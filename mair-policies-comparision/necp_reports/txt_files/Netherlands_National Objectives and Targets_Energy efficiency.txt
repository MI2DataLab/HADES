2.2 Energy-efficiency dimension i. Indicative national energy-efficiency contribution to achieving the energy-efficiency target of the European Union of at least 32.5% by 2030, including cumulative energy savings in final consumption (Art. 7 of the EED) and total floor area that must be renovated (Art. 5 of the EED) Indicative national energy-efficiency contribution to achieving the energy-efficiency targets of the European Union of at least 32.5% by 2030 The indicative national contribution of the Netherlands to the European energy-efficiency target of 32.5 % is based on the expected primary energy consumption of the Netherlands in 2030, in the event of a cost-efficient package of measures capable of achieving a 49 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 1990. In the PBL Outlook from 2018, a number of packages of measures have been analysed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 49% in 2030.47 In 2018, the PBL calculated the corresponding energy consumption for each package of measures.48 The national energy-efficiency contribution assumes the most cost-efficient package of measures.49 Measures that result in energy savings are included herein, insofar as the measures were deemed cost-efficient by the PBL. The "energy-efficiency first" principle is included as part of the cost-effective reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.                                                  46 Letter to Parliament on the Gas extraction level in Groningen in 2019-2020 33529 no. 678 47 https://www.pbl.nl/publicaties/nationale-kosten-klimaat-en-energietransitie-in-2030-update-2018 48 https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2018/04/19/het-effect-op-het-nederlandse-energieverbruik-van-maatregel- pakketten-voor-49-emissiereductie-van-broeikasgassen 49 https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/kamerstukken/2018/05/14/kamerbrief-bij-verslag-informele-energieraad-19-april-2018-en-uitkomsten-studies-naar-eu-doelen-voor-hernieuwbare-energie-en-energie-efficientie-voor-2030. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    The Netherlands has opted to make its contribution based on primary energy consumption in 2030. The Netherlands aims to achieve primary energy consumption of 1,950 petajoules by 2030 (excluding use for non-energy purposes). In terms of final energy consumption, this contribution is translated into an expected final energy consumption of 1,837 petajoules by 2030. According to the European Commission this is a reasonable contribution by the Netherlands. These contributions are based on the definitions adopted in Eurostat in the context of the 2020-2030 energy targets. As a result, the Netherlands is expected to meet the indicative national contribution to the European target. The Dutch contributions will be achieved by implementing the package of policy measures specified in the Climate Agreement (see Chapter 3.2). The KEV 2019 includes the annual prognoses of Dutch CO2 emissions and energy consumption in 2030 (see 4.3.2). As indicated this does not yet include the measures proposed in the Climate Agreement. This is why no indicative trajectory has been defined as of 2021. The next KEV (October 2020), will include an integrated prognosis and contain the policy measures specified in the Climate Agreement. An indicative trajectory will subsequently be established as of 2021. Cumulative energy savings of final consumption during the period 2021-2030 (Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU) The mandatory energy savings during the period 2021 up to and including 2030 amount to 925 petajoules. The Netherlands has determined cumulative energy savings in the 2021-2030 period based on 0.8 % savings per year of average final energy consumption in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 (the reference consumption).50 Annual energy savings, based on the estimated reference consumption, amount to 16.8 petajoules. For each year from 2021 to 2030 inclusive, the annual savings are multiplied by the relative multiplier for that year (see table below). The sum results in cumulative energy savings for the period from 2021 to 2030 inclusive. See also Appendix 3 for more details.   The mandatory energy savings for the period 2014 to 2020 inclusive amount to 482 petajoules, in accordance with the fourth National Energy-Efficiency Action Plan. Total floor area that must be renovated or the equivalent in annual energy savings (Article 5 of Directive 2012/27/EU) Article 5 of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) contains a requirement to renovate 3% of central government's building stock on an annual basis. Following renovation, the 3% of the building stock must comply with the minimum energy performance requirements established by the Member State in question in the context of Article 4 of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD). The requirement relates to buildings owned and used by central government with an area of use greater than 250 m². The directive provides the scope for achieving the same savings effect using an alternative approach. The Netherlands aims to make use of this option for the 2021-2030 period. The Netherlands aims to adopt the Sectoral Road Map of the Central Government Real Estate Agency as an alternative approach. The road map was produced in the context of the Climate Agreement and outlines the route to achieve a low CO2 real estate portfolio for central government by 2050. The desired savings in the road map are 1.3 petajoules in 2030. This is much higher than the expected savings of 0.2 petajoules if 3% of the buildings with an area of use greater than 250 m² owned and used by central government are renovated annually51. ii. The indicative milestones for 2030, 2040 and 2050, the national established measurable progress indicators and their contributions to the energy-efficiency targets of the European Union The built-up environment accounts for at least 30% of total energy consumption in the Netherlands. In order to meet the long-term energy and climate targets, it is also essential that efforts continue to make the national building stock more                                                  50 For 2018, energy consumption is based on expectations in accordance with the KEV (PBL, 2019). As soon as Eurostat has the final figures for 2018, the amount of the mandatory energy savings can be confirmed. 51  The alternative approach and expected savings effects are further substantiated in the "Energy savings resulting from renovation of central government buildings in the context of Article 5 EED" report, compiled by ECN, part of TNO.

In line with the Netherlands' broader energy and climate policy, any further efforts aimed at making the built-up environment more sustainable will primarily be driven by CO2 reductions. This means that CO2 emission ceilings are chosen as indicative milestones for increasing the sustainability of the built-up environment and that progress will be measured as Mton of CO2 emissions. Indicative milestone 2030 Based on the target of a 49% CO2 reduction and the draft Climate Agreement, the PBL examined the extent to which the Netherlands can contribute to the European Union's energy-efficiency target figures. The Netherlands' indicative contribution to the European energy-efficiency target is primary energy consumption of 1,950 petajoules in 2030 and final energy consumption of 1,837 petajoules. These contributions are not translated into sectoral target figures. However, the Climate Agreement does include an indicative allocation of CO2 targets for sectors. For the built-up environment this is 3.4 Mton of additional CO2 reduction by 2030 compared with existing and proposed policy.52 According to this indicative allocation maximum CO2 emissions in 2030 amount to 15.3 Mton for the built-up environment. This is an indicative milestone that the Netherlands aims to adopt for the built-up environment for 2030. The Netherlands aims to achieve the proposed CO2 reduction of 3.4 Mton using a wide range of measures. These measures and the underlying strategy will be described in the long-term renovation strategy to support the renovation of the national building stock. The measures are focused on reducing energy consumption and increasing the share of renewable energy in the built-up environment.  Indicative milestones for 2040 and 2050 A 95% reduction of greenhouse gases in the Netherlands by 2050 is anchored in the Climate Agreement. The Netherlands does not have an indicative allocation of CO2 targets for sectors for 2050. This is why the indicative milestone for the built-up environment for 2050 is based on a direct translation of the general 95% CO2 reduction target to the built-up environment. A 95% CO2 reduction by 2050 in the built-up environment compared with 1990 is equal to maximum emissions of 1.5 Mton CO2 equivalents. This is the indicative milestone that the Netherlands has adopted for 2050. The Netherlands has not established any CO2 reduction targets for 2040 either. Therefore, determining the indicative milestone for 2040 for the built-up environment was based on a linear reduction of greenhouse gas emissions between the indicative milestones for 2030 and 2050. Consequently, the indicative milestone amounts to maximum emissions of 8.4 Mton of CO2 equivalents. The Netherlands emphasises that this concerns indicative targets, which may be adjusted upwards or downwards in the next version of the NECP if developments (such as those related to the cost effectiveness of the energy transition or innovation) provide the rationale for doing so. Table 4 Indicative milestones and progress indicators for the built-up environment  iii. Other national objectives in areas such as energy efficiency in the transport sector Efforts are under way in association with employers and public transport companies to reduce emissions resulting from people commuting to work, including establishing specific agreements in the Environment and Planning Act and by focusing more on fully accessible travel via shared cars, public transport and by bicycle.53 Logistics represents an important cornerstone of the economy and society (Holland International Distribution Council). At the same time, logistic operations are a major source of CO2 and other emissions. Apart from the energy carriers trajectory, other approaches are also being pursued to accelerate the transition to zero emissions. These involve medium-sized zero-emission zones in 30-40 larger municipalities, zero-emission construction traffic and                                                  52  This is based on the National Energy Report 2017. 53 Letter to Parliament dated 28 June 2019 on the proposal for a Climate Agreement - Parliamentary document 32813-342 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    mobile construction machinery, climate-neutral and circular ground, road and hydraulic engineering work (GWW), logistical efficiency improvements and a Green Deal for Inland Waterway Shipping
