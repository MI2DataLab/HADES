3.2. Dimension: energy security  Planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030 as well as other objectives referred to in point 2.2, including planned measures and instruments (also of a financial nature) to promote the energy performance of buildings, in particular with regard to the following:  i. Energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative policy measures under Articles 7a and 7b and Article 20(6) of Directive 2012/27/EU and to be prepared in accordance with Annex III to this Regulation After thorough analysis, the Slovak Republic has decided to implement energy savings exclusively through policy measures, i.e. without introducing mandatory schemes. The most significant influence as regards this decision was from the projected increase in final energy prices, which would ultimately have a negative impact on the business environment, which would then have reduced the competitiveness of the economy as well as possibly increasing unemployment. For the implementation of the proposed measures it will be necessary to maximise synergies between the various measures in order to subsequently maximise the overall contribution towards meeting the energy efficiency and other energy and climate objectives. Alternative policy measures are applied to achieve energy savings in line with Art. 7 of the Directive. The most important policy measures and financial mechanisms that have contributed, and may contribute, towards the fulfilment of the objective under Art. 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU include:  The obligations on energy efficiency laid down by generally binding legislation beyond the obligations imposed by EU regulations  State Housing Development Fund  energy efficiency programmes   Operational Programme Quality of Environment, ESIF 2014-2020  Operational Programme Integrated Infrastructure, ESIF 2014-2020  Integrated Regional Operational Programme, ESIF 2014-2020  Slovseff III programme  Subsidies under the ME SR  Environment Fund  Subsidies through the Ministry of Transport and Construction of the Slovak Republic  Voluntary agreement  Future programmes involving the promotion of energy efficiency measures under the new Cohesion Policy 2021-2027  Modernisation Fund Table 33: Overview of the most important policy measures to achieve the objective of Art. 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU Measure Funding source 1.

Private sector buildings (excluding public sector buildings) The buildings sector will continue to be a very important one after 2020 in terms of the potential for achieving energy savings. New legislation adopted in accordance with the transposition of Directive 2018/844 will introduce new requirements for building renovation with an emphasis on increasing the number of buildings that have undergone comprehensive renovation, additional requirements  for technical building systems (installation of self-regulating equipment, control of heating and cooling systems, etc.) and implementation of building automation and management systems. The adoption of measures to improve the energy performance of a building is intended to reduce the overall energy demand of such building, which in turn will be covered to the greatest extent possible by energy supplied from renewable sources. A total of 64.7% of apartment buildings and 48.9% of family houses had been renovated in Slovakia, by the end of 2018 thanks to properly configured mechanisms from the State, operating in the field of thermal insulation in Slovakia for over 25 years. Measures that have the greatest impact on achieving energy savings have been carried out for a large part of these, namely the renovation and thermal insulation of the building structures (cladding, roof, the ceiling above unheated basements) and the replacement of opening structures (windows, doors). Meeting the minimum requirements for almost passive buildings during renovation after 2020 will require thorough renovation that will entail higher financial costs; and a subsequent renovation (at the end of the building elements life) of a building already renovated in the past will bring lower energy savings than in the case of the first renovation of that building. The climate changes observed over the last ten years in Slovakia and across the EU will result in greater demand for building cooling and ventilation, which will also translate into a change in energy consumption patterns in buildings. The above-mentioned measures in the buildings sector apply only to privately-owned buildings, that is to say only to non-State and non-public buildings. Measures concerning State and public buildings are described in the Public sector chapter. Improving the thermal and technical characteristics of family houses  There are over one million family houses in Slovakia. The statistical data on family houses date from 2011 and monitor the extent of thermal insulation and reconstruction of family houses, but not the technical standard of the work performed. Most homes were built in the 1960s, and so the majority are between 30 and 70 years old. The number of dwellings in family houses account for over half the total number of dwellings in Slovakia and they are privately owned. This fact is fundamental for the States approach to motivating the population to carry out the renovation of family houses. At the end of 2018, the share of renovated family houses (at different stages of renovation) in Slovakia was 48.97% of occupied dwellings in family houses, while the renovations carried out so far have been almost exclusively financed from the owners private resources, possibly in combination with loans from the building savings system or commercial banks. Renovation costs per m2 are known to be higher for family houses than for apartment buildings. In an effort to motivate family house owners, the State introduced support in the form of a State contribution towards the insulation of family houses to improve their energy efficiency in 2016. This allows the owner to cover up to 40% of incurred eligible renovation costs, subject to meeting the conditions laid down for the subsidy. In the light of practical experience, the contribution was revised upwards, the scope of activities covered by the contribution broadened, and the administrative requirements simplified to make the support mechanism more attractive to owners. The amendment to the Strategy for Residential and Non-Residential Building Fund Renovation states that, at the current rate of renovation, all occupied family houses will be renovated by 2043. It should be noted that a large proportion of family houses were previously renovated using inappropriate materials, often by the owners themselves, without expert knowledge of the technological process of thermal insulation. Repeated renovation will not only be much more costly due to the stricter minimum energy  performance requirements of buildings after 2020, but especially due to the need to improve the necessary training and incentives for owners to renovate. The construction of new family houses to the energy standard of almost passive buildings has been supported since 2018 through a State contribution towards almost passive family houses. EU funds have supported technical equipment in family houses in the form of a subsidy for the installation of RES in family houses. Family houses and apartment buildings can apply for aid in the form of a voucher for small installations using renewable energy sources through the national project of the Slovak Innovation and Energy Agency (SIEA) called Zelená domácnostiam (Green for Households). In the new programming period, it is planned to continue the Green for Households project, also in connection with the objective of increasing the share of renewable energy sources in heating and allowing the energy savings thus achieved to be set against the 35% exemption from the energy efficiency target under Art. 7. A key measure to 2030 will continue to be improvements in the thermal and technical properties of family houses, which will mainly be financed privately and through commercial banks. However, financial incentives remain an essential part of funding as the main incentive tool for continued renovations. Improving the thermal and technical characteristics of apartment buildings The renovation of apartment buildings in various forms has a long tradition in Slovakia. The proportion of renovated apartment buildings in Slovakia was over 64% of the total number at the end of 2018. The amendment to the Strategy for Residential and Non-Residential Building Fund Renovation 2017 shows that at the current renovation rate, all apartment buildings where renovation is possible will have been upgraded by 2030. Therefore, it is important to continue to support the renovation of apartment buildings in the upcoming period at least at the same rate. However, we need to take into account the fact that apartment buildings renovated more than twenty years ago will need to be renovated again in view of the gradual end of the lifetimes of the building materials and structures used, which will mean higher financial costs for thorough renovation of an apartment building to the stricter energy level of near-passive buildings after 2020. The most important financial mechanism providing motivation to renovate apartment buildings is the building renovation programmes of the State Housing Development Fund and their combination with the use of EU structural funds. Their continuation into the 2021-2030 period is also anticipated to be a key factor for meeting energy efficiency targets to 2030. Other important support programmes are Slovseff and Munseff and support for project preparation through JESSICA projects and financial tools managed by Slovak Investment Holding. Technical equipment in apartment buildings has been subsidised through EU structural funds in the form of subsidies for the installation of renewable energy sources in apartment buildings. As with family houses, the continuation of the Green for Households project is anticipated to continue in the new programming period. Improving the thermal and technical characteristics of non-residential buildings Non-residential buildings in the private sector are supported through various financial mechanisms. European funds are very important for this type of building. Renovation measures have the greatest potential for the renovation of buildings with the lowest energy efficiency. In this context, this primarily means hospitals and medical facilities. This measure could also potentially accelerate renovation for those categories of buildings that have financed their renovation exclusively from  their own resources. These are mainly shops, wholesalers, hotels and restaurants. The introduction of a suitable form of aid for this category of building will certainly be one of the decisive factors in the issue of building renovation, whether it be for owners or investors. The determination of a realistic projected value for the potential energy savings depends directly on the value of the aid.  The guaranteed energy service can also make a significant contribution towards achieving energy savings in this category, especially as it is a mechanism that, in most cases, does not depend on investment by building owners. Since these are private sector buildings, the basic rules for the use of the guaranteed energy service set out in the Energy Efficiency Act can be applied.  The new building requirements will require more funding to meet the set objectives and, in the case of repeated renovation, there will also be lower benefits in terms of energy savings. With an anticipated 20% share of energy savings from the total estimated savings from the measures implemented in the 2021-2030 period, this represents EUR 3 billion (including measures for public buildings), but this may not be the final value. 2. Industry Due to its structure, industry in Slovakia is one of the most energy-intensive of all the EU Member States. According to data from the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic for 2017, industry in Slovakia accounted for approximately 35% of final energy consumption. Between 2000 and 2015, the Slovak Republic reduced energy intensity by approximately 51%, while in the 2006-2012 period this reduction was over 27%, the largest reduction among EU countries in the given period. This achievement was a result, in particular, of implementing cost-effective measures with a sufficiently reasonable payback period to reward enterprises to pursue them solely from their own resources without public support. Given the limited potential of cost-effective measures, efforts to maximise the energy savings potential in relation to the achievement of the objective of Art. 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive will be a major challenge in particular. A prerequisite for successfully tackling this challenge will be to create an environment that will motivate enterprises to implement energy-saving measures as much as possible while minimizing the burden on public resources. The expenditure needed to reduce energy intensity in industry will be significantly higher than in the 2011-2020 period. Reducing the administrative burden and simplifying processes related to the drawing of public funds to promote energy efficiency will be at least as important in this context as ensuring the financing of such projects. It will be important to continuously raise awareness of existing and planned instruments for State support of energy efficiency in industry. The State will endeavour to contribute towards creating an environment that promotes the exchange and sharing of information between enterprises, sectors and associations with the aim of reducing energy intensity. It will be necessary to introduce systematic data collection, verification, evaluation and subsequent reporting to continuously update and configure measures to promote energy efficiency, prioritise and subsequently implement them. Slovakias ambition towards the fulfilment of the objective ensuing from Art. 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive is currently limited by the fact that the energy saving potential in Slovakia currently mapped through energy audits does not correspond to the anticipated contribution of enterprises towards meeting this objective. The potential for energy savings in industry, calculated from currently available data, in particular from energy audit summary sheets, is around 2 780 GWh, or an average of 278 GWh per year to 2030. It is assumed that this value is in fact higher, as the potential in the summary sheet is a  recommendation by the auditor and does not always include the overall potential of the enterprise. Moreover, the number of large enterprises from which this data originates does not correspond to the total number of large enterprises in Slovakia legally obliged to carry out an energy audit. Also, there are no data from enterprises with energy management systems in place, or data from small and medium-sized enterprises. On the other hand, account should be taken of the fact that part of the measures relating to the identified potential may already have been, and probably have been, implemented. These facts are an example of the importance of ensuring systematic data collection in the process of meeting the objectives, with an emphasis on their quality. However, the payback period is decisive for the implementation of the measures. Data available from energy audits show that the potential of measures with a return within 2 years, i.e. cost-effective measures, is around 28%. Given the continuing pressure to reduce costs, there is a strong assumption that this potential will decrease very rapidly and relatively significantly in the coming period, which will directly and proportionately increase the need for support from public funds for energy efficiency projects. Measures Measures to promote energy efficiency in industry for the 2021-2030 period are a combination of proven measures, activities from the Slovak energy efficiency action plans prior to 2020, and newly proposed measures and activities. The proposals for new measures reflect the SR to increase the rate of energy savings in industry, while also drawing on the experience of other countries where they proved very beneficial. Increasing energy efficiency and reducing emissions in enterprises through competition This measure is aimed at supporting the implementation of investment projects to reduce energy intensity and CO2 production. It aims to provide support for projects only to the extent necessary for their implementation, which will in turn result in significant savings of public funds. One prerequisite will be to respect the principle of the primacy of energy efficiency, according to which energy efficiency improvements must be made whenever they are more cost-effective than equivalent solutions on the supply side. This means that, in addition to projects to improve energy efficiency, bidders will also be able to submit offers related to the installation of renewable energy sources. The main criterion for evaluating bids will be the cost in EUR per MWh saved, respectively MWh produced from RES. It is anticipated that if this measure is properly configured, is consistently implemented and properly funded, it could contribute 116.3 GWh per year towards meeting the target. The total estimated annual cost of this measure is EUR 103.7 million. In view of the need to implement the measure and ensure all the activities related to its effective functioning, an increase in funds of around 5% is anticipated. The contribution of the measure towards achieving the objective will directly depend on how its financing is set up. In this context, setting up the conditions for providing support to those involved in the project will be an important element. Their simplification compared to the current conditions for granting subsidies will certainly be an important incentive for companies to engage in this form of energy saving while, on the contrary, if they are left in their existing form or made even stricter, the result will be failure to realise the potential of the measure. Support for improving energy efficiency in enterprises through an operational programme or implementation mechanism  The aim of this measure is to support the implementation of investment projects in industrial enterprises to reduce energy intensity with a payback period of over 2 years. The anticipated average annual benefit of this measure (48.2 GWh) is very ambitious given the experience to date. Achieving this contribution is conditional on reducing the administrative burden and simplifying the processes related to the provision of assistance from the relevant support mechanisms, as in the case of the Increasing energy efficiency and reducing emissions in enterprises through competition measure  this means everything from the submission of the application and its evaluation, to the publication of the results and subsequent monitoring of fulfilment. These factors are barriers with a major impact on the decision-making process of enterprises when considering applying. The total average annual investment costs are around EUR 42.9 million. Support for energy audits for SMEs This measure aims to support energy audits for small and medium-sized enterprises. Given the low projected energy savings potential of SMEs, the projected average contribution towards the target is only 2.9 GWh per year. The average total estimated annual expenditure is approximately EUR 0.6 million. In the Bratislava Region, this support is implemented through Act No 71/2013 on the provision of subsidies within the competence of the ME SR. Voluntary energy saving agreements This is the measure that contributed most towards the target under Art. 7 EED in the 2014-2020 period. In this period it has proved to be the most cost-effective instrument for meeting this objective among all the measures notified in the energy efficiency action plans. The objectives of the measure in the 2021-2030 period are to continuously increase the number of actors that will actively contribute towards the achievement of the objective, and also to involve industry or other relevant associations and societies in this scheme. Experience from Member States with years of experience in its implementation has shown that the measure as such not only contributes towards meeting energy efficiency objectives, but also brings about other positive effects, such as more effective collaboration between industry associations and societies with the State, or the sharing of ideas on energy efficiency projects between enterprises to reduce costs. The estimated annual contribution towards the objective under Art. 7 EED is 110.6 GWh at an average annual cost of about EUR 99.4 million, of which the maximum anticipated expenditure from public sources is about 1% to 2%. Voluntary agreements will gradually be applied to other sectors of the national economy, with a strong emphasis on the application of the primacy of energy efficiency principle. In the context of voluntary agreements, the application of this principle will entail an obligation  for entities using any public resources (state budget, structural funds, etc.) to co-finance their projects  to commit to contributing towards the achievement of energy efficiency objectives through accession to a voluntary agreement. The level of commitment of stakeholders in the voluntary agreement, whether this is to develop a plan for implementing energy efficiency measures, implementing cost-effective measures (but also measures with a longer payback period), taking energy efficiency into account in planning and purchasing, staff training, meeting requirements relating to reporting and achieving agreed energy savings, etc., should be one of the important parameters in assessing applications for co-financing projects. The measure will also include the creation of an information platform to provide information and news on energy efficiency in industry. The platform will also serve as a supporting tool for the exchange of experience and knowledge between enterprises.  Voluntary agreements, together with the Regional Energy Centre measure, will make a decisive contribution, in particular through data collection, towards improving energy efficiency in industry in the future. It is also anticipated that these two measures have the greatest potential to help Slovakia achieve the objective of Art. 7 EED. With the consistent implementation of voluntary agreements, as well as other measures to promote energy efficiency in industry, it is anticipated that industrys contribution towards meeting energy efficiency targets may be higher than envisaged in this plan. 3. Public sector Despite the many energy efficiency measures to improve energy efficiency undertaken in the past, the public sector still has considerable potential for energy savings. This assumption is based on the fact that recently the key barriers that prevented greater use of energy services in the public sector have been removed. New financial instruments used in the public sector should facilitate the achievement of the potential. One of these instruments is the guaranteed energy service according to Eurostat rules. With regard to the anticipated decrease in the allocation of structural funds for the SR in the future programming period, the area of guaranteed energy services has extraordinary potential throughout the SR. A key factor for the development of this sector will be the provision of non-repayable EU financial assistance to improve the energy efficiency of public buildings in combination with repayable funding. Public buildings and public lighting are key areas for public sector energy savings. Recent developments in this segment would imply the expansion of guaranteed energy services in the public sector. The 2019 Eurostat Guideline, technical assistance options for government and public authorities, training requirements for professionals, in particular for the provision of GES, public procurement and energy audits aimed at restoring public buildings and public lighting, as well as information programmes for state and public authorities, including simple conversion tools enabling rapid identification of suitable projects, have been implemented and introduced. From an analytical and energy savings monitoring point of view, it is necessary to establish comprehensive and interconnected lists of government and public buildings with information on their condition, renovation options and the possibilities of using GES or other funds, or combinations thereof, for these buildings. This information will also need to be disseminated for public lighting and green public procurement, integral parts of the public sector. Measures Provision of energy services for the public sector Reducing energy consumption will be achieved through the implementation of guaranteed energy service projects by providers of guaranteed energy services for the public sector under energy efficiency contracts with guaranteed energy savings for the public sector. Repayment of the investment is anticipated from sources the GES beneficiary would use to cover energy costs in the future. The concept for the development of guaranteed energy services in the public sector elaborated by the Slovak Ministry of Finance in cooperation with the Slovak Ministry of Economy and related legislative, conceptual and support measures for public sector entities, i.e. State and public administration, can be considered a significant incentive in this respect. Guaranteed energy services can be used primarily for the renovation of public buildings and public lighting. The evaluation of public sector buildings will show the real potential for this support scheme, as well as the possibilities  for its further development through combining different financial mechanisms to make the most efficient use of funds. The opening up of options for public sector use of guaranteed energy services has been made possible by the Eurostat methodological guidelines of 27 September 2017 and the methodological guide to these guidelines issued on 8 May 2018. Based on these, Slovakia has prepared a change to the legislative framework enabling the use of the new Eurostat rules for GES in an amendment to the Energy Efficiency Act No 4/2019 and, on its basis, has also prepared a model contract for the public sector, which has been assessed by Eurostat to ensure it meets the parameters necessary for the public sector use of guaranteed energy services without any impact on public debt. The model contract was subsequently published on the ME SR website in April 2019. The measure is not notified separately but is part of the financial mechanisms of selected measures in this document. Improving the thermal characteristics of public buildings This measure is a continuation of existing ones aimed at renovating public buildings through investment. The most important financial mechanisms that have contributed towards the growth in public building renovation are Environment Fund, Munseff and the structural funds. To ensure the continuity of energy savings through the renovation of public buildings, it is necessary to continue with existing funding possibilities but, in particular, to also set up new financial mechanisms in combination with guaranteed energy services that could adequately cover the financial requirements for the renovation of public buildings and the fulfilment of the public buildings renovation target. The current measures and funding for the renovation of public buildings and objective achievement are not sufficient. Support programmes and new sources of funding (such as GES) are essential to further enhance the renovation of public buildings. The total estimated amount of funding for public sector measures for the 2021-2030 period is EUR 1.24 billion. Modernisation of public lighting Comprehensive investment in the energy and telecommunications infrastructure of towns and municipalities is a prerequisite for supporting the development of public lighting. In addition to replacing the original luminaires with ones with lower energy consumption, intelligent control systems that ensure optimum operation of individual lights and, ultimately, optimal operation of the whole system at city or municipal level, will also significantly contribute towards energy savings. In addition, support for the development of the local energy infrastructure will significantly contribute towards increasing the number of charging stations in cities and municipalities. Therefore, it is desirable  if technically and economically feasible  to take as many aspects as possible into account in the implementation of the new local energy infrastructure, with the objective of contributing not only towards increasing safety and comfort for residents but also towards reducing energy consumption and, last but not least, reducing the operating costs of those towns and municipalities. In this context, great emphasis will need to be placed on ensuring that the newly installed intelligent systems are universal in terms of compatibility with systems and equipment from other manufacturers and brands. The estimated cost of modernizing public lighting is around EUR 600 million. It is assumed that energy savings in public lighting have the potential to contribute towards the objective of Art. 7 EED by approximately 8.1 GWh per year. The already-mentioned guaranteed energy services are an effective model for implementing measures in this area. Promotion of green public procurement  Green public procurement is a specific form of public procurement with specific requirements to ensure the subject matter of the contract, including activities related to its delivery, assembly, installation and operation, is more environmentally friendly than other products with comparable functional or performance parameters for which environmental impact is not normally taken into account. The aim is primarily to take into account aspects contributing towards the achievement of energy and climate objectives, including final and primary energy consumption, and not just the lowest possible purchase price. Based on legislative and technological changes and the development of green public procurement in the EU and in Slovakia, the National Action Plan for Green Public Procurement in the SR for 2016-2020 (NAP GPP III) was prepared and approved by the Government of the Slovak Republic on 14 December 2016 through Resolution No 590/2016. The main indicator currently monitored, which is at the same time the strategic objective set out in NAP GPP III, is to reach a share of 50% green contracts concluded by public authorities out of the total volume of contracts concluded by them for selected priority product groups. In view of the very ambitious energy efficiency targets, it will be necessary to set up a system to monitor green public procurement so that indicators that directly contribute towards Slovakias energy efficiency targets are also monitored and evaluated. At the same time, measures will need to be introduced to significantly increase the involvement of contracting authorities and other authorities in providing the data needed to evaluate green public procurement in terms of the contribution towards meeting energy and climate objectives. One of these measures is Government Resolution No 478/2019, which approved the Concept of Development and Implementation of Green Public Procurement in the Slovak Republic. To this end, it will be necessary, in particular, to introduce a system to educate contracting authorities and other authorities so they take into account the environmental aspects of the subject of the contract as early as at the tender documents creation stage through the use of the LCC approach (a cost-effectiveness approach that takes into account all successive stages of a product, building or service provision, such as research and development, industrial development, manufacturing, repair, upgrading, adjustment, maintenance, logistics, training, testing, withdrawal and disposal). Regional Energy Centre The Regional Energy Centre measure is one of the most important in terms of meeting energy efficiency objectives. Although it will primarily focus on supporting and increasing energy efficiency in State and public administration, its overall nature will be cross-sectional and will extend into the private sphere. It is in line with the forthcoming Vision and Strategy for the Development of Slovakia to 2030 which states, as one of the means to significantly reduce the energy and carbon intensity of the Slovak economy and to transform to clean and low-carbon energy, the need to build capacity for quality energy planning at the strategic planning level for regions, towns and municipalities. The main objectives of the measure are to promote energy efficiency improvements and RES development in regions, districts, self-governments and higher territorial units. Activities related to the fulfilment of this objective will be implemented through regional energy managers whose main tasks at the level of the allocated territorial unit will be: 1. Monitoring the energy-consumption condition of public and State buildings in the regions 2. Supporting the identification of energy savings potential and RES development potential  3. Supporting the design of measures to support energy efficiency improvements and RES development 4. Supporting the implementation of measures through consultation 5. Supporting the implementation of legislative requirements related to energy efficiency and RES 6. Supporting the implementation of actions plans for the development of sustainable energy of the strategic planning regions aimed at strengthening energy self-sufficiency, while respecting smart energy principles 7. Managing data in the energy efficiency monitoring system as one of the major sources of the Integrated Support Data System for decision-making based on accurate and verified data at all levels of government 8. Disseminating: energy legislation and the obligations arising from it for individual target entities 9. Administrating voluntary agreements 10. Promoting joint procurement for the purchase of energy and other goods and services in relation to reducing energy intensity. Support for increasing energy efficiency and RES development will also be implemented through this measure in large, small and medium-sized enterprises in the region, including logistics and freight transport enterprises, as well as at the level of apartment buildings located in the region. However, this support will be limited for the public sector in view of the priority provision of services. The estimated total costs for the 2021-2030 period are EUR 24 million. The achieved savings will be, for the purpose of fulfilling Art. 7, reported primarily through other notified measures to eliminate the risk of the double counting of energy savings. Support for energy audits, implementation of energy management, environmental management and EMAS systems for public administration, state administration and self-government The aim of this measure is a systematic approach towards energy management at the level of individual State and public administration entities. In addition to the potential to make a significant contribution towards the systematic collection of the data needed to comply with Art. 7 EED, a positive shift in end-user behaviour in terms of their approach to energy use is also anticipated. 4. Transport Transport has the fastest-growing energy consumption of all national economy sectors. In addition to the energy and climate objectives, the proposed measures must contribute in particular towards meeting the objectives of the Strategic Roadmap for Transport Development to 2030. These objectives include in particular:  increasing the share of public passenger transport, in particular passenger rail transport, by transferring journeys from individual passenger transport,  increasing the share of rail freight by transfer from road freight,  improving the efficiency of rail transport operations. The main measures to achieve these objectives from the perspective of energy efficiency are:  Renewal and modernisation of the vehicle park  rail transport,  Promotion of transport by bicycle,  Promotion of public passenger transport,  Promotion of energy-efficient individual transport.  The Slovak Ministry of Transport and Construction will implement the majority of these measures in particular through the Operational Programme Integrated Infrastructure (OPII), which supports the construction and reconstruction of energy-efficient infrastructure and public passenger transport through the purchase of energy-efficient public transport vehicles. The anticipated annual energy savings through these measures is 95.6 GWh. As part of the support for vehicles with low specific energy consumption and lower or zero CO2 emissions, the Slovak Ministry of Economy has prepared an Action Plan for the Development of Electromobility in the Slovak Republic based on the National Policy Framework for the Development of Alternative Fuels (Government Resolution No 504/2016). The Action Plan is a package of support measures which aims to ensure that consumers perceive low-emissions mobility as unproblematic, while accelerating the deployment of the relevant infrastructure. The measures have the character of direct support for the purchase of highly eco-friendly, low-energy and low-emission vehicles, support for infrastructure construction, as well as the character of incentive support, such as distinguishable vehicle designation, access to low-emission zones and the use of car parks for restricted groups of users. The ME SR plans to continue its support for the replacement of cars with lower-emission ones and to provide subsidies for vehicles whose operation will contribute towards meeting energy and climate goals. Funding for infrastructure development will be available, in particular, under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) which, for example, builds CNG and LNG filling stations and charging stations. As part of the promotion of non-motorised transport, strategic and conceptual projects are being implemented in support of non-motorised transport, such as the National Platform for Support of Non-motorised transport, National Cycling Strategy, a study of cycling development, etc. Already existing projects include bike sharing in Slovak cities, the Going to Work by Bicycle programme, etc. Given the lack of data enabling us to quantify the energy savings potential in transport and the problem of defining selected attributes resulting from the requirements of the Energy Union Regulation and the Energy Efficiency Directive, Slovakia is only notifying part of the measures in this document. Measures that will actually deliver energy savings through OPII but cannot be used for Art. 7 EED for the above reasons are as follows:  Support for the completion of a coherent network of higher road infrastructure (motorways and expressways included in TEN-T), 2nd class and 3rd class roads,  Modernisation of the main TEN-T railway tracks,  Removal of transport bottlenecks and critical high-accident-rate locations,  Support for the creation and deployment of integrated transport systems,  Modernisation of transport infrastructure, including intermodal freight terminals,  Increasing energy efficiency in freight transport,  Various soft measures aimed at driver behaviour to reduce energy consumption and energy intensity. The MTC SR also cooperates with regions in the preparation and approval of Regional Integrated Territorial Strategies, which are implementation documents for NFP drawing from IROP, the preparation of sustainable mobility plans, and the harmonisation and coordination of public passenger transport between suburban bus, rail and water transport, and strengthening the central role of rail.  Current measures and funding to support energy efficiency measures in transport are lagging behind the rapid pace of transport development. In order to reverse the unfavourable trend in energy consumption growth, it is necessary to set up a system for the creation and updating of measures to promote energy efficiency in transport. Such a system must be based on effective data collection supported by active communication with relevant entities as well as their active involvement in the process of preparation of measures. In the pilot phase, these activities will be provided by regional energy managers as well as project managers providing activities related to the implementation of voluntary agreements. 5. Planned appliance measures In the appliances sector, the only notified measure will be white goods replacement. In this sector, in addition to replacing white goods, the installation of energy-saving lighting and the tightening of the minimum technical requirements by the EC in the framework of ecodesign and labelling legislation are anticipated to continue. In the future, the Slovak Ministry of Economy and the SIEA plan to monitor other types of appliances in the white goods segment (i.e. not just refrigerators and freezers, but also washing machines, vacuum cleaners, dishwashers, etc.). It will also be necessary to introduce monitoring of other appliances (e.g. electrical goods) and support for the monitoring of discarded appliances for energy efficiency purposes. It is anticipated that the replacement of white goods will be associated with total costs of approx. EUR 109.5 million per year. These costs should generate annual energy savings of about 36.7 GWh. 6. Planned measures in the energy transforming, transmission and distribution (TTD) sectors The planned measures are described in the chapter Description of measures to develop measures to utilise the energy efficiency potential of gas and electricity infrastructure.  ii. Long-term renovation strategy to support the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, including policies, measures and actions to stimulate cost-effective deep renovation and policies and actions to target the worst performing segments of the national building stock, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU  The text for this chapter will be part of the Long-term Strategy for the Renewal of Residential and Non-Residential Buildings in the Slovak Republic, which will be submitted to the Commission in accordance with Art. 53 of the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union by 10 March 2020.  iii. Description of policy and measures to promote energy services in the public sector and measures to remove regulatory and non-regulatory barriers that impede the uptake of energy performance contracting and other energy efficiency service models  Since 1 December 2014, energy services have legislative support in Act No 321/2014 on energy efficiency and on amendments to certain other acts (Act No 321/2014 on Energy Efficiency). This Act introduced, in Sections 15 to 20, an entire system for the definition and support of energy services. Energy services are divided into support energy services and guaranteed energy services - energy services with guaranteed energy savings, which are further specified when they are guaranteed energy services for the public sector.  Support energy service Support energy services are specified in Section 15 and involve in particular advice, education and provision of a similar kind of service to improve energy efficiency. Guaranteed energy service (GES) On its website26 the Slovak Ministry of Economy maintains GES provider lists as well as a list of professionally qualified persons performing guaranteed energy services. The method for enrolling on the list is addressed through Decree No 99/2015 of the Slovak Ministry of Economy on providers of support and guaranteed energy services. A GES is an energy service provided under an energy efficiency contract with guaranteed energy savings, i.e. energy efficiency contracts. The providing of an energy service with guaranteed energy savings is a regulated trade. The Act also lays down the mandatory content of an energy efficiency contract if the provision of the energy service relates to the public sector. The Slovak Innovation and Energy Agency also supports and promotes public awareness of energy service development. It also provides training and retraining for professionally people qualified to provide guaranteed energy services and advises public entities on the options for implementing measures to improve energy efficiency within its competence. Energy service providers are required to send energy service data for the preceding calendar year to the energy efficiency monitoring system. A GES is a contract between a GES provider and GES beneficiary, as defined by Act No 321/2014 on Energy Efficiency. Table 34: Energy savings achieved through energy services in the Slovak Republic Energy savings achieved through energy services  2014 2015 2016 2017 [TJ] [TJ] [TJ] [TJ] Provision of energy services in the buildings sector (except public buildings) 5.67 4.22 70.61 22.23 Provision of energy services for the public sector  22.64 40.64 14.93 1.1 Prepared according to: Energy Efficiency Monitoring System, SIEA 2018  Obstacles and barriers: Barriers to the development of energy services in the Slovak Republic were identified in 2012 to 2014, such as poor awareness of GES, a low level of confidence in GES providers, and the lack of a basic regulatory framework. Some of these barriers were removed by Act No 321/2014 on Energy Efficiency, which introduced the basic system for energy service provision, established the institute of a professionally competent person for the guaranteed energy service provision and the content of the energy efficiency contract for the public sector, as well as information obligations for the Slovak Innovation and Energy Agency. The fundamental political and regulatory barriers to energy services have thus largely been removed. However, removing barriers in particular in terms of demand flexibility, regulation and the setting up of appropriate support schemes, remains a challenge. One of the key barriers to GES was the issue of private sector capital expenditure on public buildings under a GES contract which, according to the Eurostat until recently, increased public debt. Any financing secured by a GES provider was thus counted as a loan provided to the public sector,                                                  26 http://www.economy.gov.sk/energetika/energeticka-efektivnost/poskytovanie-energetickej-sluzby   thereby increasing public debt and deficits. In the context of assessing the priorities that can be financed within the limits of public sector debt, GESs have generally been put to the back of the queue. This was not limited to the SR  the same problem also applied to other EU Member States. As a result of discussions at European Commission level, to which Slovakia has also significantly contributed, Eurostats methodological guidance of 19 September 2017 was published and allowed for a system of energy service use in the public sector that does not lead to an increase in public debt. In the user manual of 8 May 2018, Eurostat, in cooperation with the European Investment Bank, subsequently detailed requirements to be met by GES contracts in order for them to be recorded outside the public finance sector, i.e. without any impact on public debt. Policies and measures The new methodology and user manual have significantly improved the conditions for the use of GES in the public sector. Based on this, a Concept of Development of Guaranteed Energy Services in the Public Administration of the Slovak Republic was created and approved by the Government of the Slovak Republic on 10 July 2018. Thereafter, a modification was prepared to the legislative framework, allowing the use of GES under Eurostat rules. The amendment to Act No 321/2014 on Energy Efficiency contains the necessary adjustments for the use of GES in the public sector in accordance with the Eurostat methodological manual and amendments to other related legislation concerning the management of State, municipality, town and local authority assets. A model contract approved by Eurostat is also available. The SIEA is preparing a project entitled Technical Assistance and Support for State and Public Administration to identify, in particular, building and public lighting renovation projects suitable for the application of GES in the public sector. A simple schematic representation of the provision of guaranteed energy services is presented in Figure 2. Figure 2 A simple schematic representation of the provision of guaranteed energy services   Key:  Dodavatelia energie Energy suppliers Dodanie energie Energy supply  Energy bill  - Prijatie opatreni v oblasti GES - Adoption of GES measures  -   - Guarantee of energy savings (reduction in energy costs) Subjekt verejne správy Public administration body  GES provider Platba za GES GES payment Úver Loan Splácenie úveru Loan repayment Investori Investors  In the area of demand flexibility, it is important to set up policies and measures that enable end consumers to buy, produce or store energy to maximise energy efficiency. To this end, it is important to involve end consumers directly through the installation of smart metering systems, and also to set up a system to motivate them sufficiently to use energy as efficiently as possible, e.g. by supporting the purchase of batteries for energy storage, respectively building central batteries in towns and municipalities. Another important motivating factor is the continuation of support for the installation of renewable energy sources and possible extension of the Green for Households project to apartment buildings and other categories of buildings. The regulatory framework will have to comply with the primacy of energy efficiency principle, according to which improvements in energy efficiency must be made whenever they are more cost-effective than equivalent solutions on the supply side. Equally important will be the effective configuration of support schemes, i.e. public and state bodies should be encouraged, as far as possible, to spend their resources economically to achieve the best possible result in particular. Given the need to increase the rate of renovation of buildings and public sector lighting, it will be desirable to enable providers of guaranteed energy services, in addition to public and State entities, to directly apply for support. Last but not least, in the next programming period it will be necessary to prevent distortions in the market for guaranteed energy services through the provision of purely non-repayable EU financial assistance to public authorities to improve energy efficiency in public buildings and to modernize public lighting. The use of non-repayable financial assistance in this area has potential, but non-repayable financial assistance needs to be combined with repayable assistance from financial instruments under the same operation. iv. Other planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030 as well as other objectives referred to in point 2.2 (for example measures to promote the exemplary role of public buildings and energy-efficient public procurement, measures to promote energy audits and energy management systems27, consumer information and training measures28, and other measures to promote energy efficiency29) Slovakia meets its energy efficiency objectives through cross-sectional measures whose nature impacts several sectors of the national economy. There are several such measures, but the most important ones are:  Continuation of Energy Auditor training courses  Promoting activities to share and exchange energy-efficiency experience with other Member States  Raising the awareness of children and young people in energy efficiency  Supporting information campaigns focusing on energy efficiency  Enlarging the energy efficiency monitoring system  Energy consulting - providing information on energy efficiency with the objective of reducing the energy share in household expenditure                                                       Analyses focused on the impact of energy efficiency on selected aspects, areas of the national economy  Introducing qualification schemes in energy efficiency and energy use  Introducing accreditation and certification systems  Other measures  Measures to be taken on an ongoing basis as a result of the progressive implementation of the priority for energy efficiency principle in national strategies, laws and policies  Measures that will be notified on an ongoing basis depending on the pace at which all conditions for their proper notification can be met, such as the methodology for calculating energy savings, a system for collecting and evaluating data, and others. These are mainly measures in transport, but also exist in other sectors  A gradual extension of voluntary agreements to other sectors outside industry Planned measures in the heating and cooling sector In close cooperation with measures to support RES development in the heating and cooling sector (Chapter 3.1.2), the following measures are also planned to improve the energy efficiency of the production and distribution of heat and cooling in district heating and cooling systems: Measure: Construction of new district heating and cooling systems and conversion of existing district heating and cooling systems to efficient district heating and cooling systems This measure will be implemented through the construction of new district heating and cooling systems meeting the conditions of efficient district heating and cooling (preferentially in locations with reduced air quality) and through the Roadmap for the transfer to efficient district heating and cooling, the approval of which will allow existing district heating and cooling systems to switch to efficient district heating and cooling. The construction of new efficient district heating and cooling systems and the approval of the Roadmap for existing systems will be preconditions for participation in one of the investment or operating aid programmes specified in Chapter 3.1.2., meaning through the installation of high-efficiency cogeneration systems using RES. If an existing district heating and cooling system has not implemented effective district heating and cooling technologies by 31 December 2025, the provisions of Article 24(2) and (3) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 will apply. Measure: Construction and modernisation of district heating distribution As in previous periods, support for the construction of new and the reconstruction of existing district heating distribution systems will continue. Reducing the energy intensity of heat distribution (for heat and cold supply purposes) is an important element in the energy efficiency improvement policy, so investment aid (EU funds, the Modernisation Fund and the Environment Fund) will be used for this purpose. Where projects for the construction of new district heating and cooling distribution systems (preferentially in locations with reduced air quality) are combined with projects for the construction of new RES heat generation facilities, possibly in conjunction with high-efficiency cogeneration, a combination of investment aid and operating aid from the programmes listed in Chapter 3.1.2. may be considered (subject to the restrictions on the cumulation of investment and operating aid). The Slovak Republic will do everything it can to ensure the individual support programmes enable such combination in real time and that they are compatible with each other. It will be necessary to allocate additional funding to implement these and other measures anticipated to fulfil the ambition for Art. 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive. Their amount will be  calculated as the product of the specific investment intensity of the measures for which there has been an additional increase in energy savings and the assumed absolute value of these additionally identified savings. v.  Where applicable, a description of policies and measures to promote the role of local renewable energy communities in contributing to the implementation of policies and measures in points i, ii, iii and iv The SR is creating local information centres on the use of energy through the SIEA. These services are generally free of charge. Strengthening capacity at the level of self-government in the field of energy and energy efficiency, increasing professional education for staff and strengthening instruments and measures at both national and local levels are also important. As part of the LIVE ENERGY) project, consultants from the Slovak Innovation and Energy Agency (SIEA) provide free energy advice to households, enterprises and the public sector on energy efficiency measures and the use of renewable energy sources in four advisory centres in -financed by the European Regional Development Fund under the Operational Programme Quality of Environment. As part of support for the least developed districts, activities for coordinated development of the energy sector and waste management were also created through the individual Action Plans in the districts. vi. Description of measures to develop measures to utilise energy efficiency potentials of gas and electricity infrastructure30 Description of measures to the utilise energy efficiency potential of gas and electricity infrastructure An assessment of the energy efficiency of the electricity and gas infrastructure is introduced in the form of an obligation for individual market participants who do business in accordance with the requirements of Act No 251/2012 on the energy sector in the field of electricity and gas, and who operate electricity or gas infrastructure.  Electricity sector In the electricity sector, the energy efficiency potential of the transmission system operator and the distribution system operators was assessed. The assessment was carried out by entities involved in the operation of the transmission system and distribution systems.  The main contributors towards increasing energy efficiency in the electricity sector include the  s. (Slovak Electric Transmission System (SEPS)) and the distribution system operators. The primary objectives of SEPS are to ensure the security and reliability of electricity supplies within the defined territory and to meet international obligations arising from ENTSOE membership. At the same time, however, it proposes and implements measures contributing towards reducing system losses and thus decreasing energy intensity. This includes building new lines and restoring older ones to ensure a decrease in transmission impedance, and a gradual phase-out of the 220 kV system and its replacement with a 400 kV system. Specific projects are listed in the Ten-Year Plan for the                                                  30 In accordance with Article 15(2) of Directive 2012/27/EU.  Development of the Transmission System for 2020-2029, which sets out investment plans over the next 10 years for the needs of electricity transmission, load management and network interoperability. The energy efficiency of electricity transmission is assessed based on annual balancing data for the transmission system. In the Slovak Republic, electricity distribution is currently provided by three regional distribution systems (eastern, central and western Slovakia) and about 150 district (local) distribution systems. The evaluation of the energy efficiency of distribution systems is carried out in accordance with the requirements of Act No 321/2014 on Energy Efficiency, and Slovak Ministry of Economy Decree No 88/2015, laying down the scope of evaluation, method of calculation and the value of energy efficiency of sources and distribution, which replaced Decree No 428/2010.  Under current Slovak legislation, distribution system operators are responsible, in terms of increasing energy efficiency, for:  calculating the energy efficiency of the distribution system and sending this to the energy efficiency monitoring system,   introducing smart metering systems in line with Decree No 358/2013,   installing HV/LV transformers in line with Commission Regulation No 548/2014, implementing Directive 2009/125/EC on ecodesign, with regard to small, medium and large power transformers,  a plan for the development of the distribution system which, under the Energy Act, must be sent each year to the Slovak Ministry of Economy by distribution system operators with over 100 000 supply points,  implementation of the Regulatory Office for Network Industries (RONI) methodological guideline No 05/12/2015 of 11 June 2015. The main measures by which distribution system operators contribute towards increasing energy efficiency:   replacement and modernisation of existing equipment, in particular the replacement of transformers  installation and deployment of smart metering in systems   reconstruction of electrical sub-stations  optimisation of the operation and number of transformers depending on the projected electricity consumption in a given system   introduction of system control and diagnostic processes  reactive power compensation and implementation of automatic compensation control  replacement of very high voltage, high voltage and low voltage cables  distribution mapping and upgrading of distribution cabinets  replacement of lights with LED lighting and installation of motion sensors for lighting  installation of remote data collection devices  improving the energy efficiency of the buildings in which these devices are located.   Of the above-mentioned measures, the replacement of transformers has the most significant impact on reducing primary energy consumption. Particularly because of the long payback period, it is clear that the rate of reduction of primary energy consumption through the replacement of transformers will be directly dependent on support for these investments from public funds. The less resources  spent on investment, the greater the need will be to increase investments into operating costs to maintain existing transformers. This will contribute towards extending their lifespan and safety but not to primary energy consumption target under Art. 3 EED. Part of the planned measures are described in more detail in Chapter 4.5.2. Gas industry As regards gas, the assessment was carried out by the transmission system operator, by the gas distribution network operators and by the gas storage operators. The necessary investments identified in the gas industry are about EUR 30 million for the entire ten-year period, to which the large investment projects of cross-border interconnections referred to in the Ten-Year Network Development Plan for Gas Transport (TYNDP) need to be added. The transmission system operator eustream, a.s. performed most of the key measures between 2005 and 2015. This was mainly optimising the operation of the transmission network and optimising the compressor technology.  The major projects contributing to reducing energy demand, the implementation of which planned for the future, include the modernisation and reconstruction of gas transportation technology:   modernisation of the compressor station control system  redesign of RENet compressor stations  further improvements to the accuracy and objectivity of measuring systems  increased operational safety  increased flexibility of the transport network associated with new cross-border interconnections that have been opened in the last three years, or are planned.  Gas distribution is provided by approximately 50 distribution network operators. An assessment of the energy intensity of gas distribution has been performed in accordance with Slovak Ministry of Economy Decree No 88/2015.  Among the most important planned measures are:  introduction of a switch-off, switch-on regime for the heating of natural gas volume flow depending on the size of distribution   replacement of gas heating boilers   optimisation of compressor performance, data and network pressure measurement and remote transmission  insulation of heat conduits and exchangers  improved energy efficiency of heating in control stations  control of gas conversion and preheat and gas heating control, control of route closure, gas pipeline tightness and additional insulation of pipelines  introduction of smart metering systems in gas distribution and supply  The potential for energy savings is very limited, primarily due to how the gas facilities are operated and maintained. The technical losses are approximately 300 GWh. Even employing maximum effort and sufficient resources to ensure energy efficiency measures, this potential can be reduced by a maximum of about 10%, which represents about 3 GWh savings per year. Gas storage operators have identified their key measures to be optimisation of tank operations, modernisation of the system for monitoring and controlling the productivity of equipment and technological units, and the possibility of using process heat in operations.  Energy efficiency criteria in network tariffs and regulation (EED Article 15) Description of planned or adopted measures to ensure the removal of those incentives in transmission and distribution tariffs that are detrimental to the overall efficiency of the generation, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity (Art. 15(4) EED). Under Section 11(1), access to the transmission system and electricity transmission (point d) and access to the distribution system and distribution of electricity (point e) are also subject to price regulation. The method of calculating the maximum price is set out in the RONI Decree.31 Description of planned or adopted measures to incentivise operators to improve efficiency in infrastructure design and operation (Article 15(4) EED). Under Section 9(1)(j) of Act No 250/2012, the Regulatory Office for Network Industries will organise a bidding procedure for a contractor for technology to increase the energy efficiency of systems or to reduce electricity consumption, and a contractor to prepare for the construction of, and construct, new power-generating facilities for which economic incentives are provided. A description of the measures planned or adopted to ensure that tariffs allow suppliers to improve consumer participation in system efficiency, including demand response (Article 15(4) EED). For individual tariff rates, the RONI Regulation on Price Regulation in Electricity favours individual electricity end-users directly connected to the transmission system. In this context, regulatory policy also needs to take sufficient account of the primacy of the energy efficiency principle within the meaning of Directive 2018/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, for example by introducing incentives that would, to the maximum extent possible, encourage energy suppliers and distributors to achieve energy savings on the part of end consumers. vii. Regional cooperation in this area, where applicable The Slovak Republic is one of the founding members of the international CESEC (Central and South Eastern Europe Energy Connectivity) association. The original aims of the group were to coordinate efforts to facilitate the swift completion of cross-border and trans-European projects to diversify gas supply to the region and to develop regional gas markets and implement harmonized EU rules to ensure optimal infrastructure functioning. At the 4th CESEC Ministerial Meeting in Bucharest in September 2017, energy ministers signed a Memorandum of Understanding extending the scope of CESEC cooperation including, among other things, energy efficiency and renewable resources. viii. Financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds, in the area at national level A list of financial mechanisms, including measures, is provided in Chapter 3.2. in Table 33. Union funds are also an important part of them, with European investment and structural funds anticipated to deliver the most important benefit. Co-financing from the funds will focus primarily on increasing energy efficiency and the use of RES in enterprises and buildings, promoting renewable energy sources, efficient district heating and cooling systems, smart energy systems and energy storage, and promoting sustainable mobility by increasing the share of alternative greener fuels in transport. At                                                  31 e.g. Decree of the Regulatory Office for Network Industries No 17/2017, providing for price regulation in the electricity sector and certain conditions for the implementation of regulated activities in the electricity sector.  national level, a significant contribution of the Modernisation Fund is envisaged in addition to the mechanisms listed in Table 33, in particular in the area of enterprise support
