The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         3.1. The decarbonisation dimension 3.1.1. GHG emissions and removals i. Policies and measures to achieve the target set under Regulation (EU) 2018/842 as referred in point 2.1.1 and policies and measures to comply with Regulation (EU) 2018/841, covering all key emitting sectors and sectors for the enhancement of removals, with an outlook to the long-term vision and goal to become a low emission economy and achieving a balance between emissions and removals in accordance with the Paris Agreement The national policies and action plans to reduce GHG emissions are a key element in the mitigation of effects of climate change on the environment, the economy and society. In order to support low-carbon green economic growth, EU has introduced ambitious climate and energy targets by 2030. The obligations of Romania as a Member State include participation in the EU-ETS emissions trading scheme. Moreover, emissions from non-ETS economic activities are regulated by Regulation (EU) 2018/842 and limited according to the values described in Chapter 2.1.1  On the other hand, Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 provides that each Member State should ensure that emissions resulting from activities related to land use, change of destination of lands and forestry do not exceed removals. Implicitly, Romania will have to maintain balance between the use of forestry resources (which ensure removals) and extension of agricultural holdings, for example, to ensure food security. The relevant policies and measures considered by Romania are described below and ordered by their interaction with other dimensions of the Plan: main vector in the trans-sectoral impact, secondary effect of measures pertaining to other dimensions and to the dimension concerned. Trans-sectoral policies and measures 1) GHG emissions and removals - main dimension  Promoting investments in new low-carbon power generation capacities The development of new electricity production capacities by 2030 is important, particularly considering that 80 % of the existing heat units are outdated26 as well as the fact that, in 2017, the energy sector generated over 66 % of the GHG emissions27 (excluding LULUCF), as accounted at national level. Romania thus plans to replace a significant capacity based on high-carbon sources28 with new gas, nuclear energy and RES efficient low-carbon plants. This will be achieved also for heating in SACET district heating systems by transit of energy through NES and the use of heat pumps at source level, also relying on the electricity market mechanisms. In this context, the carbonisation plan proposed by CE Oltenia, which involves replacing and supplementing (by 2030) 1 260 MW in coal-based plants with 1 400 MW in natural gas plants and 300 MW of renewable energy (from solar energy) is also under                                                 26 ), pages 142/233  27 The Fourth Biannual Report of Romania submitted under the UNFCCC (December 2019), page 9 28 dernisation works were performed for heat unit from the NES, however not all of them are equipped with installations for reducing greenhouse gas emissions so as to enable compliance with the EU requirements on sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide and emissions p The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         debate)29. The implementation of this plan could generate a positive impact on CO2 emissions in the production of electricity, considering that the emissions of natural gas plants are lower compared to those of coal-based heat plants30. Moreover, the refurbishment and construction of new nuclear units and the development of strategic projects by Hidroelectrica31 (modernisation, refurbishment, and completion of main current investment objectives) will also contribute to the replacement of polluting capacities.  Using the revenues from the EU ETS Mechanisms and the Structural Funds pertaining to the new Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027 for RES and energy efficiency projects at national and international level Part of the revenues pertaining to the EU-ETS Mechanism (Modernisation Fund) and of the Structural Funds pertaining to the new 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework, and those of the Just Transition mechanism will be committed to co-fund RES projects or to create financial instruments to guarantee loans used in the implementation of such projects, which will be conducive to the achievement of the 2030 target. Moreover, another part of the abovementioned revenues will be directed towards ensuring the resources required in energy efficiency projects and initiatives (example: establishing the National Energy Efficiency Fund).   Implementing the best available technologies (BAT) in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to increase energy efficiency in industrial processes The concept of best available techniques concerns the most efficient and advanced stage of development of activities and how to perform them, indicating particular techniques that may be used in order to mitigate emissions generated by these activities to the maximum extent possible (and thus these activities having a minimum impact on the environment).   Romania aims at supporting the implementation of these techniques, including through the Innovation Fund, Horizon 2020 etc. with the direct effect of reducing emissions. This measure will also contribute to the increase in energy efficiency and will also be supported by research and development activities. For example, it involves supporting the private sector, SMEs, start-ups, research institutes, and universities to access Horizon Europe projects under the research, innovation and dissemination axes in order to implement pilot demonstration BAT projects with a high level of replicability; developing as a priority and fostering the use of rail transport for passenger transport (to the detriment of road transport) and its intermodal integration in other modes of transport. This is to be achieved by: o the implementation of the EU policy in the field of transport [document COM (2011) 144 - Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area  Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system], which concerns:   % of road freight over 300 km should shift to other modes such as rail or waterborne transport by 2030, and more than 50   e a European high-speed rail network. Triple the length of the existing high-                                                 29 For more details on this project, see Section 3.3.i 30 According to the latest available data (the ANRE Annual Report, 2017), the specific CO2 emissions were 911.14 g/kWh for coal and 407.04 g/kWh for natural gas in 2017 31 (Activitatea de afaceri corporative), page 56 The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          -distance passenger transport should go   principles o Enhancing the quality of the underground transport service by:  Purchasing new performing low-consumption and regenerative braking trains  Modernising the existing infrastructure (ventilation system in stations, the wheel tracks, electrical lines and lighting in stations, automation installations etc.)   Increasing the accessibility of metro stations (passage ways, access points, escalators, elevators)    Adapting traffic schedules by correlation with passenger traffic;  Integrating above-ground and underground public transport by implementing a charging system that is compatible with the other modes of public transport. o Developing/extending the metro network in correlation with the mobility demand and the other modes of transport:  Improving access in Bucharest by public transport  Arranging park & ride places at entrances to Bucharest (at the ends of metro main routes) to take over passenger coming from neighbouring localities.  Promoting transition towards a circular economy by waste management policies and measures32:  o Identifying the administrative-territorial units which did not provide, in their sanitation contracts, for the separate collection of municipal waste in accordance with Article 17(1) of Law No 211/2011, as subsequently amended and supplemented, and informing the Ministry of the Environment thereof o Checking the implementation of the system of separate collection of municipal waste in administrative-territorial units where sanitation contracts including such obligation are in place o Using waste treatment installations built under the Integrated Waste Management System projects o Launching a public procurement procedure in order to develop information and awareness campaigns at national level on prevention, separate collection and recovery of municipal waste o Local treatment of waste throughout the county in which it was generated o Establishing centres to prepare municipal waste for reuse - at least one centre in each county/sector of Bucharest Municipality o Extending the system of separate collection of recyclable waste, biowaste, green waste o Extending sorting capacities o Building composting plants, anaerobic digestion plants for mechanical-biological treatment with bio-drying o Integrating existing waste treatment plants o Closing down all non-compliant landfills                                                 32 According to the presentation of the National Waste Management Plan and the National Programme for Prevention of Waste Production, February 2019, which is available at http://www.mmediu.ro/app/webroot/uploads/files/2019-03-14_SIPOCA%2021%20-%20Prezentare%20PNGD.pdf  The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         o Building compliant landfills in the counties where the Integrated Waste Management System projects have not been implemented yet and extending the existing landfill capacities o Improving the existing legislative framework in the field of waste management o Enhancing the institutional capacity of the institutions in charge with the management and monitoring of waste management o Monitoring and controlling the activities involving waste management o Organising citizen information and awareness campaigns on the benefits of the recycling activity o Fostering energy symbioses between SACETs and the proximity industry. Example: in Cluj-Napoca City, under a pilot demonstration project under the SPIRE axis of Horizon 2020 (circular economy) the residual heat (which is now discharged through the chimney of ovens) from a local factory (producing floor and wall tiles) will be recovered and introduced into the district heating system of the city to heat households, which results in substantial GHG savings. 2) GHG emissions and removals - secondary dimension The reduction of GHG emissions/increase of GHG removals may be ensured by adopting measures aimed at achieving the targets set for the other dimensions. These are trans-sectoral measures and are detailed under the dimensions that concern them directly. Specifically, the measures described under other dimensions, which also contribute to the reduction of emissions/increase of removals of GHG by 2030, are set out below; details about them may be found in the section of policies and measures (Chapter 3) of the respective dimension.  Decarbonisation - the renewable energy component  Promoting electromobility in road transport (light vehicles and urban public transport) Electromobility contributes to the reduction of GHG emissions, which is particularly important taking into account the fact that a significant share of GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) generated in Romania (over 14 %) come from the transport sector (over 20 % of CO2 emissions)   Promoting the use of biofuels in transport (further use of conventional fuels and introduction of advanced fuels in road transport) Similarly to electromobility, the use of biofuels has beneficial effects by reducing GHG emissions from the transport sector  Energy Efficiency:  Implementing the draft Long-term Renovation Strategy (LTRS) The reduction in consumption of energy in the residential and tertiary sector (governmental buildings, public buildings, office buildings) will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions in the same sectors.  Increasing energy efficiency in the industrial sectors regulated by EU-ETS The reduction in energy consumption in the industrial sector will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions in the sector.  Developing and promoting alternative mobility The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Reducing GHG emissions by developing and promoting alternative mobility methods (e.g. bicycles, scooters etc.) as these methods pollute significantly less than road transport (conventional fuels)  Renewing the vehicle stock Reducing GHG emissions by maintaining a stock of efficient motor vehicles (Euro 6) or electrically-propelled vehicles and by the possibility of prohibiting registration of motor vehicles with Euro 3 and Euro 4 pollution standard  Energy security:  Implementation of the Decarbonisation Plan of CE Oltenia The new solar energy capacities have a positive impact on the reduction of GHG emissions as these technologies are not operated on fossil fuels and, implicitly, do not produce GHG emissions (compared to the coal-based plants they replace). Moreover, replacement of coal-based capacities with gas capacities contributes to reduction in emissions in the transition period.  Developing high-efficiency cogeneration projects High-efficiency cogeneration is a method of production of electricity and heat which enables to reduce polluting emissions.  Research, innovation and competitiveness   Adopting advanced technologies in the energy sector As regards reduction of GHG emissions, the adoption of advanced technologies may bring its contribution through the implementation of carbon sequestration solutions and the development of energy production capacities without emissions and of new storage capacities. The implementation of pilot and demonstration projects promoting use of hydrogen in the production of electricity and in the industrial sector will also be facilitated. Other policies/measures pertaining to the dimension The main objectives of Romania to achieve the GHG reduction target are: to reduce GHG and NOx emissions, to ensure the sustainable development of the national energy sector, with protection of air, water, soil and biodiversity quality, and to combat climate change. The policies and measures thus proposed for each sector in the Romanian economy, which lead to the achievement of the abovementioned priority objectives, are listed below:  The energy sector The energy sector may contribute significantly to the decarbonisation of the Romanian economy. In this respect, the policies and measures currently proposed in this sector are:  Applying more restrictive conditions for the conduct of business by companies in the energy sector The current activities and the projects of the companies in the energy sector must comply with the environmental law and apply the best international environmental protection practices. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          Further reducing air, water and soil pollutants, as established by the law applicable to the energy sector  Co-financing projects that concern decarbonisation technologies and processes, which are funded under the new EU-ETS support mechanisms (e.g. the Innovation Fund).  Preparing regulations to overcome the obstacles to the achievement of private investments The transport sector The policies and measures required to achieve the decarbonisation targets also concern the transport sector because it has a significant share in the total emissions (over 10 % of the total GHG emissions at national level are currently generated by this sector). The decarbonisation measures of the transport sector are thus:  Restricting traffic of conventionally fuelled vehicles in city centres in order to improve air quality  Adoption of measures to restrict the access of polluting vehicles to city centres. For example, a measure is likely to be introduced from 2022 onward to prohibit access to the capital centre for non-Euro, Euro 1 and Euro 2 vehicles, whereas the restriction for Euro 3 would be applicable from 2023 onward.  Moreover, the annual fee for ownership of motor vehicles is likely to be revised upwards for non-euro, Euro 1 and Euro 2 motor vehicles or fees for electric vehicles are likely to be reduced/removed.  Promoting development of production and of the infrastructure required for penetration of alternative fuels, including LPG, CNG and LNG through measures such as33: o Developing two LNG terminals in

Without prejudice to the applicability of State aid rules, financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds, in this area at national level, where applicable For a presentation of the financing sources for the proposed policies and measures, see Chapter 5.3.i.  3.1.2. Renewable energy i. Policies and measures to achieve the national contribution to the binding 2030 Union target for renewable energy and trajectories as referred to in point (a)(2) Article 4, and, where applicable or available, the elements referred to in point 2.1.2, including sector- and technology-specific measures34 Having regard to the objectives proposed by Romania for 2030 (set out in Chapter 2) and to the current domestic background (including existing limitations), the priorities regarding the policies and measures promoting the use of renewable energy should aim at increasing the share of renewable energy in the production of electricity and in transport. The main policies and measures targeted by Romania in order to achieve the renewable energy target in 2030 will be focused on adapting the primary and secondary legislative framework by compliance with the new relevant directives and regulations. Trans-sectoral policies and measures 1) Renewable energy - main dimension Policies and measures to promote the use of renewable energy in transport (RES-T) Road transport The promotion of use of alternative fuels in road transport will generate secondary effects, in addition to contribution to the achievement of the RES-T target set for 2030, namely reduction of GHG emissions in the transport sector and increased energy efficiency (by promoting electromobility as electric vehicles involve lower energy consumption compared to conventional sources). Specifically, the measures proposed by Romania in this sector are:   Promotion of electromobility (light vehicles and urban public transport) by: o Preparing a plan for the implementation of public charging networks and fostering private infrastructure development investments through an incentive mechanism o Deploying recharging stations for electric vehicles                                                 34 When planning those measures, Member States shall take into account the end of life of existing installations and the potential for repowering. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         A first measure in the promotion of electromobility in road transport, as proposed by Romania, is the long-term deployment of the electric vehicle charging infrastructure in parking areas and maintenance and coordination centres (MCCs) on the Sibiu-Pitesti Motorway. Moreover, a need has been identified to initiate the procedures required for the conclusion of road area use contracts in order to deploy charging stations for Bucharest on Motorway A1 and on the section Bucharestdocumentation of the public procurement action is currently under development. 20 locations are proposed for deployment of charging stations, which will comply with the rules of Annex 3 to Government Decision No 87/2018. The financing sources identified for the implementation of these measures are the Environmental Fund, which is managed by AFM - financed programmes - Programme for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in transport by promoting the infrastructure for energetically non-polluting road transport vehicles: recharging stations for electrical and electrical hybrid plug-in vehicles and EU Funds: ERDF, CF under LIOP. In the programmatic period 2014-2020, actions are funded through the Connecting Europe Facility - CEF, which concern the creation of sustainable alternative fuel networks, the implementation of the alternative fuel network on the main segments of the central TEN-T network being thus initiated at national level.  Moreover, Romania will implement the requirements of Directive (EU) 2018/84435, which provides for measures to support the deployment of the recharging infrastructure, such as:  Deploying at least one recharging point and the ducting infrastructure (conduits for electric cables) for at least one in every five parking spaces for all non-residential buildings with over twenty parking spaces (to enable the installation at a later stage of additional points) by 1 January 2025  Deploying the conduits for electric cables for all new residential buildings and buildings undergoing major renovation, with more than ten parking spaces subject to the Directive requirements. o Further applying tax reductions and exemptions for the purchase and use of  For example, the Bucharest Municipality adopted in 2016 the exemption from the payment of the parking fee in public parking areas for electrical and hybrid vehicles registered in Bucharest. This specific measure may be also be adopted by other localities in Romania.  Moreover, the exemption from the payment of the ownership tax for electric vehicles will be further applied: 100 % exemption for fully electric vehicles and 50 % for hybrid vehicles.                                                 35 Directive (EU) 2018/844 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 amending Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings and Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         o Further granting governmental subsidies for the purchase of electrical and hybrid vehicles An example according to which subsidies of RON 45 000 are granted for the purchase of fully electric vehicles and RON 20 000 for the purchase of hybrid vehicles with maximum emissions of 50 g of CO2/km for persons domiciled and/or residing in Romania. o Preparing regulations to support stakeholders interested in investing in the electromobility infrastructure o Imposing an attractive tariff for new applications in the electricity area, such as electrical mobility, which reflects the current purchase cost and the system costs; it must deliver an attractive level of profitability and to guarantee economic sustainability o Introducing high and strict environmental fees to limit the purchase of used vehicles o Introducing special traffic lanes for means of public transport and electric vehicles o Preparing municipal regulations to organise restricted access parking spaces, thus securing a charging space for owners of electric vehicles who do not have their own garage o Preparing actions to promote the importance of electromobility, which are harmonised with the long-term decarbonisation objectives o Fostering investments in the development of the processing industry, RES equipment, energy efficiency and electromobility by establishing support measures including research and common standards and by developing the infrastructure required for electrical and hybrid vehicles o Extending and upgrading the urban public transport with eco-friendly means of transport such as trolleybuses, tramways, the metro and underground rail networks  Promotion of the use of biofuels (increase in the share of first and second generation biofuels) by: o Fostering investments in co-processing installations in refineries (production of regenerable and sustainable Diesel in accordance with the RED II Directive and the EN 590 standard) o Fostering investments in advanced ethanol production o Fostering investments in co-processing installations in refineries (production of regenerable and sustainable Diesel in accordance with the RED II Directive and the EN 590 standard) 2) Renewable energy - secondary dimension Long-term production of renewable energy may be secured by developing the infrastructure to increase the renewable energy production capacity, by developing feasible market mechanisms and by transforming transmission and distribution networks, taking into account modernisation and digitisation projects. These are trans-sectoral measures and are detailed under the dimensions that concern them directly. Specifically, the measures described under other dimensions, which also contribute to the achievement of the RES share by 2030 are set out below; details about them may be found in the section of policies and measures (Chapter 3) of the respective dimension.  Decarbonisation - the GHG emissions and removals component: The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          Promoting investments in new low-carbon power generation capacities  RES-E The replacement of existing capacities producing electricity from conventional resources with low-carbon capacities will also culminate with the promotion of renewable sources in the production of electricity (e.g. wind, solar resource).  The possibility of using the revenues from the EU ETS Mechanisms and the Structural Funds pertaining to the new Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027 for RES and energy efficiency projects at national and international level  global RES The revenues from the EU ETS Mechanisms and the Structural Funds pertaining to the new Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027 may be used to fund RES projects.  Priority development and fostering the use of rail transport for transportation of passengers (to the detriment of road transport) and its intermodal integration with other modes of transport  RES-T The fostering of rail transport to the detriment of road transport will contribute to the achievement of the RES-T target for 2030 due to the increased use of electricity in this mode of transport; this is particularly important considering the achievement of the RES-E target for 2030 (which entails a higher share of energy from renewable sources than the present one).  Energy Efficiency:  Implementing the draft Long-term Renovation Strategy (LTRS)  RES-E and RES-H&C; The draft LTRS involves, in addition to renovation of buildings in order to increase energy efficiency, the adoption of RES technologies, such as installation of heat solar panels, photovoltaic panels and heat pumps, which will contribute to the achievement of the RES-E and RES-H&C targets for 2030. The measures related to the increase in the use of renewable energy for heating and cooling and in the production of electricity, which are set out in the 36.  Increasing energy efficiency in the industrial sectors regulated by EU-ETS  RES-E; The development of electricity production facilities by industrial consumers will contribute, in addition to the increase in energy efficiency, to the increase in the share of renewable energy.  Energy security:  Fostering the development of energy storage capacities  RES-E                                                 36 measures to promote the use of renewable energy in the production of electricity (RES-- in RES-energy in heating and cooling (RES- The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         The development of energy storage capacities will contribute to the integration of RES in NES, considering their intermittent/variable nature. Specifically, the storage capacities will contribute to the reduction of gaps between the demand and offer of electricity.  Implementing demand response measures  RES-E The implementation of demand response measures will contribute to the integration of RES into the NES by reducing/moving consumption at peak hours (towards no-participate (as a prosumer) in the electricity market.   Implementation of the Decarbonisation Plan of CE Oltenia The development of the new solar energy capacities mentioned in the Decarbonisation Plan will contribute to the achievement of the RES-E target and will ensure diversification of energy sources. In addition, the change from coal plants into (transition fuel) gas plants will balance the system, which is necessary for the integration of RES into the NES.  Internal energy market:  Digitalisation of the Romanian energy system  RES-E The development of smart meters and networks will also contribute to greater integration of RES in the NES. The development of smart meters and networks will also contribute to greater integration of RES in the NES. The benefits of smart meters will consist in identification of the final consumption profiles of final consumers and thus increase in the predictability of electricity sales. Moreover, digitalisation will be conducive to an increase in RES through the development of smart grids because they enable bidirectional communication; for example, the energy from renewable resources could be fostered by implementing Grid-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Grid technologies (development of electromobility - RES-T).  Furthermore, digitalisation of the energy system will be essential for the safe functioning of smart meters and grids, ensuring protection against cyberattacks.  Developing a support mechanism of the Contracts for Differences (CfD) type  RES-E support to achieve the RES targets for 2030 by bringing about the security and  The RES support scheme will only be applied in the context of procurement procedures organised in order to achieve the targets which Romania is to undertake under the INECP for 2030. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          Concluding long-term power purchase agreements with clients (PPA) outside centralised markets Enabling the conclusion of long-term contracts between project developers/electricity producers and consumers. Such type of contract contributes to an increase in the use of energy from renewable resources in the light of the fact that it secures the return on investment for developers/producers of renewable energy.  Moreover, it provides the consumer with the opportunity of negotiating their contract directly with the electricity producer, at the same time being independent and secured against energy price fluctuations in cases of high demand.  Bringing the mechanisms/rules applicable to the electricity market in package  RES-E The implementation of the will result in the promotion of the use of energy from renewable resources as it entails adaptation of market conditions and removal of legislative barriers in order to facilitate integration of renewable energy in the NES.  Research, innovation and competitiveness  Adopting advanced technologies in the energy sector  RES-E, RES-T and RES-H&C; The adoption of the advanced technologies will be conducive to the achievement of the RES target through: development of solar and wind power plants, development of storage capacities and digitalisation of the energy system.  Fostering investments in the development of the RES equipment manufacturing industry and electromobility  RES-E, RES-T and RES-H&C Scientific research in the RES area and the fostering of investments in the development of these solutions will contribute to the achievement of the target proposed for 2030 in this respect. Other policies/measures pertaining to the dimension Policies and measures to promote the use of renewable energy in electricity production (RES-E) In order to promote the use of renewable energy in the production of electricity, the existing fossil fuel plants to be decommissioned will have to be replaced with other new renewable energy capacities. The development of these RES capacities will be based on a market design by implementing policies establishing a special regulatory framework and by opening up new outlooks for the prosumer. a. Additional taxation on imports of electricity from non-EU countries In order to foster the development of RES-E capacities and to ensure supply with green energy, a possibility is assessed at EU level to introduce additional taxes on the electricity imported from non-EU countries to EU Member States in order to create a barrier and not to The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         lead to price distortion and to unfair competition between the EU Member States, which have engaged in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (and which will have to substantially invest in this process), and non-EU countries which do not have the same obligations (including participation in the EU-ETS). These taxes may be used to develop RES capacities in EU Member States in order to contribute to the achievement of the proposed target by 2030.  b. Increase in the RES-development The draft Long-term Renovation Strategy (LTRS), which was initiated by the Ministry of Public Works, Development and Administration (MLPDA), includes a series of policies and measures by 2050. The draft LTRS concerns rehabilitation and renovation of public, residential and commercial buildings. This draft strategy also provides for measures to increase the use of RES energy, which is produced in-situ or in the proximity, for types of buildings covered by the LTRS: under the optimum renovation scenario (scenario 2), the amount of RES energy is estimated to reach approximately 0.22 Mtoe by 2030. This scenario provides for an investment demand of EUR 2.94 billion in the period 2021-2030 for the installation of RES solutions. In accordance with the scenario indicated in the draft LTRS, the measures set out in this document involve an increase in the consumption of energy from solar capacities on roofs by 2.5 TWh by 2030, accounting for 46.3 % of the total projected increase by 2030 for production of electricity from solar capacities. These measures are added to those set out in the draft law amending and supplementing Law No 372/2005 on the energy performance of buildings, which was initiated by MLPDA, according to which an obligation is imposed for new buildings to ensure, from 1 January 2021 onward, 30 % of the consumption of energy from renewable sources produced in-site or in the proximity. Moreover, when it will prepare the methodology for determining the regulated prices and charges for natural gas, the regulatory authority will see to it that it contains elements to support, in the most cost-effective way, the development of secure, reliable and efficient non-discriminatory systems that are consumer oriented, in line with the overall policy objectives in the field of integration of large and small scale production of gas from renewable energy sources. In accordance with the draft LTRS, it will also be necessary, in order to achieve the RES-E share, to encourage active consumers (prosumers) towards the measure involving implementation of smart metering solutions and smart networks, for which a clear calendar and adequate regulations should be put in place. The regulations should include recognition of investments in smart meters in the tariff and their recognition in the investment plans of distribution system operators or the prioritisation of these projects from the viewpoint of funding provided by the EU (including Structural Funds).  In addition, it will be necessary to use renewable energy systems in the renovation of public buildings and, where an optimal cost-benefit ratio can be achieved, systems will also be used in the renovation of residential buildings. One of the challenges is the difficulty encountered to produce and to sell the excess solar and possibly wind energy in more flexible forms by creating net metering schemes, simplifying connection procedures and introducing incentives and financial support. In this respect, Romania plans to encourage household, industrial and agricultural prosumers simultaneously with the development of the smart networks and meters. Moreover, the integration of distributed production systems and prosumers in the electricity system is also important. In the following years, photovoltaic capacities are foreseen to be developed in The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Romania in the form of average capacity solar parks established on degraded or less productive lands and in the form of small scattered capacities developed by energy consumers who can achieve transition to the prosumer. The adoption of Law No 184/2018 establishing the system for promoting production of new law provides for a series of advantages for prosumers, as follows: o the scheme is applied to prosumers owning renewable energy production units with installed capacity of not more than 27 kW per consumption place in individual households, residential blocks, residential, commercial or industrial areas etc.; o the electricity distribution operators must connect prosumers in accordance with the specific regulations issued by the regulatory authority in this respect; o prosumers have the possibility of selling electricity to suppliers with whom they have concluded electricity supply contracts at a price equalling the weighted average price recorded on the day-ahead market in the previous year; suppliers having a contract  o prosumers are exempted from the payment of excise duties for the amount of electricity produced from renewable sources for self-consumption, and the excess production sold to suppliers; o prosumers as natural persons are exempted from the obligation of purchasing green certificates annually and quarterly for the electricity produced and used for own final consumption, other than own technological consumption of power plants; o prosumers are provided with the service of regularisation between the value of electricity delivered and the value of electricity consumed in the grid by the electricity suppliers with whom they have concluded electricity supply contracts the service. The aim of these measures is to increase the amount of electricity from renewable resources, which is produced by prosumers. Furthermore, the barriers to the development of this sector (administrative barriers as a priority) must be removed; a first step in this direction is the implementation of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.  Policies and measures to promote the use of renewable energy in transport (RES-T) Romania plans to achieve its RES-T target by 2030 through the policies and measures proposed in order to foster use of rail transport (compared to road transport, considering a wider use of electricity in the rail transport) and to foster electromobility, at the same time further using traditional biofuels and introducing advanced biofuels in road transport.  a. Promoting the use of renewable energy in road transport In order to achieve the target for the RES-T share by 2030, it is first of all necessary to implement measures regarding the promotion of electromobility and the development of -addition, Romania will adopt the following:  Preparing a regulation to establish the obligations regarding the vehicle stocks of public institutions. The regulation will seek: o to establish a minimum number/rate of vehicles using alternative fuels; o to establish rules for the joint procurement of motor vehicles on alternative fuels. b. Promoting the use of renewable energy in rail transport METROREX The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         The specific measures and funding sources (national, EU funds etc.), which are required to achieve the renewable energy (RES) targets in the field of transport:  Introducing in the Specification, which is prepared for purchase of electricity for each year separately, the renewable energy sources - P % (RES-E) in the total amount of electricity to be onent from the viewpoint of the advantage for environmental protection, which represents the share of electricity from renewable energy sources (RES-E) - % in the total amount of electricity to be bid/supplied.  Other type of rail transport Moreover, one of guidelines of the EU policy in the transport sector concerns the priority development of rail transport and its intermodal integration in other modes of transport and, in order to achieve this aim, the EU policy in the transport sector [document COM(2011) 144 - Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area  Towards a competitive and   -wide multimodal TEN-by 2030, with a high quality and capacity network by 2050 and a corresponding set of   -speed; ensure that all core seaports are sufficiently c  c. Other policies and measures  In addition, strategies/plans are currently under preparation, providing for measures that will contribute to the achievement of the RES-T target by 2030. It is noteworthy that most of them do not concern biofuels and/or bioliquids, but the use of electricity from renewable sources in transport. Table 19 - List of strategies and/or plans under preparation Name  Reference document Enhancing the efficiency of electricity distribution management The 2019-2023 Rail Infrastructure Development Strategy  Study on the introduction of electricity systems capable of returning the electricity generated by regenerative braking General Transport Master Plan Electrification and modernisation of the Bucharest-Giurgiu Railway The 2019-2023 Rail Infrastructure Development Strategy General Transport Master Plan Electrification and modernisation of the Craiova-Calafat Railway The 2019-2023 Rail Infrastructure Development Strategy General Transport Master Plan Electrification and modernisation of the Constanta-Mangalia Railway The 2019-2023 Rail Infrastructure Development Strategy General Transport Master Plan Electrification and modernisation of the Cluj-Oradea Railway The 2019-2023 Rail Infrastructure Development Strategy General Transport Master Plan Source: Information submitted by the INECP Interinstitutional Working Group The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Policies and measures to promote the use of renewable energy in heating and cooling (RES-H&C) Law No 372/2005 on the energy performance of buildings, as republished, includes the obligation for new buildings in the property/administration of the public administration authorities, which are to be subjected to the acceptance procedure under the construction permit issued after 31 December 2020, to be nearly zero-energy buildings. In the draft law amending and supplementing Law No 372/2005 on the energy performance of buildings, which was initiated by MLPDA and which is purposed to transpose Directive (EU) -consumption of primary energy from RES has been increased from 10 % to 30 %. Moreover, a growing number of households, in particular new residences, will adopt efficient biomass heating installations with full combustion and zero pollutants. This transition towards more efficient and greener biomass forms of heating will be experienced intensively over the following years as well as after 2030. Predominantly electricity-based heating in Romania will also contribute to the achievement of the RES-H&C target for 2030. In this respect, the highest potential is encountered in individual households in the semi-urban and rural area, where the investment in high-efficiency air-soil heat pumps can be justified economically. Accompanied by heat accumulators, heating through heat pumps could be feasible by using the electricity produced in the night standstill period, which is also a form of storage of electricity. The further long-development of a national heat pump market and could provide for the heat demand by the use of heat solar panels. The draft Long-term Renovation Strategy (LTRS), which was initiated by the Ministry of Public Works, Development and Administration (MLPDA), also includes a series of policies and measures to increase the use of renewable energy in heating and cooling by 2050. According to this draft, renovation packages will include RES technologies such as installation of solar panels, photovoltaic panels and heat pumps. Their elaboration and impact will be included in an updated version of INECP as MLPDA confirms the choice of scenario 2 as the optimal scenario. The INECP will need to be updated depending on the final version of the LTRS and the solution adopted by MLPDA. MLPDA has currently proposed scenario 2 for approval and the draft Government Decision approving the National Strategy for Renovation of Buildings has been under public debate since 20 January 2020. ii. Where relevant, specific measures for regional cooperation, as well as, as an option, the estimated excess production of energy from renewable sources which could be transferred to other Member States in order to achieve the national contribution and trajectories referred to in point 2.1.2 Statistical renewable energy transfers  The statistical transfer mechanism provides for the excess RES produced in an EU Member State to be transferred to other Member States. This mechanism enables more flexibility, in view of achieving the shares established at Member State level, by providing them with an instrument to develop the RES potential in a mutually advantageous manner. In this way, countries with high RES potential may support other Member States in achieving their individual targets. This method of cooperation among Member States was introduced with the adoption of Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and the continuation legislative package. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         In this context, the instruments provided by this cooperation mechanism (statistical transfer or co-financing of RES production projects by two or more Member States) may constitute an opportunity to increase the installed RES capacity in Romania provided that the respective static transfer is not achieved to the detriment of the achievement of the national RES targets and with a negative impact on the operation of the NES under conditions of safety. iii. Specific measures on financial support, where applicable, including Union support and the use of Union funds, for the promotion of the production and use of energy from renewable sources in electricity, heating and cooling, and transport See Chapter 5.3.i.  iv. Specific measures to introduce one or more contact points, streamline administrative procedures, provide information and training, and facilitate the uptake of power purchase agreements The adaptation of the legislative framework will be a priority and will envisage administrative aspects (regarding simplification of permit procurement procedures and, implicitly, of their release period) and aspects related to the operation of the electricity market in the sense of facilitating integration of renewable energy sources.  The regulatory framework providing for transparency in connection to the power plant grids is mainly established by Order No 72 of ANRE of 2 August 2017 approving the Technical rule regarding the technical requirements for connection of synchronous generator units to the electricity grids of public interest. This Order lays down the minimum technical requirements for connection of synchronous generator groups to electricity grids of public interest. Moreover, Romania sets forth measures to cut red tape through enhanced transparency, - In addition, Romania must adopt Directive (EU) 2018/2001 regarding the procedure of connection to the grid for large power pla v. Assessment of the necessity to build new infrastructure for district heating and cooling produced from renewable sources No clear set of policies and measures are in place for these elements on the date of preparation of this document. vi. Where applicable, specific measures on the promotion of the use of energy from biomass, especially for new biomass mobilisation taking into account:  sustainable biomass availability, both domestic potential and imports from third countries   other biomass uses by other sectors (agriculture and forest-based sectors); as well as measures for the sustainability of biomass production and use To encourage production of electricity from renewable resources, Order No 46 of 5 March 2012 of the Minister for Agriculture and Rural development established, from 2012 onward, the procedure for the release of the certificate of origin for the biomass sourced in agriculture and related industries, which is used as fuel or feedstock for production of electricity. For the purposes of this procedure, the biomass sourced in agriculture and related industries, which is used as fuel or feedstock for the production of electricity, means the biodegradable fraction obtained from: The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         a) agricultural and non-agricultural energy plant crops destined for biomass production, which is used to produce electricity, as per the list in Annex 1 to Order No 46 of 5 March 2012 of the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development; b) waste from agriculture, horticulture, aquaculture, fishing and from food preparation and processing, as per the list in Annex 2 to Order No 46 of 5 March 2012 of the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development  Certificates of origin for the biomass sourced in agriculture and related industries, which is used as fuel or feedstock for production of electricity, as provided for in Article 3(9) of Law No 220/2008, are issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development through the county and Bucharest agricultural directorates. c) Moreover, the procedure for the release of certificates of origin for the biomass sourced in forestry and related industries, which is used in the production of electricity from renewable energy sources (as approved by Ministerial Order No 1534/2016), was introduced in 2016. For the purposes of this procedure, the biomass sourced in forestry and related industries, for which certificates of origin are released, means:   I. the biodegradable fraction of products resulting from the primary and secondary processing within Romania of wood - bark, sawdust, chips from processing, edges, chips from profiling lines, wood residues from the processing or recycling of wood and/or wood products, including from import, which are not classified as wood in accordance with the legal rules in force, and wood downgraded on own premises following the technological processing of wood II. wood chips only from the categories listed under point (a).  In addition, the forestry legislation in force currently provides for the sustainable management of forests and one of the main criteria of forest management plans is precisely to ensure uninterrupted wood production.
