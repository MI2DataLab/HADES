Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness i. National objectives and funding targets for public and, where available, private research and innovation relating to the Energy Union, including, where appropriate, a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met The current national development documents in Estonia have not set independent research and development targets related to the energy sector. Research and development activities relating to the energy sector contribute to the achievement of the overall national research and development targets. The Estonian research and development and innovation strategy 2014--on reaching the following targets once funding is obtained for research and development activities:  The level of investment in research and development must be at least 3% of GDP; and  Private sector research and development costs must be 2% of GDP. On 19 December 2018, scientists, politicians and business organisations concluded a social contract, the Estonian research agreement, under the auspices of the President. The signatories undertook to increase public sector funding for research and development and innovation to 1% of GDP and thereafter maintain it at least the same level72. Research and development and innovation for increasing competitiveness are governed by the following current sectoral development plans:  Estonian Rural Development Plan 2014-2020    National Waste Plan 2014-2020  Estonian Forestry Development Plan 2020  Transport Development Plan 2014-2020 An agriculture and fishery sector development plan until 2030, a forestry development plan for the period 2021-2030 and an infrastructure and mobility development plan for the period 2021-2030 are being drafted. The overall objective of the NDPES 2030 is to ensure, among other things, the growth in the competitiveness of the economy: to ensure that customers have an energy supply with market--term energy and climate policy targets and at the same time contributes to the improvement of Estonicompetitiveness in the long term. To facilitate performance of the NDPES 2030, a                                                            72 Estonian research agreement https://novaator.err.ee/886104/eesti-teadusleppe-taistekst  research and development (RD) program has been developed which among other things includes RD activities in the area of energy technologies. strategy 2019--related research and development would be funded in each of the four subsequent years to a total of EUR 1.6 million, i.e. EUR 400 000 a year. The NDPES RD programme lays out the barometers and timeframe for facilitating performance of the NDPES 2030 targets until 2023. The NDPES RD program focuses on the development of the environment for the dissemination of energy-related information (www.energiatalgud.ee) and its provision to customers, participation in international cooperation in the area of energy technology and in energy-related projects, the integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid and security of supply, the introduction of biofuels and the adoption of electric vehicles, the availability of bioenergy resources in the future, the development of a long-term strategy for the renovation of buildings (this will be completed in March 2020), as well as the more efficient use of oil shale. The Development plan for Estonian research, development, innovation and entrepreneurship 2021-2035 is currently being drafted. The implementation of the results of research and development in the interests of Estonian society and its economy has been modest to date. Cooperation between universities and companies is low, e.g. Estonia clearly lags behind EU innovation leaders in the number of publications jointly authored by businesses and research institutions. Neither current research and development policy nor enterprise policy have been able to make the economy significantly more knowledge intensive. The achievement of the targets of the climate policy will bring pressure to bear on Estonian entrepreneurs to make manufacturing models more environmentally friendly and to reduce manufacturing emissions. As a result of population decline, the number of graduates in the education system will decrease in the near future, and even if companies were to make a large-scale transition to automated manufacturing, the labour shortage will increase73. Hence it is not possible to take into consideration the funding and other targets (incl. in connection with the private sector) of the research and innovation of the new decade in setting the energy and climate targets until 2030. The transition to a climate-neutral economy will require the coordinated activity of various ministries and research institutions in planning research and innovation and making the related investments. In connection with the fulfilling of the targets and measures of the NECP 2030, a more detailed financing plan and schedule for the required research will be developed during the compilation and review of the sectoral development plans.  ii. Where available, national 2050 objectives related to the promotion of clean energy technologies and, where appropriate, national objectives, including long-term targets (2050) for deployment of low-carbon technologies, including for decarbonising energy and carbon-intensive industrial sectors and, where applicable, for related carbon transport and storage infrastructure. The long-term vision for Estonian climate policy and sectoral and cross-cutting policies                                                            73 Drafting proposal https://www.valitsus.ee/sites/default/files/content-editors/arengukavad/taies_koostamise_ettepanek_09.09.2019.pdf to set a clear path towards alleviating climate change were agreed upon at national level in the development docum74. Estonia will have a competitive low-carbon economy by 2050. This will ensure that the country is ready and able to minimise the negative consequences of climate change and make optimal use of the positive effects. In accordance with the first policy document covering the entire economy, Estonia will be transformed into an environment that will primarily be attractive for the development of innovative technologies, products and services that reduce GHG emissions. The export of these technologies, products and services and their global implementation in solving global problems connected with climate change will also be promoted. The introduction of low-carbon emission technologies and the efficient use of resources in industrial processes will be promoted. Legislation will be used to motivate industry to employ predominantly low-carbon fuels and production inputs. In seeking to limit the GHG emissions of energy and industry, preference will be given to directions in research, development and innovation that promote the development of efficient energy technologies, valorise domestic renewable energy resources, increase primary energy savings and reduce GHG emissions. Estonia joined the Hydrogen Initiative75 at the informal meeting of EU energy ministers in Linz, Austria on 17 and 18 September 2018. The public meeting of the ministers of energy in Brussels on 19 December 2018 discussed follow-up measures connected with the Hydrogen Initiative76, and the Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure delivered a speech. The use of hydrogen in different sectors of the economy offers the most efficient possibility for moving towards a low-carbon economy. start-up and scale-up companies whose activities are directed towards developing and bringing to market new products, services and technologies for reducing or capturing greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of the investment programme is to bring additional private equity to the field of green technology via investments with state equity capital.  iii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to competitiveness In accordance with the overall objective of the NDPES 2030, the plan aims, among other things, to ensure that the energy sector contributes to increasing competitiveness. Its performance will be assessed using the barometers for assessing the performance of the overall target described in the following table. Table 19. National objectives with regard to competitiveness NDPES 2030 target: To ensure for consumers an energy supply with a market-based price and availability that meets the EU long-term energy and climate policy targets and at the same time contributes to the improvement of the Estonian economic climate and environmental status and to increasing competitiveness in the long term.
