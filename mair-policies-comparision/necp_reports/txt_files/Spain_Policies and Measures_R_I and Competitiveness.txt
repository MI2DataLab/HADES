3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 190 3.5 RESEARCH, INNOVATION AND COMPETITIVENESS DIMENSION The future 2021-2028 Spanish Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy will incorporate a Strategic Action on Energy and Climate Change, as well as including this in its development plans, and assign an amount of funding for Research, Innovation and Competitiveness (RIC) in energy and climate. This point signifies a change with regard to the current structure of state planning of Research, Development and Innovation (RDI), as the calls for funding are evaluated and determined strictly based on criteria of excellence, without defining the levels of funding   3.5.1 Policies and measures to achieve the national objectives  innovation, and given the non-specific nature of the current RDI planning, the instruments of those financing the Spanish system of science and technology can be used for actions on energy and climate. It is considered necessary to carry out a continuous and dynamic strategic analysis, to establish the priorities in research and innovation in our country. This is a long-term reflection, given the volume of new technologies needed to carry out the energy transition and the high maturation time required for RDI.  Measure 5. 1. 1. Strategic action on energy and climate a) Description The legislation governing the Spanish Research, Development and Innovation system provides for the creation of frameworks and instruments to promote horizontal and strategic sectors or technologies as a matter of priority under the umbrella of a Strategic RDI Action. Through these actions, coverage is provided for the most decisive and relevant commitments in terms of RDI. The Strategic Action on Energy and Climate Change has the objectives of promoting RIC for the energy transition and of accelerating the full decarbonisation of the economy by 2050, the implementation of a model of sustainable development and resilience to climate change that provides the economic and regulatory signals that give stability and security to investors and other economic players. In particular, a sustainable energy model that encourages the use of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, the development of clean combustion technologies or emerging technologies, progress in the areas of sustainable mobility and the modal shift in transport, promotion of sustainable building and mitigation of non-energy emissions, promotion of efficiency and sustainability in the storage of raw materials for new technologies, as well as climate observation and adaptation to climate change. This action includes integral management of all the necessary programmes. To ensure coordination of the activities and the achievement of the established objectives, this commitment will define specific objectives, and will establish a budgetary commitment applicable throughout the period of the future Strategy on Science, Technology and Innovation and the Plans that implement it.  b) Objectives  To provide the necessary flexibility to facilitate international collaboration and the implementation of the SET Plan lines.  To prevent duplication and ensure continuity of the priority lines of research and the communication of results to the public administrations.

POLICIES AND MEASURES 194 Measure 5.5. Public procurement in green innovation  a) Description The public procurement of innovative technology consists of purchasing goods or services that do not exist at the time of acquisition, but that can be developed within a reasonable time period. This purchase requires the development of new or improved technology in order to meet the requirements of the acquirer. Pre-commercial public procurement is a procurement of research and development services (R&D), fully paid for by the procuring entity, in which the public purchaser does not keep the results of the R&D for its own exclusive use, but shares with the companies the risks and benefits of the R&D needed to develop innovative solutions that go beyond what is available on the market. The public procurement of innovation is set out in Article 44(3) of Law 14/2011 of 1 June 2011 on Science, Technology and Innovation. Moreover, Law 9/2017 of 8 November 2017 on Public Sector Contracts created two new procedures intended to promote the public procurement of innovation: the  This measure is aligned with the strategies for smart specialisation to improve knowledge exchange between political agents and interested parties, above all supporting the participation of SMEs.  b) Objectives addressed  To develop the capacity of the administration to act as a driver of business innovation, managing its demand for products and services.  To promote innovation from the demand side, i.e. strengthening innovative companies by incentivising the private sector to make proposals with greater added value to provide solutions for strategic government projects.  To promote public-private collaboration.  To improve public services.  c) Mechanisms The public aid that forms part of the State Programme for RDI aimed at the social challenges of the 2017-2020 State Plan on Scientific, Technical and Innovation Research, is strengthened through other measures for promoting innovation, based on innovative public procurement instruments. Through the Horizon 2020 programme, the European Commission will subsidise the preparation and realisation of joint cross-border public procurement of innovative technology and pre-commercial public procurement. Specifically, this refers to aid for the development of innovative products or services in the area of energy and climate acquired by public purchasers through the Innovative Public Procurement mechanism. There are several types of financial support for which public buyers in Spain can apply: the INNODEMANDA and INNOCOMPRA programmes. Innovative public procurement can also reinforce Measures 1.16 and 2.12 on public procurement in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency, respectively.  d) Responsible bodies CDTI, the MCI; and the relevant public administrations.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 195 Measure 5.6.

New instruments to support research and innovation in energy and climate  a) Description Under the umbrella of the Strategic Action for Energy and Climate, it is proposed to develop new instruments to promote research and technological innovation. The legislation on the energy sector, and in particular the electricity sector, has to evolve in order to facilitate the energy transition. These developments should facilitate the increasing expected contribution from distributed energy resources and the emergence of new players, such as active customers, for which digitalisation technologies are expected to play a key role. One tool that has been developed in countries around us to test innovative product, service and business model concepts before translating them into the legislative framework has been to create regulatory demonstration projects, where, in a controlled space and under the supervision of the corresponding supervisory authority, hypotheses are verified and their impact evaluated, so that the legislation developed can be based on the lessons learned. In the framework of these regulatory demonstration projects, it is possible to temporarily suspend certain existing rules to be able to assess the potential for innovative solutions, without restrictions. In this respect, Article 21 of the draft CNMC circular establishing the methodologies regulating the a proposal on regulatory demonstration projects that is fully aligned with this measure.  3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 196 Another added advantage of this type of project is its capacity to retain and attract talent in the field of innovation (business, university, etc.) at national level, in the ecosystem formed to develop testing. On the other hand, in the context of new energy and climate priorities and actions, industrial policy will be affected by new profiles of demand for raw materials that will change significantly, and it must be ensured that innovations in the field of advanced technologies are not hampered by the unavailability or volatility of mineral raw materials on the market.  b) Objectives addressed  To develop new instruments appropriate to the particular needs of the technological development for energy transition and the fight against climate change.  To promote the development and financing of projects to foster RDI activities in the management of natural resources, raw materials and adaptation to climate change.  c) Mechanisms The new mechanisms and instruments considered include: o Technology demonstrators: to facilitate the incorporation of innovative technologies and test their manageability in a real environment, making use of the tendering mechanisms established in this Plan. Specific procedures for administrative authorisation will also be developed in accordance with Measure 1.18 of this Plan. o Regulatory demonstration projects (sandbox): The appropriate regulatory framework will be developed that will include, inter alia, the participation rules (including the general requirements for access and the general framework of testing protocols to be concluded between the promoter and the competent authority), the system of guarantees and protection for participants, and the exit and post-project effects rules. o Micro-Missions: Research and development projects aimed at overcoming specific technical and economic limitations of new energy technologies and solutions for climate change. o Blockchain and climate change. In four areas: ensuring the traceability of products in supply chains that are currently complex and opaque; automating and strengthening the monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of the environmental impact of projects; environmental impact of cryptocurrencies and the creation (or participation if any exist) of a coalition between companies, start-ups, research centres and agencies that are working at the intersection between blockchain and climate change. o Raw materials: Research projects aimed at updating the information on raw material reserves in Spain and their future demand according to technological needs. d) Responsible bodies CDTI, AEI, MCI, REE, MITECO, Biodiversity Foundation (Fundaci√≥n Biodiversidad), Geological and Mining Institute of Spain (Instituto Geol√≥gico y Minero de Espa√±a  IGME).  Measure 5.8. Social innovation for the climate a) Description Climate change is generating new and unpredictable social, environmental and economic scenarios. Citizen science and social innovation, placed at the service of the new challenges, generate opportunities for constant improvement. Indeed, social innovation is key to fulfilling the Agenda 2030 and addressing challenges such as the energy transition and the climate crisis. In this respect, collaborative consumption, product durability and the prevention of programmed obsolescence, together with intelligent management of technological innovation, offer possible paths in this direction.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 197 b) Objectives addressed  To support the realisation of social and urban innovation projects, understood as the development, implementation and/or validation of innovative methodologies or technologies aimed at solving climate problems.  To promote information, dissemination, awareness and sensitisation actions aimed at the acquisition of habits and attitudes in line with efficiency, sustainability, co-responsibility and cooperation.
