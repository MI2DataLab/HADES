95  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00  Status quo energy policy provides that energy efficiency is one of the main policy instruments allowing costs to be reduced and the level of energy supply security increased by reducing energy consumption. Latvian legislation includes requirements for ensuring the rational use and management of energy sources to foster sustainable economic development. Although Latvia has committed to reach the mandatory cumulative final energy consumption target, by 2018 Latvia had fulfilled 54% of its annual target. In Latvia, the EEOS scheme has been introduced in stages or periods, namely 2014-2017 and 2018-2020, the obligation to cooperate with its end customers in the field of energy efficiency having been imposed only on electricity retailers. According to the electricity sales data of 2018, the scheme includes as responsible parties 14 electricity retailers, which fulfil their energy saving obligation mainly by informative and educational measures, as well as measures for improving energy efficient lighting. By the end of 2017, Latvia had concluded only two voluntary agreements, because even though regulations allow the competent Ministry to provide support to energy audits and individual energy efficiency improvement measures in accordance with individual agreements, no funding was ear marked for these. As things stand, large enterprises and large electricity consumers should introduce a certified energy management system or conduct an energy audit on a regular basis, as well as the three energy efficiency improvement measures recommended in the energy audit report with the highest energy saving or economic return. The higher energy savings in enterprises have been achieved as a result of equipment replacement and more efficient use of transport and up until 2020 enterprises will have had access to support programmes for the implementation of energy efficiency measures in manufacturing enterprises. At present, municipalities and public institutions have the right to use ESCO (PESCO) and to conclude energy efficiency service contracts164, however, the investments made within the scope of the contract are considered a public debt with an impact on the fiscal area, although the basic principle of the ESCO (PESCO) model does not create additional budgetary expenses for the municipality, because private investments are repaid from the energy savings achieved. However, if an institutional unit in the general government sector concludes an energy efficiency contract without observing the statistical accounting conditions of the European System of Accounts (hereinafter referred to as ESA), then such a contract has an impact on the general government budget balance, where a private eneral government budget expenses and the general government sector debt. Target status quo by 2030:                                                       164 in accordance with the annual state budget law municipalities do not have the right to assume long-term liabilities in accordance with Section 22 of the Law on Municipal Budgets, with the exception of the liabilities: 1) to ensure the autonomous function of municipalities for up to five years for purchasing of necessary services, computer equipment, communication and other office equipment; 2) to ensure long-term social care and social rehabilitation services; 3) for the implementation of investment projects referred to in the law on the annual state budget; 4) for the implementation of public and private partnership projects accepted in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Public-Private Partnership Law. 4.1. Energy efficiency 96  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00  incorporated into development and policy planning, and into the investment planning and implementation process  Achievement of the energy efficiency targets set by the State   Undertakings not only ensure they are energy efficient, but also help promote the energy efficiency of their customers   Society has become increasingly more aware of energy efficiency issues and there has been an increased in involvement and the desire to ensure energy efficiency in own lives and the day-to-day life of the community Benefits to society and economy  rational use and management of energy sources  increase in competitiveness of the economy  reduced costs of energy, with saving being invested in development and improvement of comfort  minimisation of impact on the environment and climate change   Main challenges 1) inadequate consideration of the need to improve energy efficiency in policy and investment planning and implementation incorporated into the Latvian policy planning system, and only arbitrarily taken into account in investment planning. Sectoral development  takes place when needed by sectors,  so more efficient alternatives are often ruled out . Given that the potential for energy efficiency and its alternatives are not evaluated when planning and implementing measures and no assessment is made of whether the measure inter alia also ensures the improvement of energy efficiency, such measures are frequently not implemented using the best available and possible techniques and technologies. 2) inefficient implementation of EEOS and agreement on improvement of energy efficiency EEOS is one of policy measures which energy retailers can use to get involved in the resolution of energy efficiency matters. To discharge their obligation under the EEOS responsible parties should take measures to improve energy efficiency and achieve energy savings in buildings, equipment and the transportation of end consumers, and measures of the requisite scope should be taken in respect of consumers affected by energy poverty . Presently EEOS applies only to 14 electricity retailers, although it should apply to the largest energy suppliers without the type of energy supplied being specified. As the EEOS stands, it covers an insignificant number of energy suppliers, so the mandatory obligation to implement energy efficiency improvement measures in their activities and in the activities of their customers applies to a small number of undertakings only. Agreements on improving energy efficiency are currently concluded on a voluntary basis, so only two such agreements have been concluded as a result of the concluding parties being actively committed to improving the situation in respect of energy efficiency. The number of concluded agreements is small, because this is voluntary and because those who conclude 97  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 the agreement do not see or have access to any additional benefits to offset the resources invested.  3) incomplete energy efficiency monitoring system As things stand, the energy efficiency monitoring system in place is too unwieldy, and the performer of energy efficiency improvement measures has more expenses and complications from reporting than benefits from the measures themselves. The preparation and submission of reports on paper without using online reporting tools complicates preparation and submission of reports, in particular for private individuals. Nor is it mandatory (or even desirable) for all those carrying out measures to report on the energy efficiency improvement measures , this also being true of those carrying out measures without using public funding or funding provided by the EU structural funds.  Main action line (horizontal action line) Efficient and comprehensive compliance and implementation of energy efficiency improvement in national economy sectors and society Key actions and activities 1) Comprehensive introduction and implementation of  (measure H.1) ing, before approving industry planning, policy and investment decisions, whether cost-efficient, technically, economically and environmentally sound alternative energy efficiency measures, for example, cost-effective end-use energy savings, demand response initiatives and more efficient conversion, transmission and distribution of energy, whilst achieving the objectives of those decisions, will ensure the achievement of the objectives of those decisions. It is also recommended that  be incorporated into the conditions for the acquisition of funding of EU and public funds (in the measures funded within the scope of EU structural funds and other sources of public funding) and taxation measures, if applicable. Therefore, ensuring improvement of energy efficiency  efficiency of use of energy sources, reduction of use of resources  should be considered when implementing these measures. 2) Review of EEOS and strengthening and extension of agreements on improving energy efficiency (measures H.2, H.3) In order to make the EEOS more efficient and ensure that under it stakeholders implement efficient energy efficiency improvement measures within their enterprise or with their customers, the proposal is to review EEOS after 2021 evaluating the possibility of extending the scope of the EEOS to include as EEOS stakeholders traders (including motor and heating fuel traders) whose sales account for a total of 90 % of energy sold to consumers in Latvia, including thermal energy suppliers and suppliers of motor and heating fuel  transport energy and natural gas. Doing so would include some 27 energy suppliers, 14 of which are transport energy suppliers, 3 are thermal energy suppliers, 3 are natural gas suppliers and 7 are electricity suppliers.  Practices in several European countries have confirmed that voluntary agreements are an efficient way of promoting energy efficiency and obtaining energy savings, however, the 98  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 countries provided support to enterprises or municipalities in all successful cases. Latvia has offered to act in three action lines with regard to the reinforcement of the agreement for the period after 2021:  the proposal is to maintain the option of concluding voluntary agreement for everyone, but making agreements mandatory for specific urban areas and specific administrative territories (for example, energy intensive territories);  the proposal is to extend the scope to include measures promoting the use of RES;  the proposal is to make a funding programme available offering support and funding to undertakings or municipalities which have concluded agreements, support being provided for performance of measures, actions of an energy consultant and measures for promotion of energy services. 3) attraction of private investments and elimination of obstacles, creation of financial mechanisms (measures H.3, H.8, H.9) A/S     (hereinafter referred to as ALTUM) will continue to develop financial instruments for financing of energy efficiency projects, including loan programmes for energy efficiency of the company and for introduction of RES projects. In order to ensure the creation and spending of targeted funding, the plan proposes creating an RES promotion and energy efficiency improvement fund, where finances from income derived from energy related activities  excise duty and NRT  might be diverted, which apply to the heating and motor fuel used for the acquisition of energy, income derived from forest land auctions and the rent of State immovable properties for construction of wind parks and the commercial exchange of State RES statistics with other countries, funds also being used for RE communities and financing RES measures in municipalities. Also, in order to promote the attractiveness of implementation of the energy efficiency improvement measures, the plan also proposes assessing the feasibility of developing energy savings trading schemes, where one participant of the system could transfer its energy savings to another participant who which has exceeded its savings targets. 4) To improve energy efficiency monitoring and make it more efficient (measure H.4) The purpose of the energy efficiency monitoring system is to summarise and systematise information about all energy efficiency improvement measures performed within the scope of State and municipal policies, as well as any other information related to energy efficiency in order to control progress made towards achieving the energy efficiency target. The monitoring system currently summarises information from more than 1500 information providers about projects, as well as calculations about the measures the implementation of which has contributed to end-use energy savings. In order to evaluate the energy savings obtained as a result of implementing energy efficiency measures, it is important to improve the existing energy efficiency monitoring system. An important task is to ensure that information providers ae able to submit information electronically. It is also necessary to improve the current energy savings calculation methods to make them easy to use in calculations and in the preparation of reports for the EC. This system should be designed to be as straightforward as possible, allowing the performer of an energy efficiency improvement measure, on completion of a measure, to report once a year on the amount of energy consumed by the household.
