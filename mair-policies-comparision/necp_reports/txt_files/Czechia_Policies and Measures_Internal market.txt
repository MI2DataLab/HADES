3.4. 3.4  94 3.4.1 Electricity infrastructure i. Policies and measures to achieve the targeted level of interconnectivity as set out in Article 4(d) The framework target for Czech transmission system interconnectivity corresponds to maintaining the transmission system import and export capacity relative to the maximum load at a level of at least 30 % and 35 %, respectively. This is in line with the 15 % 2030 interconnectivity target (relative to installed                                                            94 Policies and measures reflect the first energy efficiency principle.  -135-  capacity). The Czech Republic is currently meeting this target with a relatively significant reserve and can be expected to do so in the future (see Chapter 2.4.1 and Chapter 4.5.1). Therefore, the Czech Republic does not consider it necessary to have specific policies and measures to achieve this target. The expected export and import capacity of the Czech Republic and its adequacy for trade exchanges and especially for the secure operation of the transmission system is periodically assessed both within the preparation of the ten-year network development plan of the Czech Republic and within the cooperation on the ten-year development plan at ENSTO-E level. With regard to the strengthening of export and import capacity, pre-project preparation (elaboration of the spatial-technical study) of a new line between the Czech Republic and Slovakia was started in coordination with the Slovak partners. Another aspect affecting the capacity of the cross-border transmistransmission system operator, which aims to replace the 220 kV system with a 400 kV system. For more information, see also Chapter 4.5.2. ii. Regional cooperation in this area95 In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity, the development plan is also reflected in the content of the regional investment plan for the Central and Eastern Europe on a two-regional investment plan of continental Central and Eastern Europe 2015 and are included in the TYNDP 2016, which is subject to assessment in accordance with established criteria. ghbours is an initiative set up in 2015 on the basis of a joint declaration prepared by the German Federal Ministry of Economy and Energy in cooperation with the European Commission and the countries of the Pentalateral Energy Forum. The group consists of Germany, France, the Benelux countries, Denmark, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Poland and the Czech Republic. The declaration highlights the importance of the internal market as the most advantageous economic means of ensuring supply security. The real development of operational security in individual regions and blackout response in Western Europe in 2006 led to the establishment of ad-hoc coordination platforms (Coreso, TSC, SSC) aiming to ensure operational coordination between the dispatching centres of the participating transmission system operators. Over the years, and with increasing need for coordination, inter alia, due to the growing share of intermittent electricity sources in the interconnected European system, cooperation among the TSOs has become much more interlinked and more detailed.  In June 2017, TSCNet and Coreso, as two future RSCs (Regional Security Coordinators), in accordance with the SO GL (System Operation Guideline, laying down the guidelines for the operation of electricity transmission systems), signed a framework cooperation agreement.96 This means sharing resources, methodologies and tools, joint or alternating provision of services and development of new services and resources. The adopted SO GL, together with the CACM (Capacitive Allocation and Congestion Management Guideline, establishing a guideline on capacity allocation and congestion management) and the Emergency Restoration Network Code (NC ER, establishing a network code on electricity                                                            95 Non-regional PCI groups established under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013. 96  In this respect, it is relevant to mention Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the internal market for electricity, which, under Article 35, legislatively establishes the regional coordination centres posed to replace the RSC entities.  -136-  emergency and restoration), sufficiently define the mandatory cooperation between the TSOs and the regional security coordinators. On 23 January 2019, the Czech-Slovak common interest project ACON was also approved within the framework of the CEF. E.ON Distribuce, a. s., and Západoslovenská distribuEUR 91.2 million from the European Commission for the international project ACON Smart Grids. It is the first project of distribution companies in the region of Central and Eastern Europe that has succeeded in the EU among the Projects of Common Interest (PCI projects). In addition to distribution companies, ACON is also supported by transmission system operators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia  . Work on the modernisation of distribution networks will begin this year in both countries and it will continue until 2024. The aim of this project, which is implemented in the Czech Republic by E.ON Distribuce, a. s., is to modernise and increase the efficiency of the distribution system and to deepen cross-border cooperation between Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Thanks to the project, intelligent technologies will be introduced into the distribution network to help regulate energy exactly according to consumption; it will also allow for improved utilisation of renewable resources in the future. By investing in smart grids, stability and security of supply, as well as economic efficiency of networks, will increase, while also improving remote network management. All this to prepare the distribution system for the coming decades to enable the connection of electric vehicles, batteries and other devices that will become part of everyday life. iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds Investment in the electricity system can be considered as very important, also in relation to the use of EU funds. The reason for the need for these investments is that the age of a significant part of the production sources and electricity system is 35 years or more and requires corresponding investment in maintenance, renewal and modernisation. Furthermore, it is necessary to adapt to new technologies and further technological development both in terms of sources and consumption. Electricity networks should be modernised on an ongoing basis to allow for the further development of new electricity generation sources (increase of free connection capacity). In addition to EU funds, the Czech Republic plans to continue to use funds from the CEF programme after 2020. The current use of the structural funds can be summarised as follows. Eight projects for modernising and improving the capacity of the transmission system with a total value of CZK 1 609 million have been approved so far, the EU contribution is CZK 643 million; as of 21 March 2018 CZK 23 million was reimbursed to three projects. In the area of modernisation and capacity increase of distribution systems, seven projects with total project expenditure of CZK 289 million are currently being administered, the EU contribution being CZK 116 million. In 20142020, the sub-area of transmission, distribution and storage of electricity and the modernisation of energy infrastructure is supported under the OP EIC, namely under Priority Axis 3, Investment Priority 3, Development and deployment of low and high  According to the OP EIC programming document, the total allocation for investment grants under this investment priority was EUR 37 million. As of 21 March 2018, a total of three applications with a total investment grant of CZK 152.641 million were approved. There was also less interest in grants for the construction of smart electricity networks, which should cover the expected significant increase in the number of decentralised sources connected into the system and the introduction of new consumption  -137-  management services. However, the interest of the regulated entities is closely related to the setting of the fifth regulatory period. In 2017, the European Commission approved the request for change / removal of the share for large enterprises in SO 3.2, 3.3 and 3.5. This should ensure a higher absorption capacity. OP EIC provides support to an increase in the applications of elements of Smart Grids I  distribution networks and Smart Grids II  transmission networks. 3.4.2 Natural gas transmission infrastructure i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.2, including, where applicable, specific measures to enable the delivery of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and other key infrastructure projects  The process to determine the incremental capacity of commercial infrastructure projects is governed by Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/459 of 16 March 2017 establishing a network code on capacity allocation mechanisms in gas transmission systems and repealing Regulation (EU) No 984/2013. In addition, it also specifies non-common interest under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 201397 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and repealing Decision No 1364/2006/EC and amending Regulations (EC) No 713/2009, (EC) No 714/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009. These projects can then enjoy certain benefits provided for in this regulation. The last type of projects is national projects, which are governed by Act No 458/2000, on the conditions for business and the performance of State administration in the energy sectors and amending certain acts (the Energy Act). ii. Regional cooperation in this area98 Context of regional cooperation The Czech Republic produces only 2 % of its natural gas consumption and is therefore dependent on imports from third countries. Sufficient diversification of transport routes (the Gazela pipeline and reverse gas flows at border transfer points) together with market liberalisation have led to the currently very good security of gas supply for domestic customers. The transmission system operator in the Czech Republic is at the same time an important natural gas transit operator for markets in Western, Central and Southern Europe. It is currently not possible to precisely determine the impact of decarbonisation in the European and Czech context on the Czech gas network and the concrete information on how this network will be used with a view to minimise the transmtechnological solutions for the gas sector decarbonisation are not developed to a large extent in both the EU and the Czech Republic, and it is therefore appropriate to keep this infrastructure for future use for both natural gas and new types of gases. A combination of natural gas with CCS or CCU may be considered for the storage or utilisation of carbon produced from natural gas splitting. Another European trend is the future use of synthetic methane, biomethane and hydrogen as a partial substitute for natural gas. The specific decision on the use of the technologies for new types of gases can be expected in 2020 to 2030, largely depending on the research and development of these technologies and the economies of scale to be achieved after they are deployed. Regional cooperation in the area of natural gas                                                            97  Projects of Common Interest are updated as needed and the provision of these specific projects in the National Plan does not mean that these projects can be considered binding. 98 Non-regional PCI groups established under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013.  -138-  In the area of natural gas, micro- and macro-regional cooperation takes place on several levels. Within the Gas Coordination Group, which meets regularly about once a year, the EU Member States discuss security, legislative and economic issues related to the EU gas sector. Regional infrastructure cooperation is strengthened at the operational level through the implementation of PCI projects, which are regularly discussed in smaller groups set up on a geographic basis. On the basis of the revised Security of Gas Supply Regulation (2017/1938), the so-called Risk Groups have been set up through which carry out regional risk management. States are discussing factors that could threaten the stability of gas supply in the future and look for ways to mitigate the risks. The Czech Republic is an active member of three regional groups, namely the Ukrainian, Baltic and Belarusian more closely with their neighbours on crisis management and to codify the mechanism to provide cross-border assistance in case of threatened gas supply outages to protected customers. The V4 Gas Forum is regularly held by the presiding country of the Visegrad Group. The focus of the meetings is always fully up to the presiding State, but typically the central theme is the debate on the possibilities for regional cooperation in the area of gas infrastructure development and the search for a common position on the legislative proposals being discussed by the EU Council. The V4 Gas Forum newly discusses the legal and operational aspects of Solidarity implementation. or V4+B4+ meetings. This platform is relatively new, and it is currently difficult to predict how the initiative develops, or what its specific focus will be. iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds For gas infrastructure projects, it is currently possible to obtain EU financial support through the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). CEF is part of the EU Financial Framework 20142020. In the past, projects also received support from the EU Trans-European Energy Network (TEN-E) programme, which provided support to long-term energy investments.   In 2012, the BACI project received financial support from the TEN-E funds. The financial support was 50 % of the eligible costs incurred in updating the documentation for the land-use permit and the study of the future possibilities of interconnecting the Czech and Austrian gas transmission systems. The study was completed in 2013 and the land-use permit application was filed in May 2015. At the end of 2014, the project received a CEF grant covering 50 % of the eligible costs of the preparatory study on the preparation of documents for the investment application. These documents were completed in late 2015. In 2014, the CPI project received financial support from the CEF programme covering 50 % of the eligible costs for the development of land-use permit documentation and documentation for contractor he energy sector, a grant for construction work on the Stork II project was obtained, but it was cancelled because the project was postponed until the end of 2022 by the Polish partner. The Stork II project has been postponed to the end of 2023, according to information from the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of the Transmission System 20202029. Neither the BACI project nor the CPI project were included in the 4th list of Projects of Common Interest (PCI). Therefore, it cannot be expected that these projects would draw funds from the CEF programme for the period 20142020. compressor station. Its aim is primarily to prepare a feasibility study and to create an introductory project and the Detail Design.  -139-  3.4.3 Market integration i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.3 3.4.3.1 Electricity sector With regard to international aspects, the policies and measures of the Czech Republic in this area are primarily aimed at EU legislation, namely Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 (CACM) and the conditions and methodologies that follow therefrom. This is especially the MCO plan, see Chapter 2.4.3, which is binding on all NEMOs within the EU. In cooperation with all NEMOs in the EU, in June 2017 first a plan was created to jointly establish and perform the functions of a market coupling operator  management and cooperation between NEMOs, defines the relationship with third parties, and also describes the transition of existing initiatives of interconnected day-ahead and intraday markets into a single interconnected day-ahead and intraday market. In relation to the CACM Regulation, the following methodologies were developed in 2017: (i) the methodology of products that NEMOs can incorporate into single day-ahead or single intraday coupling; (ii) back-up methodology; (iii) the methodology for harmonised maximum and minimum clearing prices.99 The single price coupling algorithm and the continuous trading matching algorithm is the last methodology which had to be prepared by the MCOs under CACM. Electricity forward market allocation of long-term capacity rights under harmonised rules. The requirements for the establishment of this platform are set out in Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/1719 of 26 September 2016 100. Integration of day-ahead electricity market As part of the MCO Plan, the Price Coupling of Regions (PCR) project, based on the cooperation of energy exchanges, has been established as a technical solution to enable the integration of day-ahead markets. OTE, a.s. has been a full member of this project since 2013 and has been thus involved in the development of this solution. The PCR system provides a unified algorithm, known as EUPHEMIA, and unified operational procedures for effective electricity pricing and the use of cross-border transmission capacity. The PCR solution is already being used in price-coupled markets (see Figure 5.4) in Europe and its further use, as a basis for a future pan-European solution, can therefore be seen as a logical step. In 2018, a significant shift was made in the PCR project to initiate the steps necessary to modify the EUPHEMIA solution to meet the requirements of the price coupling algorithm in accordance                                                            99  At the time of the finalisation of the National Plan of the Czech Republic, all pan-European methodologies are already approved, but they are still undergoing changes. The following information from ACER can be used for an overview of methodologies https://www.acer.europa.eu/en/Electricity/MARKET-CODES/CAPACITY-ALLOCATION-AND-CONGESTION-MANAGEMENT/Pub_Docs/CACM%20implementation%20table.pdf 100  For more information see: https://www.ceps.cz/cs/fca-gl and: https://www.emissions-euets.com/forward-capacity-allocation-platform.  -140-  with the CACM Regulation. Intensive research is planned in the coming years to ensure sufficient quality, robustness and stability of the algorithm for the single day-ahead market in Europe. Figure 2: Current state of day-ahead market coupling in electricity in Europe  Source: OTE, a.s. The Multi-Regional Coupling (MRC) includes the markets of Germany/Austria, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Finland, Croatia, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovenia, Italy and Poland. This coupling area accounts for approximately 2 800 TWh of annual electricity consumption. The Bulgarian day-ahead market is settled together with the MRC, but without the allocation of cross-border capacities. Thanks to the long-term integration activities of the Market Operator, the Czech Republic is part of the day-ahead market coupling covering the Czech, Slovak, Hungarian and Romanian electricity market (4M MC). The 4M MC uses the PCR solution, which ensures the technical and procedural compatibility between 4M MC and the MRC and the target European solutions. Market participants in the Czech Republic are offered products and solutions also used in Western Europe.  Over the last few years, there were ongoing preparations for the coupling of this regional project to MRC on the basis of the implicit flow-based allocation of cross-border capacities within CORE established by the CACM Regulation and consisting of 13 EU Member States101.  possibility of implicit allocation of cross-border capacity at all border profiles of the Czech Republic through the above electricity markets integration projects. Integration of intraday electricity market                                                            101  France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Luxembourg and Romania.  -141-  A logical step towards creating a single European market is also the individual coupling at regional / pan-European level in intraday trading. The integration of intraday trading is largely different from day-ahead coupling, because it is a continuous 24/7 trading, with significant demands not only on the harmonisation of procedures between marketplaces and providers of cross-border profiles but also on the technical solution used, which must achieve very high availability while maintaining stable performance.  2018 saw the conclusion of the implementation of a platform for the single intraday continuous trading with the implicit allocation of cross-border capacities within the Cross-Border Intraday Coupling (XBID) project, which was established as the technical solution for the single intraday coupling in Europe under the MCO Plan. The XBID project responds to market needs by creating a more transparent and efficient continuous trading environment that enables market participants to easily trade their intraday positions across EU markets without the need for explicit allocation of transmission capacity. On 19 November 2019, the project for the European Single Intraday Coupling of electricity markets was launched with trading for the 20 November 2019 supply day102. The solution is based on a single central IT system linking bids from local trading systems operated by nominated electricity market organisers, as well as available transmission capacities between trading zones provided by transmission system operators. As part of the central solution, orders placed by market participants in one country may be matched with orders placed by market participants in any other participating country if there is an available cross-border transmission capacity between the zones concerned.                                                              102  For more information see: https://www.ote-cr.cz/cs/o-spolecnosti/zpravy_ote/projekt-evropskeho-propojeni-vnitrodennich-trhu-s-elektrinou-sidc-v-ramci-tzv-druhe-vlny-lokalnich-implementacnich-projektu-potvrzuje-spusteni-provozu-dne-19-listopadu-2019-ke-ctrnacti-jiz-propojenym-zemim-evropske-unie-se-tak-prida-dalsich-sedm-zemi.  -142-  Figure 3: Expected state of day-ahead coupling in electricity in Europe after 2019  Source: OTE, a.s. nominated electricity market operators and transmission system operators in a given area or region. On 12 June 2018, the first wave of local implementation projects was successfully launched, covering the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, Norway, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. Since the launch of the first wave in June 2018, more than 16 million trades have been successfully completed. In May 2017, a local implementation project No 15 (the so-called LIP 15) was launched, through which the relevant nominated market operators and transmission system operators representing Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia showed their interest in realising continuous cross-border trading and introducing an implicit allocation of intraday cross-border transmission capacities on relevant profiles.

Balancing services market 103, MARI104 and PICASSO105 platform projects implementing transnational platforms for sharing and activating balancing energy bids from standard products. The common objective of all platforms is the introduction of a single market with standardised balancing energy bids and thereby also the achievement of the key EBGL106 objectives. together with the implementation of the platforms, these represent an instrument for the Czech Republic to achieve commitments in this area of the market.  3.4.3.2 Gas sector The Czech Republic intends to help complete the internal energy market, in particular the internal gas market, by removing infrastructure bottlenecks between the Czech Republic and its neighbours, namely                                                            103  Trans European Replacement Reserves Exchange 104  Manually Activated Reserves Initiative 105  Platform for the International Coordination of Automated Frequency Restoration and Stable System Operation 106  Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/2195 of 23 November 2017 establishing a guideline on electricity balancing  -144-  Poland and Austria. This should be facilitated by the fact that the national gas market legislation has been adapted to two regulations designed to ensure uniform principles for the creation of a single internal gas market in the EU  Regulation (EU) No 2017/460 establishing a network code on harmonised transmission tariff structures for gas, Regulation (EU) No 2017/459 establishing a network code on capacity allocation mechanisms in gas transmission systems and repealing Regulation (EU) No 984/2013. This should be further facilitated by the support for the implementation of PCI status projects (projects of common interest), enabling direct interconnection with the gas systems of neighbouring countries. These projects contribute to the integration of national markets in the region and the creation of a Central European gas market. The interconnection with Germany and Slovakia is already sufficiently robust. The Czech Republic is interconnected with Poland by the STORK gas pipeline. There is no physical interconnection between the Czech Republic and Austria. For more information see also Chapter 2.4.3.2. ii. Measures to increase the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production such as smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, real-time price signals, including the roll-out of intraday market coupling and cross-border balancing markets National Action Plan for Smart Grids The key strategic and planning document containing measures to increase the flexibility of the energy system is the National Action Plan for Smart Grids, which is prepared by the Ministry of Industry and Trade on the basis of the task formulated in the State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic from 2015. The National Action Plan for Smart Grids (NAP SG) was approved by the Government of the Czech Republic in March 2015, by Government Resolution No 149 of 4 March 2015.  The period up to 2019 was characterised as preparatory within the framework of NAP SG; the aim in this period was to prepare the necessary analyses, to design and agree a target model for the smart grid implementation in the Czech Republic, to complete and evaluate the pilot projects and to prepare the implementation process for the Advanced Metering Management (AMM). On 16 September 2019, the Government of the Czech Republic approved the NAP SG Update, more precisely the National Action Plan for Smart Grids 20192030 (NAP SG 20192030)107. At the same time, the NAP SG Evaluation Report as of 31 December 2018 was prepared, which provides detailed information on the fulfilment of individual cards, or policies and measures within the NAP SG.  The following areas have been identified as relevant areas that fall within the scope of the NAP SG Update:  Legislation (EU legislation  network regulations, winter legislative package, new technologies);  Use of aggregation, flexibility for electricity systems (decentralised energy sources, consumption);  Electromobility (integration and use for the operation of the electricity system);  Digitalising and its use (automation, communication);  Decentralised energy sources (integration and use for the operation of the electricity system);  Dispatching control (including operational measurement);                                                            107 The National Action Plan for Smart Grids 20192030 is available at the following link.  -145-   Accumulation (integration and use for the operation of the electricity system);  Advanced Metering Management (AMM).

The CACM Regulation lays down detailed guidelines on cross-zonal capacity allocation and congestion management in the day-ahead and intraday markets, including the requirements for the establishment of common methodologies for determining the volumes of capacity simultaneously available between bidding zones, criteria to assess efficiency and a review process for defining bidding zones. The EB Regulation lays down a detailed guideline on electricity balancing including the establishment of common principles for the procurement and the settlement of frequency containment reserves, frequency restoration reserves and replacement reserves and a common methodology for the activation of frequency restoration reserves and replacement reserves. iii. Where applicable, measures to ensure the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets   -147-  In accordance with Act No 165/2012, on supported energy sources, the transmission system operator or distribution system operator is obliged, in its licenced territory, to preferentially connect to the transmission system or to the distribution system a facility generating electricity from a supported source in order to transfer or distribute electricity, if the manufacturer so requests and meets the conditions of connection, except for the demonstrable lack of capacity of the transmission and distribution facility or in the case of the risk to safe and reliable operation of the electricity system. At the same time, the transmission system operator or distribution system operator shall, at the request of the producer whose facility generating electricity from a supported source is to be connected to the distribution system or the transmission system, provide the necessary information for the connection, information on estimated connection costs, the time limit for connection, handling the connection application and an estimate of the time needed to make the connection. Integration of renewable energy sources, demand-side response and overall flexibility are dealt with in detail in the National Action Plan for Smart Grids, more precisely its updated version, i.e. the National Action Plan for Smart Grids 20192030. These measures are set out in more detail in part (ii) and they are specifically summarised in Table 55. Partial measures with regard to demand-side flexibility are also included in the approved European legislation, in particular Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU. The measures required by this Directive will be gradually transposed into national legislation. iii. Policies and measures to protect consumers, especially vulnerable and, where applicable, energy poor consumers, and to improve the competitiveness and contestability of the retail energy market  Policies and measures to protect the legitimate interests of customers and consumers in the energy sector to meet all reasonable energy supply requirements:  ensuring the supply of energy to consumers at the most competitive prices;  ensuring appropriate measures to promote a more efficient use of energy for consumers;  increased level of customer protection in the position of the consumer, i.e. especially household customers;  ensuring that consumers are informed about their energy consumption and energy costs in sufficient time intervals; non-discriminatory payment systems;  ensuring that consumers are informed of their rights in the energy sector;  ensuring the enforcement of consumer rights  establishing swift and effective complaints procedures and out-of-court settlement mechanisms;  ensuring the availability of effective means of settling disputes for all customers;    issuing binding decisions regarding energy companies; imposing effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions on energy companies;  promoting fair competition, enabling consumers to make full use of the opportunities in energy markets. Energy poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon, which can be characterised from many different perspectives. Still, the basic model criteria may reflect a situation where households have insufficient level of basic energy services as a result of a combination of high energy expenditure, low household income, low energy efficiency of buildings and facilities, possibly in combination with the specific energy needs of these households. Therefore, energy poverty itself can be seen as a problem at the interface between social, economic and environmental agendas. For this reason, the solution may be an  -148-  integrated approach, which can include both social policy measures and measures to improve energy efficiency in households, as well as measures to increase consumer awareness of the ways to save energy (improving the position of consumers, especially of vulnerable consumers). legislation, without this term being defined in them. Rather than focusing on the definition of vulnerable customers, the EU places a strong emphasis on the existence of support systems and the definition of which categories of customers this support applies to. In connection with vulnerable customers, regardless of how this term is defined in individual Member States with regard to national conditions, Member States should ensure the enforcement of rights and obligations aimed at protecting and supporting this category of customers. allowing regdevelop and implement interventions and assess their effectiveness are determined on the basis of research and market analysis. Regardless of the fact that energy poverty or vulnerable customer is not currently defined in the Czech Republic, customer support systems are now in place that partially meet the requirements of the directives, because they allow economic support and protection against disconnection of poor customers. It is a combination of economic support within social systems, together with tools to protect customers in emergency situations (supplier of last resort, obligation going beyond the licence). However, the Czech Republic does not have a specific support system for the energy sector, which is not in direct contradiction with EU requirements, because the EU requires a high degree of caution when considering intervention in the internal electricity or gas market, even if the intention is to protect vulnerable customers. Existing support systems:  an economic support system specific to the energy sector (the Czech Republic does not have an economic support system specific to the energy sector). In most countries with an economic support system in the energy sector, the system covers customers with income below a defined level.);  a system of economic support outside of the energy sector (a characteristic factor is that customers can get some financial support if needed) (part of social systems in the Czech Republic).  a system of non-economic support specific to the energy sector (a non-financial support system, such as, in particular, disconnection protection, may work as a complement to the economic support system). In the Czech Republic, these measures include the institutes of supplier of last resort and obligations going beyond the licence regulated by the Energy Act). A vulnerable customer, whose appropriately defined in law to ensure his suitable protection. The underlying theoretical parameters of a vulnerable customer may in particular involve situations where:  customers are significantly less capable of protecting or representing their interests in the energy market than typical consumers (for example, due to age or health);  in the event of a negative energy supply situation, customers, due to their personal situation, will be more harmed by an event than other customers in the same situation. The energy sector in the Czech Republic lacks systematic collection of information on the number of households suffering from energy poverty; therefore, there can be no binding parameters characterising  -149-  a vulnerable customer. Ultimately, therefore, there can be no system of economic support for vulnerable customers personalised for the energy sector.  In this respect, there are the following principles on which new policies and measures should be based to protect vulnerable and energy poor consumers:  in order to identify energy poverty among household customers in the Czech Republic, it will be necessary to publish the parameters and criteria used for its identification, measurement and monitoring  important factors in designing the indicators for measuring energy poverty are, inter alia, low income, high energy costs and low energy efficiency of homes;  drawing up a national action plan or another appropriate framework to tackle this problem, which would aim to reduce the number of people facing the problem and ensure the necessary energy supplies to vulnerable customers and customers suffering from energy poverty;  the application of an integrated approach, for example as part of energy and social policy  measures need to be adapted to the specific situation identified and may include social or energy policy measures relating to the payment of electricity bills, investment in energy efficiency of residential buildings or consumer protection, such as disconnection protection;  in the fight against energy poverty, appropriate instruments may also include community energy principle, which may also bring about progress in energy efficiency of households and reduce consumption and lower supply rates  community energy may enable energy market participation to certain consumer groups in households which would otherwise not be able to do so;  the protection of customers suffering from energy poverty or the protection of vulnerable customers should be ensured by means other than public interventions in the setting of electricity or gas supply with transparent conditions and only in precisely defined cases.

Description of measures to enable and develop demand response, including those addressing tariffs to support dynamic pricing108 Measures developing demand-side flexibility are contained in the National Action Plan for Smart Grids, or more precisely in its updated version, the National Action Plan for Smart Grids 20192030. These measures are set out in more detail in part (ii) and they are specifically summarised in Table 55. Partial measures with regard to demand-side flexibility are also included in the approved European legislation, in particular Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU. The measures required by this Directive will be gradually transposed into national legislation. 3.4.4 Energy poverty i. Where applicable, policies and measures to achieve the objectives set out in point 2.4.4  The Czech Republic does not currently have policies or measures specifically aimed at reducing energy poverty. This issue is primarily addressed by social policies or, where applicable, partially by consumer protection policies. However, the Czech Republic addresses this issue also with regard to the approved European legislation. Currently, work is underway on the methodology to identify vulnerable customers and consumers suffering from energy poverty and tools to address this problem (for more information,                                                            108 In accordance with Article 15(8) of Directive 2012/27/EU.  -150-  see Chapter 2.4.4). It will likely be possible to propose specific measures and policies in this area only following the preparation of this methodology. The first call of the pilot programme of financial assistance to households and municipalities in the Karlovy Vary, Moravian-Silesian and Ústí nad Labem Regions is under way within the National Programme Environment. The programme aims to pre-finance the replacement of substandard solid fuel boilers in households in the form of a soft loan to individuals; part of the support is intended to provide the services of a boiler replacement specialist who will provide the households with comprehensive advisory services. Therefore, the programme is aimed at helping socially weak households to support the replacement of substandard heat sources in a residential building and it can thus be to some extent considered as an energy-poverty-related programme, which is at the same time energy-sector-specific. The Czech Republic will provide information about the developments in this area by periodic progress reports in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1999
