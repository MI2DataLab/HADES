88 2.3. Dimension energy security  this.  i. The elements set out in point (c) of Article 4 (39) ii. National objectives with regard to increasing: the diversification of energy sources and supply from third countries for the purpose of increasing the resilience of regional and national energy systems iii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to reducing energy import dependency from third countries, for the purpose of increasing the resilience of regional and national energy systems iv. National objectives with regard to increasing the flexibility of the national energy system, in particular by means of deploying domestic energy sources, demand response and energy storage  Belgium depends to a large extent on imports of primary energy resources in order to meet domestic demand. Belgian energy policy therefore aims to ensure an uninterrupted supply of these primary sources, not only for their applications in the energy sector itself, but also as a raw material in various industrial processes. The aim is to ensure a diversified supply in terms of energy sources, origin and route, without, however, setting quantified targets. Belgium has an open and liquid market for both oil and natural gas, involving many national and international players. Although trade in these two products is highly globalised and governmental operators therefore have and competitive manner. Correct price signals for supply and demand are therefore the first element in guaranteeing security of supply at all times. In addition, the origin of the various sources of primary energy is constantly monitored (see figure below), with no particular producer having yet been identified as dominant. However, if this were to become the case in the future, it would have to be considered whether public intervention was desirable and necessary. Origin of energy imports by carrier in 2017 (in %)  (Source: Chiffres clés Énergie 2019 [Key figures for Energy 2019])                                                            39 (1) National objectives with regard to:  increasing the diversification of energy sources and supply from third countries, the purpose of which may be to reduce energy import dependency,  increasing the flexibility of the national energy system, and addressing constrained or interrupted supply of an energy source, for the purpose of improving the resilience of regional and national energy systems, including a timeframe for when the objectives should be met. 89 Pétrole brut Crude oil Gaz naturel (40) Natural gas (40) OPEC OPEC Russie Russia Norvège Norway Royaume-Uni United Kingdom Autres Other Pays-Bas The Netherlands Qatar Qatar  The announced reduction in the supply of lean gas from the Netherlands from 2022 requires particular attention on account of the scale of the conversion that will need to be undertaken. Belgium plans to switch 1.6 million residential and business connections from lean gas to rich gas between 2017 and 2029. Furthermore, market participants will have to conclude contracts with new parties over the next few years to meet their end-customer obligations. The government may act as facilitator in this respect. On one hand, as a refining hub, Belgium depends to a large extent on imports of crude oil. On the other hand, the refining sector allows Belgium to produce a large number of oil products within the country (domestic production). To guarantee growth in the refining sector, and therefore in the domestic production of oil products, the refining industry must continue to be supported. Furthermore, during the period 2020-2030, Belgium will take the necessary steps to promote investment in refineries to ensure as much independence as possible, both nationally and internationally. In addition, Belgium will further diversify its oil products by continuing to promote the incorporation of biofuels. This policy should reduce the dependence on a limited number of specific products that are frequently used. gium is aiming to reduce energy intensity and therefore dependence on foreign supplies of primary energy sources. The measures to be taken in this respect are listed in point 3.1 (Energy Efficiency). With regard to electricity, Belgium has clear rules, in security of supply situation. This is an important concept that determines the number of hours during which electricity demand cannot be met by any of the generating capacity within the national electricity system, taking account of interconnections. This number of hours is a legal obligation in Belgium: the LOLE cannot legally exceed 3 hours in a normal winter and 20 hours in a severe winter (41). In addition, in accordance with the Regulation on the internal market for electricity (42), a value of lost load must be determined by 5 July 2020 at the latest in order to correctly assess the security of supply situation, bearing in mind developments in the energy landscape. At the moment, the total electricity need in Belgium is one fifth of the total energy need. However, the expected electrification in the transport, heat and industry sectors will increase the share of electricity in the energy mix. In this context, Belgium foresees a radical conversion of the electricity mix in the period 2020-2030. Nuclear power plants will be gradually decommissioned (see Figure 2). The Federal Government confirmed this commitment  which was enshrined in legislation back in 2003  on 30 March 2018 as part of the Interfederal Energy Pact.  A structure has been developed not only to monitor progress in implementing the measures listed in the Energy Pact, but also to closely monitor security of supply, the development of energy prices, and the impact on climate objectives and nuclear safety, and also to take additional measures if necessary.                                                            40 40% of the natural gas imported from the Netherlands comes from a third country and is therefore simply transported via the Dutch natural gas system. 41 In accordance with Article 7bis(2) of the Law of 29 April 1999 on the organisation of the electricity market, the energy security level to be achieved is set at an LOLE below 3 hours and an LOLE95 below 20 hours, in the absence of common European rules. 42 Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electricity. 90 Timetable for phasing out nuclear power   In order to attract investment in electricity generation, a centralised capacity compensation mechanism covering the entire market will be developed. This system, which will be technology-neutral, will fully comply with the provisions of European directives and legislation on State aid. Furthermore, in addition to encouraging the construction of new gas-fired power plants or the continued operation of existing gas-fired power plants, the system will allow the large-scale implementation of demand-side management or storage solutions. The chosen mechanism will minimise costs, preserve the competitiveness of businesses and SMEs as much as possible and in no way affect the purchasing power of citizens. The framework law on this capacity compensation mechanism was adopted on 4 April 2019 and the various implementing decrees are being drafted. In order to compensate for the decommissioning of an estimated nuclear capacity of 6,000 MW, the following measures will be developed and implemented. 1. Adequacy and flexibility study (Elia): this biennial study must broadlsecurity of supply situation, bearing in mind the LOLE rules. 2. Capacity compensation mechanism: the legal framework for this mechanism will be developed in the next few months so that Belgium can organise a call for tender in good time to attract by 2025 the investment needed to ensure the required level of security of supply. 3. Renewable energy: Belgium aims to have 40% renewable energy by 2030, as an interim step towards achieving fully renewable energy generation by 2050. The Federal State will contribute to this goal through offshore wind energy. The aim here is to have a total installed capacity of 4 GW by 2030. The measures that Belgium will take to achieve these aims of developing renewable energy sources are set out in Chapter 3. 4. Interconnections: Belgium is already extensively interconnected with its neighbouring countries. In the next few years, additional investments will be made not only to increase this capacity, but also to further increase the commercial availability of the existing capacity, in accordance with the Regulation on the internal market for electricity. The objectives are discussed in point 2.4 below. 5. Flexibility: the smooth functioning of the flexibility market will be regularly reviewed so that it is in a position to meet the changing needs of the system. If necessary and desirable, the existing legislation on flexibility will be revised. Cooperation between the competent authorities will be improved in order to simplify the granting of authorisations needed to develop new generating capacity and to adapt the necessary systems to the development of renewable energy. In this context, a one-stop-shop approach, rooted in the Cooperation 91 Agreement of 27 February 2014 on the creation of a coordination and facilitation committee, will be systematically applied to energy infrastructure projects of national interest. Particular efforts will be made to minimise the administrative burden for project owners. The various levels of authority will ensure that new centralised and decentralised storage systems and options for peak-load shifting in both industry and private households continue to be developed. Based on its responsibility for guaranteeing security of supply, the Federal Government will organise active cooperation with the regions in order to fully explore the flexibility potential and guarantee system stability. Belgium will make all necessary plans in relation to the decommissioning of its nuclear power plants and to ensure that radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuels are stored/managed in the most appropriate manner. It will take all necessary decisions, particularly regarding technical specifications and the location of waste storage facilities. Alongside monitoring of the Energy Pact (see point 1.2), the Federal State will continue to structurally monitor  of supply, in collaboration with the regions and stakeholders, as part of the federal strategy and implementation of the capacity compensation mechanism, taking into account the situation in neighbouring countries. In addition, in accordance with the Regulation on the internal market for electricity (43), a value of lost load (VoLL) will be determined by 5 July 2020 at the latest, alongside the current national LOLE (44) rules, in order to correctly assess the security of supply situation, bearing in mind developments in the energy landscape. The impact on the climate, energy prices and safety of nuclear facilities will also be closely monitored. A federal monitoring committee, made up of representatives of the federal and regional entities, employers and industry, must check whether additional measures are needed based on this monitoring. In addition to the monitoring at federal level, Belgium will also conduct various risk assessments relating to the security of its electricity, gas and oil supplies in accordance with EU and international legislation. In this context, active regional cooperation (including through the Pentalateral Energy Forum and the Gas Platform) will be established. Several longer-term forecasts will also be prepared, such as the prospective studies on electricity and natural gas (by the Federal Public Service for the Economy  Directorate-General for Energy) and the Federal Planning Bureau energy outlooks. The objective and methodology of these studies will be regularly evaluated to make them as useful as possible for policymakers, minimise any overlaps with other analyses and maintain consistency. In addition, regulators and system operators, individually or within their European confederations (e.g. ACER, CEER, ENTSO-E, ENTSO-G), will also conduct numerous studies in support of energy security policy. Lastly, Belgium will continue its efforts to refine and update its crisis management policy for all significant energy carriers. In this respect, it will develop contingency plans for each energy carrier, taking into account national, regional, EU and international obligations, and will give due consideration to developments in cybersecurity. Based on its various contingency plans, Belgium intends to produce an overarching contingency plan which maps the spillover effects between the various energy carriers and sets out specific procedures to address these effects. Finally, participation in national, regional, European and international crisis simulations/exercises is also part of the plan. All of this will be carried out in close cooperation with stakeholders, particularly centres and agencies specifically set up for this purpose (e.g. APETRA (45)).                                                              43 Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electricity. 44 In accordance with Article 7bis(2) of the Law of 29 April 1999 on the organisation of the electricity market, the energy security level to be achieved is set at an LOLE below 3 hours and an LOLE95 below 20 hours, in the absence of common European rules. 45 The national storage company (Agence PETRolière/PETRoleumAgentschap).
