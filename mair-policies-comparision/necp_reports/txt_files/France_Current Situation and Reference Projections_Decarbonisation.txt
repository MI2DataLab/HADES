In particular, the existing measures enable:  - A reduction in emissions for the transport sector (energy emissions), of 5% in 2030 and 6% in 2050 compared to 2015. In 2050, they will essentially be at their 1990 level.   153    - A significant reduction in emissions for the residential/tertiary sector. Emissions for the  agriculture (which represents a minor share of the category) fall by 26% in 2030 and 52% in 2050 compared to 2015.  - A reduction in emissions for the manufacturing industry sector of 10% in 2030 and 11% in 2050 compared to 2015.  - A reduction in emissions for the industrial processes, agriculture (excluding energy) and waste processing sectors of 24%, 6% and 13% respectively between 2015 and 2030 and 38%, 10% and 42% respectively between 2015 and 2050.   - A reduction in GHG removals of 29% in 2030 and 67% in 2050 compared to their level in 2015. The quantity of GHG removals has been revised downwards following an adjustment to the WEM scenario compared to the initial version of the PNIEC project.     Results for WEM projections for the ESR sector  The WEM projections have been broken down into ETS and ESR emissions in order to assess whether  The figure below shows the projections for total emissions, the projections for ESR emissions and the Annual Emission Allocations taken from the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) and the target set by the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) in 2030 for France (a reduction of 37% compared to 2005, thus approximately 248 MtCO2e in 2030).     Figure 24: Projections for the WEM scenario for ESR    Projections AME  WEM projections   Annual emission allocations  Projections ESR AME  WEM ESR projections  Objectif ESR de la France (-37%/2005)  ESR target for France (-37%/2005)       154    In 2020, the ESR emissions forecast in the WEM scenario are 345,449 ktCO2e, and thus very slightly above (+0.3%) the annual emission allowance stated in the ESD for France in 2020 (344,300 ktCO2e). According to the projections, and given the surplus of annual emission allowances accumulated since 2013, the existing measures therefore make it possible for France to comply with the requirements imposed by the ESD in 2020.  In 2030, the ESR emissions forecast in the WEM scenario reach a level of 303,378 ktCO2e, which is approximately 21% above the 2030 ESR target set for France. The existing measures therefore do not make it possible for France to meet the requirements of the ESR for 2030.    4.2.2. Renewable energies  All of the measures developed in Part 3 should modify the French energy mix. This section reviews the situation in the various sectors and finishes with the projections for expected energy mixes following application of the measures described in Part 3, to meet the targets stated in Part 2.    4.2.2.1. Renewable and recovered heating and cooling  Heating represents 42.3% of final energy consumption in 2017, namely 741 TWh. The residential and tertiary sector represents 65% of final consumption of heating, industry represents 30%, and the portion associated with agriculture is minimal.  Heat is essentially generated 40% by gas, 21% by renewable energies (biomass, heat pumps, geothermal energy, biogas, solar thermal), electricity and oil (18% and 16% respectively) and to a marginal extent by coal (5%).  The share for renewable energies has been increasing by an average of 0.8 point each year since 2010. This significant increase is the result of an increase in heat generation from renewable sources and a fall in final heat consumption. In 2028, renewable heat generation will be between 219 and 247 TWh.  The total heat requirement is expected to be 639 TWh in 2023 and 579 TWh in 2028. The Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth has set a target of 38% renewable energies in final heat consumption by 2030. To meet this target, the speed of growth of the renewable heat rate will need to be increased by an average of 1.2% each year, thus 1.5 times faster than the speed observed between 2010 and 2016. The LTECV also sets a target of a five-fold increase in the quantity of renewable and recovered heat and cold delivered by district heating and cooling systems by 2030 compared to 2012.  France also has European commitments, with a total target of 23% renewables by 2020, which means a target rate for renewable heat of 33% by 2020. This target does not seem attainable within the mandated deadline. The Renewable Energies Directive has recently been revised and published, and requires each Member State to increase its rate of renewable and recovered heat by at last 1.3 points each year between 2020 and 2030. This new target is compatible with the framework set by the LTECV and the targets imposed by the MEP.  The following table illustrates the progress for renewable heat against the targets set by the previous MEP for 2018 and 2023.     2012  2017  Target in MEP2016 for 2018  Low  target  in  MEP2016 for 2023  High  target  in  MEP2016 for 2023  127.7 TWh  155 TWh  173 TWh  200 TWh  221 TWh   155    The targets for renewable heat set by the MEP adopted in 2016 and values achieved in 2012 (reference year) and 2017  The following table shows the final consumption target for renewable heat that can be achieved through the implementation of the measures.

This sector groups together both the wood used by households (independent heating devices such as inserts, stoves and boilers), biomass plants for industrial, collective and tertiary heating, renewable heat produced by biomass cogeneration, and the renewable share of heat produced by urban waste energy recovery units. Around 7.3 to 7.8 million households were consuming wood in 2017 (domestic final wood consumption in 2017 was 80 TWh). Additionally, between 2009 and 2017, the Heat Fund financed nearly 1,093 biomass boilers, including 163 in industry and the rest for the collective sector.     2012  2017  Target in MEP2016 for 2018  Low target in MEP2016 for 2023  High target in MEP2016 for 2023  107 TWh  120 TWh  139 TWh  151 TWh  163 TWh   156    Targets for renewable heat generated from biomass set by the MEP adopted in 2016 and the values achieved in 2012 (reference year) and 2017  compared to the 2023 target. This delay is seen particularly in the collective and industrial sectors, where biomass has not progressed as expected due to the fall in gas prices. In the call for BCIAT projects (Wood Collective Industry Agriculture Tertiary) managed by ADEME, it was noted that manufacturers are turning to solutions to recover the by-products of their activities (wood waste, etc.). Local reorganisation and the electoral context also made it more difficult to implement biomass projects.  In the domestic wood/biomass sector, there has also been a decrease since 2014 in sales of domestic wood devices (closed fireplaces, inserts and log stoves) and growth in the pellet stove sector (+13% in 2018). After 2017, when sales were up, the market again contracted in 2018 (decrease of 1.5%). Maximum supply potential  The aspects relating to the biomass resource are discussed above.  Under a European agreement, the heat generated by incinerated domestic waste with energy recovery is considered to be 50% renewable. This resource is accounted for with biomass. There is no objective to increase this resource, but rather only to maximise the energy recovery of a resource for which the trend will be downward.  Socioeconomic, industrial and environmental issues   Yields  Wood can be used directly in devices to produce heat. It is biomass that does not require a conversion stage to be used as fuel.  Independent wood devices referenced under the Green Flame label have good yields (> 75% for inserts, closed fireplaces and log stoves, and > 87% for pellet stoves). In the tertiary, collective and industrial sectors, the efficiency of boilers is up to 85% on average and 95% when they supply district heating and cooling.   In addition to the upstream challenges of mobilising biomass, it is important to promote the most energyefficient uses of biomass. The use of biomass for heat production should be promoted. It is also important to continue energy recovery of domestic waste treatment units (discussed in a specific chapter).   Sector support issues  The increase in the price for fossil fuels should have a positive influence on investments in renewable heating solutions, which have been decreasing since 2013 due to lower gas prices. Additional actions, such as the increase in the Heat Fund amount and the simplification of the Heat Fund rules, are needed to reinvigorate investment. This will enable support for projects in industry, agriculture and the tertiary sector, through the call for BCIAT projects, and for collective boilers, possibly linked to a district heating system. Support through the CITE for individual wood-burning equipment is also a major challenge for this pathway.  Costs  The solid biomass sector has competitive full production costs. Therefore, for private individuals, the cost of heat production from a log-20. However, the  20   157    investment cost is higher than that of the benchmark fossil-fuel solutions, which explains why this sector requires support. No significant reduction is expected in terms of production costs for the biomass sector within the MEP time scales. One of the challenges facing the sector is to develop a more efficient French combustion devices industry by 2022, in anticipation of changes in European ecodesign regulations,21 and to reduce the production costs of the most powerful devices (6 and 7 stars).  The characteristics of the sector in terms of employment  The wood energy sector generates more than 22,000 jobs in France, including 70% for the domestic wood industry22. In 2017, the sector had a ratio of 160 jobs per TWh produced. About 50% of these jobs are direct: those involved in the biofuels production and usage chain (such as forestry work) or the manufacture and maintenance of boilers. The sector relies on national know-how with operators present throughout the value chain. The French industrial context consists of companies operating in the areas of stoves, inserts, boilers and flues for the domestic sector,23 companies positioned in the manufacture of wood boilers, and companies involved in the operation of boilers for the collective, tertiary and collective, tertiary and industrial sectors. Grants to private individuals are contingent upon the use of RGE-certified installers. The qualification of wood energy installers through the Qualibois and Qualibat labels will continue.   Environmental challenges  The increased mobilisation of biomass is one of the priorities for green growth and the fight against climate change. This mobilisation must take place in line with sustainable practices and must form part of the dialogue on the best operational coordination of uses. Cultivation practices and mobilised resources incorporate the challenges of carbon storage in soil, the maintenance of biodiversity, and adaptation to climate change. The National Biomass Mobilisation Strategy (SNMB) devotes a chapter to the conditions of this mobilisation.  A strategic environmental assessment report has been prepared on this SNMB, identifying three major challenges for the production of biomass resources: climate change mitigation, which the mobilisation of biomass addresses through the sequestration effect in wood products with long life cycles and through materials and energy substitution; preservation of soil quality; and preservation and reinforcement of biodiversity and ecosystem services. In terms of soils, to avoid loss of organic matter and minerals, the SNMB includes measures to promote organic soil improvement, research on the link between organic matter in soils and cultivation practices, and the identification of sensitive forest soil areas from which the quantities of residues exported must be limited. In relation to biodiversity, the SNMB could have an effect not just on the volume of old living wood, by encouraging the harvesting of more wood in forests, but also on the volume of dead wood. However, the implementation of the SNMB will also stimulate renewal efforts, which will diversify forest habitats in open/rejuvenated environments. The effect of the SNMB on biodiversity could therefore be positive or negative depending on operating and restocking practices and local conditions. A specific environmental measure has been adopted vis-à-vis forest biodiversity (preservation of standing and fallen biodiversity-friendly old wood) and measures to increase knowledge, awareness and training for stakeholders. While ensuring a mobilisation of agricultural biomass resources that is balanced against the issues associated with biodiversity preservation (biodiversity-sensitive zoning and moderation of inputs), apart from environmental measures, the SNMB has an uncertain impact on agricultural biodiversity. The SNMB is considered to have neutral to positive effects on the other environmental challenges deemed to be less of a priority in relation to upstream biomass production sectors (adaptation to climate change, limiting of the  21 .

Improved air quality is another key issue, which involves the replacement of older devices with more efficient equipment (minimum 6-star class under the Green Flame label24), in particular by maintaining the CITE and ADEME Air-Wood Fund. In 2016, between 7.3 and 7.8 million households used wood, 1.1 million of which in open fireplaces. Performance in terms of atmospheric emissions is progressing satisfactorily. All these performance values will be regulatory at EC level in 2020 (boilers) and 2022 (independent equipment). Additional measures are needed to promote the use of dry wood: a dry, split and debarked fuel emits nearly ten times fewer particles than an unlabelled commercial fuel25, with the difference being even greater with a self-consumption fuel. A national awareness campaign would also enable the development of a supervised sector and would be able to meet air quality challenges. A fouryear trial was launched in 2013 under the Atmosphere Protection Plan (PPA) for the Arve Valley (74) in order to renew individual wood-burning installations. Based on this example, the Air-Wood Fund sponsored by ADEME aims to reduce particle emissions from individual wood burning in the PPAs and must be continued, with targeted actions where relevant from an environmental and economic points of view.  Finally, in order to assess the impact of biomass projects properly, polluting emission factors need to be updated to take account of bag filter processing technologies that are under development. Emission values for NOx and dust from district heating plants with a capacity in excess of 20 MW will be updated by CITEPA in the first half of 2018. A review of emission factors for medium- and small-capacity industrial boilers will begin in the middle of the year and must be continued over time.

The renewable thermal production of the heat pump sector amounted to 27.6 TWh in 2017. The renewable share used by heat pumps was 75% in private dwellings, 16% in tertiary and 9% in collective27.      2012  2017  Target in  MEP2016 for  2018  Low target in  MEP2016 for  2023  High target in  MEP2016 for  2023  Aerothermal heat pumps  14.5 TWh  23.5 TWh  21 TWh  27 TWh  30 TWh  Geothermal heat pumps  2.9 TWh  3.14 TWh  4.6 TWh  5.8 TWh  7 TWh  Targets for renewable heat generated from heat pumps set by the MEP adopted in 2016 and the values achieved in 2012 (reference year) and 2017     26 . A distinction is made between aerothermal heat pumps that take heat from the air and transfer it either by radiators (air/water) or by forced air (air/air) and geothermal heat pumps (water/water), which take heat from the ground or from surface water and return it through heated floors or radiators.  27 . Overview of renewable and recovered heat  Autumn 2017   160    The ambitious objectives of the previous MEP exercise for 2018 had already been surpassed in 2016. The overall dynamics of the heat pump sector are indeed stronger than expected. However, the situation differs between aerothermal heat pumps and geothermal heat pumps: there is a huge development in the air/air heat pump market, with a slowdown in the development of air/water heat pumps and a major decline in geothermal heat pumps (-15% sales per year since 2008).  Maximum supply potential  Heat pumps have potential for development, particularly in private dwellings (new and renovated) and in the tertiary sector. The French Heat Pump Association (AFPAC) estimates the maximum potential to be 75 TWh in the residential sector and 40 TWh in the tertiary sector by 2050.  Socioeconomic, industrial and environmental issues  Yield  Heat pumps consume electricity or fuel (gas or fuel oil) to operate. Their performance is described by a coefficient (COP) that expresses the energy returned/energy consumed ratio. The COP for heat pumps is between 3 and 4.5 for heating and between 2.5 and 3 for hot water. Only systems with a COP above 2.5 are taken into account for the achievement of European renewables targets. Geothermal heat pumps have the highest COPs. There is room for improvement in increasing the COPs of heat pumps.   Sector support issues  There has been a direct impact of Government support policies on the development of the sector since 2008. Heat pumps are eligible for the energy transition tax credit, which has been 30% since 2015 (based on eligibility conditions). A lower VAT rate is also applicable to the installation of heat pumps eligible for the CITE. It is important that this support be maintained for the sector.   In the collective, tertiary and industrial sectors, the Heat Fund supports projects for heat pump-assisted geothermal heat production. Since 2018, the Heat Fund has also been financing the most efficient renewable cold production systems, including those using district heating-based geothermal heat pumps. Support for renewable cold via the Heat Fund and the recognition of renewable cold in the Renewable Energy Directive are important challenges for the support of geothermal heat pumps, especially in the tertiary sector.  Heating regulation challenges  Heating regulation requirements for new buildings are having a major impact on the development of the sector (the growth of heat pumps and thermodynamic water heaters in new buildings was boosted by the cumulative effect of RT2012 and CITE). To continue this dynamic, it is essential to set ambitious targets - label at the very least, and by imposing an ambitious renewable heat minimum threshold for all new buildings (private, collective and tertiary)28.  Costs  The full costs of production for air/water heat pumps and geothermal heat pumps in private dwellings ive installations, the full     28 . Self-consumption is deducted from electrical requirements in the case of PV, while renewable energy, because it is consumed on-site, is deducted from requirements.   161    Geothermal heat pumps are a more expensive investment than aerothermal heat pumps, because of the extra cost of the horizontal or vertical heat exchanger (which almost doubles the investment price), but this cost is offset by very low operating costs. There have been significant price drops in recent years (17% for air/air heat pumps and -6% for air/water heat pumps).  The characteristics of the sector in terms of employment  associated with heat pump markets across 20 industrial sites in France. Some 85% of jobs are related to manufacturing, installation and distribution, and the other 15% to maintenance and repair. In 2016, the sector had a ratio of 949 jobs per TWh produced.  The air/water heat pump market is partly supplied by imports from Asia and partly by European production. The geothermal heat pump market is mainly sourced by European production with significant French production, in a market in danger (4,000 jobs are associated with geothermal energy in France, the majority linked to geothermal heat pumps).  Environmental challenges  The most significant impact of heat pumps is linked to the use of refrigerants (risk of leaking) with high global warming potential. Research and development are essentially focused on improving the performance of equipment, replacing refrigerants and reducing noise. An implementing regulation for the European Directive on ecodesign for energy-related products, adopted in 2015, addressed the minimum performance requirements of heat pumps placed on the market, as well as enhanced acoustic requirements in 2017. Finally, the end of life of heat pumps is managed as part of the waste management of electrical and electronic equipment, with priority being given to recycling.  District cooling using geothermal heat pumps for cold production is an alternative to individual air conditioners. Through centralised maintenance, this solution makes it possible to obtain low leakage rates.

This chapter deals only with 90 °C), which involves centralised production the electricity section (see below).  State of play in the sector  There are 79 deep geothermal energy installations in France, of which 49 are located in the Paris basin, 21 in the Aquitaine basin, and the others in Alsace, the Rhone Valley and Limagne. These installations provided a total of 1,970 GWh of renewable thermal generation in 2017. A total of 90% of this production was for district heating, 8% for agriculture and 2% for thermal establishments.  2012  2017  Low target in MEP2016 for 2023  High target in MEP2016 for 2023  1.2 TWh  1.97 TWh  4.6 TWh  6.4 TWh  Targets for renewable heat generated from deep geothermal energy set by the MEP adopted in 2016 and the values achieved in 2012 (reference year) and 2017  The current rate of development of low- and medium-energy geothermal heat production does not match that predicted by the previous MEP exercise. There is indeed a stagnation that could continue, as few projects are in the study phase. The average rate of development was 70 MWth/year between 2010 and 2016, whereas it would be necessary to reach a rate of six to ten times higher to achieve the low-to-high objectives of the previous MEP for 2023. It is therefore important to boost support but also to review the 2023 target downwards, and aim for about six operations a year of 10 MW thermal units between 2018 and 2023 and 11 operations per year of 10 MWth between 2024 and 2028.    Maximum supply potential   163    The use of deep geothermal energy is limited to sufficiently deep and permeable geological formations containing aquifers where the water has been heated deep down in contact with the rocks. One of the challenges facing the sector relates to the development of deep geothermal energy coupled with heat networks in Île-de-France (creation, extension of existing networks and conversion of networks using fossil fuels to geothermal), but also other aquifers less well known than the Dogger aquifer. Other deep aquifers have high potential but their precise resources are unknown; for example, the Trias and Lusitanien aquifers in Île-de-France, aquifers in the Aquitaine Basin, Alsace, Hauts de France and the Provence-Alpes-production is estimated to be 5.8 TWh.

It is estimated that the yield is around 95%. Deep geothermal energy is also a long-term energy: the life of a well is at least 30 years.  Coordination  One of the challenges of geothermal energy is to set up local coordination: the regions where a dedicated geothermal coordinator is in place show a more marked dynamic in terms of development of the sector (e.g. Centre Val de Loire, Hauts de France and Grand Est). In addition, at least one trained coordinator per large region would help to raise awareness among individuals and public or private institutions about the advantages of geothermal energy for the production of heat and/or cold. This action should be promoted by both ADEME and the Regions concerned.  Coverage of geological risks  Geological risk, linked to the discovery of a resource with the appropriate temperature and flow characteristics, hinders the development of projects. Furthermore, investment in the exploration phase is costly, which means that the risk of an insufficient resource must be insured. Accordingly, since the 1980s, the SAF environment Fund29 has covered both the short-term risk (insufficient geothermal resources) and the long-term risk (reduced exploitability of the geothermal resource) for projects aimed  29 . SAF environnement is a subsidiary of the Caisse des Dépôts et des Consignations.   165    at producing heat. The continuation of this mechanism, which has proven effective, must be guaranteed and made scalable (see the next issue on little-known aquifers). Furthermore, the establishment of the GEODEEP Guarantee Fund, with the support of ADEME and the participation of the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations, will make it possible to cover the risk of geological risks in the drilling phase for projects in Metropolitan France producing heat, where the estimated temperature is higher than 120 °C, making it possible to produce electricity and/or heat where the resource is located in less well-known mainland geological contexts. This mechanism is currently being reported to the European Commission and it is important to finalise it to support all deep geothermal projects that will be filed.  The Heat Fund already supports deep geothermal operations (production of doublets or triplets and associated heat networks). A project could be implemented to stimulate operations on insufficiently known aquifers, for example by financing additional exploration activities (3D seismic surveys, etc.) to provide a guarantee for the drilling to be undertaken. A study on this potential development could be conducted in order to determine the exact methods and the necessary allocations, for example in the context of the doubling of the Heat Fund.  Innovation  The sector benefits from French know-how and must maintain its lead in terms of innovation. The development of geothermally sourced cold-/hot-coupled networks is a major challenge. The Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2018/2001 gives a new place to renewable cold production. Furthermore, an amendment to the Mining Code explicitly mentioning cold production using geothermal energy could help to develop this technology.  Since 2018, the Heat Fund has been supporting renewable cold technologies with a high degree of efficiency.  Costs  Low- and medium-temperature thermal energy technology is well developed. While investment costs are high and require major capital input (return period exceeding 10 years, excluding grants), running costs are, by contrast, low, which makes this one of the least costly renewable energies over the long term which in turn provides a guarantee of price stability. According to ADEME, the full cost of sector to ensure better identification of the costs per technology and better characterisation of the life cycle analysis. The potential for innovation exists in most segments of the project value chain (sub-horizontal, multi-shaft drilling, optimisation of the exploitation of reservoirs, materials, etc.). Production costs should therefore remain stable or decrease slightly.   The characteristics of the sector in terms of employment  The low-lling companies (including near-to-surface geothermal energy drilling companies) account for about 2,400 full-time employees and geothermal energy for district heat generation also mobilises full-time grid operators. Professionals are trained and certified, and the French sector has the relevant know-how. In 2016, the sector had a ratio of 1,500 jobs per TWh produced.  Environmental challenges  It is mainly in the exploration phase that certain risks and nuisances can arise, especially during drilling operations (risk of creating connections between several aquifers, lorry traffic, etc.). The existing regulatory context (Mining Code, Water Law) governs the implementation of operations to minimise nuisance.  During the exploration phase, geothermal operations have little or no impact. The main issue thus concerns the possibility of depleting the resource, which could be mitigated by alternating production of  166    hot and cold or by refilling the subsoil (cooling of buildings, summer injection of solar energy or excess residual energy).  A life cycle analysis has been conducted in the past on some exemplary operations (Soultz-sous-Forêt, Bouillante). It would be interesting to carry out a life cycle analysis on an operation typical of the Paris basin.

The installed floor area in the residential sector represents 54% of the total area, with 43% in the tertiary sector and 3.5% in industry and agriculture.  Solar thermal technology is used exclusively for the production of domestic hot water (from a single solar water heater or a shared domestic hot water system) or for the joint production of hot water and heating (combined solar system).   2012  2017  Low target in MEP2016 for 2023  High target in MEP2016 for 2023  1 TWh  1.18 TWh  3.1 TWh  4.6 TWh  Targets for renewable heat generated from solar thermal energy set by the MEP adopted in 2016 and the values achieved in 2012 (reference year) and 2017  The previous MEP provided for the revitalisation of solar thermal energy through large-scale applications in collective and industry heating and in district heating, and prospects in the private residential and collective sectors in the event of an enhancement in the heating regulations governing the generation of renewable heat. The final consumption of heat from solar thermal was based on an average rate of 100,000 m² installed per year in private dwellings and about 200,000 m² installed per  167    year in the collective/tertiary sector. In 2015, fewer than 100,000 m² were installed across all sectors, so the rate was three times lower. For 2023, the MEP targets need a five- to nine-fold increase in the m² of thermal surface area to be installed per year on average over the 20162023 period compared to 2015. There were some encouraging signs in 2017, such as a halt to the decline of solar in collective applications and growth in the combined solar segment (fewer than 500 installations per year). In 2017, the production of solar thermal energy increased +3.7% compared to 2016.  Maximum supply potential  France has particularly good solar resources, ranking fifth in Europe. The maximum potential of solar thermal energy is estimated as 6 TWh (by 2050).  Socioeconomic, industrial and environmental issues  Yield  The energy yield varies depending on the climatic zone in which the solar equipment is installed:   the productivity of individual facilities is around 300 kWh/m²/year in the north of France and 500 kWh/m²/year in the south;   the productivity of collective or district facilities is around 450 kWh/m²/year in the north of France and 600 kWh/m²/year in the south;   the productivity of industrial facilities in the south of France is around 700 kWh/m²/year. These are used as an additional resource and can provide 30% of the heating demand of a manufacturer.  The seasonal energy efficiency of combined solar systems is at least equal to 90%. Energy efficiency for water heating varies between 65% and 85%, depending on the extraction profile. In terms of meeting demand:   solar water heaters provide 50%60% of domestic hot water (DHW) needs;   combined solar systems provide 30% of cumulative DHW + heating requirements, distributed 60%70% for DHW versus 15%25% for heating;   collective and tertiary solar water heaters provide 50% of hot water requirements.   Heating regulation challenges  Following a period of marked growth until 2008, it is the domestic solar market in particular that has seen the sharpest decline. Despite the requirement for at least 5 kWh/m² of renewable energy in new private dwellings, solar thermal energy is struggling to develop because it competes with other renewable equipment with lower installation costs and which also meet the RT2012 thermal regulation criteria. Enhancing these criteria would make it possible to use more efficient solar equipment.  As the markets for new collective or tertiary buildings are not under an obligation to include renewable energies, they are not developing in this market. The Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2018/2001 provides for a minimum level of renewable energies in all new and heavily renovated buildings, including in the collective and tertiary sector (in addition to private dwellings). The installation of solar thermal energy in new builds and in renovations would represent an efficient response to this new requirement. The modernisation of the RT2012 calculation engine is currently being considered in order to upgrade energy regulation, coordination and storage systems, and would be favourable to the development of the sector. Finally, an obligation to study the solar thermal solution in new operations was successfully launched in Brittany by the Brest conurbation and could be duplicated in other regions.   168    In renovation, solar thermal installations are eligible for the CITE (energy transition tax credit). A CITE credit differentiated according to technology would make it possible to promote the performance of solar solutions.  The dissemination of combined solar systems is also supported as part of the boost provided by the ertain operations undertaken between 1 April 2018 and 31 December 2020, for energy-poor households replacing oil-fired boilers with equipment using renewable energies (biomass boiler, air/water, water/water or hybrid heat pumps, combined solar system, connection to a district heating network).  Potential of solar energy on the grid and in industry  An opportunity for the development of solar thermal energy in industry and on district heating and cooling is there for the taking. The Heat Fund would enable support for solar energy in these sectors. projects on new emerging technologies and must continue. In industry, new business models are developing, such as sale by kWh or leasing, which make it possible to offer competitive deals compared to gas (including the cost of storage). Finally, studying the replacement of energy in favour of a renewable solution in energy audits would also make it possible to raise awareness about solar alternatives and their benefits.  n the collective sector (including on the grid), the tertiary sector and in industry, where large surface areas can be deployed, thus lowering costs. The sector believes that it has the immediate capacity to manufacture and install three to four times more solar thermal equipment than it does today. The sector today is mostly export-based.  Current and foreseeable costs  The full cost of producing solar heat in private dwellings is higher than the cost of thermodynamic water heaters. For combined solar syst30. The cost of heat in the -grid solar energy also % reduction in the overall 20-year cost by 2025 for solar water heaters and for combined solar systems. Lower costs are also expected for solar energy in industry.  The characteristics of the sector in terms of employment  The solar thermal market (Metropo2017 and generated 2,320 jobs31. In 2017, the sector had a ratio of 1,160 jobs per TWh produced. The decline in solar energy led to a fall in solar thermal jobs (-34% jobs between 2013 and 2017).  The jobs are mostly located in the manufacturing, installation and maintenance of equipment. The manufacture of equipment in France today is mostly geared towards exports (85% of activity in 2015). Most installers of solar thermal collectors are grouped under the Qualisol label, which has made it possible to increase the reliability of the installations. Finally, the collective sector is brought together within SOCOL32, which has developed qualifications for design offices and installers, to bring stakeholders together and disseminate best practices. SOCOL covers nearly 1,000 experts, professionals and project owners.  Environmental challenges  Solar thermal energy is low in CO2 emissions, at around 35 gCO2/kWh (solar water heaters). The most significant impact is therefore related to the electric or gas/oil auxiliary (coverage rate of 50%). Finally,  30  31  32 .

When this waste heat is recovered and used, the process is called heat recovery. There are many sources of recovered heat: waste heat at industrial sites, tertiary buildings (data centres, waste water plants, etc.), energy recovery units for domestic waste known as WTE (Waste-to-Energy) units (in terms of their non-renewable part34) or heat from waste processing sites (SRF, heat treatment of slurry, etc.). The Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth sets a target of a five-fold increase in the amount of renewable and recovered heat and cold delivered by the grids by 2030 (baseline 2012). Recovered heat, whether recovered locally on-site for self-consumption or in response to local needs via a district heating system, contributes to these objectives.  The quantity of recovered industrial heat currently used by district heating is estimated as 445 GWh35. The amount of heat recovered from waste energy recovery units and delivered is 4 TWh36.      Maximum supply potential   33 . The heat produced by cogeneration, for the purpose of the simultaneous generation of heat and electricity, is not considered to be recovered heat (Official Gazette No 32, 8 March 2007, on the conditions governing the application of the reduced VAT rate on calorific energy delivered).  34 . By convention, it is considered that 50% of the energy generated by domestic waste energy recovery units is renewable and 50% is recovered heat.  35 . Source: annual survey of heat networks, 2017, SNCU.  36 . For more details on the evaluation of the heat generated from waste energy recovery, see Section 5.5.  Figure 30: Final consumption of heat produced by solar thermal energy (TWh)    170    The technical potential of industrial waste heat at more than 30 °C is estimated to be 109 TWh,37 while the national waste heat resource from domestic waste treatment units (excluding optimisation of existing units), waste water treatment plants and data centres is 8.4 TWh. Considering the portion that can be recovered outside that resource, the amount of waste heat at more than 60 °C available near existing district heating networks is quantified as 12.3 TWh, including 56 sites near an existing district heating system, which total 9 TWh. Considering the decline in energy consumption in industry by 2035, we can estimate a maximum recoverable potential in the grids of 7.7 TWh. The maximum potential of domestic waste energy recovery units following optimisation or modification of existing units is estimated as 10 TWh of additional heat compared to 2009, of which 6 TWh could supply district heating and cooling (for an equivalent amount of waste burned). This represents total potential of 9 to 10.5 TWh in heat delivered by district heating and cooling from energy recovery units. Finally, solid recovered fuels could also contribute up to 1.7 TWh to the development of heat recovery in district heating and cooling systems.   There is also potential for heat recovery from waste water. The resources in Île de France have been estimated as 2 TWh, of which 1.1 TWh is recoverable. An estimate of the potential of each region could be developed as part of the SRADDET. ADEME could also assess this potential when updating its study on waste heat.  Socioeconomic, industrial and environmental issues  The challenges of industrial heat recovery mainly concern contracting capacity between industrial plants, or between an industrial plant and a district heating system (public or private). Issues relating to the duration of commitment, and more generally of economic returns, can also hinder projects. A study of the financing of ongoing industrial recovery investments will identify the obstacles to the development of projects, as well as the levers for action to be implemented (financial, regulatory, fiscal, etc.)38. The Heat Fund has been supporting waste heat recovery projects since 2015. This progress must be continued by targeting a specific action on the 50 or so sites identified near an existing network. Since 2015, classified facilities for environmental protection over 20 MW with non-recovered waste heat must39 conduct a cost-benefit analysis on the appropriateness of recovering this heat in a district heating system. Similarly, any new or substantially overhauled energy production installation connected to a district heating system must prioritise a study on the possibility of recovering waste heat from sites near the system. This study, where it is legally required, is now one of the listed documents that must be provided with any Heat Fund grant application. The specific issues of waste energy recovery (including WTE units, SRF, etc.) are discussed below.    The recovery of waste heat by an industrial plant is part of the process of supplying cheap energy in a given territory, which enhances the attractiveness of the area and helps sustain industrial activity. Dialogue, the sharing of services and the creation of energy infrastructures in areas where heat-intensive industries are grouped could promote energy exchanges between stakeholders (communities, companies, etc.), with clear communication about the expected benefits in terms of economics and environment, even if the priorities, strategies and objectives of these stakeholders differ.

Study conducted by ADEME in 2018.  39 . This relates to new installations or those being substantially overhauled. A substantial overhaul means a renovation where the cost exceeds 50% of the cost of a comparable new unit.   171    The environmental challenges associated with waste heat recovery are positive because this process enables a reduction in energy consumption by capturing unused thermal energy.     Energy recovery from waste  Waste use for energy production purposes contributes to the circular economy when it uses waste that could not have been avoided or recovered in the form of materials. The LTECV sets two principles for energy recovery from waste: the management of treatment near the source and the search for efficient waste energy recovery processes. In 2016, energy recovery from waste accounted for the following:   3.3 TWh produced by biogas from non-hazardous waste landfills (ISDND);   9.4 TWh produced by domestic waste incineration plants (DWIP);   5.5 TWh produced by biogas from anaerobic digestion.  Plants for the co-incineration of waste40 also produce several TWh of energy recovered from waste.    Recoverable waste resources  The circular economy policy initiated by the LTECV should radically change the situation in respect of energy recovery from waste. Waste flows will be redirected on a large scale. By 2025:   9.8 Mt fewer wastes will be landfilled in ISDND, in particular biowaste, i.e. waste that produces biogas. This trend will lead to a 25% reduction in biogas production in ISDND, and thus a fall of 2.5 TWh.   DWIP will receive 2.9 Mt less domestic waste (LHV42 2,300 kWh/t) and an extra 1.5 Mt of recycling rejects (LHV 2,800 kWh/t). This should lead to an approximately 2.5 TWh reduction in energy production.     8 Mt of biowaste should be collected separately and recovered. Half (4 Mt) will be used through methanation, which should generate an extra 2.8 TWh energy reduction.   2.4 Mt of high calorific recycling rejects (LHV 3,500 kWh/t) will be turned into solid recovered fuel and should be able to generate 8.4 TWh of energy.  Some of the above waste for energy recovery could be subject to thermal treatment such as: pyrogasification. These processes are still under development in France and it is currently not possible to determine the amount of waste that will be recovered through these methods.  In terms of diversion of biowaste from landfills, the European Commission communication of 26 January 2017 declares that biogas recovery from ISDND may no longer constitute a target in and of itself. For that reason, the existing injection support mechanism for electricity generation will be continued to completion but will not be extended beyond that point. It will provide extra capacity of 60 MW of new facilities, by 2023 at the latest. Support mechanisms should take into account the decrease in available resources and support the sectors concerned.  Socioeconomic, industrial and environmental issues   40 Facility for which the main purpose is to produce energy or material products and which uses waste as regular fuel or secondary fuel or in which a thermal process is used for waste disposal. 42 Lower Heating Value.   172    Domestic waste incineration plants  A total of 126 domestic waste incineration plants are installed in France. In 2015, the 113 installations equipped with energy recovery systems produced 2.3 TWh of electricity and 7.1 TWh of heat. The composition of French incineration plants is as follows:   52 units accounting for 56% of incinerated waste are considered to be energy recovery units (> R1);   64 units accounting for 42% of incinerated waste are considered to be recovery units (R1 < 0.6 or 0.65);   10 small units accounting for 2% of incinerated waste are considered to be waste disposal facilities (no recovery). According to an inventory undertaken in 2019, 6 of these 10 facilities have already closed and the remaining facilities will continue to operate with an objective of improving their energy performance.  The stock of facilities is made up of a large number of very small, quite old units that underwent major upgrading to ensure standards maintenance between 2000 and 2005.  These facilities are adapting continuously, and the recovery of residual energy from incineration is expected to develop and become widespread. Only a small number of facilities will be built in the coming years. It is also crucial to encourage the optimisation of existing units. This could entail possible support for optimisation operations from the Heat Fund and the Waste Fund. ADEME monitors optimisation work on these units and raises awareness among local authorities about the benefits of optimal energy recovery by their facilities (economic, taxation, environmental, local development and employment impacts, etc.).   In 2017, 14 DWIP exceeded the 65% energy recovery threshold thanks to grants from ADEME, and 742,964 MWh/year of additional energy was recovered. Eight other DWIP facilities are expected to exceed the R1 threshold in 2020 threpresenting an additional energy recovery of 421,070 MWh/year.  A BREF41 is currently being developed, and this will make energy performance schemes mandatory42. This optimisation could result in additional heat generation of between 7 and 10 TWh, including 60% (4 to 6 TWh) intended for district heating and cooling networks. It would be appropriate to maintain the grants paid through the Waste Fund (and through the Heat Fund for heat recovery networks).   In 2028, heat production from DWIP is expected to be between 15 and 18 TWh and electricity generation should account for 2.3 TWh.  Facilities producing energy by burning solid recovered fuel (SRF)  In 2017, 800 kt of solid recovered fuel (SRF) was produced in France: 100 kt was exported, 300 kt was consumed by the cement sector, 200 kt was used by facilities supported as part of the ADEME call for SRF projects and 200 kt did not find an outlet. By 2025, annual SRF resources are expected to amount to 2.5 Mt, including 1 Mt for coincineration in cement factories. A total of 1.4 Mt (around 4.9 TWh) could therefore be used in SRF energy recovery units. This flow is, however, expected to decrease over time because of the efficiency of prevention and material-recovery improvement policies.  Waste energy production outputs range between 25% and 40% for power generation, depending on the technologies used, between 45% and 55% for heat production through cogeneration and around 90% for pure heat generation. Priority will therefore be given to heat generation.   41 . BREF; Best Available Techniques Reference.  42 . The decree on the regional waste prevention and management plan in accordance with the NOTRe Law provides for an improvement in energy efficiency of waste energy recovery units by limiting the portion of waste of the quantities incinerated in 2010 by 2025.   173    The SRF resource without any identified outlet therefore has potential of 200 kt in 2018, increasing by approximately 150 kt each year until 2025. Some 260 kt of SRF (+150 in Réunion) will be consumed in a facility receiving a regional ADEME grant for an annual volume of 120 MW LHV. The support cost -year period in the form of investment grants.  The Waste Fund finances heat generation in Metropolitan France using SRF (100% SRF) through the call for SRF projects. For its part, the Heat Fund finances district heating systems, enabling the recovery of energy produced from SRF as recovered energy, in accordance with the LTECV target of a five-fold increase of the amount of renewable heat and cold and recovery in those networks by 2030. The reduced VAT rate of 5.5% is also applicable to networks that use more than 50% renewable and recovered energy, including waste.   Biofuel and biogas production  The inputs that can be used in a methaniser primarily include livestock effluents, agricultural biomass (energy crops, agricultural residues, etc.), by-products from agrifood industries, household and professional biowaste (food waste, vegetable waste), sewage slurry (urban and industrial) or other recoverable organic waste from sanitation. Some of these inputs, such as fats, can also be used for the production of biofuels. Others are by-products from agrifood industries, for which it is important not to create imbalances with existing recoveries.   The anaerobic digestion sector is described in the section on biogas.  Overall food waste resources (biowaste excluding green waste) are estimated as 8 Mt, half of which could be used for anaerobic digestion after source separation, thus an amount of 4 Mt/year by 2025. In addition to food waste, the collection of all professional biowaste accounts for approximately 2 Mt of food waste, with the bulk of current mobilised resources being used for anaerobic digestion, and therefore an additional 1 Mt of waste. This stock of 5 Mt of methanated waste could generate 3.5 TWh of primary energy.  Wood waste  End-of-life wood resources are also taken into account (see identification in Section 4.4), in addition to the quota that could be used as SRF.   Environmental challenges  All waste treatment plants are subject to the ICPE regulation43 and are governed by a strict framework to assess their impacts and pollutants.  The objective is not to maximise energy production from waste but to maximise energy recovery of waste that could not be avoided and that is not recoverable as materials. Waste energy recovery should neither reduce waste prevention measures nor capture waste flows that could have been recovered as materials. Waste energy recovery is undertaken in accordance with the European Commission -to- In total, 16.8 TWh of heat should be generated by thermal waste recovery facilities and 3.5 TWh used by the cement industry, and 2.3 TWh of electricity should be generated.  Of the 16.8 TWh of heat, half the heat generated by DWIP is considered to be renewable and counted in the biomass target. The other half is considered to be recovered energy. This contributes between 4.5 and 5.2 TWh to the renewable and recovered energy integration target. Of the 4.9 TWh of heat generated through SRF, it is estimated that around 2 TWh could be recovered by district heating networks and be counted as recovered energy.   43 . Establishments classified for environmental protection.   174        General prospects for renewable heat and cold  The following table shows the energy sources that will meet the heat requirement within the period covered by the MEP.    2023  2028, Scenario A  2028, Scenario B  Fossil fuels (fuel oil, coal, natural gas)  390  314  290  Electricity  99  95  88  Biogas (including injected biogas)  7  12  18  Wood  145  157  169  Renewable heat excluding biomass  Heat  pumps  (aerothermal  and  geothermal)  39  44  52     Geothermal  3  4  5  Solar thermal  2  2  3  Recovered energies  4.4  7.6  9.9  Total heat production  690  635  635  Heat mix that the MEP will make it possible to achieve for 2023 and 2028  In 2023, the MEP should make it possible to meet heat needs with 196 TWh of heat from renewable sources, i.e. 28% of final heat consumption.  In 2028, the MEP should make it possible to meet heat needs with 219 and 247 TWh of heat from renewable sources, i.e. 34.3% and 38.9% of final heat consumption. According to the target set by the LTECV, 38% of final heat consumption in 2030 must be provided by renewable energies.  This progression will be achieved through an average rate of increase in renewables and heat recovery of between 1.2 points and 1.8 points annually between 2020 and 2030, where the Renewable Energy Directive requires minimum growth of 1.3 points annually starting from 2020.  It should be noted that if x% of biogas is injected into the grid, x% of gas consumed to produce heat through the network is considered to be renewable.  It should also be noted that electricity from renewable sources is not accounted for here because the European methodology considers that, because specific goals have been set for renewable electricity, it should not be accounted for twice. Only targets that are not tracked by energy vector monitoring are monitored here.

Final consumption of liquid fuels is expected to be around 406 TWh in 2023 and 348 TWh in 2028.  In 2015, Directive 2015/1513/EU, on indirect land-use change (ILUC)47 confirmed a target set previously by the renewable energy directives48 of 10% renewable energies in transport in 2020, with a ceiling value of 7% for biofuels in competition with food crops, and an indicative target of 0.5% in 2020 for advanced biofuels. It establishes a list of raw materials that enable the develop of advanced biofuels. The LTECV adopted a more ambitious target of 15% renewable energies in final fuel consumption by 2030. To meet this target, it will be necessary to increase the rate of incorporation of biofuels and to ensure greater development of alternative fuels with lower carbon emissions than traditional fossil fuels. A new Renewable Energy Directive, referred to as RED II, was published on 21 December 2018. It sets a renewable energy target of 14% in transport by 2030, confirming the 7% ceiling for first-generation biofuels. It also reiterates and reinforces the sustainability criteria defined in the first Renewable Energy Directive, and aims to limit the effect of indirect land-use change by identifying the raw materials most at risk, capping their incorporation into biofuels and then gradually eliminating them by 2030. State of play in the sector  In France, conventional biofuels (produced from food-related materials) represent 7% of fuel energy. Biofuels are included in liquid fuels to the extent authorised by European regulations.   -generation fuels produced from wastes and residues and defined in Annex IX-A to Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of  177    energy from renewable sources (known as the RED II Directive). The first MEP set targets for the incorporation of advanced biofuels (from waste, residues or lignocellulosic material) with the assumption that molasses, C starch and acid residues of edible oils would be considered as advanced biofuels. However, these three substances have not been included in the list of raw materials that enable the production of advanced biofuels under the RED II classification.                                                               47.

In other words, they do not include biofuels produced from raw materials listed in Annex IX-A to the Directive. The figures in this MEP are therefore lower than those shown in the 2016 version, since their scope has been revised.  Box 5: Aeronautical biofuels  Air transport will need to roll out innovative and sustainable aeronautical biofuels in line with the continuous progress of technologies, operational improvements and market measures such as CORSIA, to meet the climate change challenge and reduce its carbon footprint. These biofuels are a strategic lever for reducing net emissions in a growing sector that has a limited choice of energy alternatives. Bio-based fuels, which can originate in the circular economy, would make it possible to reduce up to 90% of carbon emissions over the entire life cycle.   Considerable progress has been made in recent years, in particular in terms of the performance and certification of aeronautical biofuels. The operational use of aeronautical biofuels is now controlled. The roadmap produced by ANCRE (the National Alliance for the Coordination of Energy Research) has assessed the potential of the French production pathways for aeronautical biofuels. In global terms, five aeronautical biofuels sectors have been certified by the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) and have been identified as possible renewable and sustainable alternatives to aeronautical fossil fuels. Certain biofuels can be incorporated up to 50% into the volume of fossil fuel, thus representing significant emission reductions. Other innovative sectors are being studied, with different degrees of feasibility and variable timelines for certification, confirming the richness of the available technological potential. Certified technologies for the production of aeronautical biofuels make it possible to manufacture molecules that are very similar to those present in kerosene and totally  2016    2018    2023    178    compatible. The use of these biofuels does not require any adaptation of the aircraft or airport infrastructures.  To promote the emergence of a French aeronautical biofuels sector, the Government, Air France, feasibility of implementing a French production and distribution pathway for sustainable aeronautical biofuels. The conclusions of that study are expected in late 2019.    Description of current resources  The production of second-generation biofuels involves the use of materials that do not compete with the production of food products.   Inputs that may be used include agricultural residues, household, municipal or industrial waste, plant waste and residues, straw, manure and sewage slurry, livestock effluents, algae, waste and residues from silviculture, pulp residues, wood, and renewable fuels of non-organic origin.  Some materials are used in already mature industrial processes. Others, such as lignocellulose plants, are used for the development of new industrial processes:    the thermochemical method makes it possible to obtain synthetic biodiesel: also known as BtL (Biomass to Liquid);   the biochemical method provides ethanol.   These new sectors have more favourable energy balances than those of the first generation and make it possible to limit the problems of land use and competition with food outlets.    Some of these inputs, such as household waste or sewage slurry, offer resources that can be used either for the production of biofuels or for the production of biomethane. Others are by-products from industries for which it is important not to create imbalances with existing recoveries. The potential of materials is sufficient to achieve the objectives of advanced biofuel production.  The main challenges for the development of the sector are organising input mobilisation, supply logistics towards processing plants, and the cost of creating industrial processing units.   Socioeconomic, industrial and environmental issues  The biofuel production sector is currently structured around first-generation fuels. By using 80% of ethanol production in fuel, it contributes to the economic profitability of the sugar sector in France (8,900 jobs49). In the diesel sector, it also provides the recovery of 1.4 million tonnes of French rapeseed oil50. The second-generation biofuel production chain is still emerging, and the costs and employment content are as yet unknown.  Environmental challenges  To be counted as renewable energy in fuels, biofuels must meet sustainability criteria (related to the preservation of the quality of cultivated land, GHG emissions, etc.). This tightly controlled system is the production. This is why the quantities of first-generation fuels produced will be stabilised, but will not be increased.  The following table shows the energy sources that will make it possible to meet liquid fuel needs within the period covered by the MEP when the measures laid down in this MEP will be adopted.     2023  2028   179    Petrol  Fossil  84  79  1G Renewable  6  6  2G Renewable  2  3  Diesel  Fossil  294  233  1G Renewable  22  18  2G Renewable  3  8  TOTAL   412  347                                                            55. Source: SNPAA  50. Source: sustainability declarations    Liquid fuel mix that the MEP will make it possible to achieve in 2023 and 2028 (TWh).   Second-generation renewable fuels include advanced biofuels, as well as biofuels from used oil and animal fat, listed in Annex IX-B to Directive (EU) 2018/2001.  In 2023, the MEP should make it possible to meet liquid fuel needs with 33 TWh of fuels from renewable sources, i.e. 9% of final fuel consumption.  In 2028, the MEP should make it possible to meet liquid fuel needs with 35 TWh of fuels from renewable sources, i.e. 11 % of final fuel consumption.   According to the target set by the LTECV, 15% of final energy consumption used in transport in 2030 must be provided by renewable energies.    4.2.2.3. Renewable gas  In 2018, natural gas consumption was 470 TWh HHV. Measures to control energy demand are expected to reduce gas consumption to 439 TWh HHV in 2023 and 377 TWh HHV in 2028.  The law has set a target of increasing the share of renewable energies to 10% of gas consumption in 2030. There are essentially three technologies that could be used to meet this target, namely anaerobic digestion, gasification and the conversion of renewable electricity into synthesis gas.  Renewable gas production targets  At the end of 2018, there were nearly 650 planned biomethane production facilities with a cumulative production potential of 14 TWh per year. Given this large number of projects, some stakeholders are  180    asking for a renewable gas production target that goes beyond the target of 10% in 2030, as set by Article L. 100-4 of the Energy Code.  The cost of producing biomethane is significantly higher than natural gas. In 2018, the average purchase price of injectprospects expected for cost reductions mean it is not possible to imagine the development of the sector without public support over the MEP period.   The production costs for gasification of organic matter for injection into natural gas networks are estimated as being higher than biomethane production costs.  To control public expenditure allocated to support renewable gas, the MEP sets targets to 2028 that are consistent with a share of 7% to 10% of total gas consumption in 2030, while linking support to efforts to be made by the various sectors to decrease production costs.  Anaerobic digestion  State of play in the sector  Anaerobic digestion is the decomposition of organic matter by micro-organisms into biogas, consisting mainly of methane and carbon dioxide. This biogas can then be recovered in various ways. It can be purified to obtain a gas with thermodynamic properties equivalent to natural gas, which means that it can be injected into gas network grids or conditioned as a fuel for gas vehicles (bioNGV). Biogas can also be used directly as a fuel. Finally, it can be used to produce electricity in cogeneration installations, but this use is not preferred because of its lower energy yield.       2017  Target in MEP2016 for  2023  Biogas injected into grids (TWh)  0.4 TWh  8 TWh  Biogas used to generate electricity45  1.9 TWh of electricity,  (5.5 TWh of biogas)  2.6 TWh of electricity,  (7.3 TWh of biogas)  Total biogas consumed (direct use or injected in heat grids, excluding bioNGV)  5.9 TWh  15.3 TWh   Targets set by the MEP adopted in 2016 for the consumption of biomethane   As at 31 December 2018, 635 facilities were generating electricity from biogas, for a total capacity of 456 MW. Electricity generation from biogas was 2.1 TWh in 2017, using 6 TWh of biogas.  A total of 76 facilities inject biomethane into the natural gas grids, after production and purification of biogas, for a total production capacity of 1.2 TWh per year.  The production of biomethane directly recovered as fuel remains marginal. It is important to develop the use of biogas in transport, out of the network when necessary.  Maximum potential of anaerobic digestion  Anaerobic digestion involves the use of organic matter that can easily be broken down by microorganisms. To reconcile the development of anaerobic digestion and compliance with land use  45 . Energy equivalence of the target in capacities.   181    criteria, France has chosen to develop anaerobic digestion based on the use of wastes or residues. Article D. 543292 of the Environment Code therefore provides that a methaniser cannot use more than 15% of food or energy crops, grown as a main crop.  The inputs that can be used in a methaniser include livestock effluents, agricultural residues, by-products from agrifood industries, domestic biowaste, vegetable waste, and sewage slurry such as fats, constituting a resource that can be used for the production of both biofuels and biomethane. Others are by-products from agrifood industries, for which it is important not to create imbalances with existing recoveries. The use of agricultural waste must incorporate a balance between the production of biogas and the return of carbon to the soil.  The availability of methanisable materials by 2035 is estimated as 100 Mt by ADEME, i.e. 50 Mt of livestock effluents, 46 Mt of vegetable matter and 3 Mt of domestic waste, for a total of 70 TWh of primary energy.  Socioeconomic, industrial and environmental issues  The energy yield of an anaerobic digestion plant depends primarily on the recovery technique used to generate the biogas. For recovery by injection into natural gas networks, the energy yield of an anaerobic digestion plant is estimated as 94%, taking account of the heating needs of the methaniser. For recovery by electricity generation, the electrical yield is about 35%.    This energy yield gap explains why alternative recoveries to electricity production are prioritised, and particularly injection into gas grids, where this is possible.  Natural gas grids have been designed to transport natural gas from a few import points to a large number of consumers throughout France. The development of biomethane injection could require the grid to be reinforced in order to facilitate the injection of sources distributed throughout the country towards the arteries of the network.  The anaerobic digestion sector needs to advance in terms of acceptability. This will include good practices in terms of dialogue that must be assimilated by project leaders. Acceptability must be monitored constantly, so that it does not become a hindrance to the development of the sector.  In 2016, the biogas sector employed 2,110 direct FTEs46. The employment ratio of the biogas sector is therefore 389 FTE/TWh. Equipment is mainly imported.  Current and foreseeable costs  The cost of generating biomethane injected into a natural gas grid following purification is about  With the development of anaerobic digestion, a reduction in plant costs is expected due to a series effect on the equipment and the development of supply for maintenance-servicing operations. Technical progress could also be observed for the purification of biogas. The project costs could reach an average HHV by 2028.  Environmental challenges   46   182    Anaerobic digestion is based on the use of wastes and residues, so it does not have any particular impact in terms of land use. Potential conflicts of use relating to the inputs of anaerobic digestion plants will continue to be monitored.  Hydrogen and power-to-gas  Hydrogen  French solutions must be ready for deployment in Metropolitan France by 20302040, and they must be set up so that they participate in the development of a competitive sector. This involves improving electrolysis and mass storage technologies, as a complement to developing other uses, particularly for mobility. By 2035, plans will be in place to prepare for the development and integration of the technology for converting electricity from renewable sources into gas by producing suitably sized demonstrators. Today there are four demonstrators in France, including one under construction, and the objective is to increase their number so as to gradually change scale, while developing a French industrial sector.  Some isolated areas already need flexibility and renewable energy storage capacity to decarbonise their energy production without destabilising their electrical systems. Non-interconnected zones could therefore represent useful spaces for trials or indeed pilot deployments, benefiting from a more advantageous regulatory framework.  The drastically lower costs of electrolysis systems now make it possible to envisage different markets, as discussed below. The cost of producing hydrogen through electrolysis depends on the technology used, the length of use and above all the price of electricity. For instance, alkaline electrolysers can development of these technologies, hydrogen produced by electrolysis could cost anywhere between  Industrial hydrogen  The current global hydrogen market is essentially an industrial market: hydrogen is a product used in the oil and chemical industries. On a global scale, the industrial hydrogen market is estimated today as 60 Mt. In France, it stands at about 1 Mt.  In 2018, the cost price of hydrogen produced in large quantities from fossil products (gas steam volumes (refineries). For some less intensive uses that are sufficiently stable (glass, agrifoods, metallurgy, electronics) and for which hydrogen is transported and delivered by lorry  known as   directly on site by electrolysis.  A balance will need to be found between diffuse uses, for which the current price is higher but which involve more complex industrial processes (non-uniform configurations, which can raise costs) and more mass uses, where the price of current technologies is higher, but which enable the rapid deployment of electrolysers in series, and thus increasing power.  Hydrogen for mobility  Hydrogen in mobility is complementary to batteries and bioNGV. It offers key advantages for intensive uses requiring long battery life and short recharging times, especially in urban areas where measures are taken to reduce pollution and noise. Many projects are already emerging across the country around fleets ses, trucks, trains, etc.).   183    Due to a still limited volume effect, the total cost of ownership of a hydrogen vehicle remains higher than their fossil fuel equivalents (20% to 50%). However, with start-up support, it would be possible to cover the extra cost of fuel-cell vehicles and to refuel vehicles at an equivalent cost to that of the energy for a diesel vehicle. By 2030, in particular as a result of the progress expected in terms of the cost of electrolysis, the decarbonised hydrogen distributed at service stations should be priced at a level (<  These advantages are found mainly in certain heavy transport modes (road, rail and river), for which the weight, bulk and embedded energy of batteries are still prohibitive. These heavy transport modes are a major lever for quickly ensuring high volumes of hydrogen, and generating an autonomous ecosystem by economies of scale through the faster deployment of large stations. This is a key point in the economic model of recharging stations.  To develop mobility from hydrogen, the goal is:   to encourage the development of a range of heavy vehicles, not only on the road but also in other modes (boats, trains, aircraft);   to pursue a regional fleets approach. In this respect, the role of local authorities in aggregating uses within regional projects is key. Other uses may also be considered in these regional projects (e.g. bridging between industry and mobility).  Hydrogen for storage  As an energy vector, the hydrogen produced by electrolysis is a long-term structural solution for the integration of renewable energies into the electrical system: compared with other storage solutions such as batteries, hydrogen is currently the most promising interseasonal large-scale storage medium for intermittent electrical renewables. It can also be used as a storage vector, either by direct injection into the gas grid or by methanation (production of synthetic methane).  Compared with other storage solutions such as batteries, hydrogen is currently the most promising interseasonal passive storage medium (see the section on storage). Electrolysers are also capable of providing other services to the electrical grid, like other storage technologies or other means of flexibility (demand management, development of interconnectors).  A study conducted by RTE in 2019 on the challenges for the electrical grid related to developing hydrogen production through electrolysis highlights the benefits of hydrogen over the long term. The production of hydrogen by electrolysing water from decarbonised electricity leads to a significant reduction in national and European CO2 emissions. However, there is a certain level of variability depending on the scope and scenarios. Still, according to RTE, the value that electrolysers can add to the grid by 2035 will still remain relatively limited, and grid linking will not be necessary within that time frame.  Power-to-gas  -to-electrolysis. The hydrogen produced can be decarbonised provided that the electricity used to produce it is itself decarbonised. Under these conditions, hydrogen is compatible with the targets that France has set for renewable energy development, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants.  Hydrogen produced via electrolysis can also be transformed into synthetic methane following a recombination of hydrogen with CO2  this is known as methanation.  The conversion of renewable electricity into gas is generally mentioned in situations where the generation of renewable electricity would be surplus to consumption, in order to enable the recovery of the surplus electricity generated. These situations are not expected in France on a large scale before 2035, according to the energy scenario considered.   184    The resulting gas can be used directly or injected into existing gas grids. While it seems possible to inject small quantities of hydrogen directly into the gas grids (see current demonstrators), beyond a certain percentage  which still needs to be determined with precision  issues of technical compatibility and/or grid safety could arise (compatibility of materials, burner settings using gas, measurement of quantities delivered, etc.).  The use of power-to-gas is mentioned in connection with the variable production of renewable electricity such as solar or wind (which makes it possible to obtain hydrogen from renewable sources) and in particular in situations where the generation of renewable electricity would be surplus to consumption, thus enabling the recovery of the surplus electricity generated. Power-to-gas is a seasonal storage solution that supports power grids. Based on existing technologies, it is even the only way to store electricity over very long periods. The advantage of power-to-gas architectures lies both in the synergy created between the electricity and gas grids and in the multiple uses of hydrogen and synthetic methane.  However, as mentioned above, the need to implement power-to-gas on a large scale is unlikely to arise in France before 2035.  All energy system stakeholders therefore still need an industrial scale experimentation framework. At the same time, R&D efforts are also needed in less mature electrolysis technologies.  Recovery gas produced through gasification  State of play in the sector  The gasification of solid recovered fuels (SRF), as well as the co-incineration of gas from gasification for the production of heat and electricity, are among the energy recovery processes identified as some of the most effective by the European Commission. As for the gasification of organic matter, the synthesis gas from the gasification of SRF can be used, depending on its level of purity, to produce heat or for conversion into methane for injection into the natural gas grids.  Additional studies need to be undertaken to specify the energy yield of SRF gasification, to specify the maximum supply potential, and to identify the risk of cannibalising the waste resources used by other sectors. These studies will also focus on the environmental impacts of this sector, particularly in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.  Total prospective gas  Gas consumption is characterised by significant seasonality: the differential for gas consumption between the winter peak and the summer off-peak is a factor of around 10. In France, the gas spike is connected on the one hand with direct use for heat (about 100 GW) and, on the other hand and to a lesser extent, with gas consumption for electricity generation (less than 10 GW).  In 2016 (the benchmark year for the chart), the seasonal variation for gas consumption between the spike and the minimum consumption point was higher than the same differential for electricity:  between 450 and 3,700 GWh/day for gas consumption;     between 32 and 92 GW for the electricity spike.  Figure 33: Daily spike (gas in GWh/day on the left and electricity in MW on the right)     185       Pointe quotidienne (gaz et électrique)  Daily peak (gas and electricity)  Pointe journalière de gaz  Daily gas peak  Pointe électrique  Electricity peak  Minimum conso électrique  Minimum electricity consumption    The targets for reducing fossil fuels make a case for reviewing natural gas use by focusing it on the sectors where its use is essential and by reducing the demand spike for gas.   While there are some advantages in using gas, principally in terms of storage and volume modulation in the grids, it is 100% imported and therefore requires big investment in the networks. Since gas consumption is thermosensitive, a significant drop in the use of gas for heat is required to achieve the goal of lowering the gas consumption spike. In the future, it appears necessary to speed up the pace of building renovations in order to reduce the thermosensitive share of consumption on the one hand, and to prioritise biomass district heating systems on the other.

In 2028, the MEP should make it possible to meet gas needs with between 24 and 32 TWh of gas from renewable sources, i.e. between 6% and 8% of gas consumption.  According to the target set by the LTECV, 10% of final gas consumption in 2030 must be provided by renewable energies.    4.2.2.4. Renewable electricity  Electricity accounted for 27% of final energy consumption in 2018, or 439 TWh (adjusted for climatic variations). The tertiary residential sector accounted for 66% of final electricity consumption and industry for 28%, while transport and agriculture remained minimal at around 2%.   187    In 2018, 71.7% of the electricity was produced from nuclear, 7.2% using thermal fossil fuels and 21.1% from renewable energies.   The electricity requirement is estimated at 440 TWh in 2023 and 426 TWh in 2028 (excluding exports and grid losses). The underlying assumption is stability of consumption, with decreases in consumption linked to energy efficiency improvements being offset by usage switchovers.  French law has set a target of 40% renewable energy in electricity generation in 2030. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to initiate major changes in the electrical system, with an acceleration of all renewable energy pathways. The efforts to be made, however, depend on the availability, maturity and competitiveness of the individual pathways.

Simplifying tender procedures and the designation of winners  A decree47 passed in 2016 simplified the procedure for calls for tenders and the designation of winners for power generation facilities, contributing to a reduction in the deadlines for selecting winning projects, which previously could take 18 or even 27 months. The administrative simplifications imposed include the following in particular:   simplification of authorisations to operate under the Energy Code, by very significantly increasing the power thresholds for renewable energy installations subject to this procedure in order to exempt most of them when they are developed within the framework of the support mechanisms provided by the Government;   simplification of the legal framework applicable to offshore renewable energies by limiting appeal deadlines, by entrusting the handling of appeals to a specialised Administrative Court of Appeal in first and final instance, by extending the duration of Maritime Public Domain (MPD) concessions from 30 to 40 years, and by reducing the time-to-file for Water Law authorisations; Decree No 2016-9 of 8 January 2016 on offshore renewable energy generation and transmission installations was published on 10 January 2016;   simplification of the administrative procedures required to gain access to the purchase obligation, with abolition of the CODOA procedure (certificate creating an entitlement to the purchase obligation);   simplification of planning procedures54 by making it possible to extend the period of validity of planning permits several times for all renewable energy production installations, up to a maximum of 10 years from the issuance of the decision;   general application of the single permit allowing the abolition of the need for a building permit for onshore wind farms and simplification of the legal framework for this sector, with the Administrative Court of Appeal overseeing initial claims.   47 Decree No 2016-170 of 18 February 2016 on tender procedures for power generation facilities. 54 Decree No 2016-6 of 5 January 2016 on the period of validity of planning permits and a variety of mechanisms related to the application of land rights and associated taxation.   188      Hydroelectricity  Wind  Solar-based electricity  Bioenergy  20172018: 15 months  20182019: 5 months  20182019: 5 months ground PV and building PV  20182019: 8 months  Periods observed between the publication of the specifications and the selection of winners after reform  Developing crowdfunding and promoting local ownership of projects  Participatory investment (crowdfunding) makes it possible to strengthen local ownership of renewable installations and to facilitate projects by improving local support. Tenders launched since 2016 have systematically favoured projects that implement crowdfunding solutions (involving citizens or local authorities) by integrating criteria and bonuses linked to participatory investment. The Government has also relaxed the conditions for crowdfunding of renewable energy projects on financing platforms.

For the first photovoltaic tenders launched in 2011 and 2013, the completion rates were between 44% and 83% (see table below). For new tenders, the introduction of financial performance guarantees and the obligation to obtain planning permission prior to the bid will contribute in particular to a decrease in rates of never-completed tender projects.

The numbers shown in the 2016 MEP are only for extra capacity. In this table, it is the total capacities that are shown, for the sake of comparability with the other pathways.  49     https://www.ecologique- solidaire.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/potentiel%20hydro_synth%C3%A8se%20publique_vf.pdf   192     the hydrology, which can vary significantly from one year to the next.  On average nationally, the load factor is around 25% (about 2,200 full power equivalent hours), but it generally varies between 20% and 40% (about 1,800 to 3,600 full power equivalent hours). Lake power plants, which have significant installed power to produce at peak hours, generally have lower load rates than run-of-river plants, for which the power is calibrated according to the average flow rate of the watercourse. Some plants designed to generate power from the minimum flows to be left in the watercourses run at full power almost all year round.  The hydroelectric industry is essential for the transition of the electrical system:   it is a renewable pathway that can be predicted and managed;   its flexibility (lake and sluice installations) makes it possible to manage the supply-demand balance reactively during periods of tension within the electrical system, instead of using expensive thermal systems that emit greenhouse gases;   hydraulic storage also makes it possible to position generation activities to match consumption over long periods (weekly or even seasonally).  Hydroelectricity regularly accounts for more than 20% of grid power during peak periods. Moreover, thanks to its flexibility, this sector accounts for about 50% of the adjustment mechanism, which is a device that allows RTE to ensure a balance between generation and consumption of electricity at all times.  Current and foreseeable costs  Hydroelectricity is a competitive renewable energy because of the long life of the facilities, which are subject to regular investment. Construction costs are high (civil engineering, equipment, grid connection), but operating and maintenance costs are relatively low. Costs related to environmental improvements are becoming increasingly significant.  Substantial disparities in costs are observed depending on the characteristics of the power plant and in particular depending on the installed power, the height of fall used and the hydrology of the site. The average unit costs observed50 are:   -of-river installations;   -power installations with substantial fall heights;   -power installations.  The hydroelectric sector is a mature sector and significant changes in these costs are not anticipated.  The characteristics of the sector in terms of market and employment  51. The French hydroelectric industry boasts world-renowned know-how and dynamic export activity. Studies and engineering make up the bulk of exporjobs.  The hydroelectric sector accounted for around 12,300 jobs in France in 2016 according to ADEME, concentrated mainly on operation. The engineering wings of EDF and General Electric are the two main  50 . LCOE - levelised cost of energy.  51 2017.   193    French players involved in major installations. An ecosystem of SMEs also exists around small hydropower, which has significant potential to develop for export.  In 2016, the employment factor for this sector was 230 FTE/TWh.  Environmental challenges  To preserve the quality of aquatic environments and guarantee other uses of water, the environmental regulations applicable to hydroelectric installations have been strengthened significantly: maintenance of a minimum flow in the watercourse, and developments to restore ecological continuity, systems to limit fish mortality, etc.  Like existing structures, hydroelectricity projects raise very different environmental issues depending on the size of the project and the location. For a small-scale project aimed at equipping an existing dam, the impact of the project may be limited to the problem of downstream migration of fish in connection with the installation of a turbine and the modification of the hydrological landscape in case of a bypassed section. For a hydroelectric project on a greenfield site, additional impacts should be considered, such as those related to flooding (hydromorphology, water quality), or those related to ecological continuity for the run or transit of sediments. For large-scale projects with reservoir dams, the management of the impacts of sluice operation during project design is crucial. Finally, regardless of the size of the project, the cumulative effects must be evaluated where there are already installations on the watercourse concerned, particularly in terms of ecological continuity or when flooding is in prospect.  Given their higher cost and their lower benefit for the electrical system in terms of their environmental impact, the development of new low-power projects should be avoided on sites with a particular environmental sensitivity. On the other hand, additional installations or new facilities to improve the flexibility of the hydroelectricity stock must be prioritised.  Onshore wind farms  Description of the existing installations  As at 31 December 2018, 1,808 facilities were connected in France (including the overseas territories and Corsica)52, and the French stock of existing installations therefore represents 15,075 MW and approximately 7,500 wind turbines. In 2018, 150 wind farms with a capacity of 1.47 GW were connected to the grid. Wind energy accounted for 5.9% of French electricity generation in 2018, which puts France in fourth position among EU nations.

This analysis superimposes, over the entire technically impossible in these zones for technical reasons (topography, terrain, etc.) or for reasons  195    associated with land use requirements: proximity to homes, military aviation training areas, radars, areas that are sensitive from a biodiversity perspective.  The potential energy resource also depends on the technology of the wind turbine. This study considered two types of wind turbines: the standard wind turbine and the new-generation wind turbine, known as      Installed power  Output/year  Standard wind turbines  170 GW  360 TWh   120 GW  330 TWh  National wind power potential  The first French wind farms commissioned from 2000 onwards will also reach the end of their useful lives during the period covered by the MEP, raising the question of replacement. The replacement of these farms will make it possible to preserve existing sites by equipping them with more modern machines. An increase in the productive capacity of existing installations could also result from the replacement of those installations, with the use of the best available techniques. Given these challenges, particular attention should be paid by the MEP to identifying those existing installations that could be replaced and to establishing conditions that enable their replacement. In particular, volumes to be replaced must be taken into account in volumes available as part of tenders, in order to ensure the sufficient development of new production capacities. In view of the work to be undertaken, the indicative schedule for tenders presented in the MEP only concerns new installations and does not take into account those that may be replaced.  Socioeconomic, industrial and environmental issues  Wind turbines do not operate all year round at full speed. A wind turbine operates within a wind speed range of between 10 and 90 km/h. Load factors (number of hours of operation per year) for onshore wind farms have been considered until now to be between 24% (2,100 h/year) and 26% (2,300 h/year). However, recent technological progress makes it possible to anticipate significant growth in these load factors, which, by 2023 and 2028, could reach figures in the order of 28% (2,500 h/year) and 30% (2,600 h/year) respectively.  This progress is possible through the use of higher machines capable of capturing stronger and more consistent winds. The use of larger rotors will also make it possible to capture weaker winds and will therefore enable wind farm development in areas that were previously considered difficult to exploit.  Since wind energy is variable, the unpredictable nature of the resource requires modifications to the way that the power grid is managed, which are developed in Section 5. Today however, wind turbines contribute to securing the French power supply through their participation in the capacity mechanism. System operators are studying the possibility of using the technical capabilities of wind farms for voltage adjustment.  Current and foreseeable costs  In global terms, onshore wi53. In France, for installations with more than six wind turbines, the prices offered   53 Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2017, IRENA, January 2018.   196    Wind power is a sector that has potential for innovation54 and therefore cost reduction. The various estimates converge towards a decrease of about 2% per year in the cost of wind-generated MWh. In  The characteristics of the sector in terms of market and employment  The wind power sector has been developing in France and, according to ADEME, in 2016 represented more than 18,000 jobs, with 1,100 new jobs in 2018 (source: FEE). These jobs are distributed across the entire value chain: industry, development, maintenance, etc.  According to ADEME, the average employment composition of this sector is 750 FTE/TWh.

On the industrial front, despite the absenmanufacture of components. Some foreign turbine manufacturers install production units on French territory to get closer to its market.   Environmental challenges  The environmental challenges of wind power are essentially linked to its potential impact on biodiversity. They also concern project landscape integration and impact on radar. Since 2011, these issues have been taken into account during project development as part of the procedure relating to establishments classified for environmental protection (ICPE).  A ministerial decree55 also requires that wind turbines, delivery stations and cables be dismantled at the end of their operation. It also requires that foundations be excavated and replaced by land with characteristics comparable to the land in the vicinity of the installation, to a depth of at least one metre in the case of agricultural land.  It is also possible for the owner of the land to set more stringent restoration conditions in a private agreement than the conditions applying under the regulations, when leasing the land to the wind farm operator.   To ensure that these dismantling and restoration works are carried out, including in cases of default by the operator, the commissioning of a wind farm is subject to the provision of financial guarantees in an 00 per wind turbine.  Most metals (steel, cast iron, copper, aluminium) and concrete are recycled. Wind turbine blades can be recovered to produce heat or reused to make cement.  In terms of carbon impact, wind turbines emit about 12.7 g of CO2 equivalent  according to ADEME studies  to produce 1 kWh of electricity.    Photovoltaic power  State of play in the sector  In the course of 2018, photovoltaic installations with a total capacity of 0.862 GW were connected to the grid. As at 30 September 2018, 424,805 facilities had an installed capacity of 8.9 GW. Photovoltaic solar energy represented 2.4% of French electricity consumption in 2018, an increase of 12% compared to 2017. The Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Occitanie, Provence-Alpes--Alpes regions have the highest installed capacities, representing nearly 70% of the total connected power in France. However, there is an increasing number of projects in the north and east of the country.

Maximum supply potential  ADEME estimates rooftop photovoltaic installation potential as around 350 GW, i.e. 350,000 ha of roof surface, which makes it possible to choose the most suitable locations. This corresponds to more than 350 TWh.  The French Research Centre on Risks, Environment, Mobility and Planning (CEREMA) has evaluated the potential for ground installations and those on parking facilities on land with no conflict of use in the southern regions of France. It estimates the surface areas that could be used as about 1.5 Mha, which would correspond to about 776 GW.  Socioeconomic, industrial and environmental issues  The load factor of photovoltaic installations depends on their location (sunshine, orientation) and the quality of the installed modules. On average, in the south of France, the load factor is considered to be around 130 kWh/m²/year.  The average load rate in France is 1,200 kWh/kWp (or 13.7%). For new panels, technological progress is improving performance and therefore increasing the average load rate. The surface yields for PV on the ground are also improving, approaching 1 MW per hectare, which would make it possible to use less land for an equal capacity and thus to reduce the impact on soils.  Photovoltaic electricity generation fluctuates during the day, depending on the solar radiation power captured by the sensors. Although it fluctuates, solar generation is predictable. Forecasting tools are increasingly reliable and enable better anticipation of photovoltaic production in the short, medium and long term. The fluctuating nature of this resource adds constraints in terms of controllability of generation and management of the electricity grid. Today, these fluctuations are no greater than those caused by demand forecast errors. The issues concerning the network for variable renewable energy penetration are discussed in the section on supply security.  Current and foreseeable costs  The 20092019 period saw photovoltaic equipment costs fall by more than 80% due to technological  prices offered rooftop installations. A further decline in the cost of installations is expected, at a slower pace that will depend on technological progress (improved yields), productivity gains, and global supply-demand balances. On the basis of an observation of the current rates of decrease in complete costs, the fall in costs is estimated as 4% per year for ground installations and 5% to 7% per year for rooftop installations. installations.  The characteristics of the sector in terms of market and employment  Activities associated with installation, grid connection and technical and commercial development make the implementation of solar installations an intensive activity in terms of jobs (up to 41 full-time equivalents (FTE) per MW installed annually for residential installations, according to ADEME). Ground facilities generate fewer jobs per installed MW (about 10 FTE/MW). The photovoltaic sector represented around 7,300 jobs in France in 201756.     56 .   200    The French industry has suffered from very strong competition in the production of photovoltaic cells and modules (which represent only 4% of the added value of an installation), especially from Asian countries. Nevertheless, it is well positioned for certain equipment, including inverters and trackers.  In 2017, t     Figure 39: Added value of the PV industry.

The challenges concern architectural and landscaping issues. Innovation in the sector should provide technologies that are better integrated into their immediate environment.   201     Solar facilities on the ground present a certain number of environmental challenges, mainly related to the biodiversity of the site and issues of land use conflict. These are taken into account during tender procedures, which make it possible to orientate the choice of sites towards degraded land that cannot accommodate other developments. They are also analysed on a caseby-case basis as part of the impact study to which projects over 250 kW are subject in order to obtain planning permission.  The dismantling of installations, if it is well done, does not pose any particular difficulty. In addition, Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) extended the scope of extended producer responsibility to include photovoltaic panels. France has transposed this Regulation into French law by means of Decree No 2014/928. As a result, suppliers must finance the management of their used equipment and associated recycling.  PV CYCLE France is the eco-organisation approved by the public authorities for the management of used photovoltaic panels. There are now 177 voluntary disposal points, meaning that 95% of photovoltaic panels may be recycled.  Generation of electricity from bioenergy  In 2018, the bioenergy sector produced 7.7 TWh of electricity, representing 1.6% of electricity consumption. The 2016 MEP did not set targets for all pathways used to generate electricity from bioenergy but, rather, only for the wood and biogas sectors.    Situation in  2016  Target in  MEP2016 for  2018  Low target in MEP2016 for 2023  High target in MEP2016 for 2023  Installed electricity generation capacity from wood (MW)  596  540  790  1,040  Installed electricity generation capacity from biogas resulting from anaerobic digestion (MW)  110  137  237  300  Targets set by the MEP adopted in 2016 for installed capacity of electricity generation from bioenergy (MW)  Generation sectors  The generation of renewable electricity from biomass encompasses several sectors, which do not have the same degree of maturity, the same development prospects or the same challenges.

Half of the electricity generated by DWIP is accounted for as renewable.

The average annual growth rate observed from 2009 to 2015 was stable at about +50 MWe, which corresponds to equipping about four sites per year with the means to generate electricity.   covers energy generated through biogas recovery. At the end of 2018, 633 installations were generating electricity from biogas:   453 methanisers with a capacity of 163 MW; only this sub-sector had a growth target in the MEP adopted in 2016;    152 non-hazardous waste storage facilities (ISDND) with a capacity of 267 MW;   28 waste water treatment plants with a capacity of 23 MW.               Figure 41: Regional distribution of connected biogas electrical power as at 31 December 2018 (in MW). Source:  RTE   203      Max.  Max.  Moy.  Avg.    Maximum supply potential  On the basis of studies of available potential nationally, the National Biomass Mobilisation Strategy (SNMB) is setting targets for 2023 to mobilise the additional forest, agricultural and biowaste resources:   52 TWh for solid biomass;   18 TWh for biogas;   7.8 TWh renewable for non-hazardous waste recovered in DWIP.  Socioeconomic, industrial and environmental issues  According to the priorities outlined in the National Biomass Mobilisation Strategy (SNMB), bioenergy resources are rare resources. The value in energy terms is therefore to direct them towards the pathways presenting the highest yields, in particular recovery in the form of heat.   The generation of electricity from biogas will be reserved for anaerobic digestion sites far from the gas grid for which there is no potential for direct recovery as bioNGV or fuel. The production of an anaerobic digestion plant is relatively stable over the year, excluding issues associated with availability of inputs, and cogeneration operations can be adapted throughout the day thanks to the flexibility afforded by biogas buffer storage. The average electrical power of anaerobic digestion plants (300 kW) is lower than for other electrical sectors.    Given the cost of generating electricity from biomass, to optimise the total cost of achieving the targets for renewable energies and to promote the greatest possible energy efficiency, support to this pathway will be reserved for heat generation.  Electricity generation in the bioenergy sector is controllable, and as such can contribute to the supply security of the electricity network.   204    Current and foreseeable costs   The average puoperational costs, including primarily the purchase of fuel, which represents betLHV, and staff. A moderate cost reduction is anticipated by the end of the current MEP period, and  variable depending on the origin of the biogas used. For new installations in Metropolitan France:     the purchase price of electricity generated by anaerobic digestion or from biogas from waste observed for the purification of biogas. Based on the example of findings in other countries that have developed anaerobic digestion on a large scale, in particular Germany, the drop in costs  The characteristics of the sector in terms of employment   The domestic waste incinerator sector accounted for around 620 jobs in France in 2016 (up slightly from 2014), according to ADEME, mainly in the electricity generation segment.  The collective, tertiary and industrial wood pathway accounted for around 6,190 jobs in France in 2017 according to ADEME, with 940 jobs in the manufacturing segment, 470 in the installation-design segment, 4,000 jobs in maintenance and 1,180 in the sale of energy (heat and electricity). Jobs in the pathway relate primarily to the market production of fuels, woodchips and wood logs for the collective  The biogas pathway for the production of heat and electricity and for injection accounted for about 2,430 jobs in France, including 270 jobs in the manufacturing segment, 1,210 jobs in the installation-design segment, and 630 jobs in sales and maintenance. Jobs in the sector are relatively stable compared to the previous year, because the increase in jobs related to the operation and sale of energy offset the decline in jobs related to investment.   Environmental challenges  DWIPs have a potential impact in terms of air pollution that is controlled by the ICPE regulations. The recovery of the waste heat from DWIPs means that other forms of energy production can be replaced, thus reducing the impact on the environment.  Biomass cogeneration plants also have a potential impact in terms of air pollution, which is regulated by the ICPE regulations. The additional issue overlaps the issues of biodiversity conservation and conflict of use for the mobilisation of biomass.   Equipping landfills and waste water treatment plants with electricity generating systems makes it possible to recover waste energy and to reduce emissions of methane or CO2 to the atmosphere when the methane is flared.  If biogas is produced from biowaste (from local authorities, agrifoods, catering, etc.) that is not being recovered to date, anaerobic digestion contributes to the European targets for reducing organic matter  205    landfilling and contributes to limiting GHG emissions within the sector. If biogas is produced from livestock effluents, anaerobic digestion helps to reduce the impact of farms on the climate, by capturing methane, but also of issues related to nitrogen pollution.   Offshore wind farms and renewable marine energy  Offshore wind power (fixed and floating)  The commercial development of the fixed offshore wind power sector was initiated by the launch of two calls for tenders in 2011 and 2013 and the allocation of nearly 3,000 MW spread over six wind farms off the coast of Normandy, Brittany and Pays de la Loire. A third offshore wind tender was launched off Dunkirk in December 2016. It was awarded in June 2019 for a capacity of 600 MW. Regarding floating wind farms, a technology at a less advanced stage of maturity, four pilot projects of 24 MW each were designated the winners of a call for projects launched by ADEME in 2017 as part of the Investments for the Future Programme: one in southern Brittany and three in the Mediterranean. Initial commissioning is scheduled for 2021.  Renewable marine energies (other than offshore wind turbines)  Each of these sectors has a degree of maturity and specific development prospects in the relatively long term. Since 2009, several Calls for Expression of Interest (CEI), run by ADEME, have been launched by the Government as part of the Investments for the Future Programme on marine energies.  Regarding tidal power, three different offshore hydrokinetic demonstrators were successfully submerged in Ouessant (October 2018, Sabella, 1 MW), Etel (February 2019, Guinard Energies, 250 kW) and Paimpol-Bréhat (April 2019, OceanQuest demonstrator on a site operated by EDF, 1 MW). All these machines were connected to the electric grid and have been producing energy ever since. These tidal turbines were all designed and manufactured in France.   The tidal power plant at Rance has an annual gross output of around 500 GWh for 240 MW installed.    Situation in  2016  Target in  MEP2016 installed  capacity in  2018  Target in  MEP2016 installed  capacity in  2023  Target in  MEP2016 capacity  allocated by tenders in 2023  Installed capacity for offshore wind generation  0  500 MW  3,000 MW  Between an extra 500 and  6,000 MW  Installed capacity for renewable marine energy  generation   240 MW57    440 MW  Between an extra 440 and  2,240 MW  Targets set by the MEP adopted in 2016 for installed capacity of electricity generation from bioenergy (MW)     57 . The MEP mentions only the extra capacity (100 MW). For the sake of uniformity with other pathways, the capacity of the Rance plant has been added.   206    Maximum supply potential  Regarding offshore wind farms: the technical potential for installed wind power is 90 GW according to ADEME. Due to limitations related to reconciliation with other marine uses, the potential is currently estimated as 16 GW. The technical potential for floating wind farms is 155 GW according to ADEME, of which 33 GW is accessible taking into account the limits related to reconciliation with other marine uses.  To develop offshore wind energy, consultations have been held with all stakeholders within the framework of drafting the strategic documents on the shoreline, which notably cover the determination of zones that could accommodate offshore wind power projects. Given the success of the consultation in that forum, the first calls for tenders for floating wind farms will be in southern Brittany, followed by the Mediterranean. The next wind energy tender will be launched in Normandy. As of January 2024, calls for tenders will be launched for extensions to previously awarded projects for offshore wind farms, with pooled connection.   Box 8: North Seas Energy Cooperation  France is a member of a cooperation related to wind energy in the North Sea, which aims to support the deployment of cross-border wind projects and to share processes and methods to accelerate the development of offshore wind energy among the member countries. The cooperation includes France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden and Luxembourg. France has used the information shared in this group to radically modify its framework for the development of offshore wind projects, giving a reinforced role to the Government upstream of any calls for tenders (performance of advance studies and participation by the public, in particular to identify the zone for the call for tender, under the aegis of the National Commission for Public Debate). This group is also involved in developing a shared framework for assessing the cumulative impacts of offshore wind farms, and France will build on that knowledge. Lastly, France has committed to providing the group with the planned calendar for its tender procedures, to give industrial players a  consolidated view of coming calls for tenders and to identify possible overlaps to avoid.     Regarding the tidal (marine current) sector, France, which has some of the strongest currents in the world, has an exploitable technical potential, without taking into account usage constraints, of 3 to 5 GW, and thus a thRazBlanchard in Normandy and in the Fromveur Passage in Brittany. The Government believes that the conditions for launching a commercial call for tenders are not met, and therefore has no plans for such a process in the period covered by the MEP. The Government will closely monitor the demonstrator projects that might be pursued and the performance of the sector in the coming years.  Regarding wave energy, these activities are still at the demonstration stage. There is no reliable estimate  Regarding tidal energy, France is currently a pioneer in this technology through the Rance plant, but it is not planning to develop it further in the short term, especially in view of the substantial environmental challenges presented by this technology at new sites.  Regarding ocean thermal energy, the potential sites are located primarily in overseas territories where temperature gradients between warm surface waters and deep cold waters are greater than in metropolitan France.  Socioeconomic, industrial and environmental issues  Offshore wind power (fixed and floating)  With wind speeds that are more sustained and more consistent than onshore wind farms, a wind turbine at sea can generate on average twice as much energy as one on land. The load factor is around 40%  207    (about 3,500 h/year). In addition, offshore wind farms currently have an average capacity of 500 MW (compared to an average of 10 MW for onshore wind farms); current projects are now on average between 700 MW and 1 GW.  The grid manager is involved upstream in calls for tenders to identify the capacity of the grids and to propose offshore grid-linking options, ideally through cost sharing. It provides overall control and management of the connection of wind farms and the engineering of underwater connections, and finances the costs for those wind farms resulting from tender procedures.  Current and foreseeable costs  The costs of offshore wind turbines installed have been declining for several years in Europe and are curreoffshore wind project (around 600 MW off the coast of Dun A sharp decrease in costs for commercial floating wind farms is expected, with a tariff of about floating wind turbines in the medium term.  As regards tidal turbines, the studies and demonstrators commissioned show that this sector has matured, even though production costs are still high compared to other technologies such as offshore wind turbines.  In its 2015 Medium-Term Renewable Energy Market Report, the International Energy Agency58 ean thermal energy, Jobs.  dy on the offshore wind energy sector: assessment, prospects and 59 published in September 2017, the structuring of the sector is crucial in generating a significant number of jobs during subsequent tenders. All ongoing projects could eventually represent up to 15,000 direct and indirect jobs, including the several thousand that already exist. The development of offshore wind turbines without the structural organisation of a national sector would lead to a limited increase in jobs.  Environmental challenges  Offshore wind turbines (fixed and floating) present environmental issues related to the biodiversity of the sites, with impacts mainly on marine biodiversity (marine mammals, seabed) in the construction phase (with fixed wind having a greater impact than floating), impacts mainly on bird life during the operation phase, and relatively significant landscape impacts depending on the distance of the wind farms from the coast. There are also conflicts of use with professional fishing and recreational craft.  authorisation. To enable more comprehensive consideration of these issues for future tenders, the Government will carry out studies and involve the National Commission for Public Debate upstream of calls for tenders, in order to organise public consultation on these wind farm resources.

The geothermal electricity sector in Metropolitan France remains very marginal today, with only one industrial installation located in Alsace, in Soultz-sous-Forêts. This project, originally built as a pilot for a scientific trial in the mid-1980s, became an industrial site in 2017, with gross electrical power of about 1.5 MW, which represents around 7,800 MWh/year supplied to the power grid.  Situation in 2016  Target in MEP2016 for 2018  Target in MEP2016 for 2023  1  8  20 to 40  Targets set by the MEP adopted in 2016 for installed capacity of electricity generation from geothermal energy (MW)  Maximum supply potential  Deep geothermal energy only develops in certain regions that have geological contexts favourable to the significant production of a high-temperature water resource. This activity requires a thorough knowledge of the subsoil at great depths, up to 5,000 m.  In 2018, 15 exclusive research permits in Metropolitan France covered an area of just over 10,000 km². This exploration phase, which is a prospecting phase with high financial risk, sometimes carried out for more than 10 years, makes it possible to understand the geological context and reduce the geological risk associated with the discovery of the resource and its characterisation in terms of temperature and flow. The geological contexts favourable to the development of this deep geothermal energy exist in France in the Alsatian Upper Rhine Plain, in the Auvergne and in particular in the Limagne basin, the Rhône Valley and the Aquitaine basin.  Thermoelectric conversion efficiency remains limited, at around 10%. One way to improve the performance of these units is to recover the waste heat produced, in particular by supplying district heating systems.  Socioeconomic, industrial and environmental issues  This emerging sector is mobilising several industrial players in Metropolitan France.   Major investments through research permits and the long exploration phase required to classify the resource and minimise geological risks make it difficult to develop the sector rapidly. The establishment of the GeoDeep Guarantee Fund, which is being pre-notified to the European Commission, is a mechanism for covering geological risk during the drilling phase, consisting of equal parts of private and public funding.  The legislative and regulatory framework has enabled significant development of district heating systems in Île-de-France, a region with favourable geological characteristics.  Current and foreseeable costs  The main technological barriers concern the discovery, evaluation and understanding of geothermal reservoirs. Significant cost reductions are expected as geoscience studies lead to a better understanding of geological potential. This gain in competitiveness will also be made possible by the depreciation of boreholes and, to a lesser extent, by the gains in efficiency and yield of binary-cycle units.   209    In France, the cost of generating electricity from the Bouillante power station in Guadeloupe  the only volcanic-operated unit  h60, which is higher than the international price of MW. This is partly due to the island nature of the plant and its current small size (15 MW). According to ADEME, deep geothermal installations in Metropolitan France will have a generation cost ranging  The Decree of 13 December 2016 allows installations using energy extracted from geothermal deposits to generate electricity to be paid additional remuneration on the feed-in tariff, based on the reference  The characteristics of the sector in terms of employment  According to a study61 published in 2019, the deep geothermal sector  a sector in development  could represent about 1,200 direct jobs in 2017, both in investment and in production and maintenance. The Of that turnover, 20% represents high-energy activities.  Environmental challenges  The phases during which a deep geothermal site can cause the most nuisance and impact are the drilling and production test phases. The Mining Code and the Energy Code strictly regulate this activity, thus making it possible to control the environmental risks related to the sector. Deep geothermal energy in Metropolitan France operates in closed circuit with re-injection of the geothermal fluid into the same formation as it is generated. Aquifers exploited for their geothermal resources do not contain drinkable or drinking water. The exploitation of a geothermal site may produce induced micro-seismicity, but monitoring networks can be used to analyse the data. These projects must be accepted by local stakeholders because they recover a local resource, which is permanently available and generally located in urban areas. The carbon footprint of deep geothermal energy is very close to neutral because the total CO2 emissions calculated over the life of a project vary between 17 and 60 g/kWh.

In 2028, the MEP should lead to the generation of between 210 and 227 TWh of electricity from renewable sources, 32 TWh of electricity from thermal sources and between 382 and 371 TWh from nuclear sources, i.e. between 33% and 36% of electricity generation from renewable sources and between 59% and 61% from nuclear sources.    4.2.2.5.
