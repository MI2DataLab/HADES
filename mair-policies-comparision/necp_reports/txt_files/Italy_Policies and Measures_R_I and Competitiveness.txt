INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 226   3.5 Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness   i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.5  A series of policies and measures have been put in place to achieve the objectives. The most significant consist of the following Funds:  Electric system research fund Financed through a levy placed on electricity tariffs (available resources for the 2015-2017 three- million), and having the principal objective of supporting both research of general interest (currently carried out by the National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA), the National Research Council (CNR) and the energy system research company RSE as part of specific programme agreements), and industrial research. A new Three-Year Plan for 2019-2021 has been approved by Decree of the Ministry of Economic Development of 9 August 2019, which will set new research objectives in line with the SET Plan and the involvement in Mission Innovation. The allocation provided for the three- million, the same as for the previous three years, so as to avoid increasing the burden on the A5 tariff component of the electricity bill.    Fund for actions and measures for technological and industrial development A fund held at the Fund for Energy and Environmental Services (CSEA), set up by Legislative Decree No 28/2011 and financed through a levy placed on electricity and natural gas tariffs  million/year. It aims to support actions and measures for technological and industrial development in the field of renewable sources and energy efficiency. If necessary, the fund may also be called on to support demonstration projects.   Fund for the development of intangible capital A fund set up by Article 1(c-1091) of the 2018 Budget Law, for the development of intangible capital, competitiveness and productivity, managed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, in concert with the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research, which may also be used for financing technological research carried out by companies, in partnership with research bodies, with an allocation  million for the 2018-2020 three-year period. It may be used to finance activities associated with the involvement in the various technological challenges set out by Mission Innovation. Additional measures that will play a significant part in achieving the objectives are:   Guarantee fund Increasing the possibility of being granted a loan: supporting companies and professionals unable to readily be granted a bank loan as they lack the sufficient guarantees.   Hyper-amortisation and super-amortisation INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 227   Supporting and incentivising companies that invest in new capital goods and tangible and intangible assets (software and IT systems) instrumental in the technological and digital transformation of production processes.    the Ministry of Economic Development having the objective of making it easier for companies investments for purchasing or leasing machinery, equipment, plant, capital goods for productive use and hardware, and also software and digital technologies. The Budget Law for  million  million for each of the  million for 2025 for the New Sabatini law, intended to provide subsidised loans for investment in new machinery, plants and equipment, including those that fall within the scope of Industry 4.0, and a corresponding State contribution towards the construction of production facilities, based on the interest calculated on the above-mentioned loans. Furthermore, to increase support for innovative investments by micro-  million is set aside for increasing of the State contribution from 30% to 60% for micro- and small businesses that make investments within the scope of Industry 4.0 in Abruzzo, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Molise, Puglia, Sardinia and Sicily.    The Budget Law for to support the competitiveness and growth of small and medium-sized enterprises in  million  million for 2021, to be drawn from the Development and Cohesion Fund, managed by Invitalia.   Tax credit This instrument, which forms part of National Industrial Plan 4.0, is for the more immediate use by companies, and is aimed at stimulating private investments in R&D in order to innovate processes and products and guarantee the future competitiveness of the companies (not only in the energy sector). It consists of a 50% tax credit for incremental Research and  million per recipient and is calculated on a fixed basis stemming from the average Research and Development costs for the 2012-2014 period. The measure is applicable to Research and Development costs that will be incurred during the 2017-2020 period. The instrument has a  billion per year up to 2020, and will also draw on as much additional private -9 billion for the 2017-2020 period. As has been mentioned, the credit is not specifically calibrated to the energy sector, but on the basis of the trends observed, it is estimated that the incremental energy R&D costs will be around -500 million. Regarding the tax credit on the costs of investment s in R&D, accessible until 31 December 2020, new provisions have been set out in Law No 160 of 27 December 2019: the bonus will increase from 25% to 50%, for Regions in Southern Italy only.

Fund for sustainable growth The actions for supporting research and development projects are intended, within the scope projects seeking to introduce significant technological advancements by developing key enabling technologies (knowledge-intensive technologies associated with high R&D intensity) d in accordance with the Europe 2020 strategy.   Energy clusters In August 2017, the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (by way of  Decree No 1853 of 26 July 2017) approved the setting-up of public-private research partnerships. The initiative is coordinated by ENEA, and has so far attracted more than 90 public and private entities. It will follow the priority European, national and regional Technological Trajectories, which are characterised by differing technology readiness levels, and will play a part in reaching the research planning targets set out in the SET Plan, the NES, the NRP, the Smart Specialisation Strategy - S3 and the Industry 4.0 project, and through the involvement in Mission Innovation.   Proceeds from CO2 auctions The funds available from CO2 auctions (Legislative Decree No 30/2013) will cover experimental development, in particular in order to ensure that demonstration projects (first-of-a-kind) are supported, with the results being passed on to the production system. In particular, research centres and public administrative bodies have agreed to work together in order to develop the production and use of biofuels in the aviation sector, and ENAC has launched a research project with the aim of producing an alternative fuel derived from microcellular algae.   Fund for investments and infrastructural development INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 229   Proceeds from the fund to be distributed according to the provisions set out in Article 1(140) of Law No 232/2016, as refinanced by Article 1(1072) of Law No 205/2017, expenditure: d) priorities of the SET Plan. Law No 58 of 28 June (converting the Growth Decree-Law into law): for interventions undertaken to meet the commitments made by the Italian government via the Mission Innovation partnership entered into during the COP21 in Paris, namely to double the share of public investment into research, development and clean energy technology innovation, as well as the commitments made within the framework of the National  million is authorised for each of the  million for 2021.  The tool with which the National Fund operates is venture capital, that is, direct and indirect investments in qualified minority shareholdings in innovative companies by means of general funds, vertical funds or funds of funds, to support start-ups, scale-ups or innovative SMEs. The measures aim to cover the whole country, using an investment approach that progresses from seed capital to growth capital. There will be specific interest in technological transfer and sectors that play a strategic role in growth and competitiveness in Italy, such as artificial intelligence, new materials, health, agritech and foodtech, mobility, fintech, made in Italy, design and sustainable industry.   Prototype approach that facilitates innovative projects on energy networks Definition of a regulatory framework that facilitates innovative projects, including by means of a dedicated fund, allowing operators to conduct tests on site and at prototype stage, if necessary granting temporary waivers from the regulations in force, while at the same time providing for adequate mechanisms for effective cost recognition. Network operators will be particularly involved, activating a new approach of system innovation that involves commercial parties in the development of new business models downstream in the chain and trialling multiservice offers at urban and local level. An example of this is provided by the pilot projects launched by ARERA to foster the participation of distributed resources in the dispatching services market.   Cohesion funds Pilot projects on a metropolitan/regional scale to demonstrate the financial viability of integrated projects will also be able to be carried out by operators in partnership with Municipalities and Regions, both for the authorisation procedure and in order to promote access to European structural funds. In this respect, there will be greater dialogue with the Regions so that their commitments as regards the use of cohesion funds within the framework offered by the SET Plan fall in line with national priorities. Incentives to support R&D projects for converting production processes in the context of the circular economy To encourage businesses to adapt their activities to fit the circular economy model as part of the drive to convert industrial production processes, by Decree of the Ministry of Economic Development, subject to agreement of the Unified Conference within the meaning of Article 3 of Legislative Decree No 281 of 28 August 1997, criteria, conditions and procedures are set out for the authorisation and granting of financial incentives (for example, tax related incentives to provide funding to entities or individuals who have made a commitment to INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 230   invest in projects, in particular to achieve energy transition), within the limits of maximum aid grantable under Articles 4 and 25 of Regulation (EU) 651/2014 of the Commission of 17 June 2014, to support development projects aimed at more efficient and sustainable use of resources. Businesses and research centres that, at the date of application for aid, meet the requirements listed in Article 26(2) et seq. of Decree-Law No 34 of 30 April 2019 (the Growth Decree-Law), can benefit from the incentives. Ministry of Innovation and the National Research Agency  The Official Journal of 18 October 2019 publishes the Presidential Decree which grants a mandate to the Minister of Technological Innovation and Digitalisation by creating a special Ministry of Innovation. The new Ministry should merge the current functions of the Bureau of Innovation and Digitalisation, which is part of the Ministry of Public Administration, and the functions of the Department for Digital transformation, recently set up within the Council of Ministers. Although the main tasks of the new Ministry involve digitalisation-innovation and activities at national level, the scope of its mandate is clearly not limited to the digital transformation of government bodies and services, but innovation throughout the whole country. The Budget Law for 2020 provides for the creation of the National Research Agency, tasked with coordinating scientific research activities in universities (first level) and public research bodies and institutions (second level). Specifically, the Agency is called upon to manage the selection of projects with strategic value, chosen on the basis of criteria and procedures that comply with international best practices, assessing the impact of financed projects, gaging European arena by ensuring compliance with international standards.  Law No 60 of 27 December 2019 establishes in the statement of estimates of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance  million  million f million  million  million for 2024,  million  million  million for each of the years from  million for each of the years 2033 and 2034.  The fund is intended for the relaunch of investments of the central government bodies and for national development, also with reference to the circular economy, the decarbonisation of the economy, emission reductions, energy savings, environmental sustainability and, in general, investment programmes and innovative projects. Support can also take the form of contributions to businesses which are highly sustainable, taking account of their social impact.   ii. Where applicable, cooperation with other Member States in this area, including, where appropriate, information on how the SET Plan objectives and policies are being translated to a national context  Italy considers the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) to be a vital tool for tackling new challenges; in the next few years, the SET Plan will constitute the reference point for EU, national, regional and private investments in energy research and innovation. In Italy, the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research have been tasked with coordinating the SET Plan. Italy has decided to oversee all the working groups set up for organising the Implementation Plans (IPs) concerning the INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 231   ten key action areas. The national representatives of each working group have, in turn, set academic spheres, which are able to contribute significantly to the drafting of the IPs. The Italian delegation works by holding plenary hearings of the main public and private operators in the R&D sector, and also bilateral meetings. It has also been able to count on the support representatives from companies, research bodies, universities, Ministries and Regions, and convenes two or three times each year. During the extensive work in drawing up the Implementation Plans, Italy has been particularly active in cooperating with other Member States to identify priorities and recommendations with respect to financial requirements. Together with other Member States, Italy is in charge of the following Strategic Priorities of the SET Plan:  European leadership in the development of innovative renewable energy sources, particularly in the geothermal sector;  Instruments for allowing consumers to play an active role in the energy transition (smart sector), with particular focus on smart grids;  new renewable fuels for sustainable mobility. Possible partnerships on these priority issues with other Member States are currently being looked into, also from the perspective of Mission Innovation. There has also been much cooperation between Member States as part of the Horizon 2020 programme, which places research and innovation measures under a single strategic framework. Italy is one of the most active and forward-thinking countries when it comes to submitting research and innovation proposals, since it is able to count on a vast network of public and private operators and large companies, together with an array of proactive SMEs. in the next Horizon Europe Framework Programme, starting in 2021.  iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds  The principal national financing measures have been given in section 3.5i. As part of Mission Innovation, Italy, together with other Member States, is committed to doubling the value of the portfolio of resources for public research into clean energy, which  million in 2013 (the year taken as  million in 2021. The main lines of research that are intended to be promoted at national level are described in section 2.5.  In addition to the national and regional financial instruments, Italy believes that, in the run-up to 2030, other EU instruments will play a key role in supporting, above all, the technical-economic demonstration of clean technologies, which is what the EU needs after decades of funding research and innovation projects. Among these, particular importance is attached to the InnovFin Energy Demo Projects (EDP), which constitute instruments specifically for the -of-a-Plan, and also those vital to demonstration projects, such as the Innovation Fund. Interest has also been shown in the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) as well as InvestEU and the Juncker Plan itself, in which many Italian companies, and SMEs in particular, have been able to find financial guarantees to support their own INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 232   investments. Italian businesses have also shown increasing interest in the Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) facility, to support value chains identified by the Commission, including in particular those related to batteries and hydrogen, for which new proposals for projects in collaboration with other Member States are being prepared.     Participation in the Horizon Programme, which in this context is rapidly evolving in order to reach the targets set, is vitally important to aligning with the priorities of the SET Plan. As -2016 three-year period, in the face of strong Italian involvement with over 2 300 operators taking part in tender proceedings, the success rate of Italian-coordinated projects was 9.4 % and the financial contribution for  million (7.8 % of the allocated budget).  Following the monitoring carried out by APRE24has improved, also from a forward-looking perspective, with the most notably successful sectors being:  smart grids and storage systems;  renewable energy sources (in particular, R&D projects passing from TRL 3-4 to TRL 4-5 and innovation projects passing from TRL 5-6 to TRL 6-7);  bio-energy;  energy efficiency (in particular, projects for penetrating the market with products and best practices);  smart cities and communities (in this case, the economic value of individual projects, such as the project for the city of Florence, is more important that the number of projects).                                                                24 APRE: Italian Agency for the Promotion of European Research
