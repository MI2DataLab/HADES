INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 61   2.5 Research, Innovation and Competitiveness Dimension  Overview of key objectives:  increase investment in R&D - at least 3% of GDP by 2030 (of which at least 1% of GDP is public funding),  increased investment in the development of human resources and new skills needed for the transition to a climate-neutral society,  support for businesses for an efficient and competitive transition to a climate-neutral and circular economy,  encourage targeted research projects and multidisciplinary R&D programmes and demonstration projects to reach a climate-neutral society based on the direct interest of the economy or the public sector, and fulfilling national development goals, in particular in the areas of energy,  preparation of a new Research and Innovation Strategy of Slovenia (RISS), taking into account the achievement of the targets of a climate-neutral society,  direct companies towards financing and inclusion in R&D programmes and demonstration projects with an active tax policy,  promote new and reinforce existing R&D programmes in the area of energy, in line with the objectives of the NEPN and the Long-Term GHG emission reduction strategy,  promote the use of digitisation for climate action and enhancing cybersecurity across all strategic systems,  promote R&D cooperation between the public and private sectors,  create competitive conditions for innovative research work in public companies.  In order to achieve the set objectives, the NEPN confirms as a target increasing investment in R&D by at least 3% of GDP by 2030 (of which 1% of GDP is public funding), with funds earmarked for climate-neutral goals and projected to be directed towards targeted research projects, multidisciplinary programmes and demonstration projects. In order to achieve the set objectives, we will intensify R&D investment in future, since the level of investment in 2017 was 1.87% of GDP, including public funds amounting to 0.44% of GDP (SORS, 2019). Slovenia thus lags behind the EU average of 2.06% of GDP in 2017, of which 0.70% of GDP is spent on public R&D (Eurostat, 2017). A new Research and Innovation Strategy for Slovenia (RISS) will be drawn up for Research, Innovation and Competitiveness (including Energy Union objectives); while ensuring the achievement of the objectives of a climate-neutral society, it will also include R&D to achieve these objectives. We will also target more funding to transform educational content to create a digital and research-driven society of the future. Such a society will create personnel of the future that will be properly educated to meet the ever-changing needs associated with climate change and the need to handle it. At the same time, Slovenia will develop into a country with a competitive workforce capable of greening the jobs within its economy. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 62   The NEPN provides for the following activities in the area of research and innovation:  long-term priority development of scientific disciplines in line with Slovenia's development needs and the interests of the domestic economy, especially in the area of the climate-neutral society,  introduction of multidisciplinary research and development programmes in all fields related to energy management, in particular in the area of sustainable energy use,  implementation of targeted R&D programmes and demonstration projects that improve the practical qualification for the quality preparation and implementation of projects in the area of energy efficiency, the circular economy and green energy technologies,  preparation of a new Research and Innovation Strategy of Slovenia (RISS), taking into account the achievement of the goals of a climate-neutral society,  accelerated cooperation between R&D institutions and the economy and joint involvement in international projects,  introduction of digitisation by promoting and accelerating digitisation in the implementation and monitoring of measures in the fight against climate change, increasing the use of advanced technologies, influencing the progressive functioning of individual stakeholders in society, and thus innovatively addressing climate and social challenges; particular emphasis will be placed on increasing cybersecurity and reducing the vulnerability of all key strategic systems in the country,  active involvement of Slovenia in European innovation promotion initiatives and projects with centralised EU funds in the area of climate-neutral society and the circular economy.  Thanks to the above set of planned activities, we are engaged in research and innovation-related development policies, with especially close links with industrial, corporate and educational policies. To move towards a climate-neutral society, sustainable energy production and use must become a priority area for research, development and innovation. Investing in research and promoting innovation in low-carbon technologies and energy efficiency not only contributes to sustainable development but at the same time contributes to the reliable and competitive operation of the energy sector, which significantly contributes to the competitiveness of the entire economy. The research, innovation and competitiveness dimension also contribute significantly to the achievement of the objectives of the other four Energy Union dimensions. In Slovenia, in future, the main areas of energy research will be: renewable energy sources, efficient use of energy in buildings, nuclear energy, electricity and electric power and electricity systems, heat and heating systems, the circular economy, etc. We will also encourage the development of technologies in these areas, such as upgrading gasification and waste recovery technologies for energy purposes, power to X technologies, digitisation of energy, cybersecurity, nanotechnologies, energy storage, the capture of emissions, etc. In the area of transport, investment in alternative fuel technologies will be key. The NEPN also aims to reinforce competitiveness and technological development capabilities in energy and develop new products, manufacturing processes, services and solutions that are suitable for transfer to the economy, especially with regard to EEU and RES and the climate-neutral and circular economy. In December 2017, the Slovenian Government adopted SRS 2030 which defines two objectives related to the research, innovation and competitiveness dimension in Slovenia:  the sixth SRS 2030 objective is a competitive and socially responsible business and research sector, specifying, among other things, a focus on environmentally friendly technologies and eco-innovations, which, as an important factor in the competitiveness of companies, also contribute to reducing the environmental burden, INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 63    the eighth SRS 2030 objective is  transition to a low-carbon circular economy as a priority development orientation for the whole economy, breaking the link between economic growth and the growth of raw material and non-renewable energy use and the associated increased environmental burden. In September 2017 the Slovenian Government adopted the Slovenian Smart Specialisation Strategy (S4)63, which is the implementation plan for the transition to a highly productive economy by enhancing innovation capacity, promoting the transformation and diversification of industries into new activities, and the growth of new fast-growing businesses. S4 identifies three priority pillars and nine areas of application where Slovenia achieves a critical mass of knowledge, capabilities and competences, thus possessing innovative potential for positioning on global markets: I. Digital (1 - Smart cities and communities; 2 - Smart buildings and the wood-chain dwelling); II. Circular (3 - Networks for transition to a circular economy; 4 - Sustainable food; 5 - Sustainable tourism); III. (S) Industry 4.0 (6 - Factories of the future; 7 - Health - medicine; 8 - Mobility; 9 - Materials as products). In addition to cohesion funds, it is planned that the Climate Change Fund will play an important role in future in promoting research, innovation and competitiveness, its resources being used inter alia to fund R&D and demonstration projects to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change, including participation in European Strategic Energy Technology Plan initiatives (the SET plan) and European Technology Platforms (SET-Plan, 2018). The Climate Act will define the framework for the dedicated use of available R&D funds in the area of transition to a climate-neutral society. The Climate Act will also make the promotion of low-carbon energy sources an indispensable climate policy objective.                                                              63  S4 - Slovenian Smart Specialisation Strategy 2014-2020, available at: http://www.svrk.gov.si/fileadmin/svrk.gov.si/pageuploads/Dokumenti_za_objavo_na_vstopni_strani/S4_strategija_V_Dec17.pdf.
