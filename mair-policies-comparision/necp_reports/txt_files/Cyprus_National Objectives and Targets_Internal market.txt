2.4.3, respectively.  Regarding indigenous hydrocarbon deposits offshore Cyprus, the Aphrodite natural gas field contractor and the Republic of Cyprus have completed discussions on the Aphrodite Field Development and Production Plan (AFDPP), which was approved. As a result, an Exploitation License for the production of the Aphrodite Field has been issued in November 2019. According to the AFDPP, natural gas production is expected to begin in 2025. The Aphrodite Field gas, is going to be transmitted to Egypt via a subsea pipeline, mainly to Idku LNG Terminal for liquefaction and re-export, as well as for the domestic market.  In February 2018, the ENI / Total joint venture completed the first exploratory well "Calypso 1" in Block 6, which resulted in a gas discovery. Moreover, in February 2019, the ExxonMobil/ Qatar Petroleum Consortium discovered a gas reservoir in their Glaucus-1 well in Block 10. Finally, hydrocarbons exploration activities in Cyprus Exclusive Economic Zone are ongoing and a number of exploration wells are planned for the next two years, with the aim to discover more hydrocarbons. 2.4. Dimension internal energy market 2.4.1. Electricity interconnectivity In case the electricity interconnection is materialized the expected increase of 34.   The EuroAsia Interconnector will be implemented in two phases, 1000 MW being the first and 2000 MW the second phase. By 2030 the interconnector shall satisfy /address the peak demand of Cyprus (1000 MW). According to ENTSO-E guidelines and other practices in MS, the usual target for interconnection capacity is 20%- 30%.   The expected total installed capacity by 2030 in Cyprus will be 1500MW (without RES) and 2500 MW (including RES).                                                            34 Investment Request Dossier 2016 (submitted to CERA/RAE for their CBCA decision) 85  Cyprus is aiming to set the national target based on the actual flow and also the findings in the CBA studies of the EuroAsia Interconnector on 15% interconnection and the capacity of 150 MW. Taking into account the assumed electricity prices as presented in the table below, the price difference between Cyprus and Israel and Cyprus and Greece exceed the threshold of  Table 2.17: Assumed electricity prices in Greece and Israel and calculated prices in Cyprus in the PPM scenario (EUR2016/MWh). Country 2025 2030 Greece 73.5 74.2 Israel 63.0 75.9 Cyprus 85.6 92.2 Regarding nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30% of installed renewable generation, there is no available information at the moment. The incorporation of the EuroAsia interconnector in the system at a Net Transfer Capacity of 1,000 MW and to a lesser degree the lower electricity demand in the Planned Policies and Measures (PPM) scenario, leads to major changes in the investment outlook of the electricity supply sector (Table 11 from CUT study for Impact Assessment of NECP35). Specifically, investments in new CCGT units are reduced by one unit as compared to the WEM scenario (with existing measures). Similarly, no investments occur in new steam turbines, gas turbines and CHP facilities. In addition, investments in batteries are also reduced drastically and are delayed to the end of the modelling horizon. The above changes in the Electricity System are reflected in the sensitivity analysis scenarios that are included in section 5.4. 2.4.2. Energy transmission infrastructure 2.4.2.1. i. Key electricity and gas transmission infrastructure projects, and, where relevant, modernisation projects, that are necessary for the achievement of objectives and targets under the five dimensions of the Energy Union Strategy Key electricity transmission infrastructure projects In total 67 transmission projects for the construction of new and the upgrade of existing infrastructure are planned for the period 2019-2028. In addition, an upgrade in the Ripple Control System for the control of non-critical loads will reduce high generation costs related to primary fuel, CO2 emissions and increased reserve requirements during peak load conditions. The list of the projects is shown in the Ten Year Transmission Network Development Plan for the period 2019-2028 (Appendix 5).                                                            35 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/EnergySe.nsf/All/4CFADF62B303D228C22584D6004AAB42/$f ile/SRSS-C2018-070_Deliverable_5.pdf 86  EuroAsia Interconnector is an electricity transmission infrastructure and also a Project of Common Interest (no. 3.10.1, 3.10.2). It is a cross border interconnector between Crete, Cypriot, and Israeli power grids via the world's longest submarine HVDC power. HVDC onshore converter stations with a total capacity of 2000MW will be located at each connection point. It is also a priority Electricity Highway Interconnector Project. The Interconnector is an energy highway bridging Asia and Europe. The quantified objective is market integration but also ending the energy isolation of Cyprus and contributes to energy security of supply. The planned budget of the EuroAsia Interconnector project is approximately 1.5 billion Euros (stage 1). The Governments of Cyprus and Greece have recently made a common statement to ensure the technical interoperability for the interconnection between Cyprus and Greece, after the Hellenic Government decision to proceed with the implementation of the Crete-Attica interconnection as a national project. Due to the common statement, the Project Promoter of EuroAsia Interconnector, the Project Promoter of the Internal line Crete-Attica and the transmission operators from both MS have to collaborate in order to find the solution on the interoperability issue. The Project Promoter has submitted the PCI application file to the National Competent Authority of Cyprus.  This Project of Common Interest is also related to Energy Security Dimension, as it promotes diversification of energy sources and ends the energy isolation of Cyprus. In addition, it contributes to the Decarbonisation Dimension because electricity imports will preferably come from natural gas or renewable sources which contribute to the reduction of greenhouse emissions. Key gas transmission infrastructure projects The EastMed pipeline (Project of Common Interest no. 7.3.1), promoted by IGI-Poseidon S.A. aims at connecting the European market with the gas resources of the Eastern Mediterranean region.  The EastMed pipeline will have an initial capacity of up to approximately 10 Bcm/year. In a 1900 km off-shore-pipeline divided into the five following sections: 1) offshore in the Levantine basin to Cyprus; 2) Cyprus-Crete; 3) Crete-Peloponnese; 4) Peloponnese-W. Greece; 5) W. Greece-Thesprotia. From there, at Florovouni, it will connect to the off-shore section of the Poseidon pipeline enabling the direct flow of gas to Italy and beyond in the European continent. Moreover, via the potential connection with the Greece-Bulgaria Interconnector, the EastMed pipeline can also allow the Levantine gas to reach the Balkan markets while the metering & regulating station at Megalopoli provides a connection to the Greek gas transmission system.  The Project Promoter notified the project to the NCA of Cyprus in November 2019. This Project of Common Interest is also related to the Energy Security Dimension, as it promotes diversification of energy sources and routes, ends the isolation of Cyprus and Crete, supports new gas production in the Eastern Mediterranean, including EU indigenous 87  sources, and facilitates gas exchanges in South-eastern Europe. It also contributes to the Energy Efficiency Dimension, as natural gas is more efficient fuel than the other fossil fuels and to the Decarbonisation Dimension because of the import of natural gas in Cyprus fuel market which has lower greenhouse gas emissions than those from conventional fuels.  CyprusGas2EU (Project of Common Interest no. 7.5 former 7.3.2) promoted by MECI aims at introducing Natural Gas via LNG imports to the island of Cyprus in order to end the current energy isolation of Cyprus, by establishing the required infrastructure. In October 2018, a tender was announced by ETYFA (Natural Gas Infrastructure Company of Cyprus) for the construction of a LNG Import Terminal in Vasilikos Bay. The target date for the completion of the entire LNG imports and infrastructure development project and the commencement of the supply of natural gas to the domestic market of Cyprus is by the beginning of year 2022. For more details, see 3.3.i. This Project of Common Interest is also related to the Energy Security Dimension, as it is removing internal bottlenecks in the Trans-European Networks of Energy (TEN-E), it is ending the energy isolation of Cyprus and allowing transmission of natural gas from Eastern Mediterranean. It also contributes to the Energy Efficiency Dimension, as natural gas is more efficient fuel than the other fossil fuels and to the Decarbonisation Dimension, because LNG has lower greenhouse gas emissions than those from conventional fuels. 2.4.2.2. ii. Where applicable, main infrastructure projects envisaged other than Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) Electricity infrastructure projects EuroAfrica Interconnector is an interconnector between Greek, Cypriot, and Egypt power grids via submarine power cable. The interconnector will link Egypt with Cypriot and Greek power grids through the island of Crete. It is an energy highway bridging Africa and Europe and it will have a capacity to transmit 2.000 MW of electricity in either direction. The energy supply for Cyprus, Greece and Egypt connecting them with Trans-European Networks of Energy (TEN-E), allowing significant economic and geopolitical benefits to the three involved countries.  Gas infrastructure projects Aphrodite-Egypt Export pipeline. The Aphrodite-Egypt Export pipeline is designed to export gas produced from the Aphrodite field to gas buyers in Egypt. The pipeline will mainly transmit gas from the Aphrodite field to Idku LNG Terminal. An Intergovernmental Agreement between Cyprus and Egypt was signed in 2018 to facilitate the project. The pipeline distance will be approximately 240-340km, depending on the landing point. The pipeline diameter is expected to be between 24 and  The current base case capacity is 800mmscfd. The landing point and the identity of gas buyers are not finalised, but potential gas buyers will be the owners of Egypt LNG liquefaction facilities in Idku, as well as domestic consumers. 88  2.4.3. Market integration 2.4.3.1. i. National objectives related to other aspects of the internal energy market such as increasing system flexibility, in particular related to the promotion of competitively determined electricity prices in line with relevant sectoral law, market integration and coupling, aimed at increasing the tradeable capacity of existing interconnectors, smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, and real-time price signals, including a timeframe for when the objectives shall be met Introduce System Flexibility Currently, the electricity market in Cyprus cannot support neither flexibility services nor aggregation and demand response. Flexibility services, aggregators and demand response will be able to participate through a fully functioning competitive electricity market (CEM), which is planned to become operational by the end of 2021. For a description of the CEM  Estimated timeframe for meeting this objective is 8-12 months after the deadline of transposition of the recast Electricity Directive to the national legislation i.e. September 2021 to January 2022. Expand aggregation Currently, the Trade and Settlement Rules (TSRs) allow for the aggregation of RES-only generation and the size of the aggregated capacity is limited in the range of a minimum 1MW up to a maximum of 20 MW. A new bill has been submitted which, among other measures, expands the aggregation scope to allow the aggregation of sources of generation irrespective of the primary type of fuel or technology, of storage systems as well as of the supply side (demand response). TSRs will be reviewed and amended in accordance to the new law. Aggregators will also be allowed to participate in the wholesale energy market, the balancing and reserve markets on an equal footing with conventional generation. Estimated timeframe for meeting this objective is 8-12 months after the deadline of transposition of the recast Electricity Directive to the national legislation i.e. September 2021 to January 2022. Use of flexibility by the DSO Subject to the provisions of the recast Electricity Directive, enable the DSO to procure flexibility services, including congestion management in their service area, especially from distributed generation, demand response, storage and other market participants (including those engaged in aggregation). The specifications for the flexibility services shall be defined by the DSO in close cooperation with CERA and the TSOC. The local flexibility markets shall be operated by the Market Operator in close cooperation with the DSO. 89  Estimated timeframe for meeting this objective is 8-12 months after the deadline of transposition of the recast Electricity Directive to the national legislation i.e. September 2021 to January 2022. Non-discriminatory  It is estimated that by 2030 there is going to be in Cyprus an untapped Demand Response potential of around 50 MW. The existing Trade and Settlement Rules (version 2.0.1) were reviewed in October 2019 and a related proposal was submitted by the TSOC to the Regulator for approval. This proposal better reflects the provisions of Article 15(8) of the Directive 2012/27/EU.  Non-discriminatory participation of Electricity Storage in the envisaged CEM  There is an estimated 130MW pumped storage potential by 2030 in Cyprus. The Regulator Official Gazette of the Republic of Cyprus with which the Storage Systems installed upwards the metering point and which are not combined with local consumption of electricity could potentially participate in the Wholesale Electricity Market. This Regulatory Decision also instructs the TSOC to take into consideration the technical parameters of Storage Systems and proceed with the necessary amendments to the Trade and Settlement Rules (TSRs) and the Transmission and Distribution Rules (TDRs) until the 31/7/2020. These systems will be able to participate in all the stages of the CEM and be able to contract bilaterally with RES Generators and Aggregators of RES-E for clearing their imbalances collectively. The storage systems will not be charged for use of the grid during the charging cycle.  Specific products for high-performance ancillary services could be defined (e.g. fast primary regulation, synthetic inertia.), to be provided by storage systems and remunerated according -for- Introduction of an intraday market Currently, the electricity market is open to independent suppliers and generators that may engage in energy-only bilateral contracts, which are cleared on a monthly basis. All balancing and ancillary services are provided by the incumbent Electricity Authority of Cyprus. A fully functioning competitive electricity market (CEM) is scheduled to become commercially operational by the end of 2021. The CEM will comprise of a Forward, a Day-Ahead, a centrally run Integrated Scheduling Process and a Balancing Market. An Intraday market will be introduced at a later stage. Specifically, the revised Trade and Settlement Rules provide for the introduction of an intraday market 24 months after the operation of the CEM. Intraday trading is required in order to minimize the exposure of market participants to imbalances. If the interconnection of Cyprus with Greece via the Euroasia Interconnector takes place, a cross-border intraday market with a continuous trading up to one hour before delivery will be introduced. Estimated timeframe for meeting this objective is October 2021 to December 2021.   90  Introduction of dynamic-pricing retail contracts According to the final provisions of the Electricity Directive (recast), dynamic pricing retail contracts will be introduced gradually as the installation of smart meters is roll out and the competitive electricity market becomes operational. This target is also related to Energy Efficiency Dimension (See 3.2.i). Cyprus shall provide the necessary regulatory framework to ensure that final customers who have a smart meter installed can request to conclude a dynamic electricity contract from a supplier that has more than 200.000 final customers. Suppliers with less than 200.000 final customers will not be obliged to offer dynamic-pricing retail contracts. Estimated timeframe for meeting this objective is 8-12 months after the installation of 200.000 smart meters i.e. September 2025- December 2025. 2.4.3.2. ii. Where applicable, national objectives related to the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met Priority Dispatch for RES and High Efficient Combine Heat and Power (HECHP) CERA, in close cooperation with the TSO and DSO, shall amend, if necessary, the existing TSRs to provide for a correct interpretation of the concept of priority dispatch for RES and HECHP. Day-ahead and upward balancing offers by RES and HECHP should be cleared before offers of other sources with the same price; thus, RES and HECHP shall have priority only if they offer the same price as other sources. Estimated timeframe for meeting this objective is December 2020.  Technical Bidding Limits CERA will review and decide whether to allow for the submission of a Negative Priced Downward Offers in the Balancing Market, so as to provide an incentive to RES to participate in downward balancing. Estimated timeframe for meeting this objective is December 2020. Strategic Reserve CERA and the TSOC (Market Operator) to review the need and if required introduce a strategic (contingency) reserve mechanism to address short-term capacity adequacy concerns. Units participating in this mechanism will be held outside the electricity market and will be dispatched in case day-ahead and intraday markets have failed to clear and the TSO has exhausted all balancing resources. The TSO shall conduct Yearly Auctions for the procurement of Contingency Reserve. The Contingency Reserve will be technology-neutral, i.e. will allow the participation of DR, Storage and RES with the necessary technical capability. 91  The design of the Contingency Reserve is already provisioned in Chapter 5 of the most recent version of the Trade and Settlement Rules (v2.0.1). These provisions shall be reviewed by the Regulator and the TSOC so as to ensure compliance with Articles 21 and 22 of the Regulation (EU) 2019/943 on the internal market for electricity and in light of the position of the European Commission to the pre-notification of this mechanism by the TSOC (DG Competition, State-Aid, Case no. SA. 53729). 2.4.3.3. iii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to ensuring that consumers participate in the energy system and benefit from self-generation and new technologies, including smart meters; Advanced Metering Infrastructure The objective to deploy an Advanced Metering Infrastructure, including the roll-out of 400.000 smart meters by January 2027 will enable the optimization and control of the distribution system, increase the penetration of distributed renewable sources, enable aggregation of RES, demand response and storage and increase direct final customer participation in all market stages (active customers). Furthermore, it will contribute to increased system observability, load and generation forecasting accuracy, accurate system analysis and planning, load management alternative to ripple control, optimization of the operation of the distribution system, supervisory control and data acquisition of Photovoltaic systems.  The existence of a smart meter is necessary for the provision of consumer functionalities, such as near real-time feedback on their energy consumption or generation. Smart meter functionalities will be prescribed according to the requirements of Article 20 of the Electricity Directive (recast), which, among others, foresee for the provision of information to final customers on actual time of use.  Timeline: 400.000 smart meters will be equally divided in seven (7) installation rounds, each round consisting of the installation of 57.143 smart meters. The completion date for the first round is January 2021 and for the seventh round in January 2027.  Meter Data Management System Competitive market operation and customer participation require the installation of an MDMS system for the central data management of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). The MDMS shall provide integration with the Meter Data Collection Systems and other utility information systems (SCADA, GIS) and functionalities such as Data Warehousing and Management, Meter Operations, Data Validation-Editing-Estimation (VEE). Third-party (suppliers, MO) connection to Meter Management through the External Information System (EIS), to implement the energy market provisions related to the provision of the metering data of individual customers to their Suppliers as well as the aggregated invoices to the Energy Suppliers in the market. MDMS also allows the DSO to operate as an independent entity in a multi-energy supplier market and to facilitate DSOs main business processes. Timeline: MDMS is expected to be completed by December 2020.  92  SCADA/ADMS The project includes the design, engineering, supply, installation, configuration, testing and commissioning of a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition/Advanced Distribution Management System (SCADA/ADMS) and its integration with the GIS and Transmission SCADA/EMS System operated by the TSOC. The SCADA communicates with 175 RTUs installed at MV Level equipment. The ADMS shall provide, among other functionalities, applications for Power Flow, Switching Order Management, Short Circuit Analysis, Short-Term Load and Generation Forecasting, RES Management and Curtailment, Emergency Load Shedding and Restoration, Cyclic Load Shedding and Restoration, Outage Management System and Power Quality Monitoring. Timeline: SCADA/ADMS is expected to be completed in 2021. 2.4.3.4. iv. National objectives with regard to ensuring electricity system adequacy, as well as for the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met Covered by previous sections. 2.4.3.5. v. Where applicable, national objectives to protect energy consumers and improve the competitiveness of the retail energy sector Protect Energy Consumers Independent Comparison Tools According to Article 14 of the Electricity Directive (recast), the national legislation shall be amended to provide at least one independent comparison tool to small customers (households and microenterprises with an expected yearly consumption of below 100.000 kWh) in order to assess the merits of different energy offers available on the market. The comparison tool will provide clear, concise and comprehensive information by including the available offers in the whole market. The information given will be trustworthy, impartial and transparent. The comparison tool will be operated by a national authority or by a private company. Timeline: Independent Comparison Tool is expected to become operational in 2022. Right of customers to switch suppliers within a maximum of three weeks According with the Electricity Directive (recast), the national legislation will be amended to provide the right to customers for switching suppliers within a maximum of three weeks. By 2026 the technical process of switching suppliers shall take no longer than 24 hours and shall be possible on any working day. Citizen Energy Communities 93  In order to empower citizens, the national legislation will be amended, according with the Electricity Directive (recast), to provide a framework for the activation of citizen energy communities, ensure fair treatment, a level playing field and a well-defined catalogue of rights and obligation, such as the freedom of contracting, supplier switching rules, distribution system operator responsibilities, network charges and balancing obligation. The rights and obligations should apply according to the roles undertaken such as the roles of final customers, generators, suppliers, distribution system operators. Access to an energy d cost-reflective terms.  Timeline: The Regulatory Framework for the Citizens Energy Communities to be ready 8 to 12 months after the transposition of the Electricity Directive (recast) into law i.e. September 2021-December 2021.  Improve the competitiveness of the retail energy sector Quantitative and other targets will be introduced at a later stage pending the operation of the new electricity market in 2021. 2.4.4. Energy poverty Where applicable, national objectives with regard to energy poverty, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met each Member State shall define the concept of vulnerable customers which may refer to energy poverty and, inter alia, to the prohibition of disconnection of electricity to such customers in critical timesof energy poverty which was transposed in the Electricity Law36 is: Energy poverty may relate to the situation of customers who may be in a difficult position because of their low income as indicated by their tax statements in conjunction with their professional status, marital status and specific health conditions and therefore, are unable to respond to the costs for the reasonable needs of the supply of electricity, as these costs represent a significant proportion of their disposable income There are also additional provisions in the Electricity Law as to which categories may be included in the categories of vulnerable customers of electricity. Based on the provisions of the Electricity Law, the Minister of Energy, Commerce and Industry, after consultation with CERA and the Minister of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance, has issued an Order (no. K.D.P. 289/2015) regarding the energy poverty, the categories of vulnerable customers of electricity and the measures to be taken to protect such customers. According to the above Order the following categories were determined as categories of vulnerable customers of electricity: (a) Public Assistance recipients from the Social Welfare Services of the Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance.                                                             36 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/EnergySe.nsf/page06_gr/page06_gr?OpenDocument 94  (b) Beneficiaries of the guaranteed minimum income provided by the Welfare Benefits Administration Service of the Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance. (c) Five-member family or family with 3 or more dependent children that receive child benefit from the Welfare Benefits Administration Service of the Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance and with an annual gross family incomthe four. (d) The recipients of the allowance to pensioners with low incomes provided by the Welfare Benefits Administration Service of the Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance provided that they have completed the seventieth (70th) year of age and do not cohabit with another person who has not attained the seventieth (70th) year of age. (e) The recipients of severe motor disability allowance from the Department for Social Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities of the Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance. (f) The recipients of care allowance for quadriplegic persons from the Department for Social Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities of the Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance.  (g) The recipients of care allowance for paraplegic persons from the Department for Social Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities of the Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance  (h) The recipients of special allowance for blind persons from the Department for Social Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities of the Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance. Additionally, the above Order defines the measures to protect vulnerable categories of electricity customers as follows: (a) Reduced prices on electricity tariffs (special electricity tariff 08) which is based on a Ministerial Decision (no. K.D.P. 286/2016). (b) Financial incentives for installing a net-metering Photovoltaic system.  (c) Financial incentives for upgrading the energy efficiency of their houses.  (d) Safeguarding the continuous supply of electricity, during critical periods, to those vulnerable consumers that uninterrupted power supply is essential for reasons related to their health.  The total number of the beneficiaries of all the above vulnerable categories of electricity is 52,645 representing approximately 5.8 % of the total population.  It has to be noted that categories (a) and (b) of the vulnerable customers of electricity, as indicated above, fall within the definition of energy poverty through the Ministerial Order. The total number of beneficiaries who fall within this definition is 23,593, representing approximately 2.62% of the total population. Furthermore, the number of vulnerable consumers who fall within the definition of energy poverty and have applied and benefited since 2013 from the measures is 13.370 representing 1.5% of the total population.  95  It has further been decided to expand the categories of vulnerable customers of electricity and to introduce income criteria in order to target the measures in a fairer way and to those consumers most in need. A new Order to that effect will be issued in 2020
