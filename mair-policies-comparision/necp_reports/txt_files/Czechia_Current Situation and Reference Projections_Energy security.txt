In 2016 total primary energy sources amounted to 1 790.6 TJ. Solid fuels, especially brown and black coal, accounted for the largest share  38.69 % (excluding electricity, which was negative). The second biggest source of energy is crude oil (and derived petroleum products), which accounted for 19.42 % in 2016. Natural gas accounted for 16.41 %. Nuclear reaction heat contributed 14.69 %. Renewables accounted for 10.08 %, and waste (its non-renewable component) accounted for around 1 % of the total energy mix.

The Czech Republic is, in essence, fully dependent on imports from third countries in the field of oil and natural gas. The Czech Republic extracts oil and natural gas, but the quantities are marginal given the overall need. The development of local production of biomethane, synthetic methane and hydrogen can in the future contribute to reducing import dependency for natural gas, as well as for oil with higher use of biofuels. In the case of consumption of solid fuels, especially brown and black coal, the Czech Republic is currently self-sufficient. Nuclear fuel for both domestic nuclear power plants is also imported; after the cessation of uranium mining in 2017, the Czech Republic is also fully dependent on imports of feedstock for the enrichment and manufacture of nuclear fuel. The Czech Republic is also an electricity exporter (about 11 TWh in 2016).

It is obvious that the increase of physical diversification (i.e. diversification of naeven in the case of continued development of cross-border infrastructure.

The development of local production of biomethane or synthetic methane and hydrogen is also an important measure which contributes to reducing the import dependence of natural gas or to increasing its diversification. Estimated development of gas from renewables is given in 4.2.2.  -239-  Chart 84: Natural gas balance in the Czech Republic  Source: Expected long-term balance between gas supply and demand (OTE, a.s., 2018) Chart 85: Expected diversification of natural gas sources (2017)  Source: Monitoring the Internal Electricity and Natural Gas Markets in 2017 (ACER/CEER) 4.4.1.4 Diversification in oil and petroleum products In 2017 the Czech Republic imported 7 813.6 thousand tonnes of crude oil (average imports over the last 10 years total 7 127.5 thousand tonnes). The largest part was imported from the Russian Federation (52.47 %), Azerbaijan (31.04 %) and Kazakhstan (12.62 %); other countries accounted for 3.86 %. Domestic mining in 2016 was only 117 thousand tonnes. The Czech Republic uses two crude oil pipelines: the Druzhba pipeline (transport capacity available to the Czech Republic is 9 million tonnes of oil per year), which mainly transports oil from Russia, and the IKL pipeline (transport capacity of 10 million tonnes of oil per year), which transports oil from the Caspian Sea. The Czech Republic thus  -240-  enjoys diversification of both sources and transport routes. In 2017, oil import costs totalled CZK 72 396 million (the average over the last 10 years is CZK 84 947 million). The Czech Republic also imports some petroleum products as well as exports a part of its own petroleum products. The total negative balance of foreign trade in oil and petroleum products is therefore approximately CZK 80 billion. million. In 2017, the negative balance was CZK 91.7 billion; in 2014, however, it was CZK 136.3 billion. The Czech Republic processes oil in two refineries in Litvínov and Kralupy. The aggregate processing capacity of both refineries is approximately 8.7 million tonnes of oil per year. The domestic refinery output covers approximately 80 % of national gasoline and diesel consumption. The refinery in Litvínov   in particular the Russian Export Blend, which is transported to the Czech Republic by the Druzhba pipeline (and a relatively small quantity also by the IKL pipeline). The refinery in -sulphur crude oil imported into the Czech Republic by the IKL oil pipeline, namely oil from the Caspian Sea, i.e. the Azeri, CPC and Turkmen blends, as well as crude oil from North Africa.149 Chart 86: Imports of petroleum into the Czech Republic by country of origin in 20052016  Source: Czech Statistical Office                                                            149  For more information, see the Report on the Development of the Energy Sector in Oil and Petroleum Products 2016, available at: https://www.mpo.cz/cz/energetika/statni-energeticka-politika/zprava-o-vyvoji-energetickeho-sektoru-v-oblasti-ropy-a-ropnych-produktu-za-rok-2016--235988/  -241-  Chart 87: Development of crude oil imports into the Czech Republic by Druzhba and IKL pipelines, 20002016  Source: MERO, a.s.

To this end, and in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2019/943, it prepares and publishes on a yearly basis the Assessment of the Czech Electricity System Source Adequacy. The current assessment covers the period until 2040 and its full version is available  https://www.ceps.cz/cs/priprava-provozu English version: https://www.ceps.cz/en/generation-adequacy ) and MIT websites. Assessment of the Czech Electricity System Source Adequacy for 2019 was prepared in accordance with the methodological recommendations of ENTSO-E. In addition to the established medium-term resource adequacy outlook, it also includes a longer-term strategic outlook until 2040. In terms of methodology, attention was paid to further development of computational methods. The report was first compiled on the basis of production resource data collected in a digitised way via a web interface. The evaluation builds on the European ENTSO-E Adequacy Assessment and elaborates on the issue of adequacy for the Czech Republic in more detail (considering more scenarios). In particular, the results of the low carbon sensitivity scenario can be recalled from the European assessment. This sensitivity scenario for the impacts of environmental policies is up to date with regard to the price of allowances, the price of which is usually above 25 EUR/EUA in the second quarter of 2019. This scenario indicates reliability difficulties in traditional coal countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic and Germany, but also in Italy, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Figure 7: MAF 2018 results  Low-Carbon Sensitivity scenario, LOLE values in 2025  Source ENTSO-E Power Facts Calculations were performed in the scenarios as part of the Assessments, which show that the reliability standards are not met. If full availability of control power is required, which at all times corresponds to the fulfilment of the N-1 coverage requirement, a high LOLE value is calculated for the Baseline Scenario: (i) 42 hours for 2025; (ii) 256 hours for 2030.  -243-  In order to achieve the maximum recommended LOLE values (3 to 6 hours/year), it is necessary to implement measures to ensure performance balance (including the possible introduction of capacity mechanisms, for example in the form of strategic reserves). Figure 8: LOLE and EENS probability indicators for the Baseline Scenario for 2030, including export and import  Source: Evaluation of the source adequacy of the Czech Republic by 2040 (MAF CZ) The analyses show that the level of installed capacity will decrease due to the gradual decommissioning of coal sources and the end of the service life of nuclear sources. The planned development of RES and decentralised production according to the above calculations contribute to the security of electricity supply only to a limited extent. With regard to the development of power balances of neighbouring countries in our region, we cannot rely solely on import to ensure a safe and reliable supply. At present, there is no new source in the Czech Republic in preparation or implementation with an installed capacity of hundreds of MW which could be put into operation in the outlook until 2030. In the medium term, additional investment in fossil fuel sources is limited. This is mainly because of the environmental measures for fossil sources and the subsequent need for higher investments connected with their implementation.  For 2040, high trade exchanges from countries with high electricity surpluses to countries with major deficiencies can be expected based on the simulations. For the Czech Republic, the operation of Dukovany NPP is no longer considered in 2040 and the resulting balance is thus significantly deficient. According to the resulting analyses, the Czech Republic becomes dependent on the import of electricity from abroad in 2040.  The LOLE reliability indicators for 2040 are as follows: (i) 678 hours per year for scenario A; (ii) 3 622 hours per year for scenario B. In such an environment, the reliability of the supply must be ensured by sufficient performance and timely preparation of legislative, regulatory and technical measures to ensure such performance. One of  -244-  the permissible options under Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council is the introduction of a capacity mechanism following the appropriate steps.  The related steps in implementing the measures under consideration include the estimation of VoLL and LOLE and EENS reliability standards, which is the responsibility of the Member State under Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council. In addition to the Evaluation, the necessary more detailed regional evaluation was carried out for the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hunwhich does not expect an energy shortage in the given group of countries by 2025.  4.4.1.6 Securing long-term supplies of nuclear materials and fuel Nuclear fuel for the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant is purchased on the basis of a long-term contract valid until 2028 (including an option) from the Russian company TVEL, which provides not only its production (fabrication), but also the conversion and enrichment services and part of the raw uranium. Fuel is currently being used at an increased output of 105 % in a full five-year fuel cycle, thanks to the latest fuel innovation (Gd-2M +) that is being introduced since 2014. ts on the basis of a long-term fuel contract. TVSA-T fuel supported the shift to the 104 % increased power over a four-year fuel cycle and it provides the potential for safe unit operation over a partially five-year duty cycle. In 2018, an advanced type of fuel with increased uranium content and increased structural rigidity (TVSA-T mod2) was introduced in Unit 2, allowing further increase in fuel efficiency. For the production of nuclear fuel, the raw uranium and the related processing (conversion and enrichment) were provided on the basis of long-term contracts, both by purchasing from foreign suppliers and within direct fuel supplies from its producer (mainly for Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant). Due to the termination of commercial uranium mining in the Czech Republic by DIAMO, domestic uranium is no longer purchased, but the processing of its reserves held by CEZ will continues to cover approximately half of the total uranium needs of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant in 2019. A contract with a foreign uranium producer signed in 2018 covered approximately 50 % of the uranium needs for the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant until 2025. The total needs for uranium as well as conversion and enrichment services for CEZ-operated nuclear power plants are contractually fully met until at least 2020, and some contractual commitments continue until 2025. The desirable diversification of the supply base is maintained in line with the EURATOM Supply ption or endangerment of nuclear fuel supplies within the required deadlines, CEZ has already taken the decision to increase the proportion of manufactured fuel at the power plant site at the expense of reducing strategic uranium reserves at various stages of processing held by its suppliers. During 2015 and 2016, two complete nuclear fuel charges were delivered to the Temelín Nuclear Power Plant. In 2017, three charges were delivered and in 2018 a fourth one was delivered for the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant. Additional transhipments for the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant will be delivered in the coming years. At the same time, the project of developing and licencing the Lead Test Assemblies of an alternative fuel supplier, Westinghouse Electric Sweden, is ongoing. In 2019, these six units were delivered and put into Unit 1 of the Temelín Nuclear Power Plant. Among other things, the Czech Republic presents this information continuously within the framework of Uranium Resources, Production and Demand (Nuclear Energy Agency).  -245-  Table 87: Nuclear fuel reserves at Dukovany site (NPD) and their expected development Horizon Level of inventories [years of operation] Level of inventories [number of transhipments] Form of contract Fulfilment of the standard Until 2018 Approximately 2 years of operation of the power plant is ensured (including the fuel already loaded into the core of each reactor). 4 Long-term contract with JSC TVEL until 2028 (including option for delivery after 2024).

YES As the NPD operator, CEZ monitors the development and steps taken by the EURATOM initiative within the ESSANUF project in relation to the possibility of qualifying the VVER-440 alternative fuel design by Westinghouse. However, there is currently no real alternative fuel supplier for NPD that could deliver an alternative for Gd-2M + fuel from the Russian supplier JSC TVEL, and therefore the goal of security of supply is met by creating inventories for 4 years of operation. Table 88: Nuclear fuel reserves at Temelín site (TNPP) and their expected development Horizon Level of inventories [years of operation] Level of inventories [number of transhipments] Method of securing Fulfilment of the standard From 2016 Approximately 2 years of operation of the power plant is ensured (including the fuel 2 Long-term contract with TVEL until 2023.

From 2024 Approximately 2 years of operation of the power plant is ensured (including the fuel already loaded into the core of each reactor). 2 A contract signed with the contractor(s) selected on the basis of a tender in combination with other development and validation projects allowing the operation of mixed zones, including the operational transition to an alternative supplier of the qualified fuel VVER 1000. YES The implementation of the Leading Test Assemblies (LTA) programme for the Westinghouse fuel at TNPP and the announcement of a tender for a new fuel supplier are, together, a prerequisite for meeting the target of qualifying (de-licencing) the fuel of two alternative suppliers, and thus obtaining the possibility of deploying mixed zones in TNPP and, last but not least, gaining real experience with the design and operation of the mixed zone of two alternative suppliers. Consequently, the level of achievement of this objective will be one of the criteria for the amount of established and maintained strategic fuel reserves after 2024, as defined by the safety standard. Based on the current risk assessment, it is clear that maintaining one fuel transhipments per year is sufficient to cover most of the known threats to the security of nuclear fuel supply.

Projections of development with existing policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) The development of energy security is relatively difficult to be described quantitatively. Annex 2, which provides a detailed list of parameters and variables, includes an indicator of import dependence. This indicator is currently at around 33 %. The Czech Republic is almost fully dependent on imports of natural gas and oil, which make up a significant part of domestic energy consumption. Even in the future it can be assumed that the Czech Republic will be almost exclusively dependent on these fuels. An increase in import dependence may also be facilitated by an increase in the use of these fuels, particularly natural gas, which will be important as a partial replacement of domestic coal. In the future, import dependence can be expected to increase, especially due to the decreasing domestic coal consumption at the expense of imported fuels. Also, the Czech Republic is currently a relatively large net electricity exporter, but in the future a relative reduction of the exported quantity can be expected. Chart 89 shows the expected development of import dependence. Energy security does not only depend on import dependence but also on a number of other circumstances, such as diversification rate, country of origin, etc. This information should be available or derivable from analytical data in Annex 2.                                                            150  For a unit that is approaching outage (end of the campaign), 2 tanks (2x18 PS = 36 PS) are filled and prepared for the transport of FNF from storage to the unit and after their emptying it is only possible to refill them by a delivery from a fuel supplier, i.e. usually several weeks before the outage starts. 151  A total of 13 containers are available for the FNF, but at least 1 container must remain free for continuous handling and preparation of charges. 152  Containers (for hermetic cases) would have to be adapted for the storage of FNF.  -248-  Chart 89: Expected development of import dependence  Source: Prepared by MIT for the purposes of the National Plan 4.5  4.5.1 Electricity interconnectivity153 i. Current interconnection level and main interconnectors154 The methods of determining the degree of electricity interconnectivity may vary according to what the total available transmission capacity of all the profiles of the given system is related to. The 10 % interconnection target under the Barcelona Agreement is measured as the ratio of net transmission capacity to installed production capacity  with an emphasis on the integration of the internal electricity market. The current State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic determines the degree of integration into  transmission capacity in relation to the maximum load determined by the share of the total export/import capacity of the transmission system in the given year and the outlook for the maximum net load of the transmission system for the given year. For the purpose of comparing the two above methods of determining the degree of electricity interconnectivity, the outlooks of interconnectivity rates (export/import) for the years 2019, 2024 and  reiterated that the determination of to ensure complete comparability of outputs, the calculation would have to take place under fixed and identical conditions, especially for security reserves, which mainly take into account the circular flows,                                                            153  The National Plan
