Dimension Decarbonisation   GHG emissions and removals28 i. The elements set out in point (a)(1) of Article 4 The agreement of the European Union to the Paris Agreement concluded in 2015 is binding and covers all economic sectors.  The objective is to reduce GHG emissions by 40% compared to the 1990 level by 2030.  To achieve the overall target, all sectors falling under the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) will have to reduce their emissions by 43% compared to 2005 by 2030. Emissions from the sectors that fall outside the emissions trading scheme (transport, agriculture, waste management and industrial processes and small-scale energy production where energy is produced by equipment with a rated output less than 20 MW), must be reduced by 30% compared to                                                            28Consistency to be ensured with long-term strategies pursuant to Article 15. the 2005 level by 2030. The objective also concerns the land use, changes in land use change and forestry (so-called LULUCF) sector, which should contribute towards eached a detailed agreement on how to meet the target of the Paris Agreement in early 2018, and EU internal legislation was adopted on reduction of GHG emissions.  Agreement was reached on reform of the EU ETS reform, objectives of emissions reduction in sectors not covered by EU ETS and details of how the LULUF sector relates to the EU climate and energy framework. Table 4 shows the binding GHG reduction/restriction targets for Estonia under the Shared Effort Regulation and the LULUCF Regulation in the relevant sectors.  The Shared Effort Regulation lays down binding emission reduction targets for the Member States over the period 2021-2030 in the sectors falling outside the scope of the emissions EU ETS scheme. The objective for Estonia is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the above indicated sectors by 13% by 2030 compared to 2005. According to the calculation principles set out in the LULUCF Regulation, the emissions - Table 4. 2030 national binding GHG emission reduction targets for Estonia Target Legal act Achieve 13% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels in the sectors covered by the Shared Effort Regulation Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council29 Ensure that the emissions of the LULUCF sector are compensated by carbon capture by the same sector and the total emissions of the LULUCF sector and carbon capture are at least in balance Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council30  To meet the targets, the Prime Minister established a Government Climate and Energy Committee on 11 July 2019.  The Prime Minister chairs the committee and its members are the Minister for Education and Research, the Minister for Defence, the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Economic Affairs and Infrastructure, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Committee's tasks are to: 1) establish climate and energy policy-related positions for the issues within the                                                             29 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ET/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R0842&from=EN  30 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ET/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R0841&from=EN  2) find cross-sectoral solutions for reduction of the Estonian GHG emissions; 3) assess and make proposals for financing the GHG emission reduction measures; 4) find solutions to ensure national energy security and security of energy supply; 5) coordinate the activities of the competent bodies in implementation of the climate and energy policy; 6) carry out other duties assigned by the Government. To carry out its duties, the Energy and Climate Committee may: 1) give duties to the competent bodies and receive documents and information from them; 2) start preparing analyses and make enquiries; 3) receive documents and data from the competent bodies necessary for its work. ii. Where applicable, other national objectives and targets consistent with the Paris Agreement and the existing long-term strategies. Where applicable for the contribution to the overall Union commitment of reducing the GHG emissions, other objectives and targets, including sector targets and adaptation goals, if available  is a European strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate neutral economy. Numerous political discussions took place among the Member States in 2019 and it is planned to reach the joint position at the European Council at the end of 2019. The analysis of the opportunities to increase climate ambition in Estonia commissioned by the Government Office was completed in September 2019.  This analysis was compiled by SEI Tallinn and OÜ Finantsakadeemia Eesti and it assessed Estonia's opportunities to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, including which changes should be policy objectives. On the basis of this analysis, the Estonian Government decided on 3 October 2019 to support the establishment of an EU-wide long-term climate neutrality objective by 2015 if there are sufficient transition measures and the differences and different baselines of Member States and sectors are taken into account. Member States should retain the right to select appropriate ways of achieving the targets, including making sovereign tax assessments to achieve climate neutrality. -term objective of transitioning to a low-carbon emission economy, which means iterative, purposeful reorganisation of the economy and energy system to make it more resource-efficient, productive and greener.  This means changes not only in power generation, transEstonia by 2050 is to reduce the GHG emission by approximately 80% compared to the level in 1990 (see Table 5). Table 5. National long-term GHG emission reduction targets Target Legal act Approximately 70% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 and 80% reduction by 2050 compared to 1990 level in Estonia General Principles of Climate Policy until 205031 and capacity to adapt to the impact of climate change at national, regional and local level. Plan for climate change adaptation by 203032;  Adaptation to climate change The strategic objective of the development plan for climate change adaption is to at national, regional and local level. Implementation of the development plan will he impact of climate change at national, regional and local level and identify the areas that are most vulnerable to climate change. The development plan will plan and control how we adapt to the impact of climate change as a whole using a single strategy document. The approach to climate change adaptation will be coordinated and harmonised. This will ensure cohesion between sectors in adapting to climate change. The development plan sets eight sub-objectives according to the eight priority areas: These are: 1. health and rescue capability; 2. planning and land-use, including coastal areas, other areas with flood risk/soil risk, land improvement, irrigation, drainage, urban planning; 3. natural environment, including biodiversity, terrestrial ecosystems, freshwater ecosystems and environment, the Baltic Sea and marine environment, ecosystem services; 4. bioeconomy, including agriculture, forestry, fishing, game and hunting, tourism, peat extraction; 5. economy, including, insurance, banking and other financial institutions, employment, business and entrepreneurship, industry; 6. society, awareness and collaboration, including education, awareness and scientific research, communication, society, international relationships and collaboration; 7. infrastructure and buildings, including technical support systems, transport; and                                                            31 http://www.envir.ee/sites/default/files/362xiii_rk_o_04.2017-1.pdf  32 https://www.envir.ee/et/eesmargid-tegevused/kliima/klNmamuutustega-kohanemise-arengukava  8. energy and energy supply, including energy independence, security and safety of supply, energy resources, application of energy efficiency, heating, electricity production. A just transition Estonia signed the Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia Declaration at the end of 2018 at COP24 in Poland. The aim of the Declaration is to consider the rights and opportunities of the workforce in planning and implementing climate policy and to involve the labour market parties to ensure public support for long-term emission reduction and to enable countries to achieve the long-term targets of the Paris Agreement.   Renewable energies i. The elements set out in point (a)(2) of Article 4 targets that comply with the agreed EU targets laid down in Directives (EU) 2018/2001 and (EU) 2018/1999), including milestones (at least 18% of the general target must be achieved by 2022, at least 43% by 2025 and at least 65% of the general target by 2027).  The target levels of the trajectories are based on projections that take into account current renewable energy generation and consumption trends Estonian renewable energy energy statistics sold within the framework of statistical transfer must be deducted from the levels indicated in the renewable energy trajectories shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 below shows the share of renewable energy and the final target of different sectors and their achievement. The national goal for 2030 set in National Energy Development Plan 2030 (ENMAK 2030) was that the volume of renewable energy consumed would be at least 50% of final energy consumption (~16 TWh). The targets using the common EU format and methodology. Hence the renewable energy target (42%) set in NECP 2030 is somewhat different from the description in ENMAK 2030; the NECP 2030 sets out the renewable energy targets towards the gross final consumption of energy, while the targets in ENMAK 2030 are for final energy consumption.  The gross final consumption of energy is higher than the final energy consumption since it also contains the own consumption of the production equipment of electricity and heating and the energy network losses. As with ENMAK 2030, renewable energy consumption in 2030 will be ~16 TWh according to NECP 2030. It is important to note that the higher the share of renewable energy in 2030, the more successful we are in meeting our energy efficiency targets. The national ENMAK 2030 for 2030, according to which, renewable energy forms at least 50% or 16 TWh of the final energy consumption in the final energy consumption of 32 TWh by 2030, is achieved according to the projection provided in Table 7, where production of different renewable energy sources totals 16 TWh in 2030.  The share of renewable energy in total final consumption will be at least 42% by the year 2030. The targets of the sector are as follows:  Electricity - the share of renewable electrical energy in the domestic electricity consumption must be at least 30% according to NDPES 203033. According to NECP 2030, the share of renewable energy must be 40% of the gross final consumption of energy.  Transport - according to NDPES 2030, the renewable energy target for transport (share of  final consumption) has been identified only for 2020. NECP 2030 has also indicated the target level for 2030 - 14% of the gross final consumption of energy of the transport sector34.  Heat - according to NDPES 2030, 11 TWh of the total heat demand will be met by biomass in 2030, and some 80% of district heating in Estonia will be provided using renewable sources.  Given the volume of reconstruction of the building stock (this will be determined when the long-term strategy for the reconstruction of the building stock is drawn up, by March 2020) and projections of the development of renewable fuels in the district heating sector updated by the sector, the renewable fuels (11 TWh) will account for at least 63% of gross final heat consumption in 2030 (17.4 TWh in 2030).                                                            33 If the flexible collaboration mechanisms with other EU Member States are started successfully, it is possible to increase the share of electric energy from renewable energy sources in the final electricity consumption in Estonia to 50% according to ESDP 2030. ENMAK 2030 p. 30 https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/enmak_2030.pdf  34 Mandatory for the Member States under Directive 2018/2001/EU (the Renewable Energy Directive).   Figure 2: Share of renewable energy of final energy consumption in Estonia, overall and by sector. The 2020 figures are based on forecasts. The statistical volumes of renewable energy sold to the other Member States within the statistical transfer should be deducted from the forecasts.

Estimated trajectories for the sectoral share of renewable energy in final energy consumption from 2021 to 2030 in the electricity, heating and cooling, and transport sector Renewable energy in the electricity supply The estimated trajectory of the share of renewable energy in electrical energy consumption is shown in Figure 2 above. In the following decade, wind energy will have the highest growth potential (from both on-shore as well as off-shore wind farms), as will solar energy, please see Table 7. Renewable energy in heating The estimated trajectory of the share of renewable energy in heat energy consumption is shown in Figure 2 above in Chapter 2.1.2.i. Heat pumps have the highest growth potential in heating and cooling energy, please see Table 7. Renewable energy in transport Figure 3 below shows the estimated renewable energy trajectory in the transport sector in accordance with the new provisions of the Renewable Energy Directive. We envisage an increase in the share of second generation biofuels and electrical energy in the next decade.  We are working to reduce the share of the first generation biofuels in transport to a minimum as soon as possible. We wish to meet as much as possible of the consumption demand for second generation fuels with domestically produced fuel. Production of domestic biomethane and its use in transport have the highest potential. To meet the objectives, it is necessary to produce 340 GWh of biomethane by 2030 (the actual necessary volume, without multipliers). The role of electricity consumption in the transport sector will grow sharply after 2025. Consumption will rise significantly due to amendments to the Clean Vehicles Directive, lower prices of electric vehicles and their resulting rise in popularity, as well as the  electrification of railways and the completion of Rail Baltic. The contribution of the types of the energy carriers and biofuels shown in Figure 3 has been highlighted without multipliers (i.e. as actual volumes) but the final target considers the multipliers (electromobility x 4 and electricity used in railway transport x 1.5) where the calculations include the share of renewable electricity two years ago; the biofuels from raw materials highlighted in Part A of Annex 9 of the Renewable Energy Directive are double-counted).

Estimated trajectories by renewable energy technology that the Member State projects to use to achieve the overall and sectoral trajectories for renewable energy from 2021 to 2030, including expected total gross final energy consumption per technology and sector in Mtoe and total planned installed capacity (divided by new capacity and repowering) per technology and sector in MW Targets for renewables agreed at EU and national level will be achieved in the most cost-efficient way, with a focus on being high efficiency and market-based. To develop renewable energy by focusing on solutions that make maximum use of the opportunities  also plays an important role. We prefer solutions that enable a maximum increase in the efficiency of this resource.  Using biomass is in line with the environmental sustainability and biodiversity conservation aspects and biomass sustainability criteria under the Renewable Energy Directive and compliance can be certified (e.g. with certificates that verify relevant sustainable forest management and production of wood fuels).  We see the synergies between the sectors, (e.g. between energy efficiency, the energy performance of buildings and renewable energy solutions) as an important potential for achieving the targets. Chapter 2.1.2.1 sets out specific renewable energy trajectories by sector and technology solution. Given that electricity and thermal energy production generated a total of 11 TWh of renewable energy in Estonia as at 2017, a capacity of approximately 5 TWh will be added by 2030. Table 7 shows the sector-based contribution of renewable energy technologies to the trajectory of the renewable energy targets. Table 7.

Trajectories on bioenergy demand, disaggregated between heat, electricity and transport, and on biomass supply, by feedstock and origin (distinguishing between domestic production and imports). For forest biomass, an assessment of its source and impact on the LULUCF sink, where available. Figure 4 shows the trajectories for bioenergy in Estonia up until 2030.  Figure 4. Bioenergy production in Estonia (GWh) up to 2030 Key: Vedelkütuste segamine = Mixing of liquid fuel Biometaan (kordajateta) = Biomethane (without multipliers) Bioenergia, kokku = Bioenergy, total The ability to meet the demand for bioenergy was limited by weather conditions, stricter climate requirements (incl. the LULUCF sector carbon capture obligation), the need to ensure the functioning of the green network formed to protect EU biodiversity, biomass sustainability criteria, the growing use of biomass as a replacement for fossil materials as well as changes in fuel prices. Wood is used for energy in Estonia to an extent in line with the sustainable allowable cut of the forestry development plan.  The use of wood and wood fuels has increased and will increase more in the next few years.  A total of 13.1 million solid cubic metres of wood was felled from woodland and outside woodland in 2017. Of this, 5.5 million solid cubic metres were used domestically in energy and 2.7 million solid cubic metres of wood35 (i.e. over half) was exported as wood pellets.  In 2017, 2.4 TWh of thermal energy was produced from wood-fuelled boilers, and in 2018, the power station produced an unprecedented 4.2 TWh of thermal energy and 1.1 TWh of electrical energy from wood fuels (total production of power stations was 12.3 TWh)36. There are 17 active biogas stations in Estonia and biomethane is produced by two undertakings (one using agricultural output, the other using biogas from the wastewater of an undertaking that produces aspen pulp37) The estimated biomethane production potential is 450 million m3/year, which is greater than half of the demand for natural gas in Estonia is recent years38. Estonia has 2.33 million ha of woodland, of which 25.6% has economic constraints. This includes 13.1% which are strictly protected forests and 12.5% which are forests with economic constraints. The total woodland reserve area is 486 million m3. Total woodland reserve growth was 16.1 million m3 in 2017 and 14.1 million m3 for managed forest. The allowed cut volumes are determined as a social agreement in the forestry development plans for a ten-year period.  The current forestry development plan for the period until 2020 stipulated the possible volumes of use of the wood resources for active, moderate and declining wood supply scenarios.  According to the moderate scenario, the long-term sustainable level of the forestry sector was estimated at 12-15 million m3 per year. According to the biomass atlas39 compiled by the Estonian University of Life Sciences, timber may be used at its current annual sustainable volume until 2033, see Figure 5.                                                            35 . https://www.keskkonnaagentuur.ee/sites/default/files/elfinder/article_files/puidubilanss_2017_0.pdf 36 Statistics Estonia data sheets KE033, KE035 and KE043 www.stat.ee 37 Estonian Cell Keskkonnaleht 8 August 2019 file:///C:/Users/Irje.Moldre/Downloads/Keskkonnaleht_EstonianCell2019_prew4.pdf  38 Estonian Biogas Association http://eestibiogaas.ee/tootmine-ja-kasutamine.  39 ar and Ahto Kangur https://www.eramets.ee/seminar  Figure 5 The use scenarios of Estonian forests (maturity cutting area by prevalence species, consistent use felling area, total), HB (aspen), KS (birch), KU (spruce), LM (alder), LV (grey alder), MA (pine), SA (ash), XX (other species), HR (thinning), Uhtlane (consistent) Key: Lisaks HR olenevalt vanuselisest struktuurist 1,6-2,5 miljonit m3 = Also HR (thinning), depending on the age-class structure 1.6-2.5 million m3 Arvestuslank, miljonit m3/aasta = Estimated felling, million m3/year v. Where applicable, other national trajectories and objectives, including those that are long term or sectoral (e.g. share of renewable energy in district heating, renewable energy use in buildings, renewable energy produced by cities, renewable energy communities and renewables self-consumers, energy recovered from the sludge acquired through the treatment of wastewater) Share of renewable energy in district heating The heating sector has been consistently switching to renewable sources in recent years and the share of renewable energy has now reached 51.64%. More and more boiler stations and cogeneration plants have switched to renewable fuels and according to figures for 2017, the share of the renewable energy was 52%, of which 93% was labelled as efficient district heating.  The efficient district heating label is granted to district heating systems where at least 50% of renewable energy or 50% of waste heat, 75% of cogenerated heat or 50% of a combination of such energy and heat is used for heat generation in accordance with the Energy Efficiency Directive (Directive 2012/27/EU). This label attests the efficiency of the district heating and the share of renewable energy or cogeneration in the heating supplied by the network. It is important to note that the biomass used in the heating sector must comply with sustainability criteria and take into account the waste hierarchy in accordance with the Renewable Energy Directive. Renewable energy consumption in buildings Housing and energy management are very closely related. Energy demand for buildings forms an important part of the energy balance in Estonia. At the same time, both have high potential for energy savings - the energy costs of buildings account for some 40% households forms 42.7% of the total energy balance. The main types of energy consumed are electrical energy, gas and heating, of which the last accounts for the greatest share of consumption. State-applied policies to improve energy efficiency are increasingly focused on energy-efficient buildings and renovating buildings to make them more energy-efficient, thereby reducing energy dependency and GHG emissions from the building stock. In our view, renewable energy solutions must be applied to make the buildings more energy-efficient and, where possible, based on the cost-efficiency aspect. For example, it has been found that new and reconstructed buildings add an estimated solar electricity production capacity of up to 21 MW annually. Renewable energy communities and renewable energy for own consumption A more detailed explanation is provided in Chapter 3.2.v. The current legal system in Estonia enables the creation of renewable energy communities conveniently and easily and the production of renewable energy for own consumption. Under the current Commercial Code, renewable energy communities may act as a limited liability companies as well as public limited companies. The only restriction is that the renewable energy community cannot be a general partnership or a limited partnership within the meaning of the Commercial Code, since the members of these two legal entities cannot be local governments.  However, local governments may form the renewable energy community under the new Renewable Energy Directive. End-consumers, primarily households, retain their rights and obligations according to the statutes of the company, articles of association, etc. The current Electricity Market Act also allows the customer to be in the role of the producer as well as the customer. It is possible to consume self-generated electricity oneself as well as supply it to others and also apply for support under certain conditions
