Energy security (i) Current energy mix, domestic energy resources, import dependency, including relevant risks Figure 36 shows that for gross inland energy consumption in 2017 by energy source:  solids (mainly coal) accounted for 12%  oil accounted for 36%  natural gas accounted for 17%  solid biomass accounted for 19%  other bioenergy accounted for 6%  other renewables (wind and solar) accounted for 9%  waste accounted for 2%  Figure 36. Gross inland energy consumption by energy source 2005-2040 [ktoe].                         157  Figure 37 shows that import dependency in 2017 was 19%. However, as the figure shows, this situation has changed significantly over the past years, and is projected to change in the future.   -sufficiency peaked at 155 % in 2004. Since then, due to decreasing production of oil and gas, import dependency has increased and the phasing out of (imported) coal and increased renewable energy production has not yet been sufficient to covimport dependency is expected to drop significantly, as shown in Figure 37.  The development in the mid- including on the one hand the expiration of energy efficiency measures from the Energy Agreement from June 2018 in 2024, and on the other hand three large wind farms expected to begin operations.  The projected development from 2030 to 2040 reflects the methodology used, i.e. projections done with existing policies and measures. This implies that while projections assume an expected increase of consumption there is currently no decisions on deployment of new production capacity beyond 2030 to offset this increase.

Figure 36 shows from 2017-2040 the gross inland energy consumption. A key result is that solids (mainly coal) decrease 86% from 2017 to 2030 and 87% from 2017 to 2040 and to 2040.  Other results of the projections are:  oil decreases 5% from 2017 to 2030 and 13% from 2017 to 2040   natural gas decreases 40% from 2017 to 2030 and 49% from 2017 to 2040  solid biomass decrease 2% from 2017 to 2030 and 12% from 2017 to 2040  other bioenergy increases 38% from 2017 to 2030 and 32% from 2017 to 2040   waste decreases 3% from 2017 to 2030 and 5% from 2017 to 2040   Figure 36 shows projected energy consumption by energy sources in 2030 and 2040. A key result is that solids (mainly coal) accounts for only 2% of projected energy consumption in 2030 and 2040 and that other renewables (wind and solar) accounts for 26% in 2030 and 32% in 2040   The projection also shows that:  oil accounts for 34% in 2030 and 32% in 2040  natural gas accounts for 10% in 2030 and 8% in 2040  solid biomass accounts for 18% in and 17% 2040  other bioenergy accounts for 8% in  2030 and 7% in 2040  waste accounts for 2% in 2030 and 2040  Figure 37 shows from 2017-2040 the import dependency. The projection shows that import dependency decreases from 19 pct.-point in 2017 to -2 pct.-point in 2030 and increases to 20 pct.-point in 2040. An explanation for this is given above under Section 4.4 (i).
