3.2  Planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030 as well as other objectives referred to in point 2.2, including planned measures and instruments (also of a financial nature) to promote the energy performance of buildings, in particular with regard to the following:  i. Energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative policy measures under Articles 7a and 7b and Article 20(6) of Directive 2012/27/EU and to be prepared in accordance with Annex III to this Regulation  When setting up the energy efficiency obligation scheme in accordance with Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive, the Czech Republic draws on experience from the programme period 20142020. The design of individual measures is based on knowledge of the potential for energy savings in individual sectors, the cost-effectiveness of these measures and the feasibility of implementing these measures in the Czech conditions. In the period 20142020, the Czech Republic encountered limits for the implementation of some alternative measures; and at the same time, the potential of utilising other measures that it has not yet implemented has been identified. In view of the above, the Czech Republic will fulfil its obligation under Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive by alternative policy measures including financial mechanisms to support energy-saving measures, schemes for voluntary energy efficiency agreements, energy taxes, regulatory and behavioural measures. The choice and setting of measures to fulfil the commitment maximises the potential for achieving synergies between measures. Table 49: Measures to comply with Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive76 Measure type Share in new savings Share in cumulated savings Financial mechanisms 41 % 44 % Voluntary agreements 24 % 32 % Regulatory measures 4 % 13 % Behavioural measures 12 % 7 % Tax measures 20 % 4 % Table 50 contains a proposal for the implementation of measures meeting the criteria of Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive, including estimated new and cumulated energy savings in the 20212030 period, which should ensure that the Czech Republic fulfils the cumulative savings commitment by 2030. Overlaps are taken into account in the calculation of the benefits of each measure and double counting of savings is removed. Detailed information meeting the requirements of Article 7 and Annex V of the Energy Efficiency Directive and Annex III of the Energy Union Governance Regulation is provided in Annex 4 to this document. The measures are divided into two levels according to the degree of completion of their implementation. The measures in the first part can be considered to be implemented in the Czech Republic by 2020 at                                                            76  The ratios may vary depending on the specific areas of support (especially with regard to the Modernisation Fund setting).  -109-  the latest. At the end of 2020, the Czech Republic will evaluate the success of the implementation and it will revise the amount of achieved energy savings. The amount of energy savings for fiscal measures may be affected by the final amount of allocated funds and the conditions for the use of these funds set by EU or national legislation. In the case of a voluntary agreement scheme, the amount of energy savings will depend on the actual number of actors involved and their expected contributions. In view of the above (possible changes in the settings of measures and the subsequent prediction of energy savings), continue to be developed in order to be ready for implementation, not only in case the selected policy measures from the first part of the table prove to be inadequate. The amount of public support, or total investment, is provided in Chapter 5.3.2.2 (Table 125).   -110-  Table 50: Overview of measures in accordance with Article 7 and estimated energy savings for 20212030 Measure Measure type New Savings (TJ) Cumulative savings (TJ) Policy measures 20212030  Operational Programme Competitiveness 20212027 Financial mechanism 2 000 11 000 Operational Programme Environment 20212027 Financial mechanism 2 000 11 000 Integrated Regional Operational Programme 20212027 Financial mechanism 400 11 500 New Green Savings Programme / Succession NGS Programme Financial mechanism 19 000 85 600 EFEKT Programme Financial mechanism 3 000 16 500 PANEL 2013+ Programme Financial mechanism 1 000 5 500 Modernisation Fund Financial mechanism  12 300 -77 Taxation of household fuels Tax measure 500 500 Taxation of fuel Tax measure 20 000 20 000 Prohibition of boilers for 1st and 2nd emission class solid fuels Regulatory measures 8 000 64 000 Ecodriving Support Behavioural measures 2 000 6 000 Policy measures from 20142020 generating new individual measures Operational Programme Enterprise and Innovation for Competitiveness Financial mechanism 1 200 12 000 Operational Programme Environment 20142020 Financial mechanism 50 500 Integrated Regional Operational Programme 20142020 Financial mechanism 50 500 New Green Savings Programme Financial mechanism 800 8 000 Voluntary scheme for improving energy efficiency78 Voluntary agreement 23 200 157 000         Overlaps and elimination of double counting of energy savings   -12 400 -78 200 Estimated energy savings based on approved measures   83 100 331 400                                                             77  It will be specified in relation to the settings of the supported areas. 78  This is the theoretical potential declared to be achievable by the representatives of the entities concerned (distribution companies and energy traders in the gas, electricity and heating sectors).

Long-term renovation strategy to support the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, 79 including policies, measures and actions to stimulate cost-effective deep renovation and policies and actions to target the worst performing segments of the national building stock, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU General information on the long-term renovation strategy for the residential buildings fund Due to the deadline for the implementing of the revision of Directive (EU) 2018/844 amending Directive 2010/31/EU, the milestones under the current Building Renovation Strategy cannot be considered as decisive and applicable for defining policies for their implementation. For this reason, the draft National Plan does not contain specific tools for implementing the Long-Term Building Renovation Strategy under the revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. However, the Czech Republic considers the following measures to be the possible measures to decarbonise the building fund by 2030. However, their implementation requires discussion across the political spectrum and an assessment of its feasibility. Economic measures The high initial investment costs of the energy-saving renovation of buildings are one of the main barriers to their implementation. The Czech Republic has more than ten years of experience in offering support programmes that help different groups of property owners to achieve energy savings in the operation of their properties. After 2020, the Czech Republic therefore plans to introduce a financial support scheme for the renovation of buildings. Currently, a suitable combination of grants and an extension of the financial instruments portfolio is being addressed. In this area, ongoing discussions focus on the setting of support under national programmes as well as under European Structural and Investment Funds. An analysis is being conducted of the extent to which Union programmes and financial instruments can be used. In addition to grants, the discussions focus on extending the portfolio of financial instruments according to the needs of individual actors. An analysis of possible energy savings and investment assets shows that a total renovation of a building is an investment with a long return (typically around 20 years), but at the same time this means that the return on this investment is roughly 46 % per annum or higher. This is an attractive value given comparable investment opportunities (not for the business sector, but for institutions and households, and also for investment funds or banks). In this respect, an analysis of which barriers to massive investment in building renovation are key and which can be removed is being conducted. It is necessary to analyse these market failures based, inter alia, on the ownership structure of buildings, the necessary co-financing by the owners, the expected benefits of renovation, the great diversity and the relatively small (financial) size of the projects and the high transaction costs of implementation. It will then serve as a basis to discuss the possible use of innovative financial instruments to realise energy savings in buildings. Legislative and administrative measures Measures already implemented include the updated amendment to Act No 406/2000, on energy management, due to the transposition of Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (amendments: Act No 318/2012, Act No 103/2015). In accordance with the Directive, this act defines the minimum energy performance requirements for new buildings, larger changes to completed buildings and non-large (i.e. smaller) changes to completed buildings. These requirements are defined at a cost-optimal level. For the                                                            79 In accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU [as amended by the draft of COM(2016) 765].  -113-  purposes of publicly financed support programmes, the criteria should be more progressive, but should still be set at a cost-optimal level.  -consumption (gradually for new buildings with application for building permit submitted after 1 January 2016 until 1 January 2020). However, this standard is defined very softly and inadequately in the Implementing Decree on the energy performance of buildings. For this reason, this definition is being revised and the second step of near-zero-energy buildings is being introduced; this obligation will take effect for example from 2022. Education and consultation measures The ignorance of concrete appropriate measures to reduce the energy performance of a building, their cost and savings potential increases transaction costs for building renovation. This barrier can be somewhat reduced by strengthening the role of State-Consultation and Information Cbuildings, with a calculation of investment costs and savings achieved, is being considered. The above is to be understood rather as an overview of the areas in which the Czech Republic will focus on the setting of specific measures. These measures will be complemented in relation to the transposition and implementation of the revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. iii. Description of policy and measures to promote energy services in the public sector and measures to remove regulatory and non-regulatory barriers that impede the uptake of energy performance contracting and other energy efficiency service models80  For the period 20212030, continued support for the use of the EPC method is expected, particularly in the public sector, in order to maximise the efficiency of public funds invested and energy savings achieved. To this end, plans are being made to remove barriers to the use of the EPC method by public bodies, especially through education related to public procurement for comprehensive services, support for energy provider information centres and support for regional offices focusing on the support for the use of energy services. iv. Other planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030 as well as other objectives referred to in point 2.2 (for example measures to promote the exemplary role of public buildings and energy-efficient public procurement, measures to promote energy audits and energy management systems81, consumer information and training measures82, and other measures to promote energy efficiency83)  All relevant policies, measures and programmes are described in the other sections of this chapter or other parts of this document. v. Where applicable, a description of policies and measures to promote the role of local renewable energy communities in contributing to the implementation of policies and measures in points i, ii, iii and iv As stated in the previous sections summarising policies to meet the energy efficiency targets and commitments, the Czech Republic will make efforts to create local information centres for the general                                                            80 In accordance with Article 18 of Directive 2012/27/EU. 81  In accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2012/27/EU. 82  In accordance with Article 12 and 17 of Directive 2012/27/EU. 83  In accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2012/27/EU.  -114-  public. With regard to public opinion, it is necessary that these services are affordable for the public, especially at a minimum price. Furthermore, we consider it important to strengthen the self-government capacities in relation to energy and energy efficiency, increase the professional education of employees and strengthen their powers in the implementation of instruments and measures at both national and LIFE programme. vi. Description of measures to develop measures to utilise energy efficiency potentials of gas and electricity infrastructure84 Electricity sector85 Losses in the transmission system are mainly determined by the amount of transformation power transmitted with the distribution system operator, the output from power plants connected to the transmission system, and the flow through the transmission system, which is determined by the transactions between the individual trading zones in the interconnected European system.  In an area which can be influenced by the transmission system operator and which does not reduce the security of operation and reliability of electricity supplies, two loss reduction areas can generally be considered. These areas are investment in infrastructure and system management resources. Investments in infrastructure Increasing network throughput and thereby achieving greater interconnection, which, if applied specifically, ultimately results in a reduction in system losses. An increase in the throughput of the system resulting in loss reduction is largely motivated by the need to increase the possibilities of transferring active power from sources to consumption and within the interconnected European electricity system which, in the long run, secondarily leads to meeting the loss reduction requirements.  Examples of implementation include the assessment of the needs in individual corridors where, when necessary, lines with higher parameters (higher current carrying capacity, line doubling) are built, resulting in a lower unit loss factor. Within the standard renewal of installations at the end of their service life, a predetermined number of transformers between transmission and distribution systems are replaced annually. These transformers are replaced by completely new ones with higher unit output, with gradual replacement of 220/110 kV transformation for 400/110kV transformation. Regarding the reduction of losses in lines and in the transmission system, the fully modernised lines use cables with a larger cross-section, which leads to reduced losses of this line. For example, the difference when using the 434-AL1/56-ST1A cable instead of 350AlFe4 means a drop in unit active losses of about 30 % with the same active power transmission. At present, 490-AL1/64-ST1A cables are being introduced, which will further contribute to the reduction of active power transmission losses in key lines, which are modernised or duplicated with an estimated rated transmission capacity of around 2 500 A. Significant investments in the transmission system involving the use of cables with lower resistivity. System management resources                                                            84  In accordance with Article 15(2) of Directive 2012/27/EU. 85  There is a more detailed document in this area, which was created with tDistribuce, a.s. and PREdistribuce, a.s., which deals with this issue in more detail. Only a certain summary of this more detailed document is given in this material.  -115-  Loss reduction in the transmission system through a change in network operation is very limited. A deviation from the basic connection generally results in increased losses in the transmission system. The parameter in the form of the place and amount of the supply/consumption of active power, which significantly affects the magnitude of losses, cannot be influenced by the transmission system operator and, if so, at significant costs. From this perspective, only the production of reactive power, which partly contributes to losses in the transmission system, can be influenced. In this area, there are possibilities to implement source management and offset resources, in order not only to ensure the security and reliability of operation, but also to reduce losses. Approaches or tools applied in this area specifically include automatic voltage regulators in conjunction with an optimisation tool. In general, measures taken to reduce losses should always be applied with regard to the given site and always with the aim of reducing overall losses and not with respect to losses of one type of equipment. The choice of system management tools is limited by the possibility to use the available control resources, which are already fully utilised in the transmission system, but the choice is wider in pilot project allowing greater integration and coordination. Approaches to reducing energy performance in the distribution system legislation and the obligation to supply the contractual volume of electricity to end customers. It should reduce losses, there are a number of trends related to the development of renewable sources which lead to increased losses. For example, wider deployment of renewable sources usually increases the amount of reactive energy in the network, leading to increased losses. In addition, small intermittent sources are connected to the network asymmetrically, which can lead to disproportionate loading of some outlets, and thereby increase losses. In addition, the development of decentralised energy production and some appliances (e.g. pulse-controlled sources) may also involve the propagation of higher harmonic frequencies into the network, which may also result in higher losses.  The power consumption reductions that the distributor can influence is mainly possible in the area of technical and non-technical losses. These include, for example, the introduction of new technologies, voltage unification, the renewal of existing installations and the replacement of existing elements of the distribution system with new elements with higher efficiency and better parameters, as well as inspections of off-take points with the aim of detecting unauthorised electricity off-take. Data on electricity consumption and losses for individual voltage levels show that the largest space for reducing consumption / technical losses is at low voltage (lv) level and partly at high voltage (hv) level.  Thus, measures to reduce losses can be generally divided into two groups:  network renewal through the replacement of key network elements for elements with higher efficiency and better parameters. Within distribution, this mainly includes the replacement of transformers and the enlargement of cable cross-sections. In terms of cost-effectiveness, this includes the scenario, which needs to be assessed with regard to the specific conditions of its application, because the financial costs may not always justify the results  mainly in terms of local load and network topology.  The second set of measures represents an alternative to the general application of elements with higher efficiency and better parameters. It involves the deployment of such elements that enable, for example, advanced methods of network management and monitoring. Within the synergies, these elements are deployed both for reasons of better load distribution (and thus loss reduction), but also because of the need for better network monitoring at lower voltage levels, which, given the changing patterns of consumption/production, is one of main challenges for distribution.  -116-  Gas sector With a gradual phasing out of coal sources, the use of natural gas, biogas and, prospectively, synthetic methane and hydrogen will increase in the Czech Republic. The gas system has the potential to contribute to achieving the energy efficiency target, for example by the installation of more efficient equipment, which the context of continuous maintenance and modernisation of the system. For example, more efficient compressor stations could be installed with the help of the EU Structural Funds.  vii. Regional cooperation in this area, where applicable Below is basic information on the regional dimension at the Czech Republic level. Act No 406/2000 obliges the regions and the Prague Capital City to prepare the regional energy strategy and to regularly assess it. Beyond the scope of this obligation, regions and municipalities above a certain size carry out energy audits or introduce an energy management system. The above documents allow the energy efficiency to be assessed by region. These assessments are important for setting up appropriate measures that are acceptable across the public administration.  The Ministry of Industry and Trade and the regions are in negotiations to create a platform where it is possible to address the implementation issues of the above documents. There are intensive discussions with the representatives of these units in order to promote the interest in the issue of improving energy efficiency, identifying potential in a given area and looking for possibilities to realise this potential. Self-governing units are the bodies concerned for the approval of legal acts as well as strategic documents. Therefore, they are indirectly involved in the making of State energy efficiency policy. viii. Financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds, in the area at national level  Financial measures and sources of financing are summarised in Chapter 5.3. ix. Energy efficiency instruments and measures beyond the scope of Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive The tables below list the instruments and measures beyond the scope of Article 7. This point (point / part ix) has been added beyond the structure required by Regulation (EU) 2018/1999.  -117-  Table 51: Instruments and measures beyond the scope of Article 7 (investment measures) Measure Description Investment support for the introduction of CHP There is stable investment support for the implementation of CHP in both operational and national programmes. Within the current programming period, support for the business sector is allocated in the Operational Programme Enterprise and Innovation for Competitiveness. This is in particular the broad-based specific objective 3.2 Energy Savings and also the narrow-focused specific objective 3.5 Energy Savings in the HSS. Furthermore, investment support is allocated in the Operational Programme Environment, specifically in specific objective 2.2 Reducing emissions of stationary sources and specific objective 3.2 Increasing the share of material and energy recovery of waste. Specific objective 5.1 Reducing the energy performance of public buildings and increasing the use of renewable energy sources provides support for the public sector. Operating aid for the introduction of CHP CHP in the Czech Republic also receives operating aid, which ensures the development of high-efficiency CHP and reduction of primary energy consumption. Operating aid for high-efficiency CHP is part of the system to support the production of electricity and heat from RES. Legislative support is enshrined in Act No 165/2015, on supported energy sources. Investment support for the modernisation of the transmission and distribution networks in order to increase efficiency, and support for the renovation and modernisation of distribution heating facilities Within the framework of the Operational Programme Enterprise and Innovation for Competitiveness, funds are allocated for the modernisation of the transmission and distribution networks in order to increase their efficiency and implement smart grid measures within the Priority Axis 3  development of energy infrastructure and renewable energy sources, support for the introduction of new renovation and modernisation of heat distribution facilities within the support programme Energy savings in heat supply systems. Investment support for the construction of the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and Under the specific objective  Creating conditions for wider use of alternative-drive vehicles on the road network, investment support is provided from the Operational Programme Transport for the construction of backbone and additional networks of charging stations and other infrastructure for alternative vehicles. The investment support contributes to the creation of an environment for accelerating the introduction of  -118-  other infrastructures for alternative-drive vehicles alternative-drive vehicles on the Czech market, which positively contributes to increasing the efficiency of passenger transport and thus directly reduces the final energy consumption.    -119-  Table 52: Instruments and measures beyond the scope of Article 7 (legislative measures) Measure Description The obligation to improving energy performance of buildings  In accordance with Section 7 of Act No 406/2000, on energy management, as amended, in the case of construction of a new building, the builder is obliged to meet the building energy performance requirements in accordance with the implementing legislation and he is obliged to document this by providing an energy performance certificate when applying for a building permit, a joint planning and building permission, a request to change the building before its completion with an impact on its energy performance or when providing documents for building notice. In addition, obligations are imposed in the event of major changes to the completed building, but also for other than major changes to the completed building. Obligation to prepare energy performance certificate of a building In accordance with Section 7a of Act No 406/2000, on energy management, as amended, entities listed by law are obliged to prepare an energy performance certificate of a building under the conditions specified by law. Obligations linked to energy labels Section 8 of Act No 406/2000, on energy management, as amended, determines the obligations of suppliers of products that are associated with energy consumption and which are subject to energy labelling requirements. Obligation to carry out an energy audit and to prepare an energy assessment In accordance with Section 9 and Section 9a of Act No 406/2000, on energy management, as amended, the entities listed by law are obliged to perform, under the conditions specified by law, an energy audit or energy assessment for a building or an energy system, even beyond the EU requirements. Obligations linked to the setting of specific energy efficiency conditions for public procurement In accordance with Section 9b of Act No 406/2000, on energy management, as amended, in the case of over-limit public procurement of central institutions for supplies or services, the contracting authority must lay down specific technical conditions in the field of energy efficiency, in particular in relation to labelling related to energy consumption, ecodesign, and energy performance class of the building. The following conditions shall apply to public procurement: (i) the highest available class for products with energy labels; (ii) the most efficient product on the market where ecodesign applies; (iii) the highest fuel efficiency class for tires; (iv) for the acquisition of buildings, an obligation not to purchase a building with efficiency class  -120-  lower than C; (v) for the rental of buildings, an obligation to rent a building with than efficiency class better than D. Minimum energy efficiency obligation for energy sources and distribution In accordance with Section 6 of Act No 406/2000, on energy management, as amended, there is an obligation to ensure minimum efficiency in the use of energy in newly established electricity or thermal energy generating plants and in power plants undergoing changes of the finished construction. In accordance with Section 6, there is also an obligation to ensure the efficiency of energy distribution for newly established installations and for installations undergoing changes of the finished construction. Combustion sources inspection obligation  In order to ensure the declared efficiency of combustion sources, according to the valid legislation (Act No 201/2012, on air protection and Act No 406/2000, on energy management), there are obligations to carry out regular inspections of combustion sources with nominal output exceeding 10 kW or 20 kW and of associated heat distribution. The existence of mandatory inspection ensures energy efficient operation of combustion sources and thus eliminates the increase in energy consumption due to non-optimal operation of combustion sources.  Regulatory measures to reduce transmission, transport and distribution losses The Czech Republic has implemented a regulatory framework in accordance with Act No 458/2000, on business conditions and state administration in the energy sectors, to reduce losses in the transmission, transport and distribution of energy. For this purpose, a regulation methodology applicable to regulated entities in transmission, transport and distribution is prepared, which includes an efficiency factor that motivates entities to reduce regulated costs. The established regulatory framework has stimulated loss reduction for a long time. Obligation to prepare Territorial Energy Concepts at the level of regions and City of Prague The Territorial Energy Concept sets out the objectives and principles of energy management in a defined area. The territorial energy concept includes an assessment of the technical and economic potential of energy savings, the definition of tools for achieving them and the design of scenarios for future development. The elaboration of the territorial energy concept creates conditions for reducing energy consumption at the level of regional self-government in accordance with the energy and climate goals of the Czech Republic.    -121-  Table 53: Instruments and measures beyond the scope of Article 7 (other measures) Measure Description Promoting modal change in freight transport To create, based on the Government-approved Freight Transport Concept for 20172023, such an environment in which logistics and freight transport can provide the necessary level of services to ensure economic competitiveness and at the same time economically use existing resources.
