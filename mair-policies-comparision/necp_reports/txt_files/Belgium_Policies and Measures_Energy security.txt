296 3.3. Dimension energy security i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.3 As described above in point 2.3, Belgium will adopt various measures to guarantee energy security during the phase-out of nuclear power. First, structural monitoring of the energy security situation will continue and, if possible, be fine-tuned, with account also being taken of the situation in neighbouring countries. In addition, in accordance with the Regulation on the internal market for electricity (136), a value of lost load (VoLL) will be determined no later than 5 July 2020. In order to attract additional investment in electricity generation, it has been decided to develop by 2020 a centralised capacity compensation mechanism, which will fully comply with European State aid legislation and directives. The system will be technologically neutral. Furthermore, in addition to constructing new gas-fired power stations or extending the operation of existing gas-fired power stations, this mechanism will allow the large-scale implementation of storage and demand-side management solutions. It will also minimise costs and guarantee the competitiveness of businesses and SMEs, as well as the purchasing power of individuals. The framework law for this capacity compensation mechanism was adopted on 4 April 2019 and the various implementing decrees are currently being drafted. The first award is planned for the autumn of 2021, with the delivery year being 2025. Cooperation between the competent authorities will increase so that it becomes easier to grant the authorisations needed to develop new generating facilities and also to adapt the systems needed for renewable - February 2014 on the creation of a coordination and facilitation committee for granting authorisations for trans-European energy infrastructure projects, will be systematically applied to energy infrastructure projects in the national interest. Particular attention will be paid to minimising the administrative burden for project owners. The various levels of responsibility will ensure that new centralised and decentralised storage systems are continually developed, and also that peaks can be shifted for both industry and individuals. The Federal Government, in the context of its energy security responsibilities, will consult with the regions to ensure that  Belgium will also make the necessary preparations for decommissioning its nuclear power plants and correctly storing and managing the radioactive decommissioning waste and spent fuel. The necessary decisions will therefore be taken, particularly as regards the technical specifications and location of the waste disposal site. Belgium will also carry out the various risk assessments with regard to security of supply of electricity, natural gas and oil, as required by European and international legislation. In this context, active cooperation will be established at regional level (including through the Pentalateral Energy Forum and the Gas Platform). In addition, several longer term projections will be prepared, in particular prospective studies (Federal Public Service for the Economy  DG Energy) and energy outlooks (Federal Planning Bureau). The design and methodology of these studies will be regularly re-examined so that their usefulness in terms of policy is optimised, any overlaps with other analyses are minimised, and their consistency is guaranteed. Lastly, regulators and system operators will also carry out a number of studies on an individual basis or within their European coordination organisations (in particular ACER, CEER, ENTSO-E, ENTSO-G) to support policy and guarantee energy security.  Market forces will be adapted to provide the framework that will ensure energy security during the energy transition, at the lowest possible cost.  Coupling of electricity markets will improve their liquidity, which should reduce electricity prices and make them more stable. These interconnections will allow us to benefit from the complementary production mixes of the European countries.                                                            136 Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electricity. 297  Pilot projects will be promoted in the context of Power-to-X projects, provided that these are economically and environmentally justifiable.  Feasibility studies will be carried out on the transmission of hydrogen through the natural gas transmission system.  Large-scale and small-scale storage projects will be facilitated where their economic and environmental importance has been demonstrated in advance.  Various tools will be developed to improve market flexibility and better harmonise consumption and production.  Key actions - Creation of a Federal Energy Committee (with representatives from the federal authorities, regions, employers and industry), which will monitor the implementation of the federal energy strategy based on four specific analyses:  impact on the climate of the NECP (National Climate Commission);  changes in energy tariffs and prices made by the Belgian Energy Regulators Forum (Forum des régulat FORBEG);  guarantee of supply by Elia, the CREG and the authorities (DG Energy);  security of nuclear facilities, which is guaranteed by the Federal Nuclear Control Agency (Agence Fédérale de Contrôle nucléaire  AFCN).  - Development of a capacity compensation mechanism (CCM) to ensure security of electricity supply and attract investment in new capacity. - Implementation of the L-gas conversion plan.  Other measures  Market forces will be adapted to develop the framework that will ensure energy security during the energy transition, at the lowest possible cost.  The interconnection of electricity markets will improve their liquidity, which should result in lower and more stable electricity prices. These interconnections will allow us to benefit from the complementary production mixes of the European countries.  Pilot projects will be promoted in the context of Power-to-X projects, provided that this is justified in economic and environmental terms.  Initiatives will be taken so that gas systems can also carry hydrogen.  Large-scale and small-scale storage projects will be facilitated where their economic and environmental importance has been demonstrated in advance.  Various tools will be developed to improve market flexibility and better harmonise consumption and production.  ii. Regional cooperation in this area The Pentalateral Energy Forum particularly focuses on cooperation in the area of power crisis management and prevention, as indicated by the Memorandum of Understanding on emergency planning and crisis management, signed in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg on 26 June 2017, which requires the signatories to: 298  be entirely transparent with regard to the distribution of tasks and responsibilities between the countries;  make arrangements for   agree on the type of instruments to be used to respond to a crisis, with priority being given to market-based solutions; and  identify possible common risks for the region. Based on the above, a joint crisis exercise (Pentex 2018) was organised, which took place on 20 June 2018.  Emergency plans for the seven countries involved were discussed in depth in 2019. Those plans will be analysed and studied by early 2020 in order to develop a regional emergency plan (under the Risk Preparedness Regulation).  iii.
