9  1. Overview and process for establishing the plan 1.1. Summary 1.1.i. Political, economic, environmental and social context of the plan  integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) provides an overview of the climate policy is continuously evolving.  On 9 October 2019, the Federal Government passed the Climate Action Programme 2030 through for all sectors (energy, buildings, transport, industry, agriculture, land use, land-use change, forestry and waste management) and introduces a national emissions trading system for the heating and transport sectors, which are not covered by the European emissions trading system. The measures contained in the Climate Action Programme 2030 will shape Germanto 2030 and beyond. They are taken into consideration in this NECP. The Federal Government is working tirelessly on the implementation and, where applicable, the necessary detailed specification of the chosen measures and, as such, has set various legislative procedures in motion and even completed some of them already, for example the Fuel Emissions Trading Act [BEHG] and the Federal Climate Protection Act. The Federal Climate Protection Act also contains the Federal  September 2019 in New York, to pursue the long-term goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero emissions by 2050.  The contents of the Energy Efficiency Strategy 2050 -term renovation strategy pursuant to the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive are also taken into consideration in this NECP. The applicable federal budgetary and financial planning principles and approaches to the Energy and Climate Fund form the necessary foundation for all measures that have a financial impact in this area.  The topic of energy and climate policy is of vital importance for an industrial nation like Germany, and also affects other fields of policy, in particular economic, environmental and social policy. The triad of energy policy goals (reliability of supply, environmental soundness and affordability) therefore is   Figure A1: Triad of goals for the energy transition:   Bezahlbarkeit Affordability Energiewende Energy transition Versorgungssicherheit Reliability of supply Umweltverträglichkeit Environmental soundness  Germany wishes to establish an environmentally sound supply of energy through improved energy thereforconservation and species protection targets must be resolved appropriately and sustainably. Reliability of supply must be guaranteed to the maximum extent possible. Cost efficiency is a vital factor in ensuring that energy remains affordable. It therefore plays a significant role in advancing 10  status as a competitive place to do business. Supplying power in an environmentally sound manner is a vital prerequisite for safeguarding the very basis of human existence.  The energy transition is a programme of modernisation and investment. It represents a huge economic opportunity for innovative companies  not only within the German and European markets, but also around the world. Many countries are currently expanding their energy supply structures to incorporate renewable energy sources and making increased use of energy-efficient technologies. At the same time, the energy transition will mean a far-reaching structural shift in certain regions and certain sectors of the economy. Policies are needed to support and accompany this shift, resulting in a fundamental transformation in the way we live and do business.  1.1.ii. Strategy relating to the five dimensions of the energy union  The general policy guidelines derived from the triad of energy transition goals are put into concrete  an Environmentally Sound, Reliable and Affordable Energy Supply, as well as in supplementary decisions by the Bundestag and the Federal Government and in EU legislation. These documents contain many different goals which serve as a guiding compass for the German energy transition. In order to structure and prioritise these individual energy transition goals, the Federal Government has established an architecture of goals. It is based on three different levels of goals, i.e. policy goals, core goals and steering goals:  Figure A2: 2030 goal-based architecture   Klimaziele (mind. -55% bis 2030, weitgehend THG-neutral -80 bis -95% bis 2050), Kernenergieausstieg (bis 2022), Wettbewerbsfähigkeit, Versorgungssicherheit Climate goals (at least -55% by 2030, largely greenhouse gas neutral -80 to -95% by 2050), nuclear phase-out (by 2022), competitiveness, reliability of supply Steigerung des Anteils der erneuerbaren Energien (EE) am gesamten Energieverbrauch Increase in the share of renewable energies in total energy consumption Reduktion des Primärenergieverbrauchs und Steigerung der Energieefizienz Reduction in primary energy consumption and increase in energy efficiency 30% bis 2030 30% by 2030 11  60% bis 2050 60% by 2050 50% bis 205 50% by 2050 Politische Ziele Policy objectives   Steigerung Endenergieproduktivität Increase in final energy productivity   Stromverbrauch aus EE Consumption of electricity from renewable energies Wärme aus EE Heat from renewable energies EE im Verkehrsbereich Renewable energies in the transport sector Reduktion Stromverbrauch Reduction in electricity consumption Reduktion Endenergie verbrauch für Wärme Reduction in final energy consumption (heating) Reduktion Endenergie verbrauch Verkehr Reduction in final energy consumption (transport) Optimierung Optimisation Leitkriterien: Kostenefizienz, Systemintegration, Synchronisierung EE und Netzkapazitäten Guiding criteria: cost efficiency, system integration, synchronisation of renewable energies and grid capacities Maßnahmenmix (Gesetze, Verordnungen, Förderprogramme etc.) Mix of measures (acts, regulations, funding programmes, etc.)     The policy goals serve as a framework for transformation of the energy supply. The core goals include the reduction of primary energy consumption with a corresponding increase in energy efficiency and the expansion of renewable energy sources. They represent the central strategies that will be used to drive forward the energy transition. Both of these core goals are fleshed out in steering goals relating to action in the areas of electricity, heat and transport. The steering goals and the associated measures are coordinated with a view to ensuring that the overarching goals can be achieved as reliably and cost-effectively as possible through an integrated approach.  1.1.iii. Overview table with key objectives, policies and measures of the plan  The tables show the central goals, strategies and measures that will apply under the Federal national goals (Table A1) and central strategies and measures which are currently being implemented, have already been implemented, have been adopted or are planned in keeping with Article 2(1)-(4) of the EU Regulation on the governance of the energy union (Governance Regulation) (Table A2). The extent to which funds will be provided for them from the federal budget is a matter for the relevant budgeting process.

Research, innovation, competitiveness  The Federal Government is striving to ramp up energy research in the period between 2020 and 2030. It has therefore set itself the goal of providing approximately EUR 1.3 billion of funds per annum in the years 2020-2022 for energy research.  Promotion of pioneering innovations relating to transformation of the power supply  location for industry, commerce and SMEs and the jobs they offer, and establishment of a solid foundation for sustainable prosperity and quality of life   Table A2: Central strategies and measures along the dimensions of the energy union  Units Central strategies and measures 1.

Overview of current policy situation 1.2.i. National and Union energy system and policy context of the national plan  Energy and climate policy must be formulated within a European context, since energy and climate policy decisions by one Member State unavoidably have an impact on other Member States. National energy and climate plans can be used to bring about greater convergence of national policies. Energy efficiency and the growth of renewables will be major building blocks of the European energy Section 1.1.ii.).  Realisation of a single European energy market is a key prerequisite for the success of the energy transition in Germany and the EU. Open, flexible markets and fair competition are needed in order to achieve a cost-effective and reliable energy supply and integrate renewable energies into the market. The electricity markets need to be connected, and they need to send the necessary price signals. This establishes a solid foundation for the necessary investments and for increased flexibility of energy generation and consumption.  1.2.ii.

Key issues of cross-border relevance  Dimension 1: Decarbonisation 1.1 GHG emissions and removals the goal and the targets enshrined in the Paris Agreement. Experiences and best practices are exchanged with other Member States in particular with regard to national climate protection strategies and non-governmental or sub-national climate protection projects (run by NGOs and municipalities), allowing potential impacts on other Member States to be identified and discussed as soon as possible. The design and implementation of EU climate policy represents another central focus of exchanges with other Member States.  1.2 Renewable energy of renewable energies within its borders has multiple impacts on neighbouring states. The Federal Government accords high priority to the network and system integration of renewable energies (see Section 3.1.2.). Over the next few years, the Federal Government will focus on regional cooperation with other Member States as a significant driver for the market integration of renewable energies. The Federal Government is therefore opening up its tendering procedures for electricity generated from renewable energies to ensure that providers from other EU Member States are eligible. The Federal Government also plays an active role in the North Seas Energy Forum and participates in the working group on renewable energies within the framework of the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP) (see Sections 1.4., 3.2., 3.4.3.). In addition, Germany has played an active role in the Concerted Action on the Renewable Energy Sources Directive (CA-RES) forum from its inception.  Dimension 2: Energy efficiency  This dimension does not as a basic principle give rise to any issues of immediate cross-border significance. Cross-border cooperation projects have, however, been set up with neighbouring EU Member States, as well as various initiatives for exchanging best practices relating to efficiency (see Section 3.2.).  Dimension 3: Energy security  Functioning energy markets are the best possible guarantee for energy supply security within the EU as a whole, and also lower the risk that disruptions in supply will lead to adverse consequences. If the security of gy supply is under threat, there is a risk that unilateral measures taken by this Member State will jeopardise the smooth functioning of the internal market and have a harmful impact on the supply situation in other Member States. Gas can be supplied to the German market via various import routes, and the neighbouring national markets also have a range of options available to them in this respect. This reduces the risk of supply disruptions not only for the gas market in Germany, but also for markets in neimarket. Electricity Market Regulation 2019/943 sets out key principles for monitoring security of supply on the electricity market, which are currently being further fleshed out by the EU Member States. These principles -border collaboration between stakeholders in Germany and neighbouring third countries, if necessary with support from the competent authorities, is vitally important (and stipulated in Risk-Preparedness Regulation 2019/941) in order to ensure that cross-border measures can be taken to maintain security of supply in neighbouring Member States in the event of a crisis, i.e. a significant electricity demand-supply gap. Germany is involved in the drafting of a Regional Report on the Security of Supply within the framework of the Pentalateral Energy Forum.  Dimension 4: Internal energy market  The EU internal market forms the backbone of the European energy transition and is also a vital prerequisite for guaranteeing a safe, cost-efficient and environmentally sound supply of energy in Germany. With this in mind, exchanges of electricity between EU Member States are gaining in importance. Supra-regional synergies in respect of generation and consumption can be harnessed to make the electricity system even more flexible. The Federal Government therefore plays an active role in a number of different regional coopemention should be made of the Pentalateral Energy Forum and the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP) (see Sections 1.4., 3.2., 3.4.3.). The federal states are also committed to creating a European internal electricity market, for example by promoting cross-border citizen energy communities.  Dimension 5: Research, innovation, competitiveness  In common with many other European countries, Germany faces major challenges in the field of research and innovation in connection with its move towards greater use of clean and renewable energies within the framework of the energy transition. Areas where technical innovations are needed and where Member States 26  must work together include in particular the integration of increasing but fluctuating quantities of electricity fed in from wind and PV systems, digitalisation of the energy supply and sectoral coupling (including heat energy). Regional cooperation makes it possible to tackle these issues together successfully, to make effective use of cross-border infrastructures, and to deploy financial resources efficiently. Research cooperation takes place at international and more specifically EU level as a 2020/Europe and its implementation of the goals enshrined in the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan on the basis of common research projects and coordinated funding priorities. Regional and bilateral cooperation provides an opportunity to join forces and take more effective action in areas where similar challenges are faced (at either a geographical or thematic level). Last but not least, international cooperation is crucially important in ensuring  remains at the top level worldwide across all technologies.  1.2.iv. Administrative structure of implementing national energy and climate policies  The Federal Government, the federal states and the municipalities all have a role to play in implementing the energy transition and climate protection measures. At Federal Government level, the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy is responsible for energy policy. The Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety is responsible for climate policy.  Authorities at Federal Government and federal state level work together on an ongoing basis to implement the energy transition. The Federal Chancellor holds 6-monthly meetings with the heads of the federal state governments; these meetings are also attended by the competent federal ministers. Topics discussed at these meetings include progress made with the energy transition. The competent ministers at Federal Government and federal state level also discuss priorities and next steps for the energy transition on an annual basis within the framework of the Conference of Ministers for Economic Affairs and the Conference of Environmental Ministers. This institutional coordination is supplemented by discussions between Ministers for Energy, Secretaries of State for Energy and heads of energy departments at Federal Government and federal state level. Ongoing cooperation and detailed exchanges of information at a technical level also take place.  A comprehensive overview of the competent bodies at Federal Government, federal state and municipal level the energy gn Office: https://www.renac.de/who-is-who/p/10/. Details of central contact persons in the fields of policy, industry and society are also summarised in this database.   1.3. Consultations and involvement of national and Union entities and their outcome  The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy set up a participatory process for national and regional consultations, in accordance with the provisions of the EU Regulation on the governance of the energy union, in order to consult with and involve the public, national entities, stakeholders, other EU Member States and important information about the NECP process as well as the draft NECP were published via the following link both in German and English shortly after the draft NECP was completed at the end of 2018. The intention is for the final NECP to also be accessible in both languages via this website:  https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Artikel/Energie/nationaler-energie-und-klimaplan-necp.html  The consultations with and involvement of the individual players are described in the following subsections.  1.3.i. Consultations with stakeholders, including social partners, and engagement of civil society  Energy and Climate Plan was conducted online between 14/06/2019 and 02/08/2019 on the basis of the draft NECP from the end of 2018 and a survey which covered the five dimensions of the energy union.  The results of the online consultation are summarised in this section 1.3.i. in accordance with Article 10 of the EU Regulation on the governance of the energy union and climate action. A detailed report containing an assessment of the responses received during the consultation process is attached to the NECP as a separate annex. The responses reproduced in it relate to the draft version of the NECP. Since then, the Federal Government has made far-reaching decisions on its energy and climate policy, taking a substantial number of the suggestions that were made into consideration. In the second half of 2019, numerous points of criticism from the responses were addressed, in particular as part of the implementation of the recommendations of 27  the Commission on Growth, Structural Change and Employment and of the Climate Cabinet process. This is illustrated in this NECP. The summary of the responses is reproduced in the document without the addition of any comments. The extent to which the responses were taken into consideration is clear to see from the NECP. Aside from the consultation on the draft NECP, there are regular exchanges of information with stakeholders on various different energy and climate policy-related projects in meetings of the energy transition platforms of the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy.  A total of 200 responses were received as part of the online consultation process. Approximately half of the participants were private individuals (96 participants). The next sets of responses were from companies (28 participants) and industrial associations (21 participants). Then there were those from NGOs and civil society organisations (18 participants) and environmental organisations (14 participants). Research institutions/universities were represented by 10 participants. Half of the federal states also provided responses (8 participants). Foundations were represented by 3 participants whilst other national, regional and local authorities were represented by 1 participant and cities/municipalities/regional and local governments were also accounted for by 1 participant.

Consultations with other Member States   April 2019 at the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy at head of department level and at a technical level. In addition, the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy held a high-level meeting for ministers and 28  secretaries of state on 8 April 2019, the evening before the regional consultation. The high-level meeting was aimed at the group of electricity neighbours (see Section 3.4.3.vi) and was used to present the recommendations of the Commission on Growth, Structural Change and Employment for the gradual reduction and phase-out of coal-fired power generation in Germany, which were published at the start of 2019. The consultation meeting on 9 April was aimed at all neighbouring countries and EU Member States. Representatives from Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Croatia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, the United Kingdom and Cyprus as well as representatives of the European Commission and employees of various different federal ministries attended the consultation meeting.  in detail during the regional consultation meeting. A Q%A session was held after each dimension was presented.  Dimension 1: Decarbonisation (GHG reduction and renewable energy)  During the presentation of this dimension, a Member State enquired about Germrenewable energy. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy responded by saying that the Federal % share of renewable sources of energy in gross final energy consumption and that a goal for 2030 of a 65% share of renewable energy in the electricity mix had reduction of -80% to -95% by 2050 compared to 1990 and asked whether this also included achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions at the same time. The Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety responded by saying that that was the goal range agreed in the Energy Concept and, with regard to the other point, referred to the discussions to be held for creating the programme of measures for the Climate Action Plan which would not be starting until April 2019. Another Member State enquired about the expansion of the use of renewable sources of energy, reported facing challenges in their own country with expanding onshore wind farms and also highlighted, in light of this, the importance of offshore farms and the North Seas Energy Cooperation. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy responded compensation payments but that the same challenge was essentially also being faced in Germany. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy agreed that offshore wind energy was very important and explained that Germany intended to use its presidency of the North Seas Energy Cooperation in 2020 to An-mobility. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy responded by saying that this was a key point in the discussions regarding the programme of measures for the Climate Action Plan and was being fleshed out there. Finally, a Member State enquired about the use of renewable energy in the cooling sector. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy responded by saying that in Germany the cooling sector currently accounted for only a small proportion of energy consumption. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy also responded by saying that, just as there were heating networks in the heating sector, cooling networks nevertheless also existed. In this regard, the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy mentioned heat pumps as technology that was used in both the heating sector and the cooling sector. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy stated that a third of all new buildings in Germany were equipped with heat pumps.  Dimension 2: Energy efficiency  When this dimension was presented and discussed, a Member State enquired about the status of the Energy Efficiency Strategy. This Member State and another Member State also asked whether Germany had an efficiency goal and/or trajectory for buildings. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy responded by saying that the Energy Efficiency Strategy would continue to be worked on until the end of 2019 and would efficiency goal for 2030 would also be embedded in this. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy also stated that there was no separate goal for energy efficiency in buildings. The 2030 goal was designed as a cross-sector goal. However, the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy explained that the id contain a sectoral goal for 2030 for greenhouse gas reduction in the buildings sector.  Another Member State enquired about the numerical unit of the energy efficiency goal and about the connection between the energy efficiency goal and the goal for the expansion of the use of renewable energies and asked whether the latter would change once the efficiency goal for 2030 had been set. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy stated that the efficiency goal was designed as a reduction in primary energy consumption and said that the goal for the expansion of the use of renewable energy would not be changed again once the goal for increasing energy efficiency by 2030 had been set. Dimensions 3 and 4: Energy security and internal energy market  29  Electricity During the presentation and discussion, two Member States raised questions about the phase-out of coal-fired power generation. The Member States wanted to find out more information about the composition of the Commission on Growth, Structural Change and Employment, about security of supply in connection with the phase-out of coal and about any funding measures for coal. They reported that in their countries, due to the EU ETS, there was also pressure to phase out coal.  The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy responded to the questions and provided information on the composition of the commission. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy then stated that there would no longer be any direct subsidising of coal in Germany but that during the phase-out process operators of coal-fired power plants would be paid compensation. However, cogeneration plants would receive funding. With regard to security of supply, the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy stated that, in the medium term, gas would play a bigger role but that the phase-out of coal would also be tackled by means of the expansion of the use of renewable energies and greater flexibility on the grid. The assumption was that the market would also send out the right signals. A Member State enquired about offshore wind energy plans whereupon the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy responded by saying that this was an important topic for the Federal Government and that it was very interested in forging ahead with the North Seas Energy Cooperation in this regard.  Gas With regard to this topic, a Member State highlighted the importance of the decarbonisation of gas, and two Affairs and Energy reported that the issue of decarbonised gas would   Another Member State enquired about the LNG infrastructure in Germany and asked whether this was lucrative, given that there was general striving for a future with net zero greenhouse gas emissions. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy responded by saying that at this point in time it still did not know which types of technology would prevail in the medium term and that an approach which was open to different types of technology was being pursued. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy did not voice any opinions on the investment decisions of entrepreneurs who were supporting and expanding this infrastructure.  Dimension 5: Research, innovation, competitiveness  When this dimension was presented and discussed, a Member State enquired about the Federal stated that the Federal Government was pursuing an open approach and was not prioritising any of the technologies being researched. It said that market signals and market trends were also relevant here. Another Member State enquired about the importance of Carbon Capture and Utilisation / Storage (CCU/CCS) in the  Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy stated that there were concepts and also specific research projects for this and said that this technology was also being discussed as part of the creation of the programme of measures for the Climate Action Plan.  Following on from the consultation meeting, the neighbouring countries and EU Member States were given and the United Kingdom took advantage of this opportunity.  The written comments from the three Member States focused, in particular, on the issues of market coupling, a common European electricity market and renewable sources of energy. There was specific interest in the geographical separation between generation and consumption and the resulting influence on neighbouring Member States. In this context, reference was made to the German-French energy platform and the question was raised as to whether there was any opportunity for similar cooperation with other neighbouring Member States. Furthermore, detailed questions were raised regarding re-dispatching costs, the market integration of the gas sector, and dynamic electricity supply contracts. Interest in smart meters and related monitoring was also expressed.  Further remarks from the Federal Government concerning renewable sources of energy in the final NECP were eagerly awaited. The main focus here was the transmission system infrastructure. The issue of the recovery of electricity costs as part of the expansion of the use of renewable sources of energy and a request for experience and technical know-how regarding offshore wind energy to be shared were both raised.  Questions were also raised concerning the next steps for CCUS/CCS and toxic waste. With regard to the phase-out of nuclear energy, the issue of substitution and further planning was raised in light of existing 30  greenhouse gas reduction goals. The statements regarding the phase-out of coal in the final NECP were eagerly awaited, in particular those relating to overall costs.  Interest was also expressed in the Energy Efficiency Strategy for Buildings. The issue of best practice was raised here.  With regard to the scenarios, there was a lot of interest in the WAM (with additional measures) scenario. As such, the expectations entertained regarding the final NECP were expressed.  This final NECP deals with many of these issues, which have been addressed in specific measures in connection with the Climate Action Programme 2030 and the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Growth, Structural Change and Employment.  1.3.iii. Iterative process with the European Commission  On 18 June 2019, the European Commission published its communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: United in delivering the Energy Union and Climate Action  Setting the foundations for a successful clean energy transition. In addition to the communication, the recommendations of the European Commission regarding the draft NECPs of the EU Member States were also published in accordance with the EU Regulation on the governance of the energy union and climate action. 11 recommendations were issued to the Federal Government, which form the central basis of the so-called iterative process with the European Commission. The following table lists the topics covered in the recommendations and indicates where in the final NECP NECPs of the EU Member States can be accessed via the following link.  https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/governance-energy-union/national-energy-climate-plans  Table A4: Recommendations of the European Commission as part of the iterative process  No Recommendation regarding NECP section 1 Greenhouse gas reduction 2.1.1, 3.1.1., 3.1.3. 2 Renewable energy 2.1.2., 3.1.2. 3 Energy efficiency 2.2., 3.2. 4 Reliability of supply 2.3, 3.3. 5 Internal market 2.4., 3.4. 6 Research/ innovation/competitiveness 2.5., 3.5. 7 Regional cooperation 1.4. 8 Need for investment 5.3. 9 Energy subsidies 4.6. 10 Air quality 5.1., 5.2. 11 Structural change 2.4.4.i, 3.4.3, 5.2.    31   1.4. Regional cooperation in preparing the plan 1.4.i. Elements subject to joint or coordinated planning with other Member States  Whilst working on their NECPs, the EU Member States of the Pentalateral Energy Forum (Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France, Austria and Germany), on the initiative of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and the EU Member States of the North Seas Energy Cooperation (Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France, Denmark, Sweden, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Germany), developed joint sections on the initiative of Denmark. The Federal Government expressly welcomes cooperation in these forums and highlights their import  JOINT SECTION ON THE PENTALATERAL ENERGY FORUM      INTRODUCTION  As part of the Pentalateral Energy Forum for regional cooperation set up in 2005, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and (since 2011) Austria work together on a voluntary basis  together these countries account for more than a third of the population of the EU and more than 40% of the electricity generated in the EU. Switzerland joined in 2011 as a permanent observer and actively contributes to the technical work carried out and to the decision-making. In close cooperation with the cooperation between all relevant stakeholders and hence seeks to create a regional electricity market as a stepping stone towards creating a single European electricity market.  Cooperation is managed by the respective Ministers for Energy, who meet on a regular basis. The activities are continuously supported by the Penta coordinators and the Penta-NECP Committee under the leadership of the corresponding Directors-General for Energy in the countries involved. The work programme is implemented by the transmission system operators (TSOs), ministries, regulatory authorities, the European Commission and the market players, who meet regularly in three working groups (Support Groups).  The huge success achieved over the last 15 years is demonstrated by the fact that the outlook of each of the countries involved in terms of their energy policy has developed from one with a purely national focus to one with a truly regional approach. The countries involved have set up specific regional milestones in various different areas which are still relevant today:  Internal electricity market/market integration: Penta Support Group 1 (SG 1) focuses on the coupling of the electricity markets in the region. SG 1 had set itself the goal of ensuring the flow-based market coupling (FBMC) of the day-ahead markets. This was introduced in May 2015 in the Penta region making this the first region within the European Union to achieve this. Since then, flow-based market coupling has been continuously optimised in order to achieve higher welfare gains, and now provides the basis for market coupling for the day-ahead markets which is fully embedded in the EU.  In order to increase the available transmission capacity for cross-border trade on the intraday market, SG 1 promoted a coordinated process for calculating intraday capacities which was implemented in March 2016 following the flow-based market coupling of the day-ahead markets for all borders in the region as an initial step towards the coupling of the European intraday markets.  The Support Group has been able to gain privileged insights into the radical changes in the electricity landscape and management of the electricity markets. Whilst the electricity operators were still operating largely independently of each other in 2005, over the years the working group has promoted 32  cooperation between the players, which for example has led to the formation of regional groups of TSOs within their associations, the merging of electricity exchanges and TSOs and the formation of new regional players (TSCNet, Coreso, formerly CASC-CWE, SSC).  opportunities for joint action.  Internal electricity market/flexibility: Support Group 3 (SG 3) concentrates on issues concerning flexibility in the region. So far, the work of SG 3 has been focused on the areas of balancing energy, intraday and the role of load management, and hence three important areas for regional cooperation for improving the flexibility of our electricity markets. Several technical background documents have been drawn up detailing the main obstacles to any greater use of flexibility within the Penta region. SG 3 is open to traditional participants (regulatory authorities and TSOs) as well as other players such as distribution system operators (DSOs), major consumer associations and renewable energy producers.  Existing approaches have been evaluated and good practices have been shared within the Pentalateral Forum in the area of balancing energy. The Pentalateral Forum also plays an important role in the drawn up a report on load management which depicts the current situation in the Penta region and in particular details the regulations and areas of responsibility of new market players in each country with the region. A hydrogen workshop has been held in order to identify potential areas for further cooperation in this field between the countries involved.  Reliability of supply Support Group 2 (SG 2) focuses on issues concerning security of supply in the region. In June 2017, the countries involved signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on cooperation concerning security of supply. On that basis and in light of the new EU Regulation on cooperation in the area of risk-a better shared understanding of national concerns, identify potentially relevant (cross-border) crisis situations within the region and assess various different measures for reducing the impacts of any crises.  The first regional Generation Adequacy Assessment (GAA) carried out by the TSOs of the countries involved and published in March 2015 was a real milestone. The methodology used for the assessment was based on a probabilistic and chronological approach with hourly resolution for the years 2015/2016 and 2020/2021 and hence represented a significant improvement compared to the existing deterministic approaches. Furthermore, the transmission system operators of the countries involved used a shared regional dataset, whereby they relied on the same scenarios and assumptions, such as for example a temperature-dependent load model for the entire region and harmonised probabilistic hydrological data.  The governments of the countries of the Pentalateral Energy Forum are certain that these parameters will also continue to be relevant in the future. In addition to continuing their work in the aforementioned areas, the countries involved will also work on the following key focus areas in the next few years as part of the Pentalateral Energy Forum:  DECARBONISATION OF THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR  Shared vision of a decarbonised electricity supply in the countries involved by 2050: The countries involved discuss their ideas for achieving a decarbonised electricity supply by 2050 (and intermediate goals for 2030 and 2040) based on a highly efficient energy system heavily characterised by renewable sources of energy, a gradual phase-out of fossil fuel power generation and efficient final consumption of electricity. As part of an initial step, national scenarios for the potential creation of the electricity system in 2050 are being compared and similarities and differences between these scenarios and the ways in which security of supply is guaranteed in them are being identified. This is providing a basis for the development of a shared understanding of the expectations and challenges involved in the development of the future electricity system.  Start of cross-border cooperation in the area of renewable sources of energy: The countries involved are voluntarily drawing up a package of joint approaches covering various different levels of cooperation; for example, opportunities are being explored for opening up national calls for tenders and/or carrying out cross-border calls for tenders, joint calls for tenders for interested for interested Pentalateral Energy Forum countries. 33   The countries of the Pentalateral Energy Forum also support the work currently being carried out by the European Commission and the Member States to develop a financing mechanism for renewable sources of energy in the EU.  Integration of e-mobility options and services without regional restrictions By promoting e-mobility (including options with fuel cells), the countries involved are contributing to an increase in the share of renewable energies used in the transport sector. They are supporting the integration/implementation of unrestricted e-mobility options and services in the Penta region by identifying and, where necessary, removing barriers to the cross-border deployment of e-mobility and charging services and ensuring interoperability.  Assessment of various different carbon pricing options and their cross-border effects on electricity prices Penta countries which are planning on or are considering pricing carbon are voluntarily exchanging information on political approaches to introducing carbon pricing, on the positive and negative impacts on the reduction of CO2 emissions as well as on security of supply, price developments and fair competition.  INTERNAL ELECTRICITY MARKET  Market integration The Penta countries are continuing to work on improving monitoring of flow-based market coupling with the aim of increasing cross-border trade, improving public welfare and optimising benefits for consumers. The countries involved are making the monitoring process more innovative in order to be able to create joint key indicators which are necessary for assessing progress towards a fully decarbonised Pentalateral electricity market by 2050.  The countries involved are working together on a swift implementation of -border impacts on the energy markets (e.g. further development and improvement of re-dispatching cooperation in the Penta region).  Flexibility The Penta countries are focusing on the effects of the implementation of flexibility options, including -to-and e-mobility and are analysing specific electricity-related barriers to sectoral coupling.  In light of the potential use of hydrogen, which is increasingly derived from renewable sources of energy, the countries involved are exploring possible joint approaches to guarantees of origin, cross-border infrastructure, the relevant roles of TSOs and DSOs and standards for hydrogen admixtures and are exchanging information and best practice on funding programmes for hydrogen projects and innovative projects and on the future role of hydrogen in general.  RELIABILITY OF SUPPLY  The Adequacy Assessment and are including improved weather data, the latest figures and goals from the National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) for identifying the future energy mix, and other sensitivity analyses. The TSOs of the countries involved are currently developing the third assessment for the timeframe up until 2021 and/or 2025 and are including regional circumstances (based on national ones), improved flow-based calculations and sensitivities relating to flexibility on the consumption side.  the context of regional cooperation and the Regulation on risk-preparedness, the Penta countries have begun to hold talks with ENTSO-E, the Commission and other stakeholders in order to set out rules for cooperation between the Member States which will help to identify potential regional crisis scenarios as well as prevent and handle electricity supply crises and prepare for them, taking solidarity and transparency as well as the requirements of a competitive internal electricity market into consideration. The Penta countries are working together on developing specific regional measures for crisis situations.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR THE ENERGY TRANSITION The Pentalateral Energy Forum will exchange views and ideas on potential regional approaches to increasing energy efficiency and expanding the use of renewable sources of energy; as such, joint approaches could be explored, for example with financial institutions such as the European Investment 34  Bank (EIB), by means of which the risks in both areas could be reduced, in turn making it easier to achieve the goals in the countries involved.         35  JOINT SECTION ON THE NORTH SEAS ENERGY COOPERATION    Germany is part of the wider North Sea region, which has impressive renewable energy potential. The European Commission estimates that offshore wind energy from the North Sea could cover up to 12% consumption by 2030.  Projects in the areas of offshore power generation and cable infrastructure can have cross-border impacts on energy prices, security of supply and the environment, including the availability of maritime space and the pace of innovation. As such, the North Sea coastal states can benefit considerably from cooperation.  The North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC) was founded in 2016. It is an initiative for voluntary, grass roots-based and market-oriented regional cooperation. The aim is to create synergies, prevent incompatibilities in terms of national policies, share and exchange knowledge regarding tried-and-tested approaches, and promote joint strategies, where possible and beneficial. The continued cost-effective use of offshore renewable sources of energy, in particular wind energy, should be coordinated and promoted in order to ensure a sustainable, secure and affordable energy supply in the North Sea coastal states through an increased and better coordinated use of offshore wind energy as well as through potential joint projects or cluster projects. The NSEC primarily pursues a gradual approach with the long-term perspective of further integration and increased efficiency of electricity wholesale markets, while contributing to the simultaneous reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and average wholesale price ranges and to an improved security of supply in the region.  The North Seas Energy Cooperation comprises the following 10 countries and also enjoys the involvement of the European Commission: Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark.  Regional cooperation When drawing up this plan, Germany availed itself of the NSEC, whereby experts in the working groups exchanged and shared their knowledge and experience of certain aspects, for example regarding obstacles and tried-and-tested approaches relating to national use of offshore wind energy and in particular regarding the coordination of national renewable energy plans concerning offshore wind energy for 2030 and market integration.  Germany also consulted the other North Sea coastal states for its National Energy and Climate Plan with regard to planned offshore wind energy for 2030 and related aspects of cable planning.   WG 1: Maritime spatial planning and environmental soundness WG 2: Development and regulation of offshore cables and other offshore infrastructure  WG 3: Support framework and financing of offshore wind energy projects WG 4: Standards, technical specifications and regulations in the area of offshore wind energy  Maritime spatial planning and environmental soundness As part of the North Seas Energy Cooperation, Germany is contributing to developing a joint environmental impact assessment procedure. In order to achieve our energy and climate goals within the EU, we need to gain a better understanding of the potential ecological limitations of using wind energy on a large scale in the North Sea. More work needs to be done in the area of maritime spatial planning and environmental soundness so that the North  the use of offshore wind energy in the North Sea, the North Sea coastal states will continue to cooperate closely in the areas of maritime spatial planning, environmental research and cumulative environmental impact assessments of wind farms by authorities responsible for energy, maritime spatial planning and the environment.  36  Offshore cables and other offshore infrastructure The NSEC serves as a platform for collaborating on concepts for potential joint offshore wind energy projects and a coordinated electricity infrastructure, including the transmission infrastructure.  Germany is working with the other North Seas Energy Cooperation countries with a view to seizing the opportunities offered by specific cooperation projects. In addition to joint offshore wind energy projects, which connect several cross-border solutions to connect offshore wind farms to the grid and would strive to achieve synergies with the capacity to interconnect countries, as well as work on corresponding rules for the market.  Germany is therefore contributing to developing opportunities for cooperation in the area of hybrid projects, is identifying legal, regulatory and commercial barriers and is dealing with them. Coordinating a stronger degree of interconnection between the NSEC countries could also result in more surplus energy flowing into other countries and covering demand there as part of a well-functioning internal energy market.  The NSEC has drawn up a list of potential areas and projects in the region where joint projects could be particularly beneficial. These include: (1) the IJmuiden Ver offshore wind farm to the UK, (2) CGS IJmuiden Ver  Norfolk, (3) COBRA Cable, (4) the DE-NL offshore wind farm and (5) the North Seas Wind Power Hub. The NSEC is working on developing specific concepts for the implementation of select projects from the aforementioned list.  The NSEC will continue to work on action plans for the specific hybrid projects, which could also be further developed at national and regional level. The NSEC will also continue to serve as a forum for deliberating on how to deal with uncertainties regarding the regulatory treatment of hybrid projects at EU level and national level as well as a forum for discussing options for solving such issues.  Support framework and financing of offshore wind energy projects rk provides a platform for sharing and exchanging tried-and-tested approaches to designing funding programmes and developing and further developing new concepts for overcoming new challenges in the area of funding offshore wind energy as well as developing potential options for future joint wind energy projects.  exchanging tried-and-tested processes for designing funding programmes for offshore wind energy and, where possible, establishing joint principles and potential options for aligning funding.  With regard to the coordination of calls for tenders, Germany regularly shares information with other NSEC countries regarding its national call-for-tenders schedule. This helps identify any potential time overlaps and ensures as steady a flow as possible in the call-for-tenders process in the North Sea region in order to optimise competition and ensure the best value for money for consumers. Alongside other criteria and where possible, Germany is prepared to take the call-for-tenders schedules into consideration in its future call-for-tenders planning in order to avoid any unnecessary bottlenecks and ensure a steady capacity flow without any disruption cycles for those involved.  As part of the NSEC, Germany shares information regarding its expected national offshore wind energy course, its national offshore use plans and tried-and-tested processes for developing calls for tenders for offshore wind energy and discusses these topics in this context.  During the meeting of ministers held on 20 June 2019 in Esbjerg, the North Sea coastal states agreed to cooperate in order to achieve total installed capacity for the NSEC member states of an estimated minimum of 70 GW by  GW (also see Section 2.1.2).  In order to take the dynamics involved in the use of offshore wind energy in the region into account, the long-term planned aggregated capacity of at least 70 GW by 2030 can be achieved with indicative milestones for the region of around 25 GW in 2020 and 54 GW in 2025. As part of the NSEC, Germany also helps with analysing and developing options for the mobilisation of investments in joint projects, for example through EU funds such as the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) infrastructure fund as well as through help from institutional investors. Such future joint projects could include cross-border projects for renewable sources of energy in line with the CEF proposal. Harmonisation of specifications, regulations and technical standards The North Seas Energy Cooperation works on harmonising standards and technical requirements, which could help further reduce the costs involved in the use of offshore wind energy. The harmonisation of specifications, regulations and technical standards focuses on five areas. These are: (1) aviation, identification and lighting, (2) 37  health and safety, (3) certification of regulatory requirements, (4) design of wind farms and site investigation, and (5) research approaches. The NSEC works on developing proposals and recommendations for implementation in close cooperation with industry. The goal of the recommendations is to reduce costs whilst simultaneously ensuring feasibility. The Cooperation will continue to work on harmonising standards and technical requirements as well as sharing and exchanging tried-and-tested approaches for removing unnecessary regulation and reducing costs for the industry.                   38  1.4.ii. Explanation of how regional cooperation is considered in the plan  The energy transition can only succeed, and progress can only be made in the field of climate protection if both are enshrined at EU level and backed up with regional cooperation. Regional cooperation  in the form of bilateral cooperation or joint initiatives and forums involving multiple EU Member States  therefore important existing regional cooperation arrangements with European partners covered in the plan are mentioned below by way of an overview. They can be found in the corresponding regional cooperation sections of the NECP:  Bilateral cooperation  The Federal Government cooperates closely with many other EU Member States (in particular its direct neighbours) on energy and climate policy. Cooperation with certain Member States has been stepped up and made more concrete through the adoption of joint memoranda of understanding. In the current parliamentary term; for example, the Meseberg Declaration was adopted in June 2018, the Declaration on Energy Cooperation was adopted in July 2018 and the Treaty of Aachen was signed by Germany and France on 22 January 2019 with a view to strengthening yet further the existing (and highly productive) cooperation between France and Germany in the field of energy and climate policy. Germany cooperates with France inter alia through the French/German Energy Platform, the internal energy market and energy research projects (see Sections 3.2., 3.4.3., 3.5.). A great deal of knowledge and experience is also exchanged thanks to the activities of the German/French Office for the Energy Transition. In addition, the energy agencies of both countries, dena and ADEME, have been cooperating for years in cross-border projects as part of the French/German Energy Platform (see Sections 3.2. and 3.4.3.). The memorandum of understanding on energy cooperation with Belgium issued in October 2018 stated inter alia that Germany would help Belgium to resolve the specific security-of-supply problems faced by the country in winter 2018/19. In October 2019, a declaration of intent on the energy transition was signed with the Netherlands, which defines major areas of cooperation, for example in offshore wind, hydrogen and security of supply. As part of the strategic dialogue between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, there are regular exchanges on bilateral and European climate and energy issues in Working Group 5 on the Environment and Climate and in Working Group 10 on Energy.  European Climate Initiative  The European Climate Initiative was launched by the Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety in 2017. Bilateral and multilateral projects within the framework of the European Climate Initiative will focus on topics including the development of climate strategies and their implementation at various levels, exchanges of information on climate policy instruments, and measures and projects in all the relevant sectors: energy, industry, transport, private households, commerce, trade and services, waste, agriculture and land use (see Section 3.1.1.).  Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP)  BEMIP was set up in 2009, and its members include all of the Baltic Sea coastal states which belong to the EU, as well as Norway in the role of observer; organisational matters are chiefly handled by the European Commission. The Federal Government sits on the BEMIP working groups (see Section 3.1.2.) and is involved in revising the BEMIP action plan.  North Seas Energy Forum/North Sea Energy Cooperation  In 2016, the North Sea coastal states and the European Commission founded the North Seas Energy Forum with a view to further expanding their cooperation in the energy sector. The cooperation facilitated through the Forum relates primarily to the expansion of offshore wind power and grid infrastructures, as well as maritime spatial planning in the North Sea. The Member States involved (including the Federal Republic of Germany) have exchanged information on the relevant sections of the North developed a joint NECP section (see Sections 1.4.i., 3.1.2. and 3.5.) within the framework of this initiative.  Pentalateral Energy Forum  The Pentalateral Energy Forum was set up in 2005 for the purpose of facilitating cooperation between the EU Member States of Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France, Austria and Germany in the areas of electricity market coupling, security of supply, crisis preparedness and flexibility of electricity markets. Switzerland participates in this Forum as an observer. The Penta Member States involved (including the Federal Republic of Germany) have exchanged information on the relevant sections of the NECPs and developed a joint NECP section within the framework of this initiative (see Sections 1.4.i. and 3.4.3.).  39  Pentalateral Gas Forum  The Pentalateral Gas Forum was set up in 2009 for the purpose of facilitating cooperation between the EU Member States of Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France and Germany in the area of gas supply (see Section 3.3.).  Cooperation in regional groups within the framework of the Trans-European Energy Networks (Trans-European Networks Energy  TEN-E Regional Groups)  The Federal Government participates in several TEN-E Regional Groups for the purpose of cooperating with other EU Member States. The Regional Groups correspond to the primary energy infrastructure corridors referred to in the TEN-E Regulation and hold regional responsibility for identifying projects of common interest (PCI) relating to the energy infrastructure developments required under the TEN-E Regulation. Pursuant to Article 4 of the TEN-E Regulation, the projects in question should contribute to at least one of the following criteria: market integration, sustainability, competition (diversification of supply sources, routes and supplying counterparts) and security of supply (see Sections 3.3. and 3.4.3.).
