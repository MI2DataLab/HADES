3.4.  Dimension internal energy market 3.4.1. Electricity infrastructure i. Policies and measures to achieve the targeted level of interconnectivity as set out in point (d) of Article 4 A target of at least 15 % by 2030 was established at EU level for the level of interconnectivity of electricity grids.  Through the measures and policies defined in order to develop the electricity infrastructure, Romania thus undertakes to achieve an interconnection rate of at least 15.4 % in 2030.  The relevant policies and measures considered by Romania are described below and ordered by their interaction with other dimensions of the Plan: main vector in the trans-sectoral impact, secondary effect of measures pertaining to other dimensions and to the dimension concerned. The internal energy market (electricity infrastructure) - main dimension The development of these projects will also improve the energy security of Romania, considering the facilitation of cross-border trade, in particular in emergency cases. Developing the electricity infrastructure, thus reaching an interconnectivity rate of at least 15.4 % In order to reach the interconnectivity rate, the ETG Development Plan includes the following projects:   Oradea South;  the 400 kV OPL Iron Gates - by building a new 400 kV station;    Stâlpu, with an entry/exit circuit in   - -   the 400 kV OPL in double circuit (equipped circuit) Smârdan     - Arad, including the station. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         The above projects are a priority in the achievement of the objectives stipulated in the EU directives/regulations on the interconnectivity rate of electricity grids in 2030 (15 % of the total installed capacity in 2030).   The minimum available capacity for cross-border trade  Preparing a methodology/list of projects in the first half of 2020, which includes long-term solutions to enable Transelectrica to meet the obligation under Article 16(8) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 - hall not limit the volume of interconnection capacity to be made available to market participants as a means of solving congestion inside their own bidding zone or as a means of managing flows resulting from transactions internal to .) following minimum levels of available capacity for cross-zonal trade are reached: (a) for borders using a coordinated net transmission capacity approach, the minimum capacity shall be 70 % of the transmission capacity respecting operational security limits after deduction of contingencies, as determined in accordance with the capacity allocation and congestion management guideline adopted on the basis of Article 18(5) of  Other policies/measures pertaining to the dimension In order to achieve the abovementioned investments/objectives, the following will also be considered:  implementing Law No 120/2019 on certain measures required to perform the works and to implement projects of national importance regarding the electricity transmission be responsible for facilitating and coordinating the authorisation process for projects of national importance regarding electricity transmission is the Ministry of Energy, Economy and the Business Environment in accordance with the legal rules on authorisation of construction works) issues construction permits;  supporting projects involving the deployment of electricity transmission lines at central and local authority level. Therefore, project inter-cooperation methods must be established with these central and local authorities, such as setting up working groups designated at central and local level per county for the settlement of aspects/issues/delivery of opinions/etc. in connection with the development of projects;  setting up a one-stop shop for infrastructure projects (construction of electricity transmission lines) for the delivery of opinions needed in order to issue construction permits;  (sequence) expropriation of the entire safety corridor of an OPL. ii. Regional cooperation in this area50 Not applicable iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds  Projects may be funded from external non-reimbursable funds and from the own funds of the transmission system operator (e.g. electricity transmission tariff and/or other revenues - ETG connection charge, procurement procedures for interconnection capacities etc.).                                                 50 Other than the PCI Regional Groups established under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         See also Chapter 5.3.  3.4.2. The power transmission infrastructure i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.2, including, where applicable, specific measures to enable the delivery of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and other key infrastructure projects According to the competences and duties established under the Law on electricity and natural gas and the Specific Licensing Conditions, Transelectrica plans to develop the ETG taking into account the current stage and the projected trend in consumption, the production park and the electricity exchanges, and prepares a development plan every two years for the following successive ten years, which is submitted to ANRE for approval and to the grid owner (the Romanian Government).  Considering that the Development Plan is based on the strategies and policies of the Romanian Government, and on the objectives of the new Union policy on energy and climate change, the Plan sets out the measures required to develop the projects deemed essential for the electricity transmission infrastructure. Similarly, having regard to compliance with Article 22 of Directive 2009/73/EC and to the duties established under the Law on electricity and natural gas, Transgaz prepares a development plan annually for a period of ten years, which is submitted to ANRE for approval and to the grid owner (the Romanian Government). In the preparation of the latest edition (2019-2028), Transgaz also considered including an elaboration of the measures regarding the funding of the major projects referred to in the Plan (estimated at EUR 1.25 billion, of which 65 % is estimated to be covered from attracted sources). Moreover, in order to facilitate decarbonisation, decentralisation of production and digitalisation of the energy sector in order to have more connected, efficient and sustainable energy systems, an assessment is needed in regard to the current technical condition of the electrical equipment and installations of electricity transmission and distribution grids, and to the costs of investments required for the efficient management of the grid. ii. Regional cooperation in this area51 The Government of the Republic of Moldova and the Romanian Government signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 2015 for the development of projects required for the interconnection of natural gas and electricity networks between the Republic of Moldova and Romania.  In this respect, the asynchronous interconnection of the electricity systems of the Republic of Moldova with those of Romania is planned through the implementation of the project involving construction of the Back-to--- The interconnection works within the territory of the Republic of Moldova are funded under the Loan Agreements signed with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank. Within the territory of Romania, Transelectrica will perform the  52.                                                  51 Other than the PCI Regional Groups established under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 52 Extract from the Protocol of the Nineth Session of the Mixed Intergovernmental Commission for  The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds Romania will use the EU funds to strengthen the administrative and institutional capacity and for technical assistance in the development of strategic infrastructure projects.  See also paragraph 5.3 herein above. 3.4.3. Market integration i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.3 The relevant policies and measures considered by Romania are described below and ordered by their interaction with other dimensions of the Plan: main vector in the trans-sectoral impact, secondary effect of measures pertaining to other dimensions and to the dimension concerned. Trans-sectoral policies and measures 1) Internal market - main dimension Liberalisation of energy markets Romania aims at de-regulating the internal energy and gas markets in order to ensure harmonisation with the Community acquis. The deregulation calendar targets the staged liberalisation to ensure that the impact of transition on the consumer is low, as much as possible. Moreover, the liberalisation measures are purposed to develop a legislative framework that is favourable for investments that may contribute to energy security, also enhancing the flexibility of the national energy system. In this respect, the main measures are:    Implementation of a deregulation calendar  electricity Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electricity, the Regulatory Authority approved the rules for removing and/or mitigating the impact of certain measures or policies that are likely to contribute to pricing restriction on the electricity market. This order also provides for the deregulation calendar with the following characteristics:  producers holding/commercially operating dispatchable nuclear and hydro power units/plants must supply to suppliers of last resort the quantity of electricity required to secure the consumption of household consumers under conditions regulated by ANRE only until 31 December 2020;  ANRE will approve the prices charged by suppliers of last resort to household consumers only until 31 December 2020;  from 1 January 2020 onward, competitive prices will be charged to non-household consumers as beneficiaries of the universal service and to non-household consumers who had not been entitled to eligibility. Therefore, from 1 January 2021 onward, the energy market will be fully liberalised and the consumption demand of household consumers will be covered exclusively by competitive transactions, the price for the electricity supplied to household consumers being determined by suppliers.   Implementation of a deregulation calendar  natural gas In accordance with Government Emergency Order No 1/2020 regarding certain fiscal-budgetary measures and amending and supplementing certain legislative acts, producers, including their subsidiaries and/or affiliates belonging to the same group of The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         economic interest engaged in natural gas extraction and sale of gas extracted within the territory of Romania, must sell the quantities of natural gas from the current domestic production to suppliers of household consumers and to heat producers at the price of RON 68/MWh by 30 June 2020. Moreover, the draft law provides for limited supply of natural gas at the regulated price and under the framework contracts by 30 June 2020 for household consumers. In conclusion, full liberalisation of the natural gas market starts on 1 July 2020.  The right of production operators, energy storage operators and supply operators to enter and exit the energy market based on the assessment of the economic and financial viability of the business   The conduct of transactions in electricity (subject to compliance with competition rules) on the electricity markets, including non-regulated markets and electricity stock markets, markets for trade in electricity, capacities, balancing services and system services within all the time intervals, including futures markets, day-ahead markets and intra-day markets In the light of Article 10 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943, Romania already submitted a report to the Commission regarding the identification of inconsistencies that would not allow the application of the Regulation provisions and which are likely to have direct and/or indirect implications for pricing on the wholesale electricity market, presenting legislative acts already issued in order to remove these inconsistencies and measures envisaged in order to further remove them. Regional integration of the internal energy market The Romanian authorities, together with the participants in the internal energy market (e.g. OPCOM, Transelectrica etc.), are engaged in the initiatives meant to facilitate the integration of the electricity market at regional level.  The participation of OPCOM and Transelectrica in any initiative meant to facilitate the integration of the electricity market in Romania in the internal energy market OPCOM is engaged in the implementation of Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 establishing a guideline on capacity allocation and congestion management in the context of creating and achieving the Single Day-Ahead Coupling (SDAC) and the Single Intra-Day Coupling (SIDC), involving the corresponding contractual framework. SDAC implementation, development and operation process, the following actions were carried out:  OPCOM is part of the operational contractual framework for cooperation of TSOs and DEMOs pertaining to the creation, development and operation of SDAC. In this respect, OPCOM participates directly in the SDAC creation and operation activities, including as regards performance of joint activities, participation in the development process (including the development of the coupling infrastructure, PCR), implementation.  The day-ahead market in Romania, which is administered by OPCOM, has been functioning since 19 November 2014 under a coupled regime with the markets in Coupling of Regions) solution, which is the coupling solution for SDAC.  The national regulatory authorities in Austria, Germany and Poland, together with the 4M MC countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia) The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         initiated together an interim NTC-based market coupling project. OPCOM and Transelectrica participate in the development and implementation of the DE-AT-PL-hieving coupling between 4M MC and Poland and the Multi-Regional Coupling (MRC) by the implementation of the NTC-based implicit allocation for related borders and the single coupling of day-ahead markets (SDAC). Operation is estimated to start in the third quarter of 2020.  National authorities, transmission system operators and DEMOs in Romania and Bulgaria have initiated a NTC-based project of day-ahead markets coupling between the two countries. The project is estimated to be completed in December 2020; OPCOM and Transelectrica are part of the Core Flow-Based Market Coupling Project, which is purposed to achieve the development and implementation of a flow-based day-ahead market coupling throughout the Core region (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia) under the single day-ahead market coupling (SDAC) project. Operation is estimated by the parties to the Core Flow-Based Market Coupling Project to start in 2021 and the exact time will be confirmed depending on the progress of the project development activities and on the decisions of ACER and the European Commission, where applicable  Following the approval by the national regulatory authorities in the two countries, the TSOs and market operators in Romania and Bulgaria decided, at the end of November 2019, to initiate a project for the implementation of day-ahead electricity markets coupling by rendering them operational under a coupled regime and by integrating them in the SDAC single coupling also, at the same time taking into account the progress of the coupling projects already under implementation. The aim of the project for the implementation of the coupling of market zones in Romania and Bulgaria (BG-RO MC Project) was to implement the implicit NTC-based allocation on this border by applying the PCR coupling solution and the SDAC operational rules and procedures. The project activities started with a general implementation calendar agreed upon and the cooperation reference terms, which were sustained by the national regulatory authorities in the two countries. According to current estimations, operation is due to start in December 2020.  SIDC implementation, development and operation process, the following actions were carried out:  OPCOM is part of the operational contractual framework for cooperation of TSOs and DEMOs pertaining to the creation, development and operation of SIDC. In this respect, OPCOM participates directly in the SIDC creation and operation activities, including as regards performance of joint activities, participation in the development process (including the development of the coupling infrastructure, XBID), implementation. The second XBID operationalisation wave was launched on 19 November 2019 and it concerned the integration of the borders pertaining to the integration of the bidding zones in Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovenia in the already coupled area (the first coupling wave included Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Finland, France, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, The Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Sweden, and Spain). In 2019, the President of ANRE approved Order No 202/2019 amending the Regulation for scheduling production units and dispatchable consumers, as approved by Order No 32/2013 of the National Energy Regulatory Authority, and repealing the Rules of organisation and functioning of the intra-day electricity market approved by Order No 73/2013 of the President of the National Energy Regulatory Authority and endorsed the Procedure for the functioning of the intra-day electricity market, which was prepared by Opcom SA, under Opinion No 89/2019. Both documents were required to launch, on 19 November 2019, the second wave of coupling of the intra-day electricity markets by local projects; Romania has The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         thus adopted the single European solution of intra-day markets coupling in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 of 24 July 2015 establishing a guideline on capacity allocation and congestion management and with its subsequent documents approved by all the regulatory authorities in the EU Member States or by ACER. By extending the operation of the intra-day market to the regional level and adopting a single European solution, the liquidity of the intra-day market is expected to increase, ensuring a reduction in the share of the balancing market and more accurate balancing of participants, the better use of the production capacity and resources, the optimal use of the cross-border transmission capacity and, last but not least, as a direct consequence, the enhanced security of supply for consumers in Romania.  The preparation of a common capacity calculation methodology in the SEE region (Romania, Bulgaria and Greece) and participation in the regional operational security coordination (RSC) centre in the SEE regions (Romania, Bulgaria, Greece) and GRIT (Greece, Italy).   The development of a common capacity calculation methodology in the SEE CCR capacity calculation region comprising Bulgaria, Romania and Greece as Member States. The project concerns the preparation of a common capacity calculation methodology, which is harmonised at SEE CCR level, including EU Member States, i.e. Romania, Bulgaria and Greece, more specifically the Romania-Bulgaria and Bulgaria-Greece borders. The daily and intra-day capacity calculation methodology within the SEE CCR was prepared by the Transmission System Operators in Romania, Bulgaria and Greece and was approved by the national energy regulatory authorities in Romania, Bulgaria and Greece, as EU Member States, on 10 April 2019. Insofar as they are ready, the WB6 countries (the six countries in the Western Balkans), for which the capacity calculation methodology was prepared by the Energy Community, will also adhere to the project. The methodology is pending approval and implementation under a project administered by the Energy Community. The EU energy law [the Third Energy Package under Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 and Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222] imposes on Member States and, in particular, on electricity transmission system operators, the obligation to develop and strengthen cooperation at regional level for the coordinated operation of power systems.   Through the energy borders with its neighbouring countries that are EU Member States (Hungary and Bulgaria), Romania is part of two cross-border transfer capacity coordinated calculation regions:   By the Romania--border transfer capacity coordinated calculation region. In terms of regional operational security coordination services, this region is served by the regional operational security coordination centre TSCNET Services GmbH (registered in Germany). Transelectrica is a shareholder of TSCNET Services GmbH since 2018.   By the Romania-Bulgaria border, Romania is part of the South-East Europe (SEE) cross-border transfer capacity coordinated calculation region.  In terms of regional operational security coordination services, this region will be served by a self-standing legal entity exercising the role of regional operational security coordination centre (hereafter SEE RSC).   Transelectrica will participate in the establishment of the regional operational security coordination centre (RSC), which will take place in Thessaloniki, Greece and will serve the SEE cross-border transmission capacity coordinated calculation regions (Bulgaria, Greece, Romania) and GRIT (Greece, Italy). The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Implementing a capacity mechanism The implementation of a capacity mechanism will lead to the improvement of the energy security parameters. The mechanism is purposed to provide for additional production capacities alongside the active capacities on the electricity market, which are required in order to maintain balance between generation and consumption of electricity in extraordinary unpredictable cases, having regard to the particularities of the energy market in Romania. The capacity mechanism thus intervenes to secure supply when the offer on the electricity market becomes scarce, despite the free prices, in order to enable balance between offer and demand. At a first stage, the Ministry of the Economy, Energy and the Business Environment intends to conduct a study on the development of a capacity mechanism adapted to the specific conditions of Romania. The study outputs will inform the discussions with the European Commission in the context of the implementation of such mechanism.  Developing a support mechanism of the Contracts for Differences (CfD) type The CfD instrument constitutes a transparent and non-discriminatory mechanism addressed to all investments in the production of low-carbon electricity. Its characteristics are a key element with integrated effects for the Decarbonisation (energy from RES) and Energy Security Dimensions. In the context of the targets undertaken in this plan for 2030 as regards the share of energy produced from renewable sources, the mechanism will provide adequate support in order to achieve these targets. Unlike the current support mechanism for renewable energy sources regarding the green certificates market, the implementation of a CfD mechanism may provide additional benefits and an attractive and predictable environment for investors, such as:   bringing about enhanced safety and stability of revenues by removing exposal to the volatile prices on the wholesale market;  avoiding overcompensation of producers when the electricity price rises above the strike price;  protecting producers from price fluctuations on the market;  protecting consumers from the payment of the support when the price on the electricity market rises;  safeguarding a contractual agreement under the law for a predetermined period, which provides reasonable flexibility for project developers and protection against unexpected changes;  providing enhanced safety for investors: once the contract has been signed, investors are capable of implementing projects without being affected by the political risk or by the fact that the market trend is likely to affect the return on the projects to a significant extent;  in order to support the necessary investments, the CfD mechanism must provide for a clear and transparent framework that addresses the risks to which long-term investments are exposed, and be reliable and predictable to investors;  in correlation with the trend in the decommissioning of certain capacities and against the background of the additional capacity needs (determined by the increase in the demand), new production units could benefit from the CfD mechanism under bidding procedures in the sense that support would be geared by the lowest price offered by an investor/developer;  Transition from fixed subsidies for RES to their determination under a competition is an advantageous mechanism, particularly in terms of costs, because it leads to a more efficiency allocation of capital expenses in the context of building the RES production units. The technologies considered as potential beneficiaries of a CfD scheme are: The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          technology for use of renewable sources;  nuclear technology;  storage of electricity. The implementation of a CfD mechanism for low-carbon technologies requires a complementary legislative and regulatory framework which elaborates on the implementation elements.  Long-term power purchase agreements with clients (PPA) This type of contract supports consumers who wish to purchase solely renewable energy, generating a positive impact under the Decarbonisation dimension (RES). Typically, a PPA is a long-term energy supply bilateral contract concluded between the client (buyer) and the energy producer (seller).  The contract provides for the supply of an hourly quantity of electricity (with related guarantees of origin) depending on the consumption profile of the final consumer. Moreover, it provides the consumer with the opportunity of negotiating their contract directly with the electricity producer, at the same time being independent and secured against energy price fluctuations in cases of high demand.  Other policies/measures pertaining to the dimension Amending the primary and secondary law in order to remove any inconsistencies that would not allow for the application of Regulations (EU) 2019/943 and 2019/941 and Directive (EU) 2019/944 on common rules for the internal market for electricity  Moreover, as a horizontal measure, which spreads through any initiative of the public sector, the quality of the administrative act in the energy sector will be improved by:  cutting red tape through enhanced transparency, digitalisation and introduction of the one-stop shop;  introducing the best practices on transparency and responsibility in the interaction between the user and the administrative system;  developing institutional mechanisms (such as whistle blowers);  removing the conflict of interests between public institutions and State-owned energy companies. ii. Measures to increase the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production such as smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, real-time price signals, including the roll-out of intraday market coupling and cross-border balancing markets The improvements to the internal market will generate multiplied effects and support under all the dimensions prioritised in the INECP, being a key factor in: Digitalisation of the Romanian energy system (smart grids) The digitisation of the Romanian energy system, including transmission and distribution grids (smart grids), plays an essential role in increasing production of energy from renewable -for-increasing integration of RES. In order to achieve this objective, Romania seeks to introduce smart meters and grids in the energy systems. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          The introduction of smart meters in the energy systems must constitute a national priority as a first step in the digitisation of the infrastructure. Smart metering is recognised for its benefits for final consumers, utilities companies and the whole energy system, including benefits for the environment, by enhancing energy efficiency and the RES integration in the NES. Smart grids will also integrate grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) solutions, which enable the staged introduction of RES projects and the enhanced reliability of the energy system. of implementation of electricity smart measurement systems (SMS) at national level for the period 2019- The mounting of smart measurement systems is free of charge for final consumers and distribution system operators are to recover their costs through the distribution tariff.

Coupling cross-border balancing markets  Transelectrica participates in the European process of implementation, development and operation of joint platforms on which balancing energy stocks will be traded, in this respect taking the following actions: Transelectrica acts as an observer in the TERRE project and participated in the preparation of the implementation framework for the LIBRA platform and in the completion of the design elements for this platform. For the time being, Transelectrica will keep its position of observer because it is an isolated TSO on the list of transmission system operators using replacement reserves in Eastern Europe. However, the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/2195 will be complied with by remodelling the platform of the balancing market at national level and by The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         using this type of reserve with the same characteristics, bidding method, and selection of bids so that, whenever one of the neighbouring TSOs requests entry to this regional balancing energy market, Romania is ready for coupling. The extension of the balancing market at regional level starts in 2020, with the launching of the LIBRA information platform, where replacement reserves will be traded in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2195 and in 2022, the operation of the balancing market is to be extended to the European level for frequency restoration reserves, which are traded on other two dedicated platforms under Articles 20 and 21 of the same Regulation. Balancing energy reserves will be thus traded on three market platforms designed and developed by transmission system operators under the projects:   TERRE (Trans European Replacement Reserve Exchange) concerns design, development and operation of the replacement reserve (RR) trading platform;  MARI (Manually Activated Reserves Initiative) concerns the design, development and operation of the manual frequency restoration reserve (mFRR) trading platform;  PICASSO (Platform for the International Coordination of Automated Frequency Restoration and Stable System Operation) concerns the design, development and operation of the automated frequency restoration reserve (aFRR) trading platform. Transelectrica is a member in the MARI and PICASSO projects, having a contribution, alongside the other member TSOs, to all the stages of design, development and operation of the mRRF and aRRF trading platforms. All the transmission system operators carrying out the automated frequency restoration process (aRRF) in accordance with Article 22 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2195 and under Part IV of Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 must put into service and use the European platform for the imbalance netting process. The ENTSO-E Market Committee chose the existing IGCC (International Grid Control Cooperation) project to become the future European imbalance netting platform. The main benefit of using the imbalance netting platform is the reduction in the quantity of aRRF activated balancing energy, with direct consequences for the costs on this market, possibly in the sense of their reduction. CNTEE Transelectrica SA is a member in the IGCC platform extension project, contributing to the modernisation and adaptation solutions for this platform in line with Regulation (EU) 2017/2195. At the same time, it conducts the operations involving the upgrading of the local equipment in order to be able to actively participate in the IGCC platform starting with the third quarter of 2020. Harmonisation of the imbalance netting interval every 15 minutes at European level is requested from the beginning of 2021, which is an obligation imposed on all transmission system operators in accordance with Article 53 of Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/2195 and with Article 8(4) of Regulation (EU) No 2019/943. The objectives of this action are: to promote intra-day trading and to develop commercial products with the same supply intervals in order to provide market participants with the possibility of balancing themselves as close as possible with the actual time.  Transelectrica, as a national coordinator and responsible authority for this action, collaborates with distribution system operators, relevant associations/organisations (RWEA, ACUE, COGEN, PATRES), OPEE and PRE in the process of adaptation of the measurement equipment and modernisation of data aggregation and processing platforms. Transelectrica prepared a proposal for a programme of implementation of the measures needed to provide for the settlement conditions on the wholesale electricity market at 15 minutes by the deadline of 1 January 2021, as required by Regulation (EU) 2019/943. The OMEPA Measurement Directorate The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         of Transelectrica updated the existing platform as a temporary solution to provide for the implementation of settlement at 15 minutes and initiated data exchange tests with distribution system operators. Moreover, the settlement operator will implement, by 1 January 2021, the changes required for transition to settlement on the wholesale electricity market at 15 minutes. Connection of renewable energy sources The connection of renewable energy sources to the electricity grids requires special measures at system level in order to maintain the security in the operation of energy systems and the increase in the number of producers with uncontrollable output leads to an increase in the frequency of occurrence of network congestions. In this respect, the transmission system operator included investment measures in the ten-year ETG Development Plan, which provide the necessary support to discharge, without major restrictions, the electricity produced by wind power plants in the Dobrogea and Moldova areas as well as in Banat and Southern Muntenia. 2) Internal market - secondary dimension  Fostering the development of the energy storage capacities is one of the key factors under the Energy Security dimension, which impacts the Internal Market. The implementation of these initiatives will lead to an increase in the competitiveness of the internal energy market, having a positive impact on the prices in the energy supplied to final consumers. The specific measures and policies are reflected in Section 3.3.  Supporting research-innovation initiatives and gradually adopting technologies with proved functionality and benefits in areas such as the Internet of Things, decentralised storage, blockchain and smart applications by strengthening the public-private partnership  Implementing demand response measures The implementation of demand response measures entails adaptation of prices in order -load hours. This will contribute to the increase in the competitiveness of electricity producers.  Aggregation  Final consumers may participate in organised electricity markets either directly or by aggregation if they have power above 500 kW approved in the connection certificate. If they have such approved power up to 500 kW inclusive, final consumers may participate in organised electricity markets excluding aggregation. iii) Where applicable, measures to ensure the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets Currently not applicable.  iv) Policies and measures to protect consumers, especially vulnerable and, where applicable, energy poor consumers, and to improve the competitiveness and contestability of the retail energy market See point 3.4.4. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         v. Description of measures to enable and develop demand response, including those addressing tariffs to support dynamic pricing53 See Chapter 2.4.3 3.4.4. Energy poverty i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.4 Romania intends to prepare and to implement a series of measures and policies designed to reduce energy poverty. Moreover, energy efficiency measures dedicated to vulnerable consumers are envisaged in order to reduce final consumption, which impact electricity and heat costs positively. The relevant policies and measures considered by Romania are described below and ordered by their interaction with other dimensions of the Plan: main vector in the trans-sectoral impact, secondary effect of measures pertaining to other dimensions and to the dimension concerned. Trans-sectoral policies and measures 1) Internal market - main dimension  Regulating and defining the vulnerable consumer and means for their financing In accordance with Government Emergency Order No 1/2020 regarding certain fiscal-budgetary measures and amending and supplementing certain legislative acts, the Romanian Government will regulate, by 31 December 2020, on the initiative of the relevant ministry, the legal status and regime of the vulnerable consumer and the means for their financing. Moreover, at the end of 2020, ANRE approved Order No 235/2019 approving the Regulation for supply of electricity to final consumers. In accordance with the regulation, the vulnerable consumer is considered to be the person with low income and/or with health conditions, electricity suppliers having a series of obligations in relation to the respective persons - securing the supply of electricity as a priority, limiting planned interruptions and prohibiting disconnection from the electricity grid in electricity crisis situations. Other policies/measures pertaining to the dimension The Ministry of the Economy, Energy and the Business Environment collaborates with the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, which is responsible for preparing the national action plan for energy poverty cases, which defines the critical situations and the consumers who cannot be disconnected in such situations, and specifies the recovery of related costs by operators under a specific procedure approved under a Government decision on a proposal from ANRE. According to the National Strategy for Social Inclusion and Reduction of Energy for 2015-2020 and to the Strategic Action Plan for 2015-2020, policies aim directly at reducing poverty and enhancing social inclusion in several key fields: social assistance and social security rights, energy poverty, employment, education, health, social participation and social services.                                                  53 In accordance with Article 15(8) of Directive 2012/27/EU The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         The social protection measures in the Strategic Action Plan also include improving the performance of the social assistance system to protect low-income persons and one of the specific objectives is to protect low-income and vulnerable consumers against the shocks generated by an increase in energy prices. The responsibility for the achievement of these objectives lies with the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.   providing for non-financial support for vulnerable low-income consumers by providing for the possibility of payment rescheduling (staggered payment of the electricity bill);  implementing the National Social Assistance Computer System;  Romania grants aids for home heating in accordance with Government Emergency Order No 70/2011, as repealed and replaced by Law No 196/2016, which should produce effects as of 1 April 2021. In order to ensure the fair granting of heat subsidies, the development of the national social assistance computer system is a prerequisite for building the capacity of the local public administration authorities. They will ensure the computer processing of data on the applicants and verification of the eligibility criteria for the categories of vulnerable consumers. The subsidy, which is currently applicable to all heat consumers, will be granted only to vulnerable consumers who have been identified as such by the responsible authorities in accordance with Law No 196/2016. Law No 123/2012 on electricity and natural gas, as subsequently amended, currently provides for the possibility of establishing a solidarity fund to financially support the vulnerable consumer.  Another important element in the achievement of the energy poverty objectives is ensuring just transition, in terms of social and economic impact, for the mono-industrial regions (e.g. Valea Jiului or other areas which are dependent on the coal industry or on other energy intensive sectors). The following initiatives have been thus put in place:  Transition. In this context, the Romanian State obtained support from the Commission to fund the study on the preparation of a transition strategy for Valea Jiului through the Structural Reform Support Service (SRSS) Programme.

It has been envisaged, for the financial year 2021-2027, to consider this region for Integrated Territorial Investment allocations. Such an initiative would replicate the good practices derived from the actions carried out to develop the Danube Delta, with the advantage of programmes designed according to the specificity and needs of the territory - demographic structure, migration intensity, number and specificity of jobs, and the potential that may be tapped.  On the initiative of the private sector, the Ministry of the economy, Energy and the Business Environment will support the project for the retraining/training centre in Valea Jiului. Its objective involves reallocation, reskilling and improvement in the tion, initiatives related to job searching and start-ups in dialogue with social partners.
