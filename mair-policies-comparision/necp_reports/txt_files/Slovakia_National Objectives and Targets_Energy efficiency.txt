2.2. Dimension: energy efficiency  i. The elements set out in Article 4(b) 1. the indicative national energy efficiency contribution to achieving the Unions energy efficiency targets of at least 32.5% in 2030 as referred to in Article 1(1) and Article 3(5) of Directive 2012/27/EU, based on either primary or final energy consumption, primary or final energy savings, or energy intensity.  In connection with the indicative national contribution in energy efficiency to achieving the Unions energy efficiency objectives, the Slovak Republic has created two scenarios - realistic and ambitious. When developing these scenarios, the starting point was the Low Carbon Growth Study for Slovakia: Implementation of the EU Climate and Energy Policy Framework by 2030. The main characteristics of the scenarios are:  As growth slows, some sectors and subsectors will expand while others shrink. Export-oriented production sectors, such as the motor vehicle subsector, are undergoing sustained expansion driven by external demand. Other sectors are slowing.  Continuous improvements in energy efficiency are taken into account.  The ETS will remain a major influence on the choice of energy form to 2050. The carbon price in the reference scenario will push energy consumption in industry towards lower-carbon fuels. The ETS will also bring energy savings, which should also contribute.  Industry demand for energy is anticipated to fall in parallel with the use of new efficient technologies in investments into industrial production.  The demand for electricity will increase during the outlook period.  Nuclear energy will play a key role in the electricity mix of the Slovak Republic.  In the reference scenario, steam-gas cycles will replace coal-fired power plants.  The construction of new nuclear power generation capacities in Slovakia is included, maintaining the importance of nuclear energy in the energy mix.  Demand for heat and steam will decrease thanks to continuously increasing energy efficiency. Based on the current trends in energy consumption, and also taking into account the predicted main characteristics affecting consumption trends to 2030, it can be stated that the achievement of the 32.5% target by Slovakia by 2030 is very improbable. Final energy consumption fell between 2010 and 2014. In 2014, however, this trend changed quite significantly, resulting in a level of final energy consumption reaching approximately the 2011 level as early as in 2017. Primary energy consumption showed a similar trend. In order to achieve the set national targets for 2030, whether in terms of final or primary energy consumption, it will be essential to ensure the consistent implementation of all the energy efficiency measures outlined in this Roadmap. However, achieving this ambition will be much more expensive than in the previous period given the very short-lived potential of measures with short payback periods.

This target is calculated in accordance with Article 7(1)(b) EED, which states that Member States shall achieve cumulative energy savings with the final consumer corresponding at least to annual new savings from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030 of 0.8% of the annual final energy consumption, to be determined as the average for the three most recent years before 1 January 2019. As official Eurostat data on final energy consumption for 2018 were not officially published at the time of the preparation of this NECP, the baseline period for calculating the target is 2015 to 2017. Eurostat data from Energy balance sheets 2017 DATA were used to calculate the target value.

This implies that Member States will not be able to count the energy savings achieved from individual measures or projects implemented before 2021, which is one of the barriers to the development of energy efficiency, and which also artificially created a reduction in the ambition to achieve the 2020 target. In practical terms this change means that the lifespan of measures implemented before 2020 is irrelevant from the perspective of achieving the target after 2020. In Figure 7, the red and green colours indicate the volume of savings calculated pursuant to the original Energy Efficiency Directive for the purposes of achieving the target pursuant to Art. 7.  Pursuant to the amendment to this Directive, such energy savings will have to be replaced with savings from new individual measures.
