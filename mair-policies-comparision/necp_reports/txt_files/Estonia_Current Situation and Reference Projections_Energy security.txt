Dimension energy security i. Current energy mix, domestic energy resources, import dependency, including relevant risks The structure of Estonian primary energy consumption in 2016 by fuel is characterised by the following figure (see Figure 32).   Motor gasoline %  Other 1%  Natural gas 7%  Diesel fuel 11%  Renewable energy sources 16%  Oil shale 61% Figure 32. Primary energy sources used in Estonia in 2016 [Eurostat nrg_110a] of energy. Thanks to oil shale, renewable energy sources and peat, Estonia is the least dependent country in the EU on imports via energy carriers; these accounted for 6.8% in 2016183. This share will probably decrease in the coming years as generating                                                            183 Eurostat t2020_rd320, electricity from oil shale becomes less competitive. Despite the good overall picture, all liquid motor fuels and natural gas consumed in Estonia is imported. For fuel deliveries, natural gas represents a higher risk, as most of the gas consumed in the entire region is imported from Russia.  However, the situation will improve in the near future owing to the completion of the GIPL gas pipeline connecting Poland and the Baltic States in 2023. Options for liquid fuel imports are more diverse. ii. Projections of development with existing policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) imports) will change significantly over the next decade  the importance of domestic renewable fuels will increase.
