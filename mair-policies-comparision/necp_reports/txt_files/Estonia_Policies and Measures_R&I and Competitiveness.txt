Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.5 Energy-area research and development The NDPESNDPES 2030 RD programme), approved by the Minister for Economic Affairs and Infrastructure in June 2019, envisages activities that contribute towards the successful implementation of NDPES 2030 measures. NDPES RD program activities are aggregated into the following seven areas:  Electricity supply (generation, transmission and distribution of electricity). This area covers activities relating to NDPES ele  Biomass and biofuel in the energy sector and transport. This area covers  activities relating to NDPES ative   Use of oil shale and other domestic non-renewable fuels. This area covers activities relating to NDPES                                                            162 Section 17(41) of the District Heating Act 163 Section 26(31) of the Natural Gas Act and the Oil Shale Development Plan;  Transport and mobility links with the energy sector. This area covers activities relating to NDPES   Energy efficiency of buildings (i.e. buildings scheduled for renovation and new buildings, and distributed generation solutions associated with the buildings). This area covers activities relating to NDPES prospective energy effi  Heat supply (efficient heat generation and transmission, heat storage). This area covers activities relating to NDPES   Energy saving in consumption (street lighting, industry). This area covers activities relating to NDPES  The NDPES RD program also envisages activities cutting across the boundaries of these areas, involving participation in international research and development activities, improvement of the collection and dissemination of information about the areas of the energy programme, improvement of cooperation with local authorities and ensuring that state authorities are informed about the processes of energy policy design and implementation. Among the key entities commissioning energy-related research and development activities in Estonia are large energy sector enterprises.  Economic competitiveness Implementation of this programme as a whole must contribute towards promoting economic competitiveness; no separate measures for increasing economic competitiveness are envisaged. According to the Estonia 2020 competitiveness plan, important factors for ensuring the competitiveness of the economy include the existence of a qualified labour force (including top researchers and specialists); research and ambitions and a business and investment environment conductive to promoting efficiency and productivity; sectoral integration; an international-level living environment and infrastructure; energy security, energy and resource efficiency; a smart grid; a circular economy; keeping the government deficit below 0.5% of GDP; a budget policy that supports competitiveness and a flexible governance structure. The measures for achieving the targets described in the NDPES 2030 document create the economic preconditions for avoiding having to pay the resource- and pollution-related charges associated with the introduction of energy efficiency and renewables, for deriving the benefits obtainable through cooperation and joint projects (including export opportunities), for new business and operating models to arise (renewable energy communities, energy generation and storage by customers, smart infrastructures and cities, etc.), for changes in consumption habits and behaviour to develop which stimulate a reduction in GHG emissions, and for a knowledge-based future to take shape. -up and emerging companies whose activity is directed towards developing and launching new products, services and technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of the investment programme is to attract additional private equity to green technology through State equity capital investment. ii. Where applicable, cooperation with other Member States in this area, including, where appropriate, information on how the SET Plan objectives and policies are being translated to a national context. Estonia participates in a cooperation programme between the Baltic States and Nordic Energy Research which aims to promote research into the energy sector. The founding document of this collaboration programme was approved in October 2018 and under it, joint research is to be financed, grants are to be given to students for degree courses and exchanges of scientists are to be funded. The research programme will focus on the following topics, the funding for which has been agreed until 2021:  reduction of the carbon intensity of the transport sector;  energy saving in buildings and industry;  analyses of the energy system;  challenges and opportunities in regional energy networks. formed to work on the topics of Carbon Capture, Use and Storage (CCUS) and reducing GHG emissions (NGCCUS). The aim of the cooperation platform is to: - enhance information exchange and cooperation to develop CCUS-related policies and with regard to decarbonisation; - discuss policies and strategies related to CCUS; and - monitor developments in decarbonisation and CCUS in the Nordic countries and within the context of cooperation between the Nordic and Baltic countries and the systemic solutions. iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including EU support and the use of EU funds. Energy sector research and development activities will be financed from various different sources during this EU financing period. Applied research to achieve socio--called RITA programme) will be financed under the Operational programme for cohesion policy funds 2014-202092 . Two projects directly related to the energy sector have been granted financing under this programme:   environment-friendly and sustainable options for the use of natural resources;  research into the situation and prospects of the Estonian bioeconomy and its sectors. Development of business models in selected areas of the bioeconomy. Estonia has also applied for funding for energy-related research and development in several dozen energy-related projects funded under the Horizon 2020 programme164. Energy-related priorities under the Horizon 2020 programme are a reduction in energy consumption and carbon footprints through smart and sustainable use; supplying customers with electricity which is affordable and produces low carbon emissions; alternative fuels and mobile energy sources; a single, smart European electricity grid; new knowledge and next generation technology; robust decision-making and public engagement; market uptake of energy innovations; energy security and security of supply; recovery, recycling and waste recycling. Estonian partners have been very successful in sectoral projects  attracted towards development of the sector by means of 42 agreements concluded with the European Commission (the total budget of the projects is way of comparison, the amount attracted by means of 11 agreements under the te was 15%. Innovation projects predominated (accounting for 68.8% of the funded applications). By participating in the Horizon programme, the Estonian partners also contribute towards achieving the national climate and energy targets, as all open topics are directly linked to reducing the environmental impact of the energy sector. Baltic and Nordic scientists can apply for funding for research projects under the Baltic-Nordic countries research cooperation programme, launched in 2018165. This programme is funded by Nordic Energy Research and the Baltic States.                                                            164 For successful projects, see https://edukad.etag.ee 165 For the joint Baltic-Nordic Research Programme, see https://www.nordicenergy.org/programme/the-joint-baltic-nordic-energy-research-programme/
