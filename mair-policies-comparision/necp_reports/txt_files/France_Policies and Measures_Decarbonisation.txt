 82    3. POLICIES AND MEASURES  3.1. Decarbonisation  3.1.1. GHG emissions and removals   3.1.1.1. Policies and measures to achieve the target set under Regulation (EU) 2018/842 as referred in point 2.1.1 and policies and measures to comply with Regulation (EU) 2018/841, covering all key emitting sectors and sectors for the enhancement of removals, with an outlook to the long-term vision and goal to become a low emission economy and achieving a balance between emissions and removals in accordance with the Paris Agreement   The following section describes the policies and measures planned for each CO2-emitting sector, or in other words the options that are currently being examined and that have a realistic chance of being adopted and implemented after the submission date of the integrated national energy and climate plan, in line with the definition provided in the Regulation on the governance of the Energy Union.   It also outlines the sectoral and cross-cutting guidelines laid down in the draft SNBC 2, which was published in December 2018. These guidelines underwent extensive stakeholder consultations, and were reduction targets (see Section 2.1.1). Once the strategy has been adopted, the guidelines will be legally enforceable against the public sector, and they must serve as a basis for the drafting of future public policies.   Transport  The planned policies and measures and the SNBC guidelines in the transport sector are described in Sector 3.1.3.(iii) Policies and measures to achieve low carbon emission mobility.    Residential and tertiary   Planned policies and measures  The majority of planned policies and measures aimed at reducing GHG emissions in the residential and tertiary buildings sector involve improvements to the energy efficiency of buildings (detailed in Section 3.2. Energy efficiency) and the development of renewable energies (detailed in Section 3.1.2 Renewable energies).   The environmental regulations that will apply to new builds and that are expected to come into force in 2020 will be relevant under two dimensions: energy efficiency and decarbonisation. They will introduce an innovative environmental standard for new builds that combines requirements relating not only to energy consumption and the growth of renewable energies, but also to GHG emissions throughout the -Energy and Low-Carbon Buildings (E+C-label, launched in late 2016, as a basis for agreements on the methodologies to be followed under future environmental regulations. This voluntary label will combine requirements relating to both energy and GHG emissions. It will allow developers to choose the solution that best fits the geography of the region, the nature of the buildings and the costs incurred. The pilot scheme approach is intended to test solutions n their environmental impact, the associated construction costs, and the capacity of businesses and their equipment to achieve the intended impact. Through these measures, France hopes to encourage players in the buildings sector to construct positive-energy and low-carbon buildings.   83     Guidelines laid down in the SNBC  The draft SNBC 2 outlines the following strategic guidelines for the residential/tertiary buildings sector:   steer energy mix choices towards zero-carbon energy consumption in existing buildings and new builds;   encourage the renovation of all existing residential and tertiary buildings with a view to -stock;   increasing energy and carbon performance levels in new builds under future environmental regulations;   improving the energy efficiency of appliances and encouraging citizens to be moderate in their use of such appliances.    Industry (non-ETS)   Planned policies and measures  The majority of mitigation measures implemented in the industrial sector (non-ETS) are accounted for by energy efficiency measures (detailed in Section 3.2. Energy efficiency) and measures aimed at developing renewable energies (detailed in Section 3.1.2 Renewable energies).   Guidelines laid down in the SNBC  The draft SNBC 2 outlines the following strategic guidelines for the industrial sector:   helping businesses to transition to low-carbon production systems and tap into new markets;   promoting the early development and roll-out of breakthrough technologies with a view to reducing residual emissions and eliminating them if possible;   providing a framework that encourages energy demand management and resource conservation, by prioritising carbon-free energies and the circular economy.    Waste treatment     Planned policies and measures  The Roadmap for the Circular Economy13 published in 2018 is targeted at better manufacturing (ecodesign, use of recycled materials), better consumption (increase in rates of reuse and repair, lengthening of product lifespans), better waste management (optimised sorting of waste, increase in recycling and recovery) and better mobilisation of all stakeholders.   Its main targets are as follows:    - achieving a 30% reduction in resource consumption in relation to GDP by 2030 compared to 2010;   13 https://www.ecologique-solidaire.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/Feuille-de-route-Economie-circulaire-50mesures-pour-economie-100-circulaire.pdf   84    - achieving a 50% reduction in volumes of non-hazardous waste placed in landfill by 2025 compared to 2010 (target under the LTECV);  - achieving a recycling rate of almost 100% for plastics by 2025;  - reducing greenhouse gas emissions: preventing the emission of an additional 8 million tonnes of CO2 each year through the recycling of plastics.  The Roadmap proposes 50 measures aimed at fostering the circular economy. The measures outlined in the Roadmap will be adopted at legislative level by 2019 in the law transposing the new EU Directive on waste, as well as in falso be implemented by means of regulatory measures, initiatives by local authorities (particularly in the case of measures aimed at significantly increasing the collection of recyclable waste) and voluntary commitments by companies.   The measures under the Roadmap that will have the greatest impact on GHG emissions include the following:  - increasing the use of recycled materials as raw materials for manufacturing, based on voluntary commitments and support for industry players;  - stepping up the fight against food waste;  - broadening the scope of schemes for collecting recyclable packaging, plastic bottles and cans;  - making it easier for citizens to sort their waste;  - introducing economic incentives to recycle waste rather than send it to landfill;  - making it easier for local authorities to sort and recycle biowaste at source;  - increasing the sorting, reuse and recycling rates for construction waste.  The draft Law on the Fight against Waste and the Circular Economy, which was adopted by Parliament in early January 2020, is aimed at addressing the challenges associated with combating different forms of waste and making our economy more circular. It is structured around four major areas:  - stopping waste in its various forms with a view to conserving natural resources;  - providing more information to consumers so that they can make informed decisions;  - encouraging economic players to transform their methods of production and distribution;  improving the collection and sorting of waste with a view to promoting reuse and recycling and preventing fly tipping.     Guidelines laid down in the SNBC  The draft SNBC 2 outlines the following strategic guidelines for the waste treatment sector:   encouraging all stakeholders to reduce waste;   encouraging producers to combat waste generation from the product design stage onwards;   improving waste collection and management by increasing recovery rates and improving the efficiency of treatment operations.    Agriculture     Planned policies and measures   85    The Agri-Environmental Plan for France sets out a holistic vision of the transformation of agricultural practices in France. Its underlying aim is to ensure that French agriculture moves to production systems that are highly efficient in all respects, particularly in economic and environmental terms. It incorporates several separate plans, some of which have recently been revised, are currently being revised or will shortly be revised: these include the Vegetable Protein Plan, the Organic Plan and the Teaching to Produce Alternatives Plan.   The Vegetable Protein Plan is aimed at developing pulse crops, in particular through the integrated management of inputs and the consolidation of markets. It covers the period between 2014 and 2020, with plans to increase the target for the post-2020 period. A further target of achieving protein selfsufficiency by 2030 has bRepublic on 25 January 2018: strategic project aimed at achieving sovereignty in the protein sector over the next five years, broken down at CAP level).  The Organic Plan 2022 was presented in June 2018. Its underlying aim is to ensure that 15% of utilised agricultural land is used for organic crops by 2022. The plan has a pot of around seven major areas, with funding to be awarded mainly via three tools that promote organic farming:  - -point pollution;  -   - by 2020 (enshrined in the 2018 Finance Law).  In addition to conversion aid and the Organic Future Fund, support for individual and group projects will be provided via the agricultural pillar of the Major Investment Plan (see below).  AgriEnvironmental Plan, is currently being revised. Its aim is to promote the provision of agriculture-related training that supports the transition towards new and more sustainable production systems. Teaching resources designed to be used when providing training to future generations of farmers are being revised to ensure that they cover the latest agri-environmental developments, in particular climate-related matters.  Within the framework of the current negotiations on the future CAP and the 20212027 Multiannual Financial Framework, France has also campaigned for a stronger environmental component for the common agricultural policy (CAP), in particular through payments for ecosystem services.  During a speech given in Rungis on 11 October 2017, the President of the Republic asked the interbranch organisations to produce plans for the development and transformation of the agricultural and agri-food sectors. In particular, these sector-specific contracts must include targets relating to growth in organic and high-quality products, environmental targets and targets relating to agricultural research programmes. The plans were forwarded to the Minister for Agriculture and Food by the interbranch organisations in December 2017.   -year period between 2017 and 2022, incorporates an agricultural pillar aimed at accelerating changes to tools and practices in the agriculture, fisheries, agri-food and forestry/wood sectors. The agricultural pillar of the Major Investment Plan diversifies and boosts the range of financing tools available to operators in these sectors wishing to carry out transformation-related measures, including guarantee funds, non-guaranteed loans  86    and equity investments, in addition to grants or repayable advances. It is based on nine measures gathered together under three axes:   our measures: support for investments into agricultural holdings, support for changes in agricultural practices, support for agricultural anaerobic digestion and support for investments into forestry;   contains two measures: support for upgrading of the sectors downstream of agriculture and modernisation of the sectors downstream of forestry;   easures: innovation competition, support for regional innovative projects based on cooperation and for structural investments in these sectors.   The measures are aimed not only at promoting changes to agricultural practices, but also at influencing demand and consumption in agri-food sectors. Between 20 July and 30 November 2017, the Government organised a National Foodstuffs Meeting. Several of the recommendations that emerged from this Meeting, and that were incorporated into Law No 2018-938 of 30 October 2018 on equitable commercial relations in the agricultural and food sector, and a healthy, sustainable and accessible food system, make a direct contribution to GHG mitigation as follows:    support for organic production systems, in particular through the adoption of regulations obliging operators in the food service industry to use a minimum proportion (50%) of locally sourced or quality-certified (including organic) agricultural products from 1 January 2022;   the introduction of mandatory preliminary food waste assessments (including sustainable sourcing) for all operators in the food service industry.       Guidelines laid down in the SNBC  The draft SNBC 2 outlines the following strategic guidelines for the agriculture sector:   reducing direct and indirect emissions of N2O and CH4 by applying the principles of agroecology and high-precision agriculture;   reducing CO2 emissions linked to the consumption of fossil fuels and increasing the use of renewable energies;   boosting the production of carbon-free energy and the bioeconomy with a view to reducing 2 emissions, and increasing the value added by the agricultural sector;   reversing the current trend for carbon stored in agricultural soils to be removed, in keeping with the initiati  influencing demand and consumption in the agri-food sectors via the National Food and Nutrition Programme (PNAN);   improving inventory and evaluation methodologies.   Cross-sector measures     Planned policies and measures  Carbon pricing  In 2014, changes were made to the energy consumption tax with the result that a share of this tax is now calculated in proportion to CO2 emissions from energy products. The rate was 2 in 2 in 2022. The planned increases were delayed from 2019  87    transition and its consequences for French citizens.  In addition, the trajectory for the shadow price of carbon has been updated by the Commissariat-General for Strategy and Foresight (report published in February 2019). The shadow price of carbon is the cost of all the efforts required to avoid the emission of one tonne-equivalent of CO2. It is used to assess the socioeconomic impact of public investment projects in order to steer choices towards pro- decarbonisation projects. It is also intended to be used as a basis for developing and assessing the various measures that promote carbon-free choices and private investments (explicit carbon pricing, investment subsidies, regulations, etc.), without setting a level or a rate on a case-by-case basis. The shadow price of carbon serves as a point of reference for comparing the cost of different public policies per tonne of greenhouse gas avoided, which is one of the factors to be taken into consideration when designing measures.    Plans to tax HFCs and ratification of the Kigali Amendment  The Climate Plan published by the Government in July 2017 provides for an expansion of the carbon pricing mechanisms to include other greenhouse gases and, as a first step, the introduction of tax incentives for avoiding HFCs.  The details of the tax were outlined in the 2019 Finance Law, which provides for the introduction of a tax on HFCs from 2021 based on progressive rate increases as follows: -equivalent of CO2 onwards. The entry into force of the tax has been set for 1 January 2021, so that assessments can be carried out prior to this date to determine whether industry professionals have delivered on their commitments to reduce consumption of these gases. The outcomes will determine whether these gases higher taxes should be levied on polluting operations than on work or economic activities.  On 29 March 2018, France also ratified the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. Although the -Gas II Regulation, its reporting period is longer (through to 2036, while the F-Gas II Regulation only covers the period until 2030).       Introduction of a low-carbon label for the certification of emissions-reducing projects  Through the introduction of a framework for monitoring, notifying and verifying GHG emissions, the low-carbon label is aimed at promoting the emergence of additional GHG emission-reducing projects within France and placing a value on any additional reductions achieved voluntarily by natural or legal -to projects that prevent GHG emissions in the first place and GHG sequestration projects. The label has been introduced in response to calls for a GHG emissions offsetting scheme that is both local and voluntary. Voluntary partners (from the public or private sector) will make payments to project organisers and then seek recognition for their contributions to the additional emissions reductions achieved through the relevant projects. Checks are carried out before the emissions reductions are recognised. Once they have been recognised, the emissions reductions cannot be transferred or exchanged either in private arrangements or on any voluntary or mandatory market. Emissions reductions can only be used for the voluntary offsetting of emissions by non-state players (companies, local authorities, individuals, etc.).     The regulations governing implementation of the scheme were published in November 2018. The first details of methods that must be followed in order for projects to be granted the label have already been validated.      Cross-sector guidelines of the SNBC   88    The draft SNBC 2 lays down cross-sector guidelines on carbon footprints; economic policy; research and innovation policy; and urban design, land-use planning and regional dynamics.   Carbon footprint:   improving control of the carbon content of imported products;  encouraging all economic players to reduce their carbon footprints;  encouraging citizens to reduce their carbon footprints. Economic policy:   sending the right signals to investors, particularly in respect of carbon prices, and giving them a clear, long-term view of climate policies;   ensuring a fair transition for everyone;   supporting EU and international action on funding and carbon prices in line with the Paris Agreement;   promoting investment into projects that foster the low-carbon transition, by developing funding tools that limit the risks incurred by investors and by adopting stringent criteria for identifying appropriate projects;   analysing in more depth the climate impacts of measures implemented with public funding or under public policies, and using this information as a decision-making criterion; ensuring that measures that would run counter to efforts to meet our climate targets do not benefit from public funding.  Research and innovation policy:   developing low-carbon innovations and facilitating their timely diffusion, based on basic and applied research.    Urban design, land-use planning and regional dynamics:   placing limits on anthropogenic soil development and reducing carbon emissions in connection with urban design.    3.1.1.2. Policies and measures to comply with Regulation (EU) 2018/841  The first SNBC, which was adopted in 2015, lays down strict guidelines aimed at developing a more sustainable approach to land management with a view to limiting anthropogenic development of land (in particular agricultural land), storing and maintaining carbon in soils and biomass and increasing the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere by the forestry and timber sector.  These guidelines involve firstly action under the Agri-Environmental Plan for France, and secondly the revitalisation of forestry management. In particular, four mutually reinforcing tools have been identified in the forestry and timber sector:  - use of bio-based products as substitutes for energy-intensive materials;  - recovery of energy from bio-based products or from the waste generated from these products as a substitute for fossil fuels; - storage of carbon in wood and waste wood products; - carbon sequestration in the forestry ecosystem.    Planned policies and measures   The National Bioeconomy Strategy (adopted in 2017) and the associated Action Plan for 20182020 combine within a single framework all the public policies relating to biomass, with a view  89    to positioning renewable carbon and biological resources at the centre of the economy by substituting bio-based products for fossil and mined products.   The National Forestry and Timber Plan, which provides a framework for forestry policy over the period 20162026, is aimed in particular at expanding the role played by forests in the fight against climate change, and sets a target of mobilising an additional 12 million m3 of marketed wood. Regional Forestry and Timber Programmes are currently being developed on the basis of the National Forestry and Timber Programme.   The National Biomass Mobilisation Strategy, which was adopted in 2018, estimates the potential of different types of biomass and lays down broad guidelines for mobilising them as effectively as possible, in particular with a view to achieving the targets under the MEP as regards heating and biomass electricity production capacity in line with the target set under the National Forestry and Timber Programme for forestry biomass.   The National Climate Change Adaptation Plan, which was adopted in December 2018, provides them more resilient to the heightened risk of forest fires, which would have a negative impact on stores of carbon in forests.   The Strategic Wood Sector Contract (20182022), signed by industry professionals and the The Strategic Wood Sector Contract represents a building block in the implementation of a circular economy; its objectives include sustainable production, reduced raw material waste and higher rates of wood waste recycling and recovery (Challenge 3). It also provides for the increased use of wood for construction, resulting in long-term carbon storage (Challenge 4).   The Interdepartmental Plan for Stimulating the Forestry and Wood Sector, launched in November 2018, is structured around three axes: sustainably renewing and mobilising forests as a resource, developing end markets, supporting innovation and investment, improving the   The Biodiversity Plan, published in 2018, which aims to reduce net biodiversity loss to zero, and which in particular proposes a set of measures that limit use of natural areas, agricultural land and forests with a view to achieving a target of net zero anthropogenic development.   The City Centre Action Planover five years for revitalising city centres. Priority objectives under this plan include limiting urban sprawl and reducing anthropogenic soil development.    Strategy implementation in the forestry and wood sector  A more dynamic approach to forest management requires a case-by-case assessment of existing stands with a view to identifying local potential and circumstances. It also requires research, development and innovation. It takes into account all the relevant economic, social and environmental challenges, including carbon storage in soil compartments, above-ground and below-ground biomass, litter, dead wood and harvested wood products, the maintenance of other ecosystem services, the preservation of creation of economic value and jobs.  An approach of this kind can be implemented in a number of different ways: Introducing species that are better adapted to climate change and/or those originating from more appropriate geographical regions, diversifying species and management practices within forests, reduction in forest rotation times in high-risk situations, thinning of high forests in the interests of producing high-quality timber, natural regeneration, maintaining small patches of old trees to preserve the biodiversity associated with senescence in trees, improving coppiced forests or coppices with standards by fencing off and selecting natural seedlings, restoring through planting forests that are in decline, dying or at an impasse, and improving afforestation processes that occur spontaneously on fallow agricultural land. These forestryrelated  90    measures fall under the heading of Improved Forestry Management (IFM) strategies that contribute to the strengthening and resilience of forest-based carbon sinks and stores in the long term.  Wood production and yield will increase as a result of measures aimed firstly at encouraging increasingly dynamic and sustainable forest management by forest owners, secondly at discouraging the consumption of fossil or mineral materials with a large environmental footprint, and thirdly at promoting the use of bio-based products throughout the entire economy. This quantitative increase in production and yield will be accompanied by a qualitative improvement in use, with a shift towards products with a long service life and high substitution potential, a reduction in material and energy losses at all stages of processing, and improvements to the collection and recycling of end-of-life wood products.  The entire forestry and wood industry, including upstream and downstream sectors, will be encouraged to follow this approach. By means of public policies and career development strategies, the silviculture and wood production sector will gradually but consistently be shifted towards markets with a high added value and high environmental value. Sectors and uses to be promoted include:  - uses of materials: under-valued links of the production chain, in particular deciduous woods, construction and bio-based chemistry.  - energy uses: in the long term, a small number of large carbon use and capture (CUC) or carbon storage and capture (CSC) facilities; in particular, however, small or medium-sized facilities distributed across the regions (heat production, cogeneration, advanced biofuels, gasification) using small-diameter wood, poor-quality wood and certain silviculture residues, by-products of first- and second-stage wood processing activities and recycled wood waste.  Afforestation is not necessarily incompatible with agricultural production. The priority must be to support and enrich afforestation processes that occur or will occur spontaneously on fallow farmlands. Research will also be carried out into the afforestation potential of certain types of land upon which spontaneous afforestation processes will not take place, such as degraded land, and the renaturalisation of anthropogenically developed land such as derelict land, industrial wasteland or artificially grassed areas.     Guidelines laid down in the SNBC  The draft SNBC 2 outlines strategic guidelines for the land sector:  - for the forestry and wood sector:   implementing upstream measures to guarantee the timely preservation and strengthening of carbon sinks and stores in the forestry and wood sector, and their resilience to climate stresses;   maximising the effects of carbon substitution and storage in wood products by leveraging supply and demand;   monitoring the implementation of policies adopted on this basis and adjusting them regularly in response to any findings, in order to guarantee the achievement of targets and the expected attendant benefits.  - for the agricultural sector:   reversing the current trend for carbon stored in agricultural soils to be removed, in keeping with  - for the land-use change sector:   placing limits on anthropogenic soil development and reducing carbon emissions caused by urbanisation.   91      Long-term vision and goal of moving to a low-emissions economy and achieving a balance between emissions and removals in line with the Paris Agreement  The Climate Plan presented in -term objective of achieving carbon neutrality within the country by 2050. Carbon neutrality is an ambitious target. According to recent research carried out by the IPCC, however, achieving this target as soon as possible and at global level is essential to contain global warming at 1.5 °C.   based on a reference scenario that outlines future public policy directions (presented in the sections above) in addition to the measures already in place today, thereby allowing France to meet its climate and energy targets in the short, medium and long term.  The reference scenario is designed to be both ambitious as regards its targets and feasible as regards the means by which these targets are achieved, without gambling on significant technological breakthroughs. At the same time, however, a number of new technologies are included on the basis of reasonable assumptions (carbon capture, storage and use (CCSU), power-to-gas, energy storage, etc.).  It appears that a proportion of CO2 emissions will still be unavoidable in 2050, particularly in nonenergy sectors (agriculture and industrial processes). Achieving carbon neutrality therefore involves using carbon sinks to compensate for these emissions. It is estimated that the sinks provided by an optimised and sustainable land sector (forests and agricultural land) plus carbon capture and storage will only compensate for residual non-energy emissions and the residual emissions from fossil fuels that are still used for certain means of transport (aviation).  Figure 16: GHG emissions and sinks in France in 2050, based on the reference scenario      92         The following steps must be taken to achieve carbon neutrality:                                 93    total decarbonisation14 of energy production by 2050, with exclusive use of the following energy sources: biomass resources (waste from agriculture and wood products, wood energy, etc.), heat from the environment (geothermal, heat pumps, etc.) and carbon-free electricity;   sharp reduction in energy consumption across all sectors, based on a significant increase in energy efficiency and a moderation of demand (the scenario is based on a slight drop in public demand across all sectors compared to the trend-based scenario coupled with major changes in consumption patterns, without any compromises in terms of convenience);   minimisation of emissions that are not linked to energy consumption (for example emissions from agriculture or industrial processes);   increase in carbon sinks (natural and technological) to absorb unavoidable residual emissions by 2050 while promoting biomass production. Problems may arise in connection with biomass resources, since the structure of the system is predominantly geared towards liquid and gaseous fuels at present.    3.1.1.3. Regional cooperation in this area, where applicable  France is not currently involved in regional cooperation in this area.    3.1.1.4. Without prejudice to the applicability of State aid rules, financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds, in this area and at national level, where applicable  A variety of different types of financing measures are implemented in this area, some of which are crosscutting in nature. No provision has been made for specific financing measures in this area.    3.1.2. Renewable energies  Measures to promote renewable energies are determined to achieve the objectives set by law. Since these targets are expressed as percentages of renewable energies in relation to energy consumption, the target quantities of renewable energy depend on the amounts consumed. In turn, the amounts consumed depend on the macroeconomic context. The targets for 2028 are therefore expressed as a range (Scenario A and Scenario B) to ensure that the targets set by law can be achieved. Depending on the macroeconomic context, it may be necessary for the Government to step up its policy initiatives to maintain the same percentage use of renewable energies.  3.1.2.1. Renewable and recovered heating and cooling  Measures applicable across all sectors will be adopted to boost the generation of renewable heat. For some sectors, these measures will be sufficient to support the penetration of renewable heat, while for others they will need to be supplemented with specific measures, which will be described in the corresponding paragraph.   14 -gases will remain, and secondly because fossil fuels will still be used in part for air transport.    94      The following table shows the final consumption target for renewable heat that can be achieved through the implementation of the measures.  Cross-sector measures for the development of renewable heat:  Technical measures:   Ensure that the future environmental regulation on new buildings (ER 2020) imposes a minimum level of renewable heat in all new buildings (individual, collective and tertiary) as soon as it is implemented.   Generate feedback from the calculation engine in RT2012 (the French thermal buildings regulation, amended in 2012) and on the E+C- trial to enable better use of thermal renewable energies, especially solar thermal energy, in the future environmental regulation ER 2020.   Facilitate recourse to the ranking of high-performing district heating and cooling systems (the ranking of a district heating and cooling system is a procedure that makes it possible to determine the areas within which any new installation must be connected to the system).  Financial measures:    s a change to carbon taxation before that year.    Simplify the rules of the Heat Fund: the obligation to make repayable advances for Heat Fund projects was eliminated in 2019 and replaced by subsidies, and the rules governing grants within ADEME were reconciled with the EU guidelines in 2019 by aligning them with the maximum levels of support for heat networks, which are more favourable for non-economic activities; develop local, financial contracts for the development of renewable energies, which make it possible to subsidise clusters of small projects.   effective by setting a flat-rate amount, differentiated according to technologies and giving specific consideration to the renewable heat generation enabled by each equipment type.   Keep VAT at 5.5% for renewable heat equipment eligible for the CITE, and related works (for example: smoke extraction chimney, granulate silo).   Provide better coordination of White Certificates (WC) and Heat Fund grants according to conditions that comply with the EU guidelines.   Since mid-2019, zero-rate eco-loans have applied for works eligible for the CITE without any conditions based on series of works projects.    Make the eligibility criteria for reduced VAT of 5.5% more ambitious, with an increase in the 50% threshold for renewable or recovered energy within a sustainable timetable (60% in 2030).    Information/communication/awareness-raising measures:   Undertake a collective campaign for local authorities with more than 10,000 inhabitants to initiate projects for construction of a district heating and/or cooling system.   and cooling networks and the Via Seva website for the general public.   Make it possible for private individuals to obtain information through their energy bills about their heating and cooling consumption twice a year from October 2020 in accordance with the  95    provisions of the European package in order to comply with the standards relating to metering and the provision of information for customers.  Make available the list of Government buildings and associated heating methods.    Solid biomass  Measures to supplement cross-sector measures:   Promote heat recovery from biomass before high-yield cogeneration. Heat will clearly be a priority for energy recovery from biomass.   Ensure the rapid replacement of inefficient independent wood-burning appliances (fireplaces, stoves, heating inserts) with more efficient equipment in terms of yield and air quality (Green Flame-labelled, pellets, etc.).   Organise a campaign to raise awareness about the correct use of domestic wood.   Develop local analyses of biomass on a regional basis (as part of the drafting of regional biomass plans) in order to mobilise available but underexploited biomass resources, with the updating of inventory data (work in progress by the IGN).   Continue support for boilers in collective and industrial heating systems through the Heat Fund.  Heat pumps  Measures to supplement cross-sector measures:   geothermal heat pumps, with the same size contribution required from the recipient for each of these two solutions.   Support heat pump-assisted geothermal heating and geothermal renewable cooling projects through the Heat Fund.    Deep geothermal energy  Measures to supplement cross-sector measures:   Implement a local coordination structure, with at least one geothermal specialist coordinator per region, with the support of ADEME.   Support investment in geothermal energy, geothermal district heating and cooling systems, and heat storage solutions using geothermal energy, through the Heat Fund.   Maintain the Auxiliary Finance Company (SAF) guarantee fund and adapt it where necessary to develop the potential of new little known aquifers on the basis of the conclusions of the dimensioning study being conducted by ADEME.    Enable participation by the Heat Fund in funding regional mapping for Geothermal installations of Minimal Importance (GMI), and where necessary in funding support for decision-making on the economic profitability of surface geothermal resources.   Modify the Mining Code to explicitly mention the generation of cooling through geothermal energy.

Recovered heat  Measures to supplement cross-sector measures:   Make it mandatory to recover the energy from biogas captured in waste storage facilities, where relevant.   Organise an action to stimulate domestic waste incineration plants (DWIP) and energy recovery units (ERU) to recover more residual heat. this action will be planned in conjunction with the publication of the BREF - Best available techniques REFerence documents for this sector (the BREF documents provide a description by sector of the best available techniques and the performance levels associated with these techniques: an inspection of classified installations can be required to examine the energy efficiency ratio of each energy recovery unit to ensure that it achieves the best possible ratio within the admissible range).   Provide feedback on the cost/benefit analysis of heat recovery introduced in 2015 and develop this scheme if necessary.   Develop a coordination network for industrial residual heat, for example by providing operator , or by providing information to and supporting highly industrial areas (e.g. port zones, chemical platforms).   Evaluate the potential to recover heat from waste water using a regional plan for spatial planning, sustainable development and territorial equality (SRADDET) and the updating of the ADEME study on residual heat.     97    3.1.2.2.

This action will be planned in conjunction with the publication of the BREF for this sector (the BREF documents provide a description by sector of the best available techniques and the performance levels associated with these techniques: an inspection of classified installations can be required to examine the energy efficiency ratio of each energy recovery unit to ensure that it achieves the best possible ratio within the admissible range), and may be based on an inventory prepared by the SN2E union and the National Union of Treatment and Recovery of Urban and Similar Waste (SVDU) and on expert information provided by ADEME.   Maintain the grants paid by the Waste Fund to improve the energy efficiency of DWIP and by the Heat Fund for the connection to recovered district heating systems.      3.1.2.3. Biofuels   Support measures for biofuels:   Continue national support for the development of biofuels through an incentive to incorporate biofuels for operators that release fuels for consumption.   Above the existing ceiling for conventional biofuels, limit the incorporation of biofuels produced from raw materials with a high risk of causing indirect land-use change (e.g. certain palm or soybean oils), as stipulated in the new EU Directive on renewable energies (RED II).   Reinforce the sustainability and traceability criteria for raw materials.    3.1.2.4. Renewable and recovered gas  Support measures for biogas:   Provide visibility by adopting a tender timetable for injected biomethane: two tenders, for an annual generation target of 350 GWh HHV/year each, will be launched each year.    Consolidate the obligation to purchase biogas at a regulated tariff and launch tenders that make it possible to achieve the generation targets at a reasonable cost thanks to substantial cost reductions.  - The tenders will be based on a reference feed-in tariff, used to dimension the total budget, reduced to ensure that the target public expenditure level is not exceeded. A maximum 2028 will also be introduced.  - The volume of the tender will be increased if the average tariff requested in the bids is lower than the reference feed-in tariff. The feed-in tariff proposed on an open-window basis for small-sized facilities will be adjusted downwards if biogas generation capacity is contracted in excess of the target value of 800 GWh HHV per year for all recovery sectors.    Put in place an appropriate support mechanism for biomethane not injected into natural gas networks (in particular biomethane used directly for bioNGV vehicles).    98     Promote NGV and bioNGV, in particular thanks to the additional depreciation on the purchase of compatible vehicles.    Accelerate the roll-out of NGV: support the generation of biomethane for methanisers supplying vehicles (buses, lorries) to develop direct local use, in particular those further away from the gas network.    99    Facilitate the supply and connection of NGV stations to the natural gas networks.    The following timetable shows the quarters when a tender will be launched up to 350 GWh/year.      Gasification of organic matter  Gasification corresponds to a thermochemical decomposition of organic matter into a synthesis gas (syngas) composed primarily of methane, hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. This synthesis gas is then recovered in various ways. Gasification for heat generation constitutes one of the technologies in the wood energy sector. Synthesis gas can also be converted using a methanation process and then purified for injection into the natural gas networks.  Unlike anaerobic digestion, gasification can use wood fibre material. This use of wood fibre material could bring gasification for injection into the gas networks into competition with the wood energy sector, where development requires more limited public support. Given this more limited need for public support, priority will be given to the development of the wood energy sector, which includes gasification for heat generation, rather than to support for gasification for injection.  Feedback is planned on the demonstrators for gasification for injection into the gas networks in order to analyse the role that could potentially be played by this sector. In particular, this will involve an analysis of the energy efficiency level of this biomass recovery method, and of the environmental issues affecting the installations.  The possibility of developing gasification for injection without creating competition with the wood energy sector will be studied. Where applicable, the tenders relating to the biomethane purchase 2019  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024  Q 1  Q2  Q 3  Q4  Q 1  Q2  Q 3  Q4  Q 1  Q2  Q 3  Q4  Q 1  Q2  Q 3  Q4  Q 1  Q2  Q 3  Q4  Q 1  Q2  Q 3  Q4                            100    obligation described above may be extended to cover, under the same conditions, projects involving gasification for injection into the natural gas networks.  Measures:   Generate feedback on the demonstrators for gasification for injection into the gas networks.   Study the possibility of developing gasification for injection without creating competition with the wood energy sector and, where applicable, authorise projects involving gasification for injection into the natural gas networks to take part in tenders relating to the biomethane purchase obligation.    Hydrogen and power-to-gas  Measures:  million per year and launch calls for projects on hydrogen mobility and generation using electrolysers.   Put in place a traceability system for decarbonised hydrogen in 2020.   Extend the measure providing additional depreciation for the purchase of hydrogen vehicles at least under the same conditions as for NGV (heavy goods vehicles > 3.5 t).   Mobilise financial institutions (public and private finance, including CDC, BPI) and standardise the cofinancing models for ecosystem deployment projects that pool different usages locally (mobility, industry, etc.) in the regions.   Organise in-depth reflection among all stakeholders concerned with simplifying and harmonising procedures for the authorisation and accreditation of vessels and associated hydrogen refuelling solutions.   Continue to provide support for innovation, in particular to support the industrial development and scaling-up of French industry players.     Recovered gas, pyrogasification  Measures:   Generate feedback on the demonstrators for gasification for injection into the gas networks and for heat generation.    3.1.2.6. Electricity  Cross-sector measures to increase capacity to generate renewable electricity  Provide visibility for tender schedules.   Continue the administrative simplification measures introduced to decrease development periods and reduce costs.   Support the development of crowdfunding investment in projects by citizens and local authorities.   Prepare large-scale recycling of end-of-life installations.    101      Hydroelectricity  Measures to supplement cross-sector measures   Optimise the generation and flexibility of the hydroelectricity system, in particular through over-equipping and installation of hydroelectric power plants on existing, non-equipped dams.   Put in place a mechanism to support the refurbishment of authorised plants between 1 MW and 45 MW.   Launch the granting of new concessions on certain sites where potential has been identified.   Launch tenders for small hydroelectricity according to the following table.       2019  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4                                      The objectives and issues associated with pumped-energy transfer stations (STEP) are discussed in the section on storage.  Onshore wind farms  Measures to supplement cross-sector measures   Prioritise the use of tenders to support the sector by reducing the scope of the open-window system to small-size equipment stocks developed in restricted areas and citizen stocks.   Maintain a stable regulatory framework for the authorisation of equipment stocks, simplify this framework if possible and enable reasonable development periods for project drivers, while ensuring that the environmental stakes are appropriately considered and the impacts on the environment and neighbouring populations are managed.   Make it mandatory by 2023 to recycle materials used in producing wind farm components once they are decommissioned.    Promote the reuse of wind farm sites at end-of-life for the installation of more efficient machines.   Launch the trialling of innovative solutions to reduce light pollution while protecting the safety of aircraft, and make it possible to plan for new systems that could be approved in early 2021.   Draft a protocol to measure the level of noise generated by wind farms precisely and indisputably.    102     Ensure the general application of the principle of total excavation of the turbine foundations during decommissioning and increase the amount of financial guarantees to take account of new technologies.   Introduce a mechanism to ensure that the development of wind power is more balanced nationally and avoid the risks of saturation. Proposals will be made in 2020.  Tenders will be launched up to 1,850 GW/year (excluding repowering) according to the following schedule, up to 500 MW to 925 MW per period.      2019  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4                             103    Photovoltaic power  Measures to supplement cross-sector measures:   Promote ground installations on urbanised or degraded land, or parking areas, to enable the emergence of less costly projects while continuing to apply the strict requirements in relation to agricultural land and the absence of deforestation.   Preserve the reclamation of degraded land, which makes it possible to limit the usage of natural areas.   Implement the measures adopted on 28 June 2018 following the outcomes of the solar working group, including the following in particular:   CF, ports, etc.) and owners of developed sites (large-scale distributors, logistics, etc.).  planning measures for parking shelters).    Support local authorities   Enable a better integration of solar power into the French landscape.   Adopt the following tender schedule corresponding to 2 GW per year for photovoltaic plants on the ground and 0.9 GW per year for installations on large roof areas.   Maintain a target of 300 MW installed per year for installations on small and medium-sized roofs (smaller than 100 kWp), guiding projects towards self-consumption; boost the development of projects over the 100300 kWp tranche by making them eligible for the openwindow system; and accelerate the development of projects on large roof areas (> 300 kWp).   Support innovation in the sector through tenders, to encourage the emergence of innovative solutions, in particular agrivoltaic projects that generate real synergies between agricultural production and photovoltaic energy, maintaining current tender volumes (140 MW/year).   The following schedule shows the quarters when a tender will be launched for ground plants up to 1,000 MW per period.    2019   2020  2021  2022  2023  2024  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4                            The following schedule shows the quarters when a tender will be launched for large roof installations up to 300 MW per period.     104    2019  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q 4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q 4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q 4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q 4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q 4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q 4                                 Generation of electricity from bioenergy  Measures to supplement cross-sector measures   Given the cost of generating electricity from biomass, to optimise the total cost of achieving the targets for renewable energies and to promote the greatest possible energy efficiency, support to these sectors will be reserved for heat generation. No biomass cogeneration tenders will be launched over the Multiannual Energy Plan (MEP) period.   Open a tariff window for anaerobic digestion installations between 0.5 MW and 1 MW for which injection into the network is not possible or is too costly. Above that value, anaerobic digestion installations must focus on injecting biomethane into the network.   Intensify improvements in the energy efficiency of energy recovery units for domestic waste, undertake a specific action on a dozen or so incinerators without energy recovery and go beyond the energy efficiency criterion applied to the existing units.   Extend the call for projects on recovered solid fuels for ADEME.

The projects awarded from 2024 onwards will relate in particular to extensions to previous offshore wind farms, with a pooled connection.   In terms of tidal turbines, no financial support is planned within the period covered by the MEP, but the Government will nonetheless be watching progress in the sector.   Geothermal electricity  Given the cost of generating electricity from geothermal energy, to optimise the total cost of achieving the targets for development of renewable energies, support to the geothermal sector will be focused on heat generation. Electricity generation projects for which an eligible request for additional remuneration has been made will be supported. Innovative projects, especially those coupled with the production of lithium, will be supported where applicable as part of R&D mechanisms.     3.1.2.7. Cost for supporting renewable energies  Support for renewable heat generation  The costs for supporting the Heat Fund and the CITE already take into account the changes announced in relation to the carbon component. This has already been taken into account in estimating the budgetary requirements.    Heat Fund  The Heat Fund has been 2017 period in legal commitments. As highlighted by the Court of Auditors, this is an efficient mechanism with an average 2 avoided, and a significant leverage effect  In 2017, Heat Fund grants corresponded to budgetary support of:           projects concerning a single owner or a single area);    On the basis of the targets set in Scenario B of the 2028 MEP, the budget for the Heat Fund was reviewed of the Heat Fund may be reviewed from 2021 to offset the freezing of the carbon tax (Contribution for the period after 2020, the cumulated requirement for the 2018-   Energy transition tax credit (CITE)      106    Reduced VAT rate for heating networks  The following table shows the cost for the public purse of the reduced VAT rate for district heating and cooling systems where the 50% renewable energy threshold is reached. This estimation takes into account the targets set for the networks at the deadlines set in the MEP:    2016 base year  2017-2023  2023-2028 low option  2023-2028 high option  55  65  70  75   Support for renewable electricity generation  The Government pays the differential between the sales price for electricity and the cost borne by the various sectors. The budgetary cost must therefore be assessed on the basis of the forecast costs for the various sectors and the projected changes in the sale price for electricity generated by renewable energies. For each sector, the prospects for cost changes expected are presented and followed by an assessment of the budget amount for support. That amount can be broken down into costs incurred for prior government commitments and new costs for supporting new capacity.  The public support costs have been calculated on the basis of the targets stated in Scenario A of the MEP. This is the budget that will be allocated by the Government to the development of renewable energies in order to achieve these targets. In the case of a higher reduction in costs, the budget allocated will make it possible to achieve the targets stated in Scenario B of the MEP.  The costs already incurred correspond to tenders awarded, contracts signed before 31 December 2018 and projects with the right to a purchase obligation that have submitted a request to an obligated purchaser. This does not therefore relate to the systems and equipment installed as at 31 December 2018, but to a broader series of installations: indeed, depending on the technologies, installations begin to generate between two and four years after the contract is signed.  Two electricity price scenarios have been analysed to estimate the costs for public support for the 2028 for the average market price, and are stable after 2030. The average sale prices for electricity generated by renewable electricity generation facilities are the following, for the principal pathways:    2023  2028  Market price    Sale price for wind power    Sale price for photovoltaic power    Sale price for offshore wind power    Assumptions for average sale prices for electricity generated by the principal renewable energy   107        2023  2028  Market price    Sale price for wind power    Sale price for photovoltaic power    Sale price for offshore wind power    Assumptions for average sale prices for electricity generated by the principal renewable energy  The average sale prices for electricity generated by renewable electricity generating installations for the above-mentioned pathways are lower than the average prices for electricity on the markets, because of the correlation of electricity generation for installations within a given pathway. For example, solar electricity generation occurs at the same time of day for all installations, and the increase in installed capacity by 2028 will result in a drop in the market price for electricity over those hours, reducing the average price received by the installations. A haircut has therefore been applied in relation to the average market price, to calculate the public support for generation installations. These evaluations therefore result in the following price trajectories in the two scenarios above:    Figure 17: Assumptions for average sale prices for electricity generated by the principal renewable energy       Assumptions for changes in wholesale   Prix marché  Market price   108    Prix de vente solaire  Solar sale price  Prix de vente éolien terrestre  Onshore wind sale price  Prix de vente éolien en mer  Offshore wind sale price           Figure 18: Assumptions for average sale prices for electricity generated by the principal renewable energy       Assumptions for changes in wholesale   Prix marché  Market price  Prix de vente solaire  Solar sale price  Prix de vente éolien terrestre  Onshore wind sale price  Prix de vente éolien en mer  Offshore wind sale price    The estimations made have been approved by the Management Committee for Public Electricity Service Charges, which decided to add some variants, in particular based on the feed-in tariffs to be obtained in the tenders.

It is assumed that these installations will continue to generate for some years (at least five) without support.

The assumption applied in the modelling corresponds to the assumption used in the tender schedule provided in the section on renewable electricity. In particular, 60% of capacity will be developed on the ground.

A higher decrease would make it possible to reach 10%. If generation costs do not fall as much as expected, the rate of construction of new generating capacity will be adapted.          2023  2028   Generation cost for new installations     Cost already committed   Additional cost linked to the targets set in this MEP    Total      3.1.3. Other elements of the dimension  3.1.3.1. Where applicable, national policies and measures affecting the EU ETS sector and assessment of the complementarity and impacts on the EU ETS   The national policies and measures affecting the EU ETS sector are the following:  - measures to support renewable energies (in particular: tenders from the Energy Regulatory Commission, Heat Fund);  - measures promoting energy efficiency (in particular: energy transition tax credit, white certificates).  These measures contribute to reducing electricity consumption by private individuals (especially during winter, when the most carbon-intensive production methods are used) and by industry, and to reducing emissions in the sectors subject to the ETS. They may be complementary to the ETS to the extent that the sale of allowances saved because of a reduction in emissions is not always enough to ensure that low-carbon investments are profitable. It is for this reason, for example, that the white certificates mechanism was extended to cover installations subject to the ETS in 2019.   However, the measures could accentuate the allowances surplus in the EU ETS. The introduction of the market stability reserve in 2019 will make it possible to limit this effect.   112        3.1.4. Policies and measures to achieve other national targets, where applicable  of the Energy Union.  3.1.4.1. Consistency between attenuation and adaptation  In areas where adaptation and attenuation are strongly interlinked (such as forestry, energy consumption and generation), the possible co-benefits and compromises must be identified. This process is scheduled to be completed in 2019-2021, with the aim of providing information for the review of the next National Low-Carbon Strategy (SNBC) and the National Adaptation Strategy.   3.1.4.2. Regional coordination of the adaptation policy in Metropolitan France and in overseas territories  The planning tools such as the convergence plans, Government-Region planning contracts, the blue book for overseas territories and the regional forest and wood programmes, but also the local planning documents specific to each overseas territory, will include actions to promote adaptation to climate change. Through the mobilisation of appropriate financial tools, the aim of these actions will be to strengthen the development and maintenance of infrastructures, the search for and improvement in knowledge regionally and across borders, and the preservation of natural environments and resources and the ecosystems they contain.  3.1.4.3. Forest and brush fires  The Government and public institutions such as the National Forests Office will ensure, by mobilising all stakeholders involved in forest management and in particular the competent local authorities, that forest management is adapted gradually in line with the foreseeable increase in fire risks in terms of the frequency of occurrences and the surface areas concerned in Metropolitan France and in overseas territories.   Consistency will be guaranteed between the potential for attenuation and adaptation of forest management and conservation policies and policies for the recovery and recycling of wood and biomass. The aim is to contribute to reducing the risk of fires and to increasing resilience to that risk, as fires have a very negative effect on the carbon footprint of forests and the resilience of ecosystems.   3.1.4.4. Soils   Soils contribute to atmospheric carbon sequestration. As part of the Biodiversity Plan, the Ministry for Ecological and Inclusive Transition (MTES) will limit anthropogenic development and soil sealing, seeking ultimately to stop these phenomena, using the various tools that can be mobilised nationally as part of land-use planning (e.g. regional consistency plans, local intermunicipal development plan) or a project (e.g. modification of practices, reuse of wastelands after recovery), and will study the possibilities for returning to nature, or indeed recultivating, developed lands (e.g. pollution clean-up, recovery of industrial wastelands).  3.1.4.5. Forest  The MTES and the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAA) will promote sustainable forestry management, taking into account changes in local climate parameters, impacts already recorded and studies of vulnerability and giving forests the greatest possible chance to cope with those factors and to continue to stand in the long term. The entire diversified range of silviculture techniques and tree species  113    in the forests, such as free development or active management, will be used in the light of the expertise and forecasts, to guarantee genetic diversity in the long term and thus preserve future options.  3.1.4.6. Laws, codes, standards and technical regulations  The technical references will be reviewed by the competent departments and adapted as necessary, giving priority to the sectors of infrastructures and transmission system equipment (reliability and climate comfort), energy infrastructures and construction. Once new references are established, such as the cross-sector standard relating to adaptation currently being drafted internationally, they will be incorporated into the existing labels and considered in the technical or legal standards and regulations, applying the approach based on simplification and predictability initiated by the Government in order to establish a context favourable to adaptation.  The framework will be adapted gradually to climate change to promote resilience to natural and health risks within an urban planning context that incorporates such change, in particular by using existing labels or indeed regulatory methods.    3.1.5. Policies and measures to achieve low carbon emission mobility (including electrification of transport)  3.1.5.1. Policies and measures planned  The Clean Mobility Development Strategy (SDMP) is an annex to the Multiannual Energy Plan (MEP). It falls within the context of the framework law on mobility, adopted on 19 November 2019, which radically reformed the general system governing mobility policies. The first strategy, published in 2015, covered the 20162018 period. The second strategy will be published with the revised MEP in 2019. It describes the guidelines and actions planned in the 20192023 and 20242028 periods for the preventing global warming and reducing energy consumption.   The guidelines and avenues for action described in the SDMP result primarily from the national dialogue taking place during the National Conference on Mobility held from September to December 2017. The draft framework law on mobility will be the preferred vector for implementation of these actions. Other strategies and action plans have also been used to draft this document, in particular the Climate Plan, the Hydrogen Plan, the Strategic Contract for the Automobile Sector for 20182022, the Bicycle and Active Mobility Plan and the commitment for the deployment of low-emission zones.  The principal guidelines and avenues for action covered in the SDMP are the following:  Enabling all regions to have access to alternative mobility services other than the individual use of a car and to unleash innovation   Making clean mobility accessible to everyone, providing each area with a mobility authority (AOM) and expanding the role of the AOMs to cover active or shared mobility and social mobility services. This means giving everyone their choice of mobility, offering our fellow citizens a more diversified, more effective, more connected and more shared range of services throughout the nation.   Facilitating the trialling and roll-out in sparsely populated areas of new mobility solutions, and the circulation on public roads of autonomous vehicles on the basis of an appropriate legislative and regulatory framework.  Managing demand for mobility   114     Encouraging the optimisation of travel by reinforcing the role of employers and coordination of the actions of local authorities using mobility plans.   Promoting more virtuous behaviour, in particular through the deployment of low-emission zones in conurbations and valleys where air quality is a concern.  Developing low-emission vehicles (including river and sea vessels and aircraft) and improving the energy efficiency of equipment stocks, relying on the alternative fuels market   Relying on purchase and tax incentives to achieve the ambitious targets set for the low-emission vehicle market (bonus/penalty, conversion bonus), supporting all communities.   Setting minimum incorporation rates for low-emission vehicles for upgrading public (in accordance with the European Directive on clean vehicles in public procurement) and private fleets and ensuring that these targets are met.    Supporting this development through the deployment of alternative fuel distribution infrastructures: roll-stations (NGV) and hydrogen stations.   Promoting energy efficiency of domestic river and sea transport and achieving carbon neutrality, enabling the distribution of low-carbon energy in all French ports and facilitating the switch to other low-carbon technologies (batteries, biofuels, hydrogen, sail, etc.).   Limiting the impact of air transport on climate change by targeting substantial energy efficiency improvements and a very significant switchover from fossil fuels to biofuels (50% in 2050).  Promoting modal shifts for passenger transport   Developing multi-modal mobility as a result of the accelerated opening of data and the possibility for the stakeholders to offer a journey planning and ticket payment service integrating all links for the same journey.   Boosting the share of active modes in daily mobility by implementing the bicycle and active making cycling safer (secure parking, anti-theft tagging of bicycles, bike box at traffic lights, etc.), creating incentives (grants for sustainable mobility) and making it more accessible (cycling proficiency).   Developing public, shared and cooperative modes of transport by investing in rail infrastructures, in public transport, in clean mobility through calls for projects and by encouraging the use of shared transport modes thanks to a sustainable mobility grant and dedicated lanes.  Promoting efficiency in freight transport and modal shifts towards river routes and railways   Streamlining urban logistics by taking this into account in planning documents and by overseeing the activity of digital platforms.   Developing mass modes for freight by increasing investment in mass transport infrastructures (railways, river routes and ports).    Adopted in December 2019, the Mobility Law15 (LOM) introduces several measures and targets intended to realise these various targets.     3.1.5.2. SNBC guidelines   115    The SDMP lays down the guidelines for the transport sector up to 2028. In the longer term, SNBC 2 defines the following guidelines for this sector:   providing the sector with incentivising price signals;   setting clear, consistent targets with targeted objectives for the energy transition of equipment stocks;   supporting fleet changes for all transport modes;   supporting local authorities and companies in implementing innovative initiatives;   encouraging modal shifts by supporting active mobilities and mass public transport modes  (freight and passengers) and developing intermodality;  controlling the increase in transport demand.                                                            15 https://www.ecologique-solidaire.gouv.fr/loi-mobilites-0  3.1.6. Where applicable, national policies, schedules and measures planned to phase out energy subsidies, in particular for fossil fuels  There are no subsidies for fossil energies in France in the true sense of the term. The carbon component in the energy taxation system currently in place (see Section 3.1.1) increases the prices of fossil energies on the basis of their carbon content.  However, certain sectors are subject to reductions in rates for the energy consumption tax (TICPE). This is the case in particular for road freight transport, agriculture and fisheries, and energy-intensive industries otherwise subject to the ETS system. Aviation and international maritime transport are also be fossil energy subsidies according to the definition applied by the OECD.  The identification of these tax expenditures is monitored as part of the preparation of finance laws (report 15).  Furthermore, a recent report from the Compulsory Levies Board16 carried out a detailed review of this subject.   The following table shows the primary tax expenditures that are environmentally harmful:  Tax expenditures relating to reduced tax rates for fossil energies   Road haulage  1361  Road passenger transport  219  Internal waterways transport  48  Transport by taxi  58  Non-road diesel (other than for agricultural use)  1000   15 https://www.performance- publique.budget.gouv.fr/sites/performance_publique/files/farandole/ressources/2020/pap/pdf/jaunes/Jaune2020_t ransition_ecologique.pdf  16 https://www.ccomptes.fr/fr/publications/la-fiscalite-environmental-au-defi-de-lurgence-climatique   116    LPG used as non-road fuel  75  Non-road diesel, heavy fuel oil, natural gas and agricultural LPG  1057  Energy-intensive installations subject to the ETS system  903  Energy-intensive installations performing an activity considered to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage  49  Companies recovering biomass  32  Fuels used for aircraft and ship test engines  27    The tax loopholes are subject to reductions under the most recent finance law. The TICPE rate for road non-road diesel used in particular by construction tax rate on jet fuel for international flights because of the applicable international aviation agreements, France has instead chosen to introduce a tax on airline tickets based on the distance travelled.  Continued elimination of tax loopholes is desirable, but for sectors subject to international competition, it would seem more appropriate for carbon pricing to be handled effectively at European and international level for certain sectors. Indeed, tax convergence in Europe would make it possible to remedy this problem.  France also supports international actions within the ICAO and the IMO in favour of increased carbon taxation in the aviation and maritime sectors
