Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 250 of 268  5. Impact assessment of planned policies and measures     5.1. Impacts of the planned policies and measures described in Section 3 on the energy system, GHG emissions and GHG phase-out with a comparison against the projections given in the current policies and measures (described in Section 4)   All measures established in the NECP were assessed with regard to their direct and indirect impact on greenhouse gas reduction. The specific assumptions and details of the measures included in these impact assessments (WEM and WAM) are the responsibility of the respective Federal Ministries.  The presentation of the measures for the impact assessments (WEM and WAM) has no prejudicial effect on the question regarding the extent to which they require public funds and where those funds would come from.  The assumptions regarding the development of international energy and allowance prices and those regarding social development were not changed with regard to the WEM scenario (see Tables 9 and 10) and essentially follow the European Commission recommendations.  i. Projected evolution of the energy system and of greenhouse gas emissions and reductions and, where relevant, projected evolution of atmospheric pollutant emissions in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/2284 with the planned policies and measures until at least 10 years after the period covered by the plan (including the final n policies and measures  objectives described in the NECP, as well as the WEM scenario. These measures and objectives will be implemented in the coming months and years using suitable regulatory, fiscal, funding-policy and awareness-raising instruments in order to bring about the effects laid out below. The measures listed as options in Table 1 are the only exception to this. These are not taken into account in the WAM model.  not subject to emissions trading of around 41.5 mt CO2eq by 2030, which corresponds to a reduction of around 27% when compared with 2005. Despite clear reductions, the transport Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 251 of 268  sector remains the largest emitter in the non-ETS sector, at 49%, followed by the agriculture sector in second place. Buildings and energy & industry share third place, with similarly high emission levels.  As specified, the measures listed as options in Table 1, in particular  - further greening of the incentive, funding and tax system,  - extension of the emissions trading system (ETS) to other sectors,  - identification and gradual phasing out of counterproductive incentives and subsidies  are not included in the WAM-scenario model.  Due to the complex issues surrounding the climate and the resulting comprehensive mutual impacts on public and private finance flows, correlating with a correspondingly high level of risk for public budgets both in terms of revenue (public levies and subdivision of the federal budget for the environment, energy and climate) and in terms of expenditure (including Federal Budget Category 4, Economy, Infrastructure and Environment), it is critical that efforts are taken to ensure that publicly funded measures are as effective as possible. The critical factor in implementing and prioritising the planned measures and any measures going beyond that is, therefore, the question surrounding the directly or indirectly associated reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  The results of the WAM model show that using these instruments will be necessary to cover the remaining gaps of around 5.2 million tCO2eq that will be required to achieve a GHG reduction of 36% by 2030 through domestic measures. The aim is to reduce GHG emissions by at least 2 million tCO2eq by 2030 by gradually phasing out counterproductive incentives and subsidies. Decisions regarding the exact shaping of this plan and the plan to reduce the remaining 3.2 million tCO2eq will be taken by a future Federal Government. These measures will also have a considerable impact on energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy sources in the energy system.  In terms of final energy consumption in 2030, the consumption under the WAM scenario is 46 PJ less than that of the WEM scenario. The share of renewable energy sources in the gross final energy consumption is almost 10 percentage points higher thanks to the development of wind power and photovoltaics.  By 2030, primary energy consumption will drop by 45 PJ under the WAM scenario, as compared with the WEM scenario. Primary energy intensity (primary energy consumption/GDP, see point 2.2) will drop by 17% between 2015 and 2030 under the WEM scenario, and by 20% under the WAM scenario.

Assessment of strategic interrelations (between current and planned policies and measures within one policy area and between the current and planned policies and period, with the particular aim of gaining comprehensive knowledge of how energy efficiency/energy-saving measures affect the required size of the energy system and thereby reduce the risk of stranded investments in the energy supply  The most important planned packages of incentives underlying the WAM scenario are:   in the transport sector, the increase in fleet efficiency (including massive expansion of electromobility), the improvement of public and goods transport through increased investment in this area, expanded mobility management, increased consideration of climate aspects in spatial planning and increased speed limit controls;  in the buildings sector, the intensive replacement of fossil energy sources, primarily fuel oil, via appropriate funding-policy and regulatory measures to bring about the switchover to renewable heating systems and an increase in renovation rates and quality;  in the industrial sector, an increase in energy efficiency through funding-policy and regulatory measures and the replacement of fossil energy sources, primarily replacing natural gas with biogas;  in the energy sector, the development of renewable energy sources for electricity generation, the generation of renewable methane from biomass and hydrogen from renewable electricity;  in the agricultural sector, the reduction of mineral fertilisation, changes in feed and pasture grazing and production of biogas from farm manure.  When implementing the measures, efforts must be made to ensure that this results in multiple interrelations between the individual sectors. For example, part of the development of Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 255 of 268  photovoltaics will be the result of measures implemented in the buildings sector. Likewise, changes in rights of residence are necessary to increase the number of private charging stations for electric vehicles. Electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles require more electricity, which, in turn, needs to be supplied from renewable energy sources. Similarly, a switchover to biomass requires a supply from agriculture and forestry without placing a strain on natural sinks or jeopardising the food supply. Economic growth and higher consumption not only support the production sector, but also goods transport and services. Finally, any rebound effects must not be ignored: for example, average room temperature following a thermal renovation are generally higher and industrial companies will become more competitive and will be able to increase their production due to energy saving measures.     iii. Assessment of strategic interrelations between current and planned national policies and measures and Union climate and energy policy measures  As specified in point 1, achieving the climate and energy goals by 2030 requires, on the one hand, a multitude of national policies and measures and, on the other, effective framework conditions at Union level. On that basis, critical technology pathways, for example, which are partly based on assumptions in this impact assessment, require European fundamental or systemic decisions. This is the case in particular in the transport sector, for example in relation to electromobility or the pricing of the high-level road network in accordance with the polluter-pays principle. The development and implementation of a national hydrogen strategy also needs to take place hand in hand with European strategic objectives and investment flows, as this is closely associated with issues surrounding the internal European and international competition situation and the request to avoid stranded investments.     Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 256 of 268  5.2. Impacts of the planned policies and measures described in Section 3 on the economy and, where possible, on health, environment, employment and education, skills and social conditions including aspects regarding the just transition (in the form of costs, benefits and cost efficiency) at least until the projections given in the current policies and measures.   In order to perform the socioeconomic impact assessment of the planned policies and measures, a model-based evaluation of the impacts on employment, gross domestic product and income distribution was carried out. The results of the impact assessment were calculated from the measure  Under the WAM scenario, employment is slightly higher than under the WEM scenario, although gross domestic product (GDP) barely changes. Cumulatively, under the planned measures (WAM scenario), employment figures for the 2020 to 2030 period surpass those under the WEM scenario by about 141,000 FTEs. This corresponds to an increase in employment of 0.32% when compared with the WEM scenario. Assuming a WEM sensitivity scenario on the basis of average annual GDP growth of just 1% (instead of 1.5%) there is slightly stronger growth in employment and gross domestic product in the WAM scenario than the WEM scenario, due to the larger free economic capacity.  The drivers behind these developments are the domestic economic sectors that will benefit from the measures established in the WAM scenario. These include, on the one hand, the construction sector, which will be boosted by the planned expansion of infrastructure for public transport, bicycles, buildings, renewable power generation and supply lines, and, on the other hand, production and employment in power generation and supply due to the planned expansion of renewable energy sources. Furthermore, the transport services will also benefit with employment increasing as a result of the planned service extensions in public transport (e.g. recruitment in train and bus transport). In manufacturing, employment will also increase in metal products and electrical equipment manufacturing and in machinery and equipment installation. These positive developments are, however, neutralised by the fact that a substantial portion of the economic activity triggered by these measures will not take place in Austria (e.g. electric and rail vehicle construction).  With regard to social impacts, the impact assessment shows that disposable household income will rise slightly for all income groups as a result of the measures established in the WAM scenario. However, this gain will tend to be greater for higher income groups (household income Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 257 of 268  distribution deciles) than for lower income groups. This can also true of the measures to be implemented in the buildings sector, which will have a stronger impact on disposable household income among the lower deciles than the higher.  These unequal income effects could be compensated by a tiered, income-based subsidy for private households for the implementation of building measures, which would be coordinated to the strengths of the respective instruments across local authorities. The organisation of this subsidy would need to be checked to ensure that the level of subsidisation of the measures to improve heating systems or building envelopes would increase as household income decreases. Taking the household economic position into consideration would increase the likelihood that households in unfavourable economic situations could also implement measures. Implementation via tax law could also be considered.  In addition to introducing a tiered, income-based subsidy, accompanying, awareness-raising measures of an organisation-legal nature are also needed to improve access to independent and public information and advice, and to reduce organisational barriers for households in energy poverty.  With regard to the environment and health, the planned measures would not only bring about a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but would also lead to a reduction in the emission of atmospheric pollutants. The emission reduction measures prioritise reducing NOx and PM 2.5 in the transport and industrial sectors and NH3 in agriculture. In the buildings sector, the increased use of biomass will result in more emissions from this source. Nevertheless, overall, the majority of the measures proposed are expected to bring about positive impacts on air quality.  The traffic measures described may also reduce noise pollution. The measures to be implemented in the transport, buildings, industry, waste management and agriculture sectors are expected to have positive effects on human health by reducing fine particulate matter. Thermal building renovation and building cooling (including operational buildings) are also relevant for climate change adaptation and have a positive impact on human health (e.g. when the weather is hot).

Existing investment flows and assumptions regarding future investments in connection with the planned policies and measures  Considerable investments have already been made in the areas of energy, mobility and climate in Austria over the last few years. This investment focus must be intensified considerably in the period to 2030. The estimated total investment volume for the period to 2030 is around EUR 166 to 173 billion. Public authorities will also be making a contribution, as well as creating appropriate incentives to boost investment. The following table shows the estimated investments required to achieve the objectives established in this plan. Information on additional, public and private investments is given as an indication.

EUR 234 million on the assumption of a gradual increase from the current level of EUR 12.5 million to EUR 30 million by 2030. Remaining national funds from Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology amounting to EUR 88 million. 33 The investment value represents the total volume of newly acquired e-vehicles in all vehicle categories (in particular e-cars, e-utility vehicles, e-buses, including fuel cell technology) and expansion of charging infrastructure in the period to 2030. Public support measures include subsidies for vehicle purchases with renewable energy and charging infrastructure. 34 According to the WAM scenario, investment totalling around EUR 2.2 billion will be necessary from all local authorities to develop cycling in Austria. Federal Ministry of Sustainability and Tourism share (including EU resources) in klimaaktiv mobil approx. EUR 330 million. These values would be required for a maximum expansion and are taken into account in their entirety in the third WAM model run. 35 Of which EUR 132 million from the Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology budget (connection to public train stations). 36 20% of national financing from federal government, 80% from states and municipalities. 37 Additional measures to improve fairway conditions (not land-based electricity connections) and funding programme for the use of GHG-reducing measures on inland waterway vessels.

Sector/market-specific risk factors or obstacles in the national or regional context  The sensitivity analyses carried out to date have shown that economic growth has a particular impact on the sectors of industry and transport (goods transport). From these analyses, two opposing effects can be determined: Although, on the one hand, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions drop with lower economic growth, there is, on the other hand, less capital available for investments. With higher economic grown, both energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions usually increase sharply, though this also creates more capital for investment.     iii. Analysis of additional public financial assistance/resources to fill the gaps established in ii.  With higher economic growth, it can be assumed that Austria will fall some way short from Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 263 of 268  meeting its energy and climate targets. In that case, additional funding, regulatory measures and Europe-wide solutions will be needed in good time to counter the rise in emissions.     5.4. Impacts of the planned policies and measures described in Section 3 on other Member States and regional cooperation at least until the final year of the  period with a comparison against the projections given in the current policies and measures   i. Where possible, impacts on the energy system in neighbouring and other Member States in the region  The impact assessment shows that the security of the energy supply under the fuels (in particular oil, as well as natural gas to a lesser extent) can be significantly reduced. Net imports for electricity can also be decisively reduced, though this does not allow the conclusion to be drawn that cross-border electricity exchange will reduce overall. Rather, it can be assumed that there will be a need for further growth in cross-border power line capacities, in particular in order to better temporarily integrate amounts of electricity from volatile sources onto the market and stabilise the distribution networks. Intensive bi- and multilateral efforts are being made in these areas (and in relation to gas transport) with neighbouring states and beyond.     ii. Impacts on energy prices, supply installations and the integration of the energy market  energy pricing assumptions for internationally traded energy products were made, which comply with the recommendations of the European Commission under the EU Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Mechanism. However, this does not, in any way, allow for the preclusion of the fact that certain policies and measures will lead to additional costs that the end customers will need to bear. This may affect various areas, for example, electricity, gas and fuels. However, no detailed analyses of this were carried out in the impact assessment.     iii. Possible impacts on regional collaboration Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 264 of 268   As expected, regional, cross-border collaboration in the field of energy will increase considerably over the coming years, in line with the significant rise in (cross-border) challenges. This may (and will) also affect collaboration between the Union and third countries.
