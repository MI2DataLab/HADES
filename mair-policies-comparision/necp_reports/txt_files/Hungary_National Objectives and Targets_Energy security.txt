2.3. Dimension of energy security i. The elements set out in point (c) of Article 4 The high share of imports is a determining factor in the energy supply of Hungary (Chapter 4.4), which carries serious risks for the security of supply and prices. Since Hungary defines the security of supply as part of national sovereignty, the Government of Hungary assigns a priority to strengthening energy independence and reducing import dependency. In the course of reducing dependence on energy imports and strengthening geopolitical independence, Hungary places emphasis on improving energy efficiency (detailed in Chapter 2.2 on energy efficiency), maximising the sustainable exploitation of (conventional and unconventional) national hydrocarbon reserves and renewable resources (information provided in Chapter 2.1.2), and on maintaining the level of nuclear capacities. Hungary's security of supply can be further improved by strengthening market integration and developing a diversified supply portfolio. Electricity market Hungary aims to establish an electricity sector that can simultaneously guarantee the security of supply, is consumer and climate-friendly, encourages the introduction of new, flexible products on the market and can continuously integrate innovative solutions. The consumer-oriented electricity sector should offer sustainable, affordable energy costs and a large degree of freedom of choice to Hungarian consumers. Main electricity market objectives:  (i) Objectives relating to capacity compliance and the reduction of import dependency:  Ensuring reliable, flexible and diversified national capacities: - To maintain the current high level of the security of supply it is necessary to ensure that sufficient capacities remain available to satisfy domestic peak demand in consideration of decommissioned and commissioned power plants, and growing cross-border capacities. - It is essential to ensure that the Hungarian electricity system (including consumers) possess dispatchable capacities guaranteeing secure operation and system balancing (e.g. production capacities ensuring flexibility, new types of flexibility services, DSR solutions, energy storage). It is important to ensure sufficient domestic reserve production capacities to manage extreme market conditions. - As a general principle, import capacities ensuring flexibility and manoeuvering room for the Hungarian electricity system should also be available (preferably from as many directions as possible). - In relation to capacity compliance it is also necessary to further decarbonise the electricity mix.  Import capacities and import dependency: - Maintaining and increasing national production capacities is essential for the security of supply; if these are successfully managed, it will be possible to reduce the share of electricity imports  higher than 30 %  to under 20 % by 2040. - Beyond the reduction of import dependency we also aim to further diversify import opportunities by increasing cross-border capacities. Although Hungary is significantly exceeding the 15 % Union target, it would be justified to increase the cross-border capacities of its electricity grid to 60 % by 2030. (ii) The establishment of an infrastructure, a regulatory and market environment supporting the integration of renewables, and ensuring the cost-effectiveness of integrating renewable investments in line with the above, is also a priority. It is very important for the amount of aid to match the decline in investment costs in the future, because if aid levels commonly applied at the end -effective funding as a combined consequence of excessive unit funding and substantial new capacities.30 To ensure cost-effective levels of aid, in the future aid within the REAS framework will only be available through renewable capacity tenders; production aid will be available within the conventional                                                       30 REKK (2018): Cost estimate of achieving the share of renewable energy by 2030. (https://rekk.hu/downloads/projects/2019_REKK_NEKT_megujulo_final.pdf)  feed-in system only for experimental technologies and model projects.31 (iii) The electricity grid should be prepared for the growing spread of decentralised capacities. Beyond large power plants and energy systems under centralised control, the number of distributed, household-scale power plants (HSPP) is rapidly increasing (potentially replacing the former plants). This trend poses challenges for the energy networks as well, as these need to be adequately managed. (iv) Hungary aims at effectively exploiting innovation opportunities. (v)  Strengthening integration of electricity and gas markets and coordinating the operation of gas and electricity markets further bolsters Hungary's security of supply. Gas market The benefit of reduced import dependency and import diversification for the security of supply is most obvious in relation to natural gas, as it accounts for the largest share of final energy consumption in Hungary (32.5 % share in 2017), also in consideration of the consumed quantity of electricity and heat generated with natural gas. In recent years national production covered approximately 20 % of consumption, therefore around 80 % had to be imported to Hungary. For this reason it is essential to establish a sustainable economic and regulatory environment on the gas market that preserves the results of the reduction of overhead costs and guarantees the security of supply in the long term. Continuous compliance with the N-1 rule can guarantee Hungary's energy security. (The N1 formula describes the ability of the technical capacity of the gas infrastructure to satisfy total gas demand in the calculated area in the event of disruption of the single largest gas infrastructure during a day of exceptionally high gas demand occurring with a statistical probability of once in 20 years.) The N-1 value should in each case reach 120 %. Main gas market objectives: (i) Reduction of import dependency: As a result of a decline in gas consumption and growing domestic production, Hungary's share of gas imports will decline to around 70 % by 2030 and is expected to decrease further below 70 % after 2040.  Consumption reduction milestones: - As a result of energy efficiency investments and growing use of renewable technologies, by 2030 gas consumption for heating may be 2 billion m3 less than the current consumption level. - Consumption of natural gas for district heat generation may fall by 50 %.  Milestones relating to the increased use of domestic resources: - Increased production of natural gas: by continuing to guarantee the predictability of the concession                                                       31 In the first half of 2019, the existing provisions of the FIS and the REAS, reducing aid effectiveness, were modified in two stages.  scheme, enhancing the flexibility of the system and improving the efficiency of non-standard (unconventional) gas production we can offset the exhaustion of production inventories with the encouragement of new extraction projects, thus under an ideal scenario we can expect to increase domestic conventional natural gas production up to even 2.4 billion m3 by 2030. - Use of alternative gas resources: according to estimates, by 2030 the Hungarian biogas potential could offer a realistic possibility for substituting 1 % of Hungarian natural gas consumption, amounting to around 85 million m3 annually. An additional increase is expected by 2040, raising the Hungarian biogas potential to 100 million m3hydrogen to be an alternative; we also aim to examine means of feeding hydrogen into the natural gas network. (ii) The biggest challenge in the short term is to manage the one-sided dependence on Russian sources and the route related risk caused by the developments in Ukraine. As a key objective, the remaining annual import requirement of approximately 6.2 billion m3 should be met with sources as diverse as possible and through diversified routes in 2030. To this end Hungary aims to implement an infrastructure ensuring access to four independent gas import sources (gas traded on the Russian, LNG, Romanian and Western European markets). (iii) It is also necessary to establish access to LNG sources to further enhance flexibility. This would not only enhance the flexibility of the Hungarian gas sector but also strengthen the security of supply by creating a more favourable bargaining position on international gas markets, resulting in more affordable gas prices for Hungary and Hungarian consumers. (Details in point i. of Chapter 2.4.3.) (iv) The security of supply can be further enhanced by strengthening market integration. (v) Hungary aims to maintain the largest possible transit quantity within the national natural gas transmission system32, as strengthening transit flows in recent years have continuously supported the decline of domestic transmission tariffs. (vi) Upon a sharp decline in natural gas consumption or in the volume of natural gas distributed within the network it may be necessary to also rationalise the infrastructure (point ii. of Chapter 2.4.2). Oil market Despite the high share of imports, the efficiently operating global and regional oil market, the availability of transmission alternatives (pipelines or rail/road), alternatives to pipeline supply (Friendship and Adria pipelines) and the emergency oil stockpiling system guarantee efficient pricing and a high level of a                                                       32 The possible significant decrease in transits would entail the risk of rising gas prices including higher network access fees.  security of supply on the Hungarian market. The security of supply is further strengthened by the dominant regional market position of Magyar Olaj- in which the State has a minority shareholding. Maintaining import dependency on a manageable level remains justified. Although an increase in domestic petroleum concessions is expected in the medium term (which may reduce the volume of Hungarian oil imports by up to 10 percentage points), their number is expected to stay constant due to the gradual exhaustion of the fields in the long term. Therefore the key to managing Hungarian import dependency is to reduce the rise in consumption, which is also essential for meeting decarbonisation targets. On the oil market a key goal is therefore to maximise the increase of the use of petroleum products in transport at 10 % by 2030. Coal market The share of coal in Hungarian power generation has significantly declined. At the present time only one coal-fired large power plant  the Mátra Power Plant  operates in Hungary, extracting lignite in Visonta and Bükkábrány. As the second largest power plant of Hungary, it accounts for 15 % of total Hungarian power generation. The Mátra Power Plant plays an important role not only in energy production but also on the labour market: it is the only dispatchable large power plant in the eastern half of Hungary and is also a major directly or indirectly work in the industry or at related undertakings (10 000 jobs are directly or indirectly related to the power plant, with 27 000 affected family members). However, the power plant is also the largest CO2 emitter of Hungary, accounting for approximately 50 % of CO2 emissions in the energy production sector and 14 % of total national CO2 emissions. The power plant and the roughly 100 000 households in the region heating with lignite also significantly contribute to concentrations of other air pollutants in Hungary: 36.2 % of SO2, 13.71 % of Hg and 4.48 % of NO 2.33  it is necessary to prepare for changes in the operation of the electricity system, the replacement of some capacities with other technologies, the retraining of workers in the affected region and for maintaining various industrial activities relying on the In addition, taking into account the substantial Hungarian lignite reserves, we plan to ensure the availability of lignite production as a strategic reserve. Achievement of the goals can be guaranteed by drawing up a regional decarbonisation strategy and action plan involving stakeholders. EU funds are also available for implementing the decarbonisation programme. This sectoral and regional decarbonisation transition is composed of the following elements:                                                       33 Emissions data for 2017.  - The Mátra Power Plant had a substantial social-economic impact within the immediate region, including the creation and retention of jobs, the indirect creation of jobs by related undertakings, and local tax revenues. Based on the above, in the course of revitalisation particular attention should be f -added chain. - Most of the 100 000 households supplied with retail lignite based heating are located in the region of the Mátra Power Plant. In the course of revitalisation and the transition we aim to replace household heating energy with clean energy and to reduce energy consumption. Similarly to the whole of systems to partially supply local electricity consumption. - The large site of the Mátra Power Plant may also be suitable for multi-purpose utilisation going beyond energy functionalities. Such use includes industrial park expansion and diversification opportunities, expansion of agricultural or other storage and logistics functions, conservation and presentation of the cultural heritage of mining, habitat reconstruction serving tourism and nature conservation purposes, and natural water conservation measures. Nuclear safety A key objective is to maintain the high level of safety in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Improving cybersecurity With the spread of IT solutions and digitalisation, and the growing application of artificial intelligence the number of cyber-attacks and risk factors arising from the interdependence of information systems is expected to increase in all economic segments. The activities of attackers (script-kiddies34, cybercriminals, State-organised attacker groups, APT35 groups) with diverse backgrounds and motivation are increasingly reaching the energy sector as well. The combined use of new, modern and legacy technological solutions is also a challenge. Cybersecurity should therefore become a key element of national security. The combined use of new, modern and legacy technological solutions is also a challenge to be managed.36 Improvement of the labour market in the energy sector Based on feedback from the industry, the shortage of specialists and competence observed in the energy sector is a growing problem, inter alia, in satisfying increasing network development and connection demand arising in relation to real estate development and renewable energy production investments. Hungary may face                                                       34 Script-rams (scripts) or software developed by others. They are often also commonly called hackers. 35 Advanced Persistent Threat 36 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2019/553 on cybersecurity in the energy sector.  similar problems during the future operation of the new units of the Paks Nuclear Power Plant, therefore it is necessary to mitigate the problem of lacking specialists and competence. ii. National objectives for achieving improvement in the following fields: increased diversification of energy sources and of energy supply originating from third countries for the purpose of increasing the resilience of regional and national energy systems  Taking into account that Article 4(c) of the Governance Regulation also covers this field, the reply is included in the reply under point (i). iii. Where applicable, national objectives aimed at reducing dependency on energy imports from third countries to increase the resilience of regional and national energy systems Taking into account that Article 4(c) of the Governance Regulation also covers this field, the reply is included in the reply under point (i). iv. National objectives aimed at increasing the flexibility of the national energy system, in particular by means of deploying domestic energy sources, demand response and energy storage Hungary aims to increase the share of renewable resources within final energy consumption. Chapter 2.1.2. presents goals defined in relation to the use of Hungarian renewable sources of energy. Electricity market The penetration of renewables can only be technological solutions, and the development of distribution network operation, as a decentralised intervention capability, and its transparent market mechanisms (flexible distribution market) network. The availability and use of dispatchable capacities necessary for reliable power supply in the system operation of the transmission and distribution networks is a key strategic task requiring close cooperation between all market participants, licence holders and regulators. Since short-term fluctuations in weather-dependent production are currently mainly balanced with gas-fired power plants, it is necessary to prevent a decline in the necessary amount of dispatchable power plant capacities. The spread of new, innovative solutions  such as energy storage and demand side responses (DSR solutions)  should also be enabled. The active participation of consumers on the energy market allows them to control their overhead expenses and to potentially contribute to maintaining system balance through the availability of flexibility services. Opportunities can be exploited with digital and smart devices. As regards energy storage, Hungary plans to encourage use of energy storage systems to integrate renewable energy production.  Development of regulated energy markets (operating mainly within a short time frame, supporting system flexibility) and of additional means of electricity interconnection, and enhancement of market integration  Gas market Based on domestic consumption and gas market trends, the amount of emergency natural gas stockpiles is prescribed by decree by the minister in charge of energy affairs, under authority granted by Act XXVI of 2006 on the emergency stockpiling of natural gas. In case of a supply crisis, the minister orders the sale of natural gas reserves to buyers and at the price determined in his decree. As regards natural gas, Hungary's method of preparation for possible supply problems remains unique in Europe to this day. Additional goals are not justified in this regard. In relation to natural gas storage, our aim is rather to strengthen competition on the gas storage market and the regional role of Hungarian facilities. Maintaining natural gas transit flows is a key issue in relation to storage capacities as well. In addition to ensuring storage, flexibility may also be enhanced with increased use of biogas/biomethane and alternative natural gas sources, and access to LNG sources, in particular. Ensuring a reverse-flow Croatian-Hungarian cross-border pipeline is also key in relation to the latter. Access to the LNG terminal planned on the island of Krk, namely, would also allow Hungary to import gas from Croatia. Oil market Requirements relating to minimum emergency petroleum stocks are based on Council Directive 2009/119/EC and the Agreement on an International Energy Programme drawn up within the framework of the International Energy Agency (IEA). Based on the above, the emergency stockpiling of imported oil and petroleum products is regulated by Act XXIII of 2013. The system is functioning normally, therefore Hungary considers it unnecessary to define additional goals.
