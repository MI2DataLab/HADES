The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan           A. National Plan 1. Overview and plan development process 1.1.  Summary i. Political, economic, social, and environmental context of the plan the Union has taken a leading role in the fight against climate change by the five prime dimensions: energy safety, decarbonisation, energy efficiency, the energy internal market, and research, innovation and competitiveness.    The European Union has thus committed itself to leading energy transition globally by achieving the climate change targets of the Paris Agreement, which concern the supply of clean energy throughout the Union. In order to meet this commitment, the European Union has established  energy and climate targets for 2030, as follows:  the target of at least 40 % domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990;  the target of 32 % renewable energy consumption in 2030;  the target of 32.5 % for improvements in energy efficiency in 2030;  the 15 % electricity interconnection target by 2030. Consequently, in order to ensure the achievement of these targets, each Member State was required to submit a draft Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (INECP) to the European Commission for the period 2021-2030 by 31 December 2018. The draft INECPs establish the national targets and shares in the achievement of the EU climate change targets. Consequently, Romania submitted its draft INECP on that date. The European Commission has assessed the draft national integrated plans for energy and climate under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action. The assessment comprised the level of ambition of the objectives, targets and shares designed to ensure achievement of the EU targets collectively. In particular, the assessment covered the EU targets for 2030 in the area of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, as well as the interconnectivity of electricity grids that Member States aim for. The assessment of the integrated plans submitted by all the Member States has revealed a gap between the EU targets ergy from renewable sources and energy efficiency:  There is a gap between the 32 % target for RES, as committed to at EU level, and that inferred from these plans, which ranges between 30.4 % and 31.9 %;  fficiency has revealed a reduction between 26.3 % and 30.2 % in primary consumption and between 26.5 % and 30.7 % in final consumption.  The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         ii. Strategy relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union The approach to the five dimensions of the EU considered a multitude of strategies at various stages of preparation or approval, which were conceived by the ministries/stakeholders, taking account of the convergence and development priorities of Romania as an EU Member State. This Plan integrates, as a priority, the objectives and strands established through the specific energy and climate strategies, at the same time being based on the programmatic documents initiated by other ministries/authorities. As such, the approach proposed to identify a set of priorities that lead to the achievement of the revised objectives committed to, having regard to the available resources, the need to ensure affordable transition for the industry and the consumers and the institutional implementational capacity. Similarly to the pillars by 2030, this Plan was established on a series of core elements for defining the role and contribution of Romania to the strengthening of the European Union. In this respect, the main elements taken into account in the strategic approach to the Plan were the following: - developing the holistic energy, economy, environment and climate change approach by closely correlating it with the economic reality of Member States, lest the domestic macroeconomic and social balance be affected; - restructuring the market framework in the context of the entailing transition costs and the competitiveness; - the economic growth and income per household (by 2030); - reduction in energy poverty. Main results achievement of the EU objectives by 2030 is outlined in the table below:  Table 1  Overview of the main objectives of the 2021-2030 INECP by 2030 Overview of the main objectives of the 2021-2030 INECP by 2030 ETS emissions (% compared to 2005) -43.9 %* Non-ETS emissions (% compared to 2005) -2 % Overall share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption 30.7 %  RES-E share 49.4 % RES-T share 14.2 % RES-H&C share 33.0 % Energy efficiency (% compared to the PRIMES 2007 projection for 2030)  Primary energy consumption  -45.1 % Final Energy Consumption -40.4 %  Primary energy consumption (Mtoe) 32.3 Final energy consumption (Mtoe) 25.7 The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Source: Deloitte analysis based on the official documents prepared by the authorities involved in the preparation of the INECP * The emission values correspond to those included in the draft INECP submitted to the Commission on 31 December 2018; however, it is estimated that the final value for 2030 is likely to decrease, among others, as a result of the reduction in the final energy consumption and the decrease in production of electricity from coal As regards the share of renewable energy, the European Commission recommended Romania to increase the level of ambition for 2030 up to a share of renewable energy of at least 34 %. Consequently, the level of ambition regarding the share of renewable energy was revised compared to the updated version of the INECP from an initially proposed share of 27.9 % to 30.7 recommendation to align the natReport: economic and budgetary projections for the EU-27 Member States (2016-correlatively decommissioning the coal-based capacities. In order to reach the ambition level regarding the share of renewable energy of 30.7 % in 2030, Romania will thus develop additional RES capacities of approximately 6.9 GW compared to 2015. In order to achieve this target, appropriate funding from the EU is needed in the sense of providing for the appropriate adequacy of electricity grids and flexibility in the production of RES-E by deploying backup gas capacities and storage capacities and by using smart electricity grid management techniques. Romania has chosen to adopt a prudent approach to the level of ambition, taking into account the national particularities and the RES investment demand for both replacement of capacities that have reached the maximum operation period and new ones in order to achieve the targets committed to in the INECP, having regard to the fact that Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 stipulates that, in future revisions of the INECP, shares may be adjusted only upwards. In the context of designing this approach, it is also noteworthy that, in the process of implementation of the recommendations, there was also the issue of absence of the data required to prepare a detailed plan regarding the measures, actions, and financial resources envisaged by the Romanian authorities in order to achieve the RES targets in the period 2021-2030, in particular in the area of RES for heating-cooling and transport. A new review/adjustment of the 2030 target will be possible on revision of the INECP, which will enable to estimate much better the effects of the implementation of Directive (EU) 2018/410 and of the Green Deal support programmes. In conclusion, in order to reach the proposed RES targets, Romania will develop a series of policies and measures purposed to reduce consumption of energy and to foster the use of RES sources in relevant sectors - heating and cooling, electricity and transport, by maximising the synergies between the various projected actions.  However, the European Commission mentioned that Romania would have to plan a more significant reduction in primary and final energy consumption by 2030 in order to ensure the energy efficiency objective. Therefore, Romania aims at primary energy consumption of 32.3 Mtoe and at final energy consumption of 25.7 Mtoe, thus achieving energy savings of 45.1 %, by reference to the primary consumption for 2030, namely 40.4 % for final energy consumption compared to the PRIMES 2007 baseline scenario.   Moreover, in order to comply with the obligations under Article 7 of Directive (EU) 2018/2002 amending Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, Romania must reach a cumulated value of new energy savings of 10.12 Mtoe in the period 2021-2030. Following a detailed assessment, Romania has decided to prepare and to implement alternative measures and policies in order to foster energy savings. Moreover, a draft Long-Term Renovation Strategy was submitted for public consultation and it is to be adopted by March 2020 (the current The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         renovation scenario provides for energy efficiency and significant CO2 savings as well as new facilities for RES-E production installations - most of them in the form of photovoltaic panels for existing buildings). As regards the energy security dimension, the Commission recommended a description of the support measures that facilitate the achievement of the energy security targets, with an emphasis on diversification of energy sources and reduction in energy dependency. In order to ensure energy security at national level, Romania has taken, and commits to take, measures in order to implement several projects on diversification of resources, namely:   expeditiously implementing the legal framework required for the final decisions on investment in the exploitation of natural gas resources in the Black Sea area;  adopting the Decarbonisation Plan proposed by the Oltenia Energy Complex (Complexul Energetic Oltenia), which is the main producer of coal-based electricity, with the purpose of ensuring sustainable transition towards low-carbon production of electricity;  diversifying the uranium sources for Nuclearelectrica;  extending the operating period and building new nuclear capacities;  developing new RES capacities and ensuring integration in other markets in the region as well as promoting the use of hydrogen;  developing/upgrading the existing infrastructure of electricity and natural gas networks, with a positive impact on the capacity to take over the RES energy and on the interconnectedness level;  developing storage capacities. Moreover, the European Commission suggested to Romania to define more ambitious objectives and targets regarding integration in the internal energy market, recommending in particular the adoption of certain measures to develop liquid and competitive wholesale and retail markets. Romania has recently taken significant steps in this respect, also undertaking to follow a liberalisation calendar that will ensure free pricing as of 2020/2021 depending on the demand and offer. On the other hand, the operationalisation of the support measures for vulnerable consumers and the alleviation of energy poverty will be considered in strict correlation with the deadlines of the abovementioned calendar. In the updated version of the Plan, Romania also clarifies the undertaken target regarding the level of interconnectedness of energy transmission grids, which will reach at least 15.4 % in 2030 based on a progress calendar for current and projected projects, which is administered by the energy transmission system operator. Moreover, Romania is involved in the European process of integration of energy markets in the context of achieving the Single Day-Ahead Coupling (SDAC) and the Single Intra-Day Coupling (SIDC), involving the corresponding contractual framework. As regards research, innovation and competitiveness, the Romanian Government plans to prepare the National Smart Specialisation Strategy for the period 2021-2027, which is foreseen to be published in the second quarter of 2020. The strategy intends to define the national objectives and targets of funding in the fields of research, innovation and competitiveness,  In conclusion, Romania has initiated various actions with the purpose of increasing the level of ambition as regards the RES share and the energy efficiency targets and is considering several measures to define and to implement strategies and policies that concern reaching the targets committed to. Additional measures will have to be taken, as described in Chapter 3 of this Plan, in order to reach the proposed targets (set out in Chapter 2), which will be subsequently conducive to the achievement of the overarching European Union objectives. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         In the context of the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan, which has been recently published by the European Commission, this Plan contemplates also addressing the bases of the policies and interventions designed to ensure socially just transition in Romania. The priority of the measures and policies aimed at reaching the targets was mainly established according to the interactions between dimensions, having regard to the maximisation of the projected impact of the respective policies and measures. For example, investments to increase energy efficiency will also result in reduction of GHG emissions, the increase in the share of renewable energy and alleviation of energy poverty. Positive effects will be thus recorded also at macroeconomic level, providing for the creation of new jobs, an enhanced quality of life and the reduction in social costs.  The summary of the main trans-sectoral policies and measures and the interaction between dimensions are elaborated in the following section.  iii.

The benefits of smart meters will consist in identification of the final consumption profiles of final consumers and thus increase in the predictability of electricity sales. Moreover, digitalisation will be conducive to an increase in RES through the development of smart grids because they enable bidirectional communication; for example, the energy from renewable sources could be fostered by implementing Grid-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Grid technologies (development of electromobility - RES-T).

The implementation of pilot and demonstration projects promoting use of hydrogen in the production of electricity and in the industrial sector will also be facilitated. The innovation-research pillar will speed up the creation of these conditions through an increase in and diversification of funding sources, the strengthening of a legal framework dedicated to research and innovation activities, a surge in research and innovation projects in State-owned companies and the development of educational resources at all levels.

Overview of the current status of policies in force i. The EU and Romanian energy system and the background of policies included in the national plan objective has been consistently supported ever since the publication of the Energy Union Framework Strategy1 in that the Commission prepared proposals to deliver on the energy efficiency first principle, support EU global leadership in climate action and renewable energy and provide a fair deal for energy consumers.2  The Energy Union is regarded as an essential element in a complex contrivance of flagship initiatives such as the Digital Single Market, the Capital Markets Union and the Investment Plan for Europe3.

Cities, regions, business, social partners and other stakeholders need to get actively involved in the discussions on energy transition, in particular in the context of the Integrated Energy and Climate Plans so that these respond adequately to the needs of the different territories.4 The national energy system (electricity and natural gas) The sector of electricity in Romania includes the following main activities:   production of electricity in power plants, including cogeneration plants;  transmission and distribution of electricity to final consumers through voltage lines;  the sale and purchase of electricity (on wholesale markets and to final consumers, including import-export activities). A feature of the electricity production sector is the existence of mono-fuel companies, where production of electricity is based on one type of primary resource, production companies having different production costs and relatively balanced market shares, and the price determined by the demand and offer being strongly influenced by the marginal price (of the producer with the highest cost and of the coal-based producer).                                                 4 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the European Investment Bank, Clean Energy for All Europeans, Brussels, 30.11.2016, [COM(2016) 860]  The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Production and marketing/supply of electricity are subject to competition, whereas transmission and distribution are subject to regulation. The competitive segment entails trading  in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner (in accordance with Law No 123/2012 on electricity and natural gas, as subsequently amended and supplemented), where prices are freely established on the basis of demand and offer; for these markets, the role of ANRE is to pricing/tariff setting. In addition, the electricity market includes other secondary activities/services, such as:  system services;  allocation of cross-border interconnection capacities;  green certificates trading activities;  emission allowance trading activities etc. All the activities pertaining to the electricity market (production, transmission and distribution) are carried out under the licences granted by ANRE.  The electricity market includes the following participants and associated operational structures:  producers of electricity;  a transmission system operator (Transelectrica);  an electricity market operator (OPCOM);  distribution system operators;  suppliers;  traders;  final consumers. transposition of the EU law into the Romanian law, the natural gas sector in Romania has been subjected to an extensive restructuring and liberalisation process, which has not been completed yet and which mainly followed the action lines below:   separating natural gas production, storage, transmission, distribution and supply activities;  regulating the non-discriminatory access of third companies to the transmission system;  interconnecting the national transmission system with the systems of neighbouring countries;  gradually liberalising regulated prices at both non-household and household consumers. The natural gas market features a rather high level of concentration with the two main large producers, i.e. OMV Petrom and SNGN Romgaz, these companies holding together a market share of over 90 % of the natural gas production within the territory of Romania on the free market. As for the market shares of main suppliers, there is a slight differentiation between the free market and the regulated market, the latter featuring a higher level of concentration. The main players on the free market were OMV Petrom, Romgaz, Engie Romania and E.ON Gaz Furnizare, summing up over 70 % of the market share, whereas the main domestic players on the regulated market are Engie Romania and E.ON Gaz Furnizare, with a total market share of over 90 % at the end of 2017.  Moreover, an operator of the National Gas Transmission System (NGTS) is active on the Romanian market, i.e. Transgaz SA, which ensures transmission of natural gas at national and The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         international level, the grid being interconnected with Hungary, Bulgaria, the Republic of Moldova, and Ukraine.  The National Gas Transmission System is a radial-ring system interconnected with the starting points in the deposit area of Transylvania, Oltenia and Muntenia East, and the destination area of Bucharest-2018, the system counted over 13 350 km of transmission main lines, of which approximately 370 km of international transmission lines, over 1 100 control and measurement stations, 3 natural gas compression stations with installed capacity of approximately 28.94 MW (the 2019-2028 National Transmission System Development Plan approved by ANRE). ii. Current energy and climate policies and measures relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union -Climate Change-greenhouse gas emissions, the improvement of energy efficiency and the increase in the share of energy from renewable sources (20-20-20 objectives). More precisely, the EU planned, at that time, a 20 % decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and a 20 % increase in the energy produced from renewable sources and in energy efficiency.  This directive has underpinned the reformation of the EU emissions trading scheme, has led to the setting of national targets for emissions not regulated by EU ETS and of national targets for renewable energy, to the establishment of a legal framework for the sequestration and storage of carbon dioxide and to the Energy Efficiency Directive.  Last but not least, a wish was asserted at that time to enhance energy security and import itiveness were also legitimate expectations for the EU. The table below lists the current energy and climate policies and measures relating to the five dimensions of Romania: Table 2 - Table of current energy and climate policies and measures in Romania relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union Dimension/Pillar Policies/measures Decarbonisation Reduction of GHG emissions:  the Programme Fostering Renewal of the National Vehicle Stock;  the Rabla Plus Programme, which provides interested parties, including legal persons, with the possibility of purchasing electric vehicles by receiving a subsidy of up to RON 45 000 for each motor vehicle. Moreover, a subsidy of up to RON 20 000 is offered to purchase a new hybrid electric vehicle with an external supply source, which generates an amount of CO2 emissions below 50 g/km;  the Programme for the installation of heating systems using renewable energy, including the replacement or completion of classical heating systems under the GREEN HOUSE (CASA VERDE) scheme for natural and legal persons;  the National Programme for improving environmental quality by arranging green areas in localities;  the Programme for production of energy from renewable sources: wind, geothermal, solar, biomass, and hydro;  the Programme for mitigating the impact on the air, including monitoring The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Dimension/Pillar Policies/measures of air quality;  the Programme for developing bicycle lanes. Renewable energy sources: The main measures taken at national level5, to this date, in order to promote an increase in the amount of energy from renewable sources, taking account of the indicative trajectory for achieving the RES targets, are set out in the following legislative acts (as subsequently amended and supplemented):  the system promoting production of energy from renewable sources through green certificates (accreditation was allowed by the end of 2016 and the validity of the aid scheme for accredited operators expires in 2032);  developing the electricity transmission and distribution grids to ensure the discharge of electricity produced by power plants using RES [Outlook Plan for the electricity transmission grid (ETG) and the electricity distribution grid (EDG) for 2018-2027];  Economic supply, in the context of combating climate change;  the Large Infrastructure Operational Programme (LIOP), Priority Axis 6 - Promoting clean energy and energy efficiency in order to support a low-carbon economy.

The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Dimension/Pillar Policies/measures Internal energy market The main current policies and measures regarding the internal energy market are found in both primary legislative framework (e.g. Law No 123/2012 on electricity and natural gas, as subsequently amended and supplemented) and the secondary legislative framework (e.g. ANRE orders), and they concern: Policies:  ensuring the functioning of the competitive electricity markets;  providing for non-discriminatory and regulated access of all participants to the electricity market and to public interest electricity grids;   transparency of electricity tariffs, prices and taxes in the framework of a pricing policy, seeking to enhance energy efficiency throughout the electricity production, transmission, distribution and use cycle;  improving the competitiveness of the internal electricity market and active participation in the creation of the regional market and of the internal EU energy market, and in the development of cross-border trading;  providing for the operational security of the NES. Measures:  management by OPCOM of the day-ahead market (DAM) in Romania under a coupled regime, by pricing, based on the available interconnection capacity (ATC - available transfer capacity) with the markets in Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic (4 M MC);  -based coupling of the CORE region;  y market operator) of the day-ahead market (DAM) and of the intraday market (IM) of electricity for the Romanian bidding zone for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2015/1222;  functioning of coupling mechanisms within the DAM and IM, in the process of implementation of Regulation (EU) 2015/1222, including in the context of European multiparty cooperation dedicated to the implementation,  operation and development of coupled electricity markets (Single Day Ahead Coupling - SDAC and Single Intra-Day Coupling - SIDC);  participating in the European implementation project of cross-border intra-day trading by developing and implementing the XBID solution locally;  the development by Transelectrica, in collaboration with other TSOs, of the intra-day allocation rules for the coordinated allocation of the inter-zone capacity at the borders between various bidding zones;  the development by Transelectrica, in collaboration with other TSOs, of the harmonised allocation rules - HAR) for the long-term transmission rights in rem at the borders of the various bidding zones;  the development by Transelectrica, in collaboration with other TSOs, of the trading platforms for balancing products;  standardising the energy bill for the purposes of costs comparability and transparency, and of fair information of consumers;  the implementation by ANRE of the comparator of type energy and natural gas supply bids. As regards the natural gas market, the main measures and policies emerge from the following provisions and initiatives:   The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Dimension/Pillar Policies/measures  separation of activities in the natural gas sector (transmission, storage, distribution, supply);  definition and implementation of the Network Code in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 312/2014 and Regulation (EC) No 715/2009;  definition and monitoring of performance indicators in the area of transmission/distribution of natural gas and in trading activities;  revision of the capacity auction calendar, as offered by SNTGN TRANSGAZ SA, in accordance with the ENTSO-G calendar.  designation of the forecasting party in the balancing zone of the national transmission system and selection of one of the models for information defined in Commission Regulation (EU) No 312/2014;  fostering trading in short-term standardised products on the centralised markets in Romania at the level of network users, for the commercial balancing of own source-consumption portfolios, and at TSO level, for the physical balancing of the NTS in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 312/2014 of 26 March 2014 establishing a Network Code on Gas Balancing of Transmission Networks; Research, innovation and competitiveness The National Research-Development and Innovation Plan for 2015-2020 (NRDIP III), as approved by Government Decision No 583/2015 and amended by Government Decision No 8/2018, proposes the following programmes in the energy sector:  Programme 3: European and International Cooperation  Subprogramme 3.2  Horizon 2020/Horizon Europe;  Programme 5: Research in Strategic Fields  Subprogramme 5.2 - Participation in the international research and development bodies and programmes in the atomic and subatomic field  Subprogramme 5.5 - Programme for research, development and innovation for Generation IV reactors - ALFRED;  other funding options are included in the financing mechanisms of the European Economic Area (EEA) - FM EEA 2014-2021 and the 2014-2021 Norwegian financing mechanism under the programmes coordinated by the Ministry of European Funds;  (programme operator - Innovation Norway);  (programme operator - Innovation Norway) by the Green Industry Innovation component;  - for research projects and projects in the area of generation efficiency, transmission, smart grids and distribution of electricity, green energy production technologies, and diversification/balancing of energy sources.

Key issues of cross-border relevance The key issues of regional/cross-border relevance arise from the legislative provisions applicable at Union/national level and concern the interconnections of energy/natural gas transmission systems, the market integration and coupling and the national contribution/regional cooperation in the field of energy security.  The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         These issues are found in the current approach, in the light of the current policies and measures (as described in Chapter 1.2. ii. and in Chapter 4.4. and 4.5.), as well as in the projected policies and measures (as described in Chapter 3.3. and 3.4.). iv. Administrative structure of implementing national energy and climate policies The administrative structure implementing the national energy and climate policies consists of ministries and other institutions with various responsibilities for the implementation of current strategies and plans, or of strategies and plans under preparation, in the area of energy and climate change.   For the implementation of INECP, the main stakeholders are represented by the Ministry of the Economy, Energy and the Business Environment (Afaceri), the Ministry of the Environment, Waters and Forests (), the Ministry of Transports, Infrastructure and Communications (Ministerul ), the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (), the Ministry of Public Works, Development and Administration (), the Ministry of Education and Research (), the Ministry of European Funds (Ministerul Fondurilor Europene), the National Energy Regulatory Authority (), Transelectrica, Transgaz and OPCOM, and other entities to be designated under legislative acts, ministerial orders etc., which (will) have duties in this respect.  1.3. Consultations and involvement of national and Union entities and their outcome i. Involvement of the national parliament In the framework of the public consultation process on the topic of the draft INECP, the Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian Parliament formulated a series of proposals and some of the relevant opinions as examples: - the need to correlate the data regarding the forecasts on the future electricity production capacities to be deployed in accordance with the draft INECP with other official data such as energy policies and strategies that are to be included in the 2016-2030 Energy Strategy for Romania. - an attempt was made to maintain the correlation of the respective information, however no official document on the 2020-2030 Energy Strategy is currently available, only a draft strategy still under review; - the need to correlate the target undertaken by Romania as regards the share of energy from renewable sources in the final gross consumption of energy for 2030 with the target of providing for appropriate funding from the EU in the sense of ensuring the appropriate adequacy of electricity grids and the flexibility in RES-E production by deploying storage capacities and by using smart management systems for electricity grids. The draft INECP included the respective information, insofar as it was known, as well as data on EU funding available for supporting RES and for developing investments in the indicated fields; - identification of sources, more specifically funding schemes at European level to achieve these targets and demanding the development of investment plans in the natural gas and electricity National Transmission Systems for the following ten years for the development of NTS in order to establish interconnections, to extend and to connect the new production capacities, and to develop the storage capacities needed for their operation under conditions of The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         efficiency and safety - the information made available by Transgaz and Transelectrica was considered;     - the large-scale use of digital innovations in the future complex energy systems, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), shared storage, advanced models of active consumers, aggregated energy communities, blockchain and smart applications etc., requires an adequate Action Plan for protection of data and information against intrusion and harmful attacks (cybersecurity) and uncontrolled use of data of final consumers at Member State and EU levels. Insofar as there are specific developments, they will be included in the plan revised in the period 2023-2024;   - congestion management - in order to be able to maintain the level of security in the operation of energy systems if renewable energy sources are connected to the electricity grids, special measures are required at system level - information on congestion management methods in accordance with the new EU regulations was included; - the need for the EU to enable the regular updating of the INECP with more details on the technological novelties, the trend in the costs of each technology, their funding, EU programmes on access to technology, production and contracting programmes, studies on the impact of accelerated introduction of these technologies on the electricity prices, having a separate section for the Technological Development Plan, for which a possibility exists, in the biannual reports to be prepared regarding the implementation of the INEPC; - updating the INECP with the ANRE orders and decisions indicated in the document, with a view to facilitating its development, and with the need to develop reiterations, adjustments and additions thereto in accordance with the amendments required by the primary and secondary legislation, more specifically directives, EU regulations and national laws, orders and decisions of the regulatory authority in charge with their transposition and compliance - the sections dedicated to market issues, RES and energy efficiency stated the commitments of the Romanian State to transpose the new EU law in the Clean Energy Package. The ANRE orders and decisions can only be deemed consistent with the primary law and the EU regulations in force;  - providing for the energy storage capacities and the back-up systems, i.e. development of the plants, may contribute to the establishment of power reserve - such requirements are to be implemented depending on the final form of the 2020-2030 Strategy; - achieving a production-consumption balancing capacity, without jeopardising the safety of the system, for the current structure and the medium-term projection of a new production park of approximately 4 000 MW - information received from CN Transelectrica, which is the entity in charge with the NES balancing issues, was included; - the development of action plans must be considered for the implementation of INECP, which concern transition in coal regions, energy efficiency, digitisation, storage of natural gas, the map of renewable resources etc. - the various plans will be included in the biannual INECP reports as and when they are available.  ii.  Involvement of local and regional authorities Having regard to the importance and implications of the 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for the development of Romania in the forthcoming period, the Ministry of the Economy (the current MEEMA) subjected the draft INECP to a first stage of public consultation in order to collect from stakeholders proposals, suggestions and opinions in the form of recommendations regarding this document of strategic relevance. The initial consultations on the draft form were purposed to increase the transparency of the decision-making process and, at the same time, they enabled to gather useful information needed to debate certain public policy issues with a major impact for the period 2021-2030. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         The first stage of the internal public consultation process was developed in the period 29 November-10 December 2018 and it was initiated with the publication of a notice by the Ministry of Energy (the current Ministry of the Economy, Energy and Business Environment) on the official website of the institution regarding the initiation of the public consultation process on the draft 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan.  The draft  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan was annexed to this notice of initiation of public consultation.  At this public consultation stage no opinions were received from local and regional authorities. Moreover, a second stage of internal public consultation was organised in the period 13 February-15 March 2019, which culminated with opinions submitted to the Ministry of Energy and with the organisation of/participation in a series of public events with the draft INECP as the main/secondary topic. A third stage of public consultation on the topic of the draft INECP, which was revised based on  31 January-28 February 2020.

Energynomics - short presentation of the INECP 27 March 2019 Romania has met its European commitment for 2020 to increase the RES share to 24 % of the gross final energy consumption, reaching a level of 26.27 % in 2015 for this target. Moreover, Romania has endeavoured to achieve the targets for energy produced from renewable resources. The total installed electrical capacity at the end of 2018 in accredited renewable energy production units was 4 955 MW. The structural changes in the energy industry to achieve the targets for 2030 and 2050 are significant in terms of costs and technologies and ultimately the costs will be transferred to the consumers. We know that decarbonisation is the appropriate solution - we need clean energy and to stop/mitigate climate The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         No Activity Date Description change. But this approach will have its costs and, considering the economic differences at EU level, we need to make sure that there will be fair burden-sharing and distribution of financial efforts in order to reach the common energy and climate objectives. 9.

Following the review of the draft INECP, which took into account, as far as possible, the during the previous public consultation rounds of February 2020, a new internal public consultation session was conducted. The observations and comments received during this  The recommendations received at the third stage of public consultation were assessed and partially implemented. The INECP updating following this stage of public consultations thus concerned:  adding explanations on the projected trend in the natural gas-fired installed capacities by 2030 to the WAM scenario;  as regards the nuclear power production capacities (the two nuclear plants - a capacity of 1 300 MW), adding the mention that they concern net installed capacities;  adding an estimation of the number of electric vehicles and charging stations in 2030 to the WAM scenario;  indicating the level of electricity grid interconnection of at least 15.4 % for 2030 and the minimum available capacity for cross-border trade of at least 70 % of the transport capacity (2030), within the safety limits in operation after considering contingencies as per the action plan of CNTEE Transelectrica, which was developed in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electricity;  making corrections in the text as per the delivered recommendations (e.g. on the list of acronyms, updating the names of central authorities throughout the entire document etc.);  as regards the measure promoting investments in new low-carbon energy production capacities, indicating the fact that it will be implemented also for heating in SACET district heating systems, through the transit of energy through the NES, and the use of heat pumps at source level by also using the electricity market mechanisms; The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          adding the Horizon 2020 financing fund as a source for the implementation of the best available techniques (BAT);  adding the measure fostering energy symbioses between SACETs and the industry in the proximity to promote transition towards a circular economy;  measure prohibiting the access of certain types of motor vehicles to city centres, and adding the possibility of including a measure that entails revising the annual tax for ownership of motor vehicles depending on the type of motor vehicle owned;  including the additional mentions regarding the measure promoting the development of alternative fuels (including LPG, CNG and LNG), namely the fact that the measure concerns promotion of development of production of such fuels as well as of the infrastructure required to reach them;  removing the reference to the measure promoting the conclusion of long-term sales contracts only with final consumers (PPA), so the updated version makes reference to   adding the measure of sustainable development of hydrogen production from renewable sources within the territory of Romania (as far as possible);  adding the measure of development of research and development of technologies for production of biofuels (e.g. production of advanced biofuels and coprocessing of oils) and biogas within the territory of Romania;  indicating the accessing of the Mechanism for Sustainable Transition to ensure just transition for affected workers and their communities;  including additional explanations regarding the historical and projected trend in the electricity price in both scenarios (WEM and WAM), namely the fact that: o the quarterly historical average electricity prices for household consumers include all the taxes and excise duty; o the quarterly historical average electricity prices for industrial consumers exclude the VAT and other recoverable taxes; o the projected final electricity price (in the WEM and WAM scenarios) is an average of the final price to household and industrial consumers and includes all the fees relating to the system services (e.g. transmission, distribution) and other costs (e.g. green certificates) and does not include the VAT and excise duties;  adjusting the funding sources so as to make reference to the 2021-2027 multiannual funding framework under preparation. iv. Detailed presentation of the measures fostering consumption of renewable energy, in particular in the area of heating, where the development of household consumers will lead to a decrease in the use of traditional biomass and the potential migration towards natural gas-fired technologies. Moreover, the use of biogas should be considered in the I&R sector, in particular in the areas with farming potential - the information currently available on this topic was used Consultations with other Member States At the same stage of public consultation, the Ministry of Energy sent letters to the Ministry of Energy from Bulgaria and the Ministry of Innovation and Technology in Hungary on 5 December 2018, which are institutions that manage the issue of the INECP from the respective Member States, enclosing a summary of the INECP in English.  In this respect, an official letter was received from the representatives of the Ministry of Energy in Bulgaria, in which they appreciated the fact that the international projects mentioned in the draft INECP for Romania are consistent with the policies and measures set out in the draft INECP for Bulgaria, without adding any other comments and suggestions. Moreover, the following are included at the stage of regional public consultation: The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          the presentation of the RES component in the INECP at the CESEC/RES meeting of 31 January 2019 in Vienna;  the presentation of the RES and energy efficiency objectives and targets in the draft INECP of Romania at the RACVIAC meeting on the topic of energy security of 5 June 2019 in Zagreb;  transmission of information letters on 13 February 2019 to the Ministry of Energy in Bulgaria and to the Ministry of Innovation and Technology in Hungary regarding the publication of the full INECP report in English on the website of the Ministry of Energy;  CESEC  dedicated working group that facilitated exchange of relevant opinions for the draft INECP and its implementation. v. Iterative process with the Commission European In accordance with Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 and Annex I thereto, each Member State must submit to the European Commission a final draft version on the own integrated national energy and climate plan for the period 2021-2030. The first drafts of the integrated national energy and climate plans were submitted on 31 December 2018. Romania submitted its own draft integrated national energy and climate plan on 31 December 2018. The submission of this draft plan constitutes the basis and first stage of the iterative process between the Commission and Member States, which is purposed to complete the integrated national energy and climate plans in a form that enables to reach the common EU targets in 2030. In the period January-December 2019, the Romanian authorities debated on the draft 2021-2030 INECP at the stages of consultation and negotiation with the European Commission. The following actions were carried out at this stage:  participation in the consultation and negotiation rounds;  supporting and submission of the draft 2021-2030 INECP and of its main outcomes, including justification of the use of variables and parameters other than those recommended by the European Commission;  examination of the document submitted to the INECP Working Group established by the Commission through the Secretariat of the INECP Working Group established at national level.
