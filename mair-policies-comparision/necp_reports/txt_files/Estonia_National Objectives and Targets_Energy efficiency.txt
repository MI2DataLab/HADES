The elements set out in point (b) of Article 4 Under Article 4(b) of Regulation (EU) No 2018/1999, the NECP 2030 document should indicate the following:  the overall target for energy efficiency;  the cumulative amount of end-use energy savings to be achieved over the period 2021-2030;  the indicative milestones for the renovation of buildings, both public and private by 2030, 2040 and 2050;  the total floor area to be renovated of public bodies' buildings over the period 2021 to 2030. at an average level but we held the seventh place in consumption of primary energy per capita, see Figure 6 and Figure 7.

Figure 840, published by the World Energy Council shows that the issue does not lie in high energy consumption, but GDP which is still increasing, in other words, Estonia is still a developing economy.                                                            40 efficient or inten  Figure 8. Share of different sectors in the energy consumption of EU states 201241 Overall target for energy efficiency Each Member State must make a fair contribution to achievement of the general energy efficiency laid down in the Energy Efficiency Directive, according to which EU consumption of primary energy should not exceed 1273 Mtoe in 2030 and/or EU final energy consumption shall not exceed 956 Mtoe. To this end, each Member State is to indicate their indicative contribution for achieving the EU energy efficiency target (hereinafter the overall energy efficiency target). NDPES 2030 describes the consumption of primary energy, final energy consumption and energy intensity as the expected results of application of the measures in the development plan in 2030 (see NDPES 2030, Tables 1.2 and 1.3). According to NDPES 2030, the expected primary energy consumption in 2030 is 10% less than in 201242, while final energy consumption is 32 TWh (115 PJ) and the energy intensity of Estonian GDP2012. The conclusions of the European Council that took place in October 2014 on the EU 2030 climate and energy policy framework regarding energy efficiency43 were based on                                                            41  42 According to the data of EUROSTAT, Estonian gross domestic energy consumption was 256 PJ in 2012, i.e. according to ESDP 2030, the primary energy consumption in Estonia may be up to 230 PJ.2012. 43 European Summit (23.-24 October 2014) - Conclusions http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-169-2014-INIT/et/pdf the European Commission Communication44 that described different Europe 2030 primary energy consumption levels and the possible impacts of achieving these levels.  Based on the background to the EU energy efficiency target, it is most relevant to focus on the consumption of primary energy as a whole and take the consumption of primary energy in 2030 as the basis for the overall energy efficiency target. Other possible bases for setting the overall energy efficiency target include final energy consumption, energy savings in primary energy consumption and final energy consumption in 2030 and energy intensity. According to the EU Regulation on Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, the Member States have to consider the measures of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive and other measures for achieving the energy efficiency on the Member State and EU level in their energy efficiency overall target, and may also consider other circumstances that impact the consumption of primary energy and final energy consumption in the Member State. These other circumstances may be, for example: - cost-effective energy savings potential in the future; - changes in gross domestic product; - changes of energy imports and exports; - changes in the national energy balance, development of carbon storage options; - previous efforts to achieve energy efficiency. Taking into account the circumstances listed above, Estonia has set the target of keeping final energy consumption at the same level by supporting the energy saving measures planned for 2030 and reducing consumption of primary energy by up to 14% compared to the peaks of previous years (2013 - 69.4 TWh), Figure 9.                                                            44 COM(2014) 520 final, Communication on Energy Efficiency and its contribution to energy security and the 2030 Framework for climate and energy policy, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1528977372755&uri=CELEX:52014DC0520    Figure 9 Estonian actual and projected final energy consumption and primary energy domestic consumption until 2030.

The period 2021-2030 requires annual energy savings equivalent to 0.8% of the average final energy consumption in the period 2016-2018. The achieved energy saving must be cumulative, in other words the volume of the saving made in previous years must be stable throughout the period. Table 8 shows the calculated required energy saving. Table 8.

At the same time, application of these methods does not change the volume of the cumulative energy saving required in the period 2021-2030. The total floor area of public buildings to be renovated the period 2021-2030. According to Section 5 of the Energy Sector Organisation Act, 3% of the total useful floor area of buildings occupied by the central government where the central government uses more than 250 m2 and that do not comply with the minimum energy efficiency requirements are to be brought into conformity with the requirements each year. As at 1 January 2018, the total useful floor area of public buildings with more than                                                            45 Must be recalculated after publishing the statistical data of 2017 and 2018 in EUROSTAT. Preliminary 2017 information from Statistics Estonia: final consumption increased by 2.8% in 2017 compared to 2016.  250 m2 of useful floor area based on the ownership or contracting lease in the territory of the Republic of Estonia was 1,354,752.1 m2 of which 572,260.5 m2 met the requirements. Hence to comply with the Energy Sector Organisation Act, it must be ensured that the buildings that are used by public bodies that comply with the minimum energy efficiency requirements enforced in 2013 have a total useful floor area of at least 812, 000 m2 by 2030. This means that a total of 170,000 m2 of building space must be renovated in the period 2021-203046 to achieve that target .  Summary -efficiency targets are shown in Table 9. -efficiency targets up to 2030. NDPES supply and consumption is more sustainable Objective name Objective Overall energy efficiency target primary energy consumption up to 2030 < 230 PJ47 Cumulative amount of end-use energy savings to be achieved over the period 2021-2030 14,422 GWh Final energy consumption 120 PJ The total floor area of public buildings to be renovated the period 2021-2030. 170 000 m2  According to the projected primary energy consumption, consumption of primary energy in 2030 will probably be somewhat lower than the NDPES 2030 target, provided that we are able to achieve an cumulative final consumption energy saving of at least 14,667 GWh. ii.

The previous national reconstruction strategies for buildings48 was submitted to the European Commission under the Energy Sector Organisation Act and NDPES 2030 in October 2017. NDPES 2030 sets out rules on the target levels and measures for the reconstruction of buildings.  These targets can be achieved by producing more renewable energy in the buildings. Table 10 below describes the expected outcomes of the measures of NDPES 2030. Table 10.

Where applicable, other national objectives, including long-term targets or strategies and sectoral targets, and national objectives in areas such as energy efficiency in the transport sector and with regard to heating and cooling NDPES 2030 comprehensively addresses energy consumption in transport and district heating sector, including cogeneration. It also deals with the modernisation of street lighting and energy savings by production companies. The use of oil shale has a significant impact on the efficiency of the Estonian energy sector. One of the strategic targets of the National Development Plan for the use of Oil Shale, 2016-203051 shale use and reduce negative environmental effects.
