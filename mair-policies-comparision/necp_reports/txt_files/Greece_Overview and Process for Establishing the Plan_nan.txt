18 Chapter 1 PLAN OVERVIEW AND DRAFTING PROCEDURE 1.1 Executive summary 1.1.1 Political, economic, environmental and social context of the plan The National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) is a balanced mix of ambitious and rational by 2030. Such an energy transition requires a higher objective for reducing GHG emissions, increased penetration of RES in gross final energy consumption, improved energy efficiency for higher energy savings, and lignite phase-out in power generation, to make sure that this radical energy sector transformation does lead to a climate neutral economy by 2050, for the benefit of the society and the environment. On the basis of the new strategic agenda 2019-2024 adopted by the Council on 20 June 2019, the success of this green transition towards building a fair and social Europe will depend on the substantial mobilisation of private and public investment, the consolidation of an effective circular economy and an integrated, interconnected and properly functioning EU energy market. This market will provide sustainable, secure and affordable energy, with full respect for the Memdependence on external sources, diversify its supply and invest in solutions for the mobility of the future. Therefore, the systemic nature of climate and environmental challenges makes it necessary to develop sustainable policies incorporating all three dimensions of sustainable development (social, environmental, economic), with common benefits and synergies in addressing climate change, protecting nature and biodiversity, air quality, water resources and the environment. However, for these policy measures to work and for the objectives to be attained, continued effort and horizontal cooperation will be needed, along with close monitoring for supporting, updating and incorporating new technological developments, while at the same time assessing and adapting to feedback from the market and international developments in addressing climate change.   19 1.1.2 Overall strategy in relation to the five dimensions of the Energy Union The EU energy and environmental strategy promotes energy integration in Europe, i.e. the abolition of energy boundaries between national energy markets and the strengthening of the gy is the completion of the internal energy market, which will be liberalised and competitive and will dictate the following provide secure energy to all, facilitapromote and reward low-carbon economy, while at the same time supporting energy efficiency and new technologies. Security of energy supply new sources of supply from East Mediterranean and Central Asia, plus the potential for developing intra-Community supply economy by 2050. Securing and managing energy resources through diversification of energy sources and flows, with a view to strengthening the security of supply both in Greece and in the broader region of SE Europe, will shield supply to the domestic market and protect consumers in case of supply disruption and emergency. Therefore, the key strategic objective is to ensure the smooth, uninterrupted and reliable coverage of both domestic and regional energy needs, as well as the access of all consumers (people, businesses and public sector bodies) to mature energy market. Completion of a sustainable energy market Given the restructuring of its energy sector, Greece aims to develop and operate competitive and economically viable energy markets, which are supposed to function in a way that offers energy products and services to consumers at competitive and transparent prices. Moreover, in a European and global energy-neutral environment, the shift to a low-carbon-intensity energy system will allow new energy technologies to enter the energy market, providing opportunities for innovative investments and activities and strengthening the competitiveness of the Greek economy.   20 Low-carbon economy Breakthroughs are expected to occur in the next decade in the field of power supply in Greece, as the RES share in power generation is expected to increase significantly and gradually replace the use of fossil fuels. The policies to be adopted aim at integrating RES in the electricity market in a competitive manner. However, the anticipated reduction in, and ultimate end of, the use of lignite for power generation purposes will have a direct and indirect impact on growth and employment in lignite-producing areas and will be felt by the local communities. Therefore, specific transition policies will have to be developed along with a strategy for financing these policies. Physical planning The ongoing urbanisation and expansion of cities, which have been on the rise in recent years, is a common challenge for physical planning in Europe. The rate of consumption of land for urban uses far exceeds the rate of population growth. The primary objective of sustainability policy is a major overhaul of the structure and mode of operation of modern cities. The core issue is promoting the urban models that correspond to urban areas and with respect to the distribution of functions, the density and the hierarchy of their structure (centre, local centres, suburbs). The policies promoted concern changes to the shape, size, density of housing, planning and siting of activities in cities, which will result in changes to the energy demand standard and an overall improvement in their energy and climate footprint. Bioclimatic town and urban planning The geometry and siting of buildings, urban roads and public outdoor areas, the use of unsuitable materials on surfaces, the absence of plants, human activities and land uses determine the energy behaviour of an urban area and are responsible for the urban heat island effect and the reduced flow of wind, and therefore for rising temperatures in urban areas both at day and night and increased energy consumption. A key policy objective consists in using bioclimatic design (in town planning and architecture), aiming to bring buildings, roads and public and other spaces in urban areas in harmony with the environment and local climate, which will yield immediate results in terms of energy savings, while at the same time improving the urban environment and quality of life.   21 Energy efficiency Improving energy efficiency in all fields of consumption is the biggest challenge for the public policies to be implemented in the following decade. Therefore, it is an absolute and horizontal priority that should cover the entire scope and mix of policies and measures to be adopted. Energy savings achieved through improved energy efficiency have a direct impact on how energy is consumed, on the technologies used and on the coverage of consumer energy needs, also making a substantial contribution towards improving the competitiveness of all industrial activities. Energy efficiency of buildings Since buildings are currently responsible for approximately 40% of energy consumption, there is a need to promote the improvement of the energy efficiency of buildings through renovation and modernisation, as well as to adopt corresponding measures for renewing the stock of end-of-lifecycle buildings, while at the same time using construction and demolition waste in conformity to the principles of circular economy. Reducing the energy consumption of buildings requires the increased use of energy-efficient and low-emission heating systems and the renovation or construction of smarter buildings, with improved insulation materials, inter alia, in full conformity to the principles of circular economy. The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive contributes to improved quality of life and makes a significant contribution towards the reduction in GHG emissions by 2050. Another highly important policy is the optimal use of RES technologies to cover heating and cooling needs and of RES autoproduction systems to cover the needs of buildings for electricity, also by strengthening the role of consumers. These actions will ensure a lower cost of living. However, the necessary methods and means must be provided, to help people make this transition. Mobility Cities are at the core of the transition to sustainable mobility. Through sustainable town planning (for compact cities and reduced urban sprawl) and by addressing the demands of mobility and infrastructure, cities are called upon to play a pivotal role. Urban areas should move towards digitisation, automation and other innovative solutions and should adopt active and shared modes of transport through increased walking, use of bicycles and micro-mobility vehicles, use of public transport, or even car-sharing and car-pooling (sharing economy).   22 A crucial area for the transition to a clean, resource-efficient and carbon-neutral future is that of mobility, including all forms of mobility, from urban mobility to trans-European networks, road transport, as well as shipping and air transport. Transport is the primary cause of air pollution, noise, congestion and traffic accidents. The action plan for low-emission mobility, presented by numerous measures for strengthening the sustainability of the transport system. These actions aim to reduce GHG emissions and launch investment in clean transport. This will also contribute to job creation and growth. We must give priority to clean and affordable alternatives, with the a view to having zero-digital tenavigation systems help reduce emissions, for example in aviation and road transport. With respect to urban mobility in particular, there must be a shift from the conventional traffic planning used to date, which gave priority to the unhindered movement of vehicles, to human-oriented sustainable urban mobility. This shift will result from integrated and combined town and traffic planning and policies aimed at reducing the use of vehicles, ensuring parking management, and supporting and implementing arrangements and networks for pedestrians, bicycles, micro-mobility vehicles, mass transport vehicles and accessibility. Transport In the transport sector, the use of vehicles powered by alternative fuels and electricity, the sharp drop in unit energy consumption per type of vehicle, the use of second-generation biofuels, the complete electrification of railway infrastructure and the increase in the share of track-based modes of transport in the overall transport work will, by the end of the next decade, totally transform the technological structure and fuel mix used in the transport sector, thus impacting the national economy as a whole. Finally, given that Greece is a leader in shipping, it is important to promote emission reduction technologies in shipping in compliance with the decision of the International Maritime Organisation of April 2018 for a 50% reduction in emissions by 2050, compared to 2008, and eliminating emissions by 2100.   23 Research and innovation The next decade is deemed to be crucial for the development of innovative technologies and the emergence of start-ups that will help the EU to attain its ambitious objectives. A key parameter for securing the required funds is further integrating the EU energy market and the regulatory and political stability, also enhancing and complementing the framework of policies that have been adopted, without any unpredictable and fragmented moves. In this way, by ensuring the regulatory predictability and necessary competitiveness, the industrial sector will be able to restructure and transform. The market should be able to send a message to research centres that the maturation of technologies which could contribute towards the ambitious EU objectives will be supported either through targeted and time-specific incentives or indirectly such as by ensuring stable and predictable prices for the emissions trading system. In view of the above, Greek research centres are urged to apply a more open policy that will invite and welcome international partnerships with institutions and other States, avoiding the common practice of participating only in EU-financed programmes. It should be pointed out that the new planning supports and promotes the strengthening of the role of consumers and the involvement of end-users in the energy market. This can create new jobs and speed up the development of innovative technologies and applications. Moreover, certain new institutions  such as energy communities, active consumers and decentralised energy management  as well as the technological development of electricity distribution networks are expected to play a major role (smart grids). The 6th dimension of sustainable development The energy transformation of the Greek energy system, in the context of the commitments and targets that are based on the Paris Agreement, is inseparably linked to the global sustainable development goals (SDGs). These sustainable development goals are associated with the necessary shift to new production and consumption standards, the need for sustainable cities, the elimination of poverty, the establishment of flexible infrastructure, the promotion of sustainable industrialisation, circular economy and the promotion of innovation. The above aims are the components of a sustainable development model which aims to ensure, in addition to fiscal stability, the restructuring of production, the rational use of resources and, primarily, non-discriminate and unhindered access to basic goods and services for all.   24 Therefore, to implement the new Greek energy policy and attain the relevant energy and environmental objectives, it is necessary to radically transform the energy system over the next decade and, therefore, to implement significant investments in utilising the potential for domestic energy generation, energy networks, interconnections and energy infrastructure in general, as well as energy consumption and management, which will have a major positive impact on growth in Greece. 1.1.3 Policy-making framework and policy priorities The National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) lays down national objectives for attaining the draft of January, as sent to the EU services for assessment, and the core EU objectives set in the context of the Energy Union. More specifically: (A) it has set a higher objective for reducing GHG emissions, in order to enable the transition to a climate neutral economy by 2050; (B) it has increased the objective for RES penetration in gross final energy consumption; (C) it has strengthened the improvement of energy efficiency by setting a more ambitious energy savings target; and (D) it has made a commitment for lignite phase-out in power generation, leading to a radical energy sector transformation. Figure 1 shows the individual quantitative targets in the context of attaining the national energy and environmental objectives for 2030. Please note that account was also taken of the attainment of the corresponding objectives for 2020. Accordingly, Table 1 lists the key policy priorities for each dimension of the national climate and energy plan, which are deemed necessary for attaining these objectives. These policy priorities are the axes for planning and applying/implementing specific policy measures under each dimension. The overall planning methodology also involves an integrated consultation framework, to have both the definition of objectives and the laying down of policy priorities, as well as the planning and eventual implementation of policy measures evaluated by the organisations and the society in general.   25  * Without taking into account the contribution of ambient heat ** The target has been calculated on the basis of the ex-post final energy consumption data for the period 2016-2017 and the temporary data for 2018 Figure 1: National energy and environmental objectives for the period 2021-2030 in the context of EU policies. All these policy priorities and the specific measures required for their implementation are part of an integrated plan for the optimal attainment of the national energy, environmental, socio-economic and development objectives, which requires cohesion, horizontal combination and coordinated monitoring of the priorities and of the implementation of the relevant measures. Reducing GHG emissions and environmental objectivesTotal GHG emissions to be reduced by at least 40% compared to 1990 (reduction rate >42%) reduction objectives in the individual sectors within and outside the emissions trading system which are equivalent to the respective core EU objectives quantitative targets for reducing national emissions of specific air pollutants to shut down lignite power plants by 2028Increasing the RES share in energy consumptionThe RES share in gross final energy consumption to reach at least 35% final electricity consumption to reach at least 60% covering heating and cooling needs to exceed 40% transport sector to exceed 14% (19% attained), using the relevant EU calculation methodologyEnhancing energy efficiencyTo achieve an improvement in energy efficiency by 38%, using the EU methodology consumption not to exceed 16.5Mtoe in 2030 consumption not to exceed 21Mtoe in 2030 energy savings of 7.3Mtoe in the period 2021-2030**to cover, on an annual basis, 3% of the total surface area of the heated parts of central government buildings by 203026 A key requirement for attaining the objectives set out in the context of NECP is to understand that the progress made in each individual sector automatically affects that made in the other sectors, and consequently the impact of the measures that are finally planned and implemented does not relate to or affects just one theme and section of the NECP, but has a bearing on the overall development of the energy system and demonstrates that the NECP is also directly linked to other national policies, such as waste management, circular economy and adapting to climate change. Chapter 3 sets out the policy priorities and measures selected with a view to attaining consistently and effectively the ambitious targets set. The policy priorities and measures were developed by applying the procedure shown in Figure 2.  Setting ambitious goals in the NECP Consultation Laying down policy priorities Planning of a set of policy measures with a view to implementing the priorities and attaining the objectives Figure 2: Methodology for planning the policies and measures in the context of the NECP in the period 2021-2030. More specifically, to attain the national objectives, specific policy priorities were laid down, which must be implemented in the period 2021-2030 by developing targeted policies and measures. Moreover, a procedure was foreseen for assessing the performance and evaluating the impact of the policy measures, in order to obtain feedback concerning the policy priorities and possibly revise and redefine them with a view to attaining the objectives set. There is an objective, therefore, for a more efficient implementation of the specific policy priorities, which can be ensured by planning and implementing policy measures for each priority separately. Policy priorities were defined both for the six dimensions of the Energy Union:  Climate change, emissions and removals of greenhouse gases,  Renewable energy sources, 27  Improvement in energy efficiency,  Energy supply security,  Energy market  Research, innovation and competitiveness, and for new areas of interest:  Agriculture, shipping and tourism including the implementation of a horizontal policy priority axis relating to the:  Governance mechanism which is deemed to be crucial in ensuring the successful monitoring and, ultimately, implementation of the measures planned and attaining the core national energy and climate objectives laid down in the present NECP. Therefore, the policy measures were proposed taking into account the policy priorities set. It should be noted that the measures do not fully coincide with the priorities, while specific policy measures may lead to different priorities both in one dimension and across different dimensions. That was why particular emphasis was placed on maximising synergies between the different priorities and measures to be implemented across the entire range of the Energy Union. The policy priorities laid down in the context of the NECP are listed in Table 1, and the following chapters provide details on the policy priorities and measures that will ensure the implementation of the concrete policy priorities. Finally, please note that the policy measures are often a combination of individual measures and priorities, for which more specific details will be provided gradually in the period 2021-2030 during the implementation of the NECP.

Hellenic Parliament Four consultations have already taken place in the Hellenic Parliament on the National Energy and Climate Plan. Firstly, presentations were made concerning the necessity of drawing up the NECP and the relevant objectives to be set. During the first consultation in particular (27 February 2018), a presentation was made about  in the field of energy and the environment and the proposed mechanism for drawing up the plan. During the second consultation (29 March 2018), a detailed description was given of the quantitative objectives per policy axis and of the additional energy, environmental, social and economic objectives of the plan, as well as of the organisational structure of the plan implementation mechanism. Finally, during the third consultation (23 January 2019), the completed text of the initial NECP draft was presented to the Parliament, with reference to the 2030 energy and climate policy objectives, a description of the measures and policies envisaged to achieve the relevant energy and climate objectives, as well as the amount of investment required to attain these objectives. Eventually, on 13 December 2019, a joint meeting of the relevant committees was held in the Hellenic Parliament, where the final objectives, priorities and policy measures of the final NECP draft were presented and then the committee members made their comments on the NECP objectives, priorities and measures, which were discussed extensively. Consultation with stakeholders, including the social partners, the civil society and the general public, were carried out at different stages of the process of drawing up the NECP.   32 1.2.2 Getting local and regional authorities involved A workshop was held on 18 June 2018 with regional and municipal local authorities, attended by 86 representatives of municipalities and regions. Also, a questionnaire was enclosed in the invitation to the workshop, including questions on the regional dimension of the energy and climate plan, as well as the obstacles and challenges associated with its implementation. 1.2.3 Consultation with stakeholders, including social partners, and involvement of civil society and the general public I. A workshop was held on 2 April 2018 with institutional bodies, market players and NGOs, was to present measures and policies that could contribute to the attainment of energy, environmental and socially related objectives that would contribute to the economic growth of Greece, the protection of Greek consumers and the attainment of the core objective of adopting a sustainable national energy development model.  The workshop was attended by 114 participants, including 33 representatives of unions and associations, 10 universities / research centres, 27 representatives of companies and NGOs, 35 representatives of energy and environmental stakeholders, 5 representatives of the press and 4 other natural persons.  In the framework of the workshop, a questionnaire was prepared and sent to the participants asking for proposals regarding the objectives, measures and policies that should be correlated to the issues of national energy planning for the period up to 2030. The aim of the consultation was to provide a complete inventory of the proposals regarding the objectives and measures that should be put in place and implemented accordingly in the Greek territory within the context of the National Energy Planning. II. A press conference was held on 20 November 2018, where the Energy and Climate Plan and its quantitative objectives were presented, which was attended by numerous representatives of the printed and electronic press1. III.  November 2018.

The initial draft of the Energy and Climate Plan was posted on a consultation website for regulatory texts for a period of 24 days, from 13 November to 7 December 2018. A total of 868 comments were made, including 19 by unions/associations of stakeholders, 10 by civil society organisations, 7 by companies active in the energy sector, 6 by universities / research centres and 826 by natural persons. V. In the period from September to November 2019, meetings were held with market unions and players active in the fields of renewable energy sources, energy product supply and energy generation with respect to the planning of policy measures in the context of the NECP and the revised national energy and climate objectives for 2030. VI. The bodies invited to and participating in the Inter-Ministerial Committee for the NECP submitted their proposals from 14 to 20 November 2019 on the recommended policy priorities and the measures planned, and they submitted and presented their definitive proposals on the final NECP draft in a relevant meeting held on 13 December. VII. The final Energy and Climate Plan was posted on a consultation website for regulatory texts from 28 November to 16 December 2019. In the context of that final public consultation, a total of 175 comments on the text of the draft and 7 comments on the annexes were made, including 57 of them by unions / associations / collective organisations and 118 by natural persons. VIII. An open event was held on 2 December 2019, supported by the Bank of Greece, where the final NECP draft put to public consultation was presented, and then the proposals were presented to, and discussed by, those attending the event. The above event was attended by 148 representatives of public and private market players, local authorities, collective bodies, academic organisations and research centres.   34 Annex E summarises the results of the public consultation carried out in connection with the NECP over a total period of 19 days and quantitative data from the comments incorporated and taken into account in drawing up the final NECP draft. An accompanying note is also provided on incorporating the feedback from the public consultation in the NECP. There are also plans for preparing special environmental impact assessments in the following period, upon completion and adoption of special frameworks for the implementation of projects, strategic plans and programmes with a view to incorporating environmental approvals and promoting sustainable development. Consultation with other Member States Targeted contacts were made on the basis of the specific priorities and objectives per theme, as described in the next section. 1.2.4 Regional cooperation in drawing up the plan During the process of drawing up the National Energy and Climate Plan, account was taken of active/existing and ongoing regional collaborations on energy and climate issues in order to assess any synergies and specific actions that can contribute to the attainment of the national energy, environmental and other objectives of the NECP. In this context, the following information is reported: Greece-Cyprus-Jordan A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for cooperation in the fiend of RES was entered into on 16 January 2018 by and between the Ministry of the Environment and Energy of the Hellenic Republic, the Ministry of Energy, Commerce, Industry and Tourism of the Republic of Cyprus and the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The purpose of the cooperation on the basis of the above MoU is the exchange of information and know-how, policy-making, training and actions for RES, energy efficiency, innovation and research, as well as the exchange of knowledge, best practices and pilot projects in buildings, focusing in particular on promoting near-zero energy buildings and incorporating RES.   35 Greece-Cyprus-Israel-Italy An MoU for cooperation in the context of the EastMed gas pipeline was entered into on 5 December 2017 by and between the State of Israel, the government of the Republic of Cyprus, the government of the Hellenic Republic and the government of the Italian Republic. the development and implementation of the EastMed pipeline project as a viable and strategic choice for the natural gas producing countries, given that it will serve as a direct and long-term security of supply while at the same time promoting competition between natural gas suppliers. Greece-Cyprus-Israel A joint declaration was signed in Israel on 20 December 2018 by and between Greece, Cyprus and Israel in the context of the 5th summit, focusing, inter alia, on the completion of intergovernmental cooperation for the EastMed gas pipeline. The declaration stressed in -ation in the field of RES, alternative fuels, electric vehicles, strengthening innovation and joint implementation of pilot projects. After a decision was made to implement the electrical interconnection of Crete as a national project (Ariadne Interconnection), aiming to secure the energy adequacy of Crete in a timely manner, Greece has supported the implementation of the Crete-Cyprus-Israel electrical interconnection project. Greece-Cyprus-Egypt  October 2019 by and between Greece, Cyprus and Egypt in the context of the 7 th summit, whereby the three parties agreed to intensify their cooperation by entering into a number of agreements for the exploitation and transit of natural gas, pointing out that the discovery of deposits can contribute greatly to security and prosperity in the region.   36 Greece-Germany In the context of the TARES ++ (2013-)/SRRS (Structural Reform Support Service) project, the cooperation in the field of RES and energy efficiency in Greece was intensified in terms of policies and measures, and steps were taken to develop new initiatives in the above fields, as well as in the fields of electricity systems, electricity storage and electromobility, focusing on innovative technologies and best practices. Greece-Italy A joint declaration was signed in Corfu on 14 September 2017 by and between Greece and Italy in the context of the Conference of the Minister for the Environment and Energy of the Hellenic Republic and the Minister for Economic Development of the Republic of Italy. An MoU was signed in Rome on 26 November 2019 by and between the competent ministries for strengthening energy cooperation between the two countries. Central and South Eastern Europe Energy Connectivity  CESEC An MoU was signed in Dubrovnik on 10 July 2015 on a joint approach to address the natural gas diversification and security of supply challenges in the CNECP Initiative countries. A MoU was signed in Bucharest on 28 September 2017 complementing the CESEC Initiative for Central and South Eastern Europe in respect of the joint approach on electricity market, energy efficiency and RES development. With regard to RES in particular, the cost-competitive renewable energy potential and the added value of RES for the development of a cost-effective, low-carbon energy system and job creation in the CESEC Initiative countries are recognised. In this context, please note the importance of stable and effective conditions for the cost-effective development of renewable energy sources, including the impact of capital costs, and the need for further integration of RES into the market, system and network.   37 Emphasis is also placed on the development of long-term strategies and plans, such as national energy and climate plans to explore options for further cooperation in their preparation and definition. Other cooperation measures  Participation in CA-EED, CA-EPBD and CA-RES groups on RES and energy efficiency.  Participation in ENTSO-e meetings on energy infrastructure market and development issues.  Participation/cooperation of CRES as the national centre for RES in the European Energy Network (EnR) and the Mediterranean Association of National Agencies for Energy Management (MEDENER). Specific partnerships on research, innovation and competitiveness issues In the context of long-term cooperation and ongoing bilateral scientific and technological (S&T) cooperation agreements with other countries, the Secretariat-General for Research and Technology (SGRT) is launching joint calls for S&T projects. The calls announced involve the submission of proposals for the implementation of bilateral S&T cooperation projects also in the energy sector. The proposals submitted involve areas of mutual interest in the energy sector which have been developed through consultations with the competent bodies of the partner countries and are compatible with the strategic areas of research, technological development and innovation (RTDI) and the thematic priorities set out in the National Strategy for Smart Specialisation (RIS3) 2014-2020. 1.3 National and Union energy system and policy framework of the national plan The national energy and climate policy framework is governed by the respective Union framework, and a sufficiently broad national regulatory and statutory framework has been developed for its implementation. This framework is updated within the dimensions of the national plan by taking into account its operating results and the developments occurring at national, regional and European levels. The basic regulatory and statutory framework of the NECP, the administrative structure for implementing national energy and climate policies, and the existing policies and measures within the dimensions of the Energy Union are presented in Annex A to the NECP.
