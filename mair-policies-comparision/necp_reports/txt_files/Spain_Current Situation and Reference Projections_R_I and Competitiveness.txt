CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  280    A.6 RESEARCH, INNOVATION AND COMPETITIVENESS  This section shows the current status, as well as the projects for the areas related to research, innovation and competitiveness, a fundamental aspect of a long-term energy policy.  A.6.1 Level of public and private spending on research and innovation  State financing of research, innovation and competitiveness for energy transition and climate change is coordinated and executed by means of various instruments and bodies, all attached to the Ministry of Science and Innovation.  This financing can be broken down into financing for research, innovation and competitiveness projects and for public research and development infrastructure. It is channelled via:  The Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (Centro Desarrollo Tecnológico e Industrial, CDTI): financing of corporate research, innovation and competitiveness projects.  Spanish Research Agency (Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI): financing for training and attracting research personnel; basic and applied research projects,   MCI itself: financing of public-law research bodies. In the case of the CDTI, in the context of the State Plan and using the year 2017 as reference, approved 84 R&D projects in the area of energy, developed by companies with different forms of aid (refundable aid, partially refundable aid and grants). This aid overall has given rise to a total investment of more than EUR 109 m and public contribution commitments amounting to EUR 76 m73. Within the sectoral area of energy, research, innovation and competitiveness to promote renewables and emerging technology accounts for 64.7% of the projects approved, 57.1% of public contribution commitments and 68.1% of the total business investment budget. These sectoral investments in energy represent 6% of the total operations financed and 9% of the contribution commitment. It is notable that there is a route and potential for great development in this direction.  Moreover, CDTI is also responsible for managing the company INNVIERTE ES, S.A., S.C.R., whose mission is to promote the investment of risk capital in the Spanish technology sector, boosting innovative or technology-based companies (mainly small and medium-sized enterprises) and facilitating the stable participation of private capital in the long term by means of investment in public-private vehicles.                                                            73 2017 aid schemes through grants: CIIP (Eurostars projects), Interempresas Internacional sub-programme; INNO, Innoglobal Grants Programme; SERA, Eranet; and SNEO, Neotec grants. The Feder-Innterconecta Programme was not organised for 2017. Permanent CDTI schemes: ID (individual R&D projects), which includes R&I projects, CIEN (large strategic projects in cooperation), strategic projects, EUREKA, IBEROEKA projects, etc.; LIC (technology innovation projects)   ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  281    The investments in the risk capital vehicles supported by INNVIERTE in the area of energy and environment, as at December 2017, are shown in the table below.

In particular within the national RIC 2014, 2015 and 2016, a total of 176 projects were financed with EUR 24.1 m in total aid granted.  Figure A.9. Financing of energy projects from the Partnership Challenges national research,  m)  Source: Spanish Research Agency  The largest number of projects financed correspond to photovoltaics, followed by electricity/smart networks, bioenergy, nuclear fusion, energy storage and solar thermoelectric. Next are projects related to hydrogen and fuel cells, combustion/CO2and energy efficiency.  Finally, there are smaller lines including wind, nuclear fission, geothermal energy and low-temperature solar, and just one financed project related to marine energy. It should be noted that the classification by thematic lines has been made considering the predominant technology in each project, which does not prevent some of them from also   ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  282    including other technologies. Lastly, it is worth highlighting the existence of three projects consisting of research on hybridisation of renewables.  Moreover, within the same national programme, but in the Challenges  Partnership scheme (public-private partnership), in Challenge 3: efficient, secure and clean energy, in the years 2014, 2015 and 2016, a total of 113 projects were financed with EUR 92.5 m in total aid granted.  Figure A.10. Financing of energy projects from the Partnership Challenges national research, innovation  m)  Source: Spanish Research Agency  Historically, we find two broad clearly differentiated blocks:  In the first of these, with the higher number of projects financed and more aid granted, are the topics of wind energy, energy efficiency/smart cities (these have been considered jointly given the impossibility of separating them), electricity/smart networks, solar photovoltaic and bioenergy.  In the second block, very much behind the first in terms of number of projects financed, are solar thermoelectric (these are normally small projects related to the resource), energy storage (it is possible that some of the electricity network projects will also include this topic in part), fossil fuels, nuclear fission energy, hydrogen and fuel cells, marine energy, hydroelectric power and others.
