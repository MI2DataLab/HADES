Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 106 of 268  3.1. Dimension 1: Decarbonisation   3.1.1. Greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration   i. Policies and measures for achieving the objectives of the Effort Sharing and Land Use Regulation (taking into account all major sectors, and considering the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement)  Transport  ssion2030) focuses in particular on transport. Alongside the overarching Federal strategy, all nine provinces have also committed themselves to the objective, and some have already submitted provincial strategies. In order to ensure that the objectives in the transport sector are met, Austria identified eight strategic task fields in #mission2030, ranging from developing infrastructure, creating necessary economic and legal frameworks, adjusting the subsidy and levy system, boosting research and raising awareness to the use of new technologies and climate-friendly spatial planning.  In terms of the taxation of energy products, Austria is towards the lower end of the middle range of EU Member States.21 Tax rates on petroleum products are consistently lower than in neighbouring countries, which means that a significant proportion of the diesel fuel sold in Austria is used abroad (fuel exported in fuel tanks).  The Federal Government, provinces and municipalities have so far announced around 300 specific measures for the National Energy and Climate Plan, covering the following areas:                                                                           21 An overview of the taxation of energy products, including electricity, is provided in the following publication from the European Commission (as of 1 January 2018): https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/resources/documents/taxation/excise_duties/energy_pro ducts/rates/excise_duties-part_ii_energy_products_en.pdf Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 107 of 268  The public sector leading by example  In public procurement and public fleets, the public sector will lead by example by switching to zero-emission or low-emission vehicles as part of routine procurement of replacement equipment (without special operational requirements22). Vehicles will be procured according to the total cost of ownership (TCO) principle. Appealing infrastructure for cycling and charging electric vehicles will be created for employees. Future investment requirements for local authorities are still to be ascertained in this regard.   Implementation of the Clean Vehicle Directive by cities, municipalities, provinces and the State  Implementation and subsequent further development of the Sustainable Procurement Action Plan and the core criteria therein for vehicle procurement:  Continued development of the minimum number of zero-emission vehicles in new procurement (zero emission quotas);  Further annual reduction of fleet CO2 upper limits for procurement of conventional vehicles;  Master plan for equipping and retrofitting federal buildings: creating attractive infrastructure in the form of e-charging stations, bicycle parking facilities, etc. for employees and guests at public buildings. Use of innovative public procurement tools for determining where needs exist and for implementation;  Mobility management towards a climate-neutral public administration: incentives for climate-friendly travel to work by public transport, on foot, by bike or carpooling. This principle will also apply first and foremost to business trips, and unavoidable flights will be offset.    Significantly increasing the proportion of cyclists  Half of all car journeys in Austria are shorter than five kilometres and more than half of all motorised journeys for the conveyance of goods in towns and cities could in fact be made by bicycle. This reveals considerable potential for more cycle lanes.  -2025 identifies six priority areas with a total of 24 measures, which will form the basis for increasing the share of bicycle use across Austria from the current 7% to 13% in 2025. Measures range from budgetary safeguarding of funding for cycling at all administrative levels, the expansion or construction of high-quality infrastructure for moving and stationary traffic, to the implementation of awareness-raising measures. The measures can be found in all provincial strategies and will be implemented by the provinces,                                                                     22 Requirements of emergency response services and tasks of general interest service provision, including in the event of a crisis, are to be taken into consideration. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 108 of 268  towns/cities and municipalities. The reinforced implementation of measures to achieve this objective should be jointly agreed in an agreement between the Federal Government, provinces and municipalities for promoting cycling at the Austrian Cycling Summit in early 2020. The package of measures and necessary investments are being worked out by the nationwide task force for cycling at State, provincial and town/city level. In order to achieve the objective, current estimates suggest that investment totalling around EUR 2.2 billion between 2020-2030 will be necessary from all local authorities to develop cycling in Austria. Around 80% of these estimated resources will be provided at provincial and municipal level, with a maximum share of 20% coming from the Federal Government (Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism, Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology).   Subsequent implementation of the Cycling Master Plan by provinces, municipalities, public companies and the Federal Government, and the priorities and measures defined therein;  Investment campaigns by the Federal Government, provinces and municipalities to promote cycling and to expand cycling infrastructure in towns/cities and municipalities (e.g. cycle lanes, bicycle parking facilities, etc.) as well as extending regional cycle paths. At federal level, the focus on promoting cycling in the climate protection programme [klimaaktiv mobil] is to be developed and the necessary resources secured through EU funds and support mechanisms  e.g. EAFRD, ERDF, including for the next funding period. Towns and cities with over 30,000 inhabitants are also to receive extended klimaaktiv mobil support.  Further improvement of the legal, organisational and economic framework and incentives to increase the use of bicycles;  Raise awareness of cycling and healthy active mobility by expanding the joint motivation Österreich radelt] and rolling out the JobRad model (a scheme whereby employees can lease bicycles through their employer);  [Digitale und vernetzte Mobilität] of particularly innovative and pilot implementation measures in the fields of micro-public transport, the funding programme Intermodal Interfaces for Cycling [Intermodale Schnittstellen - Radverkehr (ISR)], walking and digitalisation of the transport system;  Increasing research into cycling to strengthen knowledge capacities and promote cycling innovations.   Recognition of active mobility in the health sector.    Improvements in relation to walking Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 109 of 268   Walking is a form of mobility which people throughout society can afford and practice regardless of age, whereby all individuals can make a contribution towards reducing CO2 emissions caused by transport. Walking also has an important tie-in role with transport and forms the basis for engaging in multi-modal transport. Promoting walking also has the effect of increasing the number of people who cycle and use public transport in particular.  -2025 Walking Masterplan sets out 26 measures grouped into 10 areas for action. These range from improving walking infrastructure and a corresponding investment campaign through to the promotion of pedestrian-friendly transport arrangements, the improvement of traffic safety and necessary raising of awareness.  The primary objective is to create conditions for walking which, in the context of increased bicycle use, do not result in this increase being brought about by a switch from walking, but from private cars.   Subsequent implementation of the Walking Masterplan by provinces, municipalities, public companies and the Federal Government, and the priorities and measures defined therein;  Investment campaigns to develop footpath infrastructure and pedestrian-friendly, safe street design with traffic calming, increased introduction of pedestrian priority zones and pedestrian areas in towns, cities and municipalities;   particularly innovative and pilot implementation measures in the fields of micro-public transport, the funding programme Intermodal Interfaces for Cycling, walking and digitalisation of the transport system;  Raise awareness of healthy active mobility and further improvement of the legal, organisational and economic framework and incentives to increase walking.     Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 110 of 268  Enhancing public transport  In Austria, an average of 14.6% of all roads on an average working day are reserved for public transport. The percentage varies on a local level and increases the higher the population density. The highest proportion of roads reserved for public transport is generally found in urban areas, notably the capital city. The greatest potential for CO2 savings is by switching from private cars to public transport. Public transport has additional potential depending on occupancy rate and also on the use of energy-efficient and alternatively-powered public transport. The highest energy efficiency comes from rail mounted and electrified transport such as public trams, underground and suburban railways in the public transportation network and local and long-distance electrified railways. However, a significant contribution to reducing CO2 emissions from transport can also come from the electrification of public road transport by means of battery-electric buses or trolleybuses.  Rail infrastructure plan for the Austrian Federal Railways network Investments in railway infrastructure in recent years and the railway coverage this has resulted in has made Austria a leader in rail passenger transport in the European Union. Nevertheless, looking towards mobility in the future, additional focus is still needed on enhancing efficient public transport, in addition to making use of the opportunities offered by digitalisation and placing far greater focus on better services.  According to the framework plan of Austrian Federal Railways, current annual investment by the Federal Government of just under EUR 2 billion is set to increase gradually to EUR 2.5 billion over the coming years up until 2030 in order to improve infrastructure.   The objective is the accelerated implementation of the Austrian Federal Railways target network: Increasing resources in comparison to the 2018-2023 framework plan with a view to implementing the 2025+ target network, including some additional measures which are intended to be particularly effective in terms of climate, in particular in metropolitan areas.  Furthermore, swift progress is to be made on work on the 2040 target network, which will form the basis of infrastructure development up to 2040. In this context, special emphasis is to be placed on further development of regular-interval timetables, reducing travel times, ensuring sufficient capacity in metropolitan areas for developing local transport, and improving competitiveness of freight transport.    Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 111 of 268  Providing greater and more attractive mobility options Alongside robust infrastructure which must meet future requirements in terms of both quality and quantity, care must also be taken to simultaneously provide a corresponding range of services. Accordingly, provision of public transport will be gradually increased at federal and provincial level from 2019 to 2029. There are also plans to make accompanying improvements in the provision of long-distance transport. These go hand-in-hand with the planned fleet modernisation which will focus on energy efficiency, accessibility and easy mobility.  Rail transport in Austria is publicly funded (by the Federal Government and provinces), with a few exceptions, e.g. on the western line between Salzburg and Vienna. This takes place by way of transport service contracts with ÖBB-Personenverkehrs AG and private railways. With a view to achieving climate targets, public transport will be more attractively designed, with services being gradually extended and becoming more regular (particularly with the commissioning of new lines) and (e.g. through the use of new vehicles) the quality of service increasing.   prior commitments by the Federal Minister for Transport, Innovation and Technology is approved): On the basis of the Prior Commitment Authorisation Act [Vorbelastungsermächtigungsgesetz], adopted in October 2019, a 37% service increase in the ordered rail capacity (period 2015-2029) is guaranteed.  There are also plans to agree transport service contracts for private railways for the next decade.  Potential funding needs to be clarified for additional orders going beyond this for expansion of local transport services, which are advisable for climate protection reasons, e.g. in order to be able to optimally exploit the potential of new and improved infrastructure.  The aim would be to further develop long-distance, overnight and international transport: In many cases, there is still track capacity available for long-distance transport. Attractive offers can tempt passengers away from air travel, which is particularly harmful for the climate, in addition to the necessary true-cost pricing of air travel.   Enhancing regional public transport In addition to steadily expanding connections across Austria, additional measures are being implemented at federal, provincial and municipal level with a view to improving regional public transport. At federal level, this covers in particular funding for private railways, urban-regional public transport, the expansion of underground rail services and decarbonisation of the vehicle fleet. At provincial and municipal level, a number of projects have been planned for improving Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 112 of 268  both infrastructure and the provision of public transport regionally and in metropolitan areas. From an infrastructure perspective, projects cover the creation of mobility hubs and the extension of regional rail and bus lines. From a service perspective, funding will be provided for regular transport services and micro-public transport. Additionally, the fare structure will be optimised.   Funding for private railways: The objective would be to increase resources for the medium-term investment programme for private railways;  Urban-regional railways: First planned federal subsidy for the creation of tramway and tram-train projects, such as in Linz, Graz and Innsbruck, with an urban-regional impact.    Electrification plan  The intention is to increase the level of electrification of the railways. Electrification of the Austrian Federal Railways network is planned to increase from its current level of 73% to 85% by 2030. In addition to this tried and tested electrification by means of overhead lines, the use of battery technology or fuel cells in conjunction with renewable hydrogen in rail vehicles can be an option for replacing diesel, at least for some regional railways.  New research priority for decarbonising the railways (batteries or fuel cells for traction purposes);  Shunters are sometimes still powered by diesel. By 2025, these will have been replaced by electric vehicles as part of procurement of replacement equipment.  At provincial and municipal level, alternatively powered  and therefore electric  vehicles are increasingly being added to the bus fleet (electric buses, trolleybuses and hydrogen buses).    At municipal level, it will also be possible to make better use of existing instruments. These include, for example, parking regulations as an effective instrument for managing demand for individual means of transport. At provincial level, effective additional measures and instruments will be available, such as spatial/urban planning, housing subsidies and restructuring of the requirement to provide parking spaces.    Increasing the multiplier effects of infrastructure investments by the Federal Government  Particularly with regard to federal investment, there are plans for towns, cities, municipalities and provinces to work together to link federal support measures to the transport requirements of Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 113 of 268  towns, cities, municipalities and provinces. These might include additional demonstrable investment in walking and cycling, or compliance with spatial and traffic planning aspects.     Strengthening cooperation with public transport system partners Investment in infrastructure and services can only have its full impact if people make full use of them. In future, there must therefore be even greater focus on making all public transport more easily accessible and comfortable, something which can only be achieved through improved cooperation between public transport partners. Consequently, work is under way on an Austria-wide fare pricing and sales system for public transport. The system will be of added value to users which complies with data protection laws by means of the interfaces which will be developed. As a result, the potential for synergies and modern services due to increasing digitalisation will lead to better services for the customers and, therefore, increased use.  In addition to numerous improvements in cycling, walking and public transport, there are overarching policy areas which need to be addressed. These include the following policy areas and measures:   The Austria-wide uniform fare pricing and sales system for public transport;  Trialling the introduction of an Austria ticket (general subscription based on the Swiss model);  Other fare-related measures, such as reductions applicable throughout Austria and ongoing fare degression;  Promotion of environmentally friendly travel to major events;  An improved coordination process for public transport crossing regional borders, i.e. between provinces, towns, cities and municipalities.     Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 114 of 268  Mobility management to promote climate-friendly, clean mobility  Mobility management is a key factor in improving the organisation of transport in the home and business environment, in towns and cities and in regions, and makes an important contribution in terms of the change to sustainable mobility and decarbonised transport. Mobility management enables a better choice of eco-friendly transport options, both for commuters and leisure travellers. Mobility management supports the introduction and use of new, eco-friendly technology so that full use can be made of its potential and counter-productive developments can be avoided. Numerous successful measures, taken by the Federal Government through the klimaaktiv mobil towns and cities, municipalities and companies in the area of mobility management and raising awareness can be cited. In future, these must be safeguarded, further developed and strengthened. All Austrian companies, towns and cities, municipalities, regions and other relevant operators in the mobility system will be encouraged to introduce zero-emission sustainable mobility solutions under mobility management schemes and will be supported in the implementation thereof. Changing attitudes towards other modes of transport or mobility patterns in general can make a significant contribution towards acceptance and increased use of public transport, active mobility and new forms of mobility.  An evaluation of the 2013-2020 programme is to be carried out as a basis for further development and for reflection on the strategic orientation, structures, content and previous successes of the klimaaktiv mobil programme. The results of this evaluation, particularly in relation to efficiency and success in ecological and economic terms, are an important basis for the required expansion and reorientation of activities where necessary, which are to be carried out in accordance with the budgetary requirements and with the involvement of the Federal Ministry of Finance.   Comprehensive expansion of the klimaaktiv mobil advisory and funding programmes for mobility management to support Austrian companies, property developers and fleet operators, towns, cities, municipalities and regions, tourism, schools and youth initiatives in developing and implementing climate-friendly, clean mobility projects;  Creating improved frameworks for mobility management at federal, provincial, municipal and company level, with incentives for employees who use climate-friendly mobility to get to work and on business trips (e.g. promoting the use of public transport), for customers and guests, and for zero-emission vehicle fleets and CO2-neutral logistics. The Tax Reform Act 2020 [Steuerreformgesetz] that has been adopted implements additional ecological measures in the area of mobility and introduces the taxation of sustainable fuels. The intention, among other things, is to provide a price signal as early as the point in time of the decision to make the purchase by introducing a registration tax that is dependent on price and emissions (with a tax rate of up to 32% and a penalty for particularly emission-intensive passenger cars). A CO2 component will also be introduced in the area of engine-related insurance tax (current motor vehicle tax), thereby steering a Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 115 of 268  course towards low-emission motor vehicles. In addition, electric bicycles will become eligible for input tax deduction and tax incentives will be provided for biogas, sustainable hydrogen and liquefied natural gas.  ide vehicle parking spaces to multimodal, GHG-saving solutions and regulations (e.g. laws, mobility contracts for companies, property developers and residents focusing on improved public transport and cycling infrastructure connections and services, for e-mobility, bike and e-car sharing, parking space management and eco-driving).  Creating a framework to reduce travel congestion (consistent utilisation throughout the day promotes efficiency, productivity and capacity), e.g. by providing incentives for companies to offer flexible working hours (e.g. home office) and increased flexibility for the start of lessons in educational institutions.  Coordinated communication with the population, companies and institutions in relation to practice-oriented consultancy for introducing zero-emission vehicles under the   Developing measures to increase the car occupancy rate    Spatial planning  The settlement pattern, i.e. the distribution of various land uses has a considerable impact on the transport outlay needed to bring these different uses together. In the past, decision-making processes failed to pay sufficient attention to such links. Spatial development in recent decades has contributed to a significant increase in the distance driven by road traffic, the energy consumption of buildings and, therefore, an increase in CO2 emissions. Consideration is therefore being given to entrenching climate and energy objectives into spatial planning and geospatial plans and programmes. In this way, land use should be steered more strongly towards limiting soil consumption, preventing sealing, and ensuring condensed, compact settlement and commercial development.  Especially in terms of parking space regulations and structuring of housing subsidies, there should in future be more emphasis on proximity to the town centre and public transport development, as well as alternative mobility services.   Entrenching climate and energy objectives into spatial planning in the provinces and into building regulations, zoning and development planning in the provinces, towns, cities and municipalities and implementing spatial energy planning to reduce energy consumption and emissions;  Reform of provincial parking space regulations for climate protection purposes and of Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 116 of 268  mobility-relevant frameworks, such as housing subsidies, in spatial planning, zoning and building regulations;  Optimal accessibility of residential areas and industrial estates for public transport, bicycles and pedestrians, promotion of dense, compact residential areas and housing development as well as location development of commercial and industrial enterprises along public transport corridors to reduce urban sprawl, and measures for upgrading town and city centres;  Promoting the creation of commercial and industrial zones with a connection to the rail network or a combined transport connection.  As part of the next Austrian Spatial Planning Concept (ÖREK 2030), which is currently in development, the role to be played by spatial planning in achieving climate protection objectives and sustainable development goals (SDGs) is to be developed under the motto Raum für Wandel] by the end of 2020, and gradually implemented by the partners of the Austrian Spatial Planning Conference (Federal Government, provinces, association of towns, cities and municipalities, interested parties) in the period 2021-2030.  for the creation of housing in town and city centres (reform of housing subsidies).  Wider application of the grading system for public transport quality in relation to spatial and transport planning;  Safeguarding relevant areas and routes for the future development of climate-friendly mobility and energy infrastructure.  Boosting local provision to promote short routes and environmentally friendly mobility.     Goods transport  In 2016, approximately 38% of all transport-related greenhouse gas emissions were caused by goods transport. Nearly all these emissions are attributable to road freight transported by light and heavy goods vehicles, powered almost exclusively by internal combustion engines.  A central issue when switching freight transport from road to rail is the further development of the infrastructural framework, and establishing true-cost pricing in transport by means of more transparency and internalisation of external costs for competitive rail freight transport. In Austria, this is achieved firstly by building base tunnels, especially on the core network lines of the Trans-European Network, to a large extent with a flat track in order to be able to carry heavier and longer freight trains, and secondly, by creating sufficient capacities for rail freight transport. The Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 117 of 268  upgrading of the western line, the southern line and the Brenner base tunnel are examples of this. Where possible, the Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology is also working intensively to expand access routes to neighbouring countries, particularly on the Brenner corridor with Germany and Italy.  The Federal Government is actively implementing measures to switch freight transport to the environmentally friendly railways as part of the traditional rail freight transport subsidy23 and the subsidy for connecting railways and terminals. Combined with investments in a well-developed infrastructure, these targeted subsidies, amounting to around EUR 120 million annually, have a correspondingly positive impact. In Austria, over 30% of all freight transport, measured in tonne-kilometres, was transported by rail. Austria is therefore among the leaders in this field in the European Union, and the aim is to maintain and further expand this high share of freight transported by rail. The structure of freight transport logistics also plays a key role in achieving climate and energy objectives in urban areas.                                                                           23 Single wagonloads, unaccompanied combined transport, rolling road Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 118 of 268  For this reason, the Federal Government wishes to work with the provinces, towns and cities and  municipalities on the following:  Continue support for multi-modal goods transport hubs in order to switch trans-shipment from road to rail. Developing infrastructure (according to the framework plan of the Austrian Federal Railways) and increasing the efficiency of rail freight transport is a condition for doing so;  Develop measures for making urban logistics environmentally-friendly; the aim is to implement CO2-neutral urban logistics systems by 2030, with a view to making urban logistics systems CO2-neutral by 2050 through a mix of regulatory, logistical, cooperative and technological measures;  Create incentives and guidelines in order to make road transport more environmentally-friendly, as well as switching to eco-friendly transport modes;  Development of a Logistics Action Plan 2.0, to include the following:  Sensing and imaging measures  eFTI  electronic freight transport information  Future-oriented professions (in climate-neutral freight transport)  Location (spatial planning)  New approach to operational aid for connecting railways;  Possible adjustment of the rail freight transport subsidy towards the maximum permitted under EU State aid law, including considering 100% of the difference to the external costs;  Innovation programme for combined transport, including for intermodal transport;  Days of action for combined transport in the provinces;  Continuation of logistics subsidies;  Boost the competitiveness of international rail freight transport by improving cooperation at European and bilateral level (e.g. reduced stopping times at borders).  Promoting the Digital Automatic Coupling (DAC) in European rail freight as a significant factor for the modal shift and climate protection: Increasing capacity by up to 30% with the introduction of ETCS Level 3 (for which DAC offers technical support) and sustainably increasing productivity of rail freight transport, as long processing times and high costs of train composition, shunting and separation by means of manual coupling will be reduced.     Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 119 of 268  Electrification plan (battery-powered, hydrogen, based on renewable energy) for passenger and goods transport  roads and infrastructure  For a clean, safe and affordable transport system, the technology which is used is of particular importance. The cleanest, most efficient technology and transport systems must be introduced, offering a high level of user-friendliness, at a socially and economically acceptable cost. Accordingly, several packages of measures must be implemented as part of an electrification plan, covering new support priorities for vehicles such as electric goods vehicles and electric buses. These will be flanked by a strong infrastructure component (e.g. recharging infrastructure for electric buses) and by continuing the successful support priorities established for electric cars and electric bicycles. The motor vehicle industry will again be involved with promoting electric vehicles by means of the public-private partnership model. Particular emphasis will be placed on promoting e-mobility management, e-logistics and e-fleets in the commercial and municipal sectors. In addition, zero-emissions research is an intended priority in the research, technology and innovation sector. Furthermore, through targeted adaptation of the legal framework, improvements will be made to increase suitability for everyday use and reduce barriers to the use of electric vehicles. This will involve, in particular, establishing incentive systems so that manufacturers more quickly introduce zero and low-emission vehicles onto the market at EU level, introducing incentives for electric vehicle users and modifying housing legislation as soon as possible (potentially as early as the first half of 2020) so that charging points can be fitted in apartment buildings. For new registrations, it is intended that focus will thereby shift to zero-emission cars and light goods vehicles by 2030. The aim is for a significant increase in the number of zero-emission lorries and buses by 2040.     Electrification plan  vehicles   Continuing the purchase bonus for private individuals who switch their vehicles to zero-emission cars, bikes and load-carrying vehicles, as a public-private partnership with the vehicle industry;  Continuing the purchase bonus for companies, provinces and local authorities who switch vehicles, particularly for cars, bikes, e-bikes, buses and goods vehicles, as a public-private partnership with the vehicle industry;  Continuing the focus on promoting e-mobility management, e-logistics and e-fleets (e.g. driving school fleets) in the commercial and municipal sectors (e.g. along with support for switching to zero-emissions taxis  see legal framework);  Switching of driving school training vehicles to zero-emission vehicles.

The starting point of a multimodal hub is usually a public transport stop in the immediate vicinity of which additional mobility services are established. The services can range from the integration of walking and cycling to car sharing, taxi services (including dial-a-ride taxis) or car rental services.  -  Continuing to support the construction of private e-charging stations in apartment buildings;  Continuing to support the construction of e-charging stations, e.g. for employees, customers and guest parking spaces;  Continuing to support the construction of e-charging stations for company vehicles (tradespeople, etc.);  Establishing minimum standards, particularly in relation to infrastructure for e-vehicles and infrastructure for new forms of e-mobility (car sharing) in the vicinity of public railway stations, public transport stops and park-and-ride facilities.

Already implemented (Federal Law Gazette I No 45/2019): From 1 January 2020, a separate tariff group is to be established for vehicles with a maximum permissible weight of more than 3.5 tonnes which are powered solely by electricity or solely by hydrogen fuel cell, for which the lowest tariff shall be set. This lowest tariff will be 50% lower than the highest tariff. Furthermore, there will be no basic per-kilometre charge for traffic-related air pollution set for vehicles powered solely by electricity or solely by hydrogen fuel cell.  Making it easier to construct e-charging stations in apartment buildings by amending   Cold chain logistics infrastructure on motorway and expressway networks: Clarifying that the operation of secondary power sources (diesel, petrol engines) for refrigerating HGVs at rest stops and rest areas during the legally prescribed rest periods constitutes avoidable air pollution, provided that electricity terminals are available at the respective location to supply the refrigerated HGVs with electricity.

New mobility services & experimental spaces   Creating a Car Sharing Preferential Rights Act [Carsharing-Bevorrechtigungsgesetz] to allow public parking spaces to be reserved for commercial operators of station-based car sharing. Creating the opportunity for operating costs for car sharing / rental bicycles / alternative mobility services to be included in Section 28 of the Act on the Ownership of Apartments [Wohnungseigentumsgesetz] (also the Tenancy Act [Mietrechtsgesetz], the Non-profit Housing Act [Wohnungsgemeinnützigkeitsgesetz]). Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 122 of 268   Controlling the use of automated public mobility services as well as automated private transport and consistently steering activities towards achieving climate-related -[Aktionspakets Automatisierte Mobilität];  Continuing the development of smart multimodal traffic management;  Establishing, in particular, legal bases for experimental spaces to use as test areas for innovation and regulation, in order to gain experience under real conditions of new innovation and technologies that are only partially compatible with the existing legal and regulatory framework. Austria needs legal flexibility instruments in order to implement and create experimental spaces, for example in the form of experimental clauses or experimental laws.  (MaaS) with open interfaces to the respective mobility providers;  mbining strong existing public transport services (bus and train) with new, flexible local services (taxi services, e-car sharing, ride sharing and car pools, etc.) as well as digital networking of all mobility services (=MaaS), to form an overall service, an alternative to owning a private car is created. As a result, the occupancy rate of the modes of transport concerned will be significantly increased through use of these new services, if the services are designed accordingly. This will lead to massive CO2 savings which in turn trigger significant positive economic effects.  Further development of public transport services in the municipalities through a clear legal framework for micro-public transport services.     Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 123 of 268  Review of infrastructure projects for compatibility with 2030/2050 climate protection targets  If there is a potential need to revise, modify, reduce or expand the high-level federal transport network as a basis for infrastructure projects with a view to achieving climate protection objectives, it may be necessary to carry out a Strategic Transport Review [Strategischen Prüfungen - Verkehr, SP-V]. In this way, the SP-V can be seen and used as an instrument for an ets in transport (SP-V Act, SP-V Guidelines).  Existing infrastructure is also to be operated in an energy-saving manner. Further savings are planned for the motorway and expressway networks by means of greater energy efficiency (e.g. LED tunnels and outdoor lighting) or through energy generation at motorway maintenance depots, open spaces in the vicinity of motorways and expressways, noise barriers, etc.  Additionally, legal conditions are to be created to allow new access points to park-and-ride facilities and interconnection of road and rail services.  Increased road transport controls  There are plans to increase weight checks for road freight transport. Furthermore, the aim is to move towards ending the scope for technically unnecessary tolerance limits in speed checks.     Inland waterway transport:  A central issue when switching freight transport from road to waterways is the further development of the infrastructural framework for competitive transport of goods via inland waterways:   Providing shore-side electricity supply points at public and private moorings (Danube ports) for river cruise ships and their mandatory use;  Targeting increased competitiveness in inland waterway transport by upgrading moorings so that they can achieve Good Navigation Status in the TEN-T, including shore-side electricity supply for freight transport;  Examining the feasibility of using alternative fuels in inland waterway transport;  Improving fairway conditions west of Vienna, including the technical condition and operation of Austrian locks, in order to achieve Good Navigation Status in the TEN-T;  Improving fairway conditions east of Vienna in order to achieve Good Navigation Status in the TEN-T to the best ecological standards; Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 124 of 268   Continuing the support programme for the use of technologies to reduce GHG emissions in inland waterway transport.    Aviation:   Continuing the support programme for the purchasing of electrically operated ground-service vehicles and for increasing purchases of electrically operated GPUs (Ground Power Units);  Implementing Free Route Airspace to save fuel;  efficiency in vertical flight profiles, resulting in fuel savings and reduction of CO2 emissions.    Further steps in the transport sector  Achieving climate targets is a particular challenge in the transport sector. This makes it all the more important to implement the policies, strategies and measures necessary to achieve these objectives quickly and in a concerted and determined manner, with joint political effort across departmental and local authority boundaries and together with business and society.  Alongside the existing measures, a larger number of other very intensive activities will be required. The politically agreed measures specifically set out in the current National Energy and Verkehrsdiensteverträgen neu] have created the basis for significantly expanding the range of passenger rail services over the next 10 years. Closing the CO2 gap requires not only an investment and support package for climate-friendly mobility, which is associated with considerable positive value creation potential and jobs for Austria, but also significant further steps. This also includes, for example, creating legal and organisational frameworks essential for the achievement of objectives, or also creating public acceptance. The following aspects require special attention from a technical point of view:   Climate targets must be incorporated into all future emissions-related considerations and (political) decisions (mainstreaming), as well as including examination of the impact of infrastructure projects and legal norms on the climate. For the mobility sector in particular, this means that all decisions are to be evaluated according to the principle of -switch-  The economic framework must be adapted in the interests of a successful climate and -Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 125 of 268  incentives. Attention must be paid both to the budgetary implications, micro- and macroeconomic compatibility, and to meeting mobility needs within the population and the economy.  Progress with implementation must be precisely determined and reviewed at regular intervals (e.g. annually). Suitable monitoring as a central component of future processes ensures that adjustments can be made quickly in the event of deviations from the target trajectory. Should the objectives not be reached, readjustment measures must be submitted very promptly.  The measures are to be accompanied, inter alia, by a consistent recycling policy that ensures the long-term and sustainable availability of raw materials. Additionally, there must be a consistent focus on improving energy efficiency in order to be able to meet the demand for renewable energy domestically, as far as (financially) possible. Generally speaking, the mobility transition must be ensured by switching to exclusively renewable energy.  In order to meet these urgent challenges in the transport sector, the Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology, in cooperation with the Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism, the Federal Ministry of Finance, the provinces, cities and municipalities, will launch a follow-- [Vorzeigeregion Österreich  Saubere Mobilität 2030]. This process includes the further development of the transport measures within this National Energy and Climate Plan within the framework of the above-mentioned aspects and should include at least the following elements:   Strategic control by the Federal Government and the provinces;  Joint development of a 2030/2050 target vision compliant with the Paris Agreement in terms of the necessary future infrastructure, technologies, forms of mobility and mobility management etc., based on the respective CO2 targets;  Professional communication and marketing support in developing the target vision and in implementing specific packages of measures;  Joint financing of accompanying measures (including communication and marketing) by the Federal Government and the provinces;  Continuous monitoring and annual reporting on the progress of the implementation  Readjustment mechanism for deviations from the target trajectory;  Developing a uniform GHG and energy efficiency evaluation system at measure level, including providing an adequate modelling database;  Development, agreement and coordinated implementation of specific packages of measures, including definition of areas of responsibility;  Establishing new formats (experimental spaces) and forms of cooperation between the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 126 of 268  public sector, civil society and business (public-private partnerships, green deals);  Developing suitable instruments to increase the competences of local authorities and their political decision-makers;  Using existing cooperation structures (European level, federal government, provinces, towns and cities, municipalities, working groups, science & experts), e.g. in relation to GHG emissions / emission inventories.  Establishing and further developing cooperation with other pioneering countries and regions. Participating in European and international initiatives and involving domestic actors in specific EU missions and partnerships.     Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 127 of 268  Buildings and heating  Between 2005 and 2015, it was possible for greenhouse gas emissions to be significantly reduced. Due to population growth, increasing specific living space and a growing desire for comfort, there has been a sharp rise in the construction of new housing and commercial buildings. At the same time, renovation works have been on the decline. Overall, this has resulted in emission levels stabilising. In order to return to a continuing downward trend in emissions, additional measures strategies adopted by the provinces represent an important cornerstone. Specific measures and and the provinces.  The following priority areas have been earmarked for the building sector:  Construction of new buildings  The technologies are already available to ensure that as far as possible, buildings constructed after 2020 will not require fossil fuels for heating, hot water or cooling. These include, for example, component activation, the active use of hot water storage tanks and the use of buildings as storage tanks for load balancing and load flexibility.  The phasing-out of oil-fired heating systems in new buildings has already been set out in statute. At the end of September 2019, the Austrian National Council passed a federal law prohibiting the fitting of oil-fired boilers in new buildings (Act on the Prohibition of Oil-fired Boilers 2019 [Ölkesseleinbauverbotsgesetz  ÖKEVG ]). This concerns all new buildings, that is to say residential buildings, public buildings and also commercially used buildings.  The thermal quality of buildings constructed after 2020  which will therefore not undergo thorough renovation before 2050  must be raised to cost-optimal level24 in accordance with the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.                                                                         24 More specific details will follow as part of the Heating Strategy 2019 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 128 of 268  Replacement of fossil fuels by renewable energy and efficient district heating (in particular based on renewable energy sources)  s Climate and Energy Strategy (#mission2030), approximately half of the estimated 700,000 oil-fired heating systems currently in use are to be replaced by innovative energy systems powered by renewable energy or efficient district heating (in particular based on renewable energy sources). In this way, it will be possible reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 2 million tonnes per year. This will be achieved through a package of incentives which are yet to be defined, comprising fiscal measures, regulatory provisions and subsidies for cushioning the social impact:  Erneuerbaren Gebot]. The aim of this measure is that by 2021 only heating systems powered by high-efficiency alternative energy sources will be used for replacing liquid fossil fuel-powered boilers. Exceptions to this rule will only be possible if justified.  A further aim is to replace liquid fossil fuel-powered boilers which are over 25 years old with renewable energy sources or district heating as from 2025.  A coordinated mix of instruments will be required in order to move away from liquid fossil fuels. Temporary subsidies which cushion social hardship cases combined with subsidised public advisory services independent of any product, and at the same time the announcement of medium-term regulatory provisions, an increase in the cost of liquid fossil fuels for end consumers and a target of 2040 for phasing out liquid fossil fuel energy sources for heating purposes will help a transition to be brought about as soon as possible. As part of the renovation initiative 2019, the Federal Government in conjunction with the provinces introduced a funding priority to phase out fossil-fuel powered heating systems in residential housing -Raus aus dem Öl-Bonus]). In 2019, EUR -renovation check and thermal renovation measures in buildings used for commercial purposes. This measure helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to implement a sustainable, competitive energy system by increasing the use of renewable energy and -check) supports around 13,000 projects. Around 96,000 tonnes of CO2 can be saved, with an annual final energy saving of around 113,000 MWh expected.   Replacement of fossil natural gas  Where possible, the natural gas grid will no longer be expanded for heating/hot-water purposes. Densification of heating and hot water connections is possible in areas where there is no district heating (if based on renewable energy or coming from high-efficiency cogeneration plants). Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 129 of 268   In the long term, fossil natural gas will be replaced by renewable gases in the gas grid.  The competitiveness of renewable gas is to be promoted by means of tax incentives implemented with the Tax Reform Act 2020 [Steuerreformgesetz].  Fossil natural gas is only to be used in new buildings in duly justified exceptional cases whereby compensatory measures25 would have to be taken.  Consistent and harmonised implementation of the requirements thereby also be gradually replaced by renewable alternatives where reasonable and sensible to do so.  Spatial planning is intended to identify areas with grid-bound energy infrastructure (e.g. district heating areas) as soon as possible/ by 2025.  By 2030, liquid fossil fuels will no longer be used in federal and provincial public buildings (owned and used).    Thermal energy renovation  The Federal Government and the provinces are working together on a definition for the   Based on this definition, the objective is to double the renovation rate for the period 2020-2030. Comprehensive renovation works may also be carried out in stages under multi-annual renovation plans. Given the current decline in renovation works, considerable extra effort and a coordinated mix of measures are required. Cost-optimal levels will apply in any case to renovation (and part-renovation).  Targeted funding for building renovation works in the form of investment grants, subsidised financing models and tax measures, is being examined and implemented. The right mix of measures can ensure an efficient and administratively sound system.  Part-renovation in particular will also be funded, but only if there is an overall thermal-energy renovation plan and the part-renovation works fit into the overall renovation plan. In this way, it will be guaranteed as far as possible that part-renovation works lead to complete renovation.  Regulatory requirements, e.g. socially-responsible renovation requirements and price signals are also under discussion. The possibility of setting price signals is being examined with an overall systematic approach.                                                                        25 More specific details will follow as part of the Heating Strategy Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 130 of 268  Accompanying measures  Alongside these measures, information and awareness-raising activities and consultations (product-independent, funded and public) are planned, energy performance certificates are to be enhanced and data on the building stock and on building conditioning technology will be collected in a structured way (e.g. a building and housing register). A major communications campaign will enable a targeted transfer of knowledge, e.g. by means of model buildings that make different construction concepts and technologies researchable and tangible.  Legal obstacles in housing law (in particular the Act on the Ownership of Apartments and the Tenancy Act) which may impede renovation measures and, inter alia, the construction of solar energy systems (thermal and photovoltaic) and/or e-charging stations must be identified and eliminated.  Spatial planning, housing development and spatial energy planning are covered under the sections on transport and horizontal action areas.  Aspects of building culture, as indicated inter alia in the Federal guidelines on building culture, should be taken into account.  Examination of targeted funding for accompanying services and smaller investment measures (hydraulic balancing, heating system check, renovation schedules/overall renovation concepts, improvement of heat distribution and output, etc.).  There needs to be a targeted qualification for architects, planners and craftspeople in order to create sufficient quantitative and qualitative capacities for the necessary implementation of measures.  sector will lead to a further reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of some 3 million tonnes by 2030 as compared to 2016 (as far as possible, complete decarbonisation of the sector is intended by 2050).     Phasing out of coal-fired power generation Austria has set itself the target of pushing forward with a rapid phase-out of coal-fired power generation. The Dürnrohr power plant, one of the last two remaining coal-fired power plants in Austria, ceased operation in 2019. The last coal-fired power plant in Austria, in Mellach, will be shut down in early 2020. This means that Austria is phasing out coal-fired power generation five years earlier than planned.   Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 131 of 268    Agriculture and forestry  Current climate and energy measures in the agriculture and forestry sector draw on the possibilities provided for under Pillars I and II of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and other national objectives laid down in federal and provincial agricultural law. The Rural Development Programme, which is vital for the implementation of those measures, will be valid until 2020. Support of a competitive, eco-friendly and resource-saving nationwide agriculture based on family farms is a central element of Austrian agricultural policy. The numerous CAP reforms in recent decades have brought the shift towards sustainable agriculture further into focus.  Contribution of the new CAP post 2020 to climate protection  -year programme is expected to start in 2021. The European proposal already clearly shows that there will be even greater focus on environmental and climate protection ambitions. Of a total of nine specific objectives, three have e protection of biodiversity, enhance ecosystem services and presermandatory environmental requirements introduced. In addition, environmental and climate regulations will be implemented more effectively under the first pillar through a new eco-scheme. In order to encourage Member States to make a greater contribution to climate protection in the future, there will be a performance bonus for meeting environmental and climate targets. The planned extension of subsidies should make it easier for the Member States to implement measures in future that are better adapted to country- and site-specific characteristics (and thus also to environmental and climatic conditions). A greater shift towards performance and results orientation and achieving targets is planned as a central element of the new CAP 2020+  the allocation and use of funds will thus be more closely linked to the achievement of objectives than in the past. Although it is not possible to anticipate the current process, it is already clear from strongly towards climate and environmental policy.  Climate protection and climate change adaptation in the CAP 2020+  In May 2019, Austria started to prepare a national strategy plan for the upcoming CAP period. By the end of 2020, the specific interventions (measures) will have been developed by representatives of the Federal Government and the provinces, along with experts and stakeholders. Like all other non-ETS sectors, agriculture will receive a quantitative reduction target (absolute GHG reduction) for the period 2021-2030 as part of an amendment to the Climate Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 132 of 268  Protection Act. A high level of participation in climate-impacting measures in the Rural Development Programme shows that Austrian farmers are already very willing to implement climate and environmental measures. This strength is to be built on in the future.  It must be considered that the CAP has a total of nine objectives of equal weight, which focus on a variety of issues (e.g. supporting young farmers, promoting sustainable farm incomes, employment and growth in rural areas, etc.), and this sometimes limits the scope for action in the agricultural and forestry sector in favour of a single objective. The economic scope for action is also limited on account of the small and medium-sized structure of holdings in Austria and the typical topography of the country (small field sizes, hillside locations, etc.). In the political statement of intent, priority should be given to voluntary measures which, upon raising awareness amongst managers of agricultural and forestry holdings, should be combined with effective content and incentives. It is up to the respective legislative authority to decide when or to what extent federal or provincial rules should deviate from the target trajectory.  The objectives to be achieved and the possible additional measures to be taken in the agricultural sector are set out below. CAP resources will contribute to some of the targets set, although the extent and specific implementation of CAP measures is still to be decided.  Reduction in the use of mineral fertilisers  The demand for mineral fertiliser is to be reduced by 20% by 2030 compared to the use included management and by compensating for the reduced use. There are already some effective ÖPUL measures for this purpose, which are to be further developed and expanded accordingly.   Improve dosing to suit requirements by means of fertiliser planning, soil sampling and Agriculture 4.0, and by greater raising of awareness (building on existing training and advisory services). Reducing losses in mineral and agricultural fertiliser management and increased nitrogen efficiency;  Legislation under the Austrian nitrate action programme will provide additional approaches;  Further development and expansion of the ÖPUL measures, which  will contribute to a reduced use of nitrogen mineral fertilisers, e.g. total elimination of mineral fertilisers on the entire farm (including organic). Furthermore, growing pulse crops can fix air nitrogen and thus reduce the purchase of mineral fertiliser.  Further reduce soil erosion and nitrogen losses (e.g. catch crops, environmentally friendly crop rotations, mulch and direct sowing);  Aim to generally reduce the use of fertilisers, inter alia by specific measures in areas with an increased load or risk situation. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 133 of 268     Reduction of nitrogen excretion  Nitrogen excretion from cattle (except cows), pigs and chickens is to be reduced by 5% by 2030 optimising of feed rations and feed quality, because the less excess nitrogen is included in feed, the less potential there is for GHG emissions.   Expansion of needs-not give them excess quantities of nitrogen);  Improve the quality of basic feed for cattle;  Provision of emission-reducing feed additives;  Raising awareness (educational and advisory services);  Breeding progress (objective: lifetime yield);  Increasing the lifetime yield of dairy cows through increased training and information measures;  Promoting marketing opportunities for old cattle  using an animal for longer leads to reduced emissions, but requires that meat from older cattle be sold on the market (e.g. fattening cull cows).    Increase in grazing of dairy and suckler cows  Grazing involves the separate excretion of faeces and urine and thus a faster infiltration of urea into the soil, resulting in lower GHG and ammonia emissions. Grazing also uses feed with a lower nitrogen content. In addition, grazing is particularly beneficial from an animal welfare perspective.   Further development and expansion of support for the grazing of animals under the agri-environmental programme ÖPUL, inter alia through a gradual extension of the grazing period (e.g. 60, 120, 150 grazing days);  Raising awareness (educational and advisory services).    Increase in farm manure fermentation  Agriculture can make a decisive contribution to the energy transition by fermenting more agricultural residues and waste materials for biomethane production in the future. If farm manure Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 134 of 268  is fermented, not only can energy from fossil fuels be replaced, but GHG emissions from storage of farm manure can also be saved. The aim is that fermentation residue is then widely spread close to the ground, as far as technically possible (hillside locations, field size) in order to enhance the GHG reduction effect. The ambitious goal is therefore to increase the share of national farm manure fermented in biogas plants to 30% (it is currently around 1%). Alongside the measures in the Renewable Energy Expansion Act, which have an impact in this area, the following measures are also possible:   Identifying locations for the construction of biogas plants with suitable framework conditions (suitable livestock or raw material supply, short distances, possibility of feeding into the gas grid);  Appropriate incentives in energy price regulations (e.g. slurry bonus) and for raw materials management of agricultural residues;  Incentives for cooperation between farm holdings, e.g. linking biogas production and fixed farm manure deposits;  Raising awareness (educational and advisory services);  Research in the field of substrate use and plant technology.    Maintaining a stable cattle population from 2025 onwards  The cattle population in Austria has been falling since 1990. Although an increasing global demand for animal products and higher contribution margins for farmers are anticipated, both past developments and current production conditions in Austrian agriculture make an increase in cattle stocks unlikely. Difficulties in animal production include competition on the global market (potentially also increased market pressure from Mercosur in the future) and challenges in (re)construction of livestock buildings (constructional requirements in the areas of animal, environmental and emission protection, high costs, complaints from neighbours, logistical challenges, etc.). Furthermore, as a result of breeding progress it is possible to achieve the same will be able to resume operations. The small-structured family farms in Austria which keep livestock are often an unattractive prospect for offspring in terms of money and employment (migration to cities, increase in part-time farms). It is doubtful that a global increase in demand for meat and milk alone would lead to rising cattle numbers in Austria. It is considered more realistic to maintain a constant cattle population.   Implementing site-adapted, area-based livestock farming with due regard for animal welfare (and thus maximum moderate density of livestock);  Decline in demand due to ongoing changes in nutritional and consumer habits, greater awareness of quality and values, reduction in meat consumption; Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 135 of 268   Reducing food waste through appropriate design of the food supply chain (policy frameworks, legislative adjustments, process optimisation, changing behavioural and consumption patterns in society, research, promotion, technology). Extending the action Lebensmittel sind kostbar!] into a national strategy;  Breeding progress, which could lead to the same production volumes from a reduced number of animals.    Use of renewable energy sources in agriculture  Fossil fuels used in agriculture are to be gradually replaced by renewable energy sources by 2030, while maintaining an economically and ecologically sustainable framework.   In particular, using damaged wood from forestry to produce Fischer-Tropsch diesel for use in tractors up to an extent of 50% of the technical potential by 2030;  Electrifying applications near farms and stationary applications by means of technical advancement;  In general, the aim is to increase energy efficiency in the agricultural sector through advisory and technical measures in the rural development programme.    Other approaches beyond primary agricultural production   Improving technology and raising awareness to prevent waste or unused residues along the value-added chain, especially in agricultural production;  Implementing the national plant- and animal-based protein strategy by offering suitable, climate-friendly measures to support the on-farm production of animal feed and protein plants, and to reduce climate-damaging imports of such products;  Impact of food consumption in cooperation with the processing and trade sectors on seasonal availability from domestic production, possibly by appropriate labelling.    Land use, land use change and forestry  With the adoption of the EU Regulation on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and first time emissions and carbon sequestration from the land use sector will be accounted for as from 2021 and, subject to certain restrictions, will be offset against national effort sharing targets. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 136 of 268   WArticle 4 of the LULUCF Regulation is complied with until 2030.  In the forestry sector, priority will be given above all to the following measures:   Continuously increase timber harvesting in accordance with the basic principles of sustainable forest management;  Preserving the carbon pool in forest floors and in biomass through sustainable forest management and, where appropriate, continuously increasing forest growth with a view to improving carbon sequestration in forest stands;  Creating appropriate conditions for an increase in domestic wood use for material purposes (e.g. building regulations) and for wood to be an optimal substitute for non-sustainable raw materials;  Creation of appropriate conditions for an increase in the use of domestic wood biomass for energy production (e.g. green electricity follow-up tariffs), taking into account the air pollution control requirements;  Focusing the future forest support -for use  within the framework of the reference level for forest management according to the LULUCF Regulation;  Continuinenergieholz] programme and similar programmes as part klimaaktiv climate protection initiative;  Encouraging forests to adapt to climate change, with the aim of increasing their resilience to extreme weather conditions and maintaining and improving the functionality of forests for society;  Planting site-adapted and high-performing tree species as part of sustainable forest management to achieve a high level of CO2 binding, to create stable forest ecosystems and to produce large quantities of wood for material-rich and energy purposes;  Conserving forests, particular in sparsely forested areas.    In the agricultural sector, the focus will be above all on measures which support targeted creation and preservation of humus in both conventional and organic farming (see humus formation measures of ÖPUL 2015). A further aim is to encourage the preservation of agricultural land (arable and grassland) and its productivity in order to ensure sustainable management. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 137 of 268   As there is often a close link between measures to reduce emissions and measures for adapting to the climate crisis, especially in agriculture and forestry, implementation must be carried out in line with the recommendations for action agreed in the Austrian Adaptation Strategy.     Waste management  By avoiding food waste and taking a more responsible approach to food, emissions reductions will not only be possible in waste management but also in upstream processes (farming, waste by raising awareness, to increase the amount of food fit for consumption that producers or traders offer social welfare organisations, to optimise all stages where value is added and to promote research activities to optimise processing and production methods, which are also adopted and supported by the bioeconomy strategy.  By developing projects and networks which increase the useful life of a project (for example repair networks, repair cafes or RE-USE projects), this will help to reduce waste and promote the circular economy.  Biogenic waste will be treated in composting plants according to the latest low-emission operating techniques, but only where the compost produced can demonstrably be used to improve the soil and replace mineral fertilisers. Examining the extent to which the guidelines on the latest composting techniques and standards on IPPC composting systems have been implemented in accordance with the new BREF document, and making specific adjustments to these, where appropriate, to comply with requirements, will exploit all potential for improvemen-friendly composting will also be improved through advice on garden composting at home.  Biogenic waste without appropriate quality or recycling possibilities should primarily be used to generate energy. The economic viability of turning biogas into biomethane will be improved, e.g. by making it easier to feed it into the natural gas grid where technically and economically feasible to do so. Agricultural or chemical recycling possibilities must be sought for the residual materials following energy recovery.  When entering waste into landfill, the specific requirements of the Landfill Ordinance 2008 [Deponieverordnung] must be consistently implemented as regards reducing residual emissions. This applies in particular to the regular maintenance, repair and, where necessary, restoration of technical equipment for capturing and treating gas released from landfill (ensuring the gas capture systems function properly during the entry and after-care phase), controlling the water Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 138 of 268  balance by means of an optimal surface cover design and, if necessary, irrigating or accelerating the reduction of residual emissions which can no longer be used or eliminated through measures for aerobic in situ stabilisation adapted to individual cases.  increase the share of recovered renewable energy will increase the share of municipal waste which is recycled, in particular waste from plastic packaging. Measures for implementing this are currently under discussion. In order to reduce the number of disposable plastic products, Austria introduced a ban on the marketing of disposable plastic carrier bags from 1 January 2020. Moreover, implementation of Directive (EU) 2019/904 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment will also be necessary. Austria plans to implement the recycling package together with this Directive by means of an amendment to the Waste Management Act 2002 [Abfallwirtschaftsgesetz, AWG]. In addition, there are amendments to the Packaging Ordinance 2014 [Verpackungsverordnung], the Battery Ordinance [Batterienverordnung] and the End-of-Life Vehicles Ordinance [Altfahrzeugeverordnung]. The Austrian Ordinance on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment [Elektroaltgeräteverordnung] has already been amended (Federal Law Gazette II 137/2019) and already contains implementation elements.     Fluorinated gases  EU law in the area of fluorinated gases is primarily to be implemented by way of Regulation (EU) No 517/2014, in particular by means of enforcement measures in line with the system of indirect federal administration. In particular, measures will be taken in cooperation with customs authorities to combat illegal trade in fluorinated gases and equipment filled with fluorinated gases and to ensure compliance with the EU quota system. In the building sector, demand for cooling during the summer needs to be reduced (thermal renovation and efficiency standards for new buildings). Support will be possible under the funding policy in place for phasing out the use of fluorinated gases with a high global warming potential (GWP) (e.g. refrigeration and air-conditioning units) at an earlier stage.   It will also be ensured (e.g. through contact with trade associations in the refrigeration and air conditioning industry and providing information about new refrigerants) that Austrian companies or persons working at such companies have knowledge available to them regarding alternative refrigerants and working with such refrigerants.     Horizontal action areas  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 139 of 268  Bioeconomy Bioeconomy is an economic concept which aims to replace fossil fuel resources (raw materials and energy sources) with sustainable raw materials in as many areas and applications as possible. It covers all industrial and economic sectors that produce, handle, process or use biological resources. In order to move towards achieving a knowledge-based bioeconomy with the involvement of the relevant stakeholders and using the full range of policy instruments, as part of #mission2030 the Federal Government committed to creating an Austrian bioeconomy strategy. This Austrian bioeconomy strategy will be an essential cornerstone of the climate and energy strategy and will support the decarbonisation of the economic system. Around 60 fields of action have been identified in total and have already been adopted by the Federal Government in the bioeconomy strategy.  The bioeconomy strategy identifies fields of action in all sectors, for which specific measures will be discussed in order to meet the defined goals of the strategy. For this purpose, following adoption of the strategy in March 2019, a series of workshops were held with stakeholders throughout Austria, in order to further promote the bioeconomy concept and work on specific bottom-up measures.  The aim is to complete a bioeconomy action plan by the end of 2019. For the best possible implementation of bioeconomy, it is necessary to create a mix of measures at all levels. Specific measures relating to bioeconomy which have already been implemented include, for example: the newly created Bioeconomy Centre at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, -fossil energy sources in the construction sector.     Land use and land take  Use of land resources is an important long-term factor in terms of achieving climate goals and making economical use of energy resources. In Austria, 12.9 ha of land is newly taken every day (2015-17 average). Land being newly taken for construction, commercial and transport purposes across many municipalities of Austria is increasing urban sprawl, thereby leading to significant under the Sustainable Development Strategy of 2.5 ha per day.  Consequently, it is essential for land take to follow more of an approach towards actually limiting development. Urban regeneration also has positive socio-political effects. Land must be developed in coordination with catchment areas for public transport stops and promote the best possible mix of functions such as housing, work and recreation. Spatial planning helps to reverse the rising trend in the distance being travelled by road, and thus the corresponding increase in CO2 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 140 of 268  emissions seen in the mobility sector in recent years.  A major concern for Austria is to reduce or stop urban sprawl. To address this it is essential for buildings to be constructed within existing settlement structures, for settlement areas to have a functional mix and for those areas to be served by public transport. Building regulations and parking space regulations are further important factors in making mobility climate-friendly.  Furthermore, greater use will be made of support for housing construction and other investment management instruments for settlement development purposes and energy spatial planning. This should be done during future negotiations between local authorities.  Energy spatial planning Energy spatial planning is an integral part of spatial planning which comprehensively addresses the spatial side of energy consumption and energy supply.  Forward-looking energy spatial planning which is coordinated at an inter-regional level, especially with regard to large infrastructure projects, leads to a reduction in potential for conflict and therefore greater acceptance among the public.  Energy spatial planning in particular enables innovative energy concepts to be implemented focusing on locally available and cheaper renewable energy, use of waste heat and integrated mobility systems. Analysis and localisation of energy consumption, energy storage and transport, and the potential for energy-savings and recovery, offers vital insight into these areas from a spatial perspective with a view to climate-friendly planning.  Modern, integrated energy concepts in spatial planning can be used to make decisions on land allocation, investment in infrastructure and the allocation of funding, such as support for housing construction. It is also important for energy spatial planning to be enshrined in spatial planning laws and provincial building regulations. Successful examples of this already exist.  Supplying buildings and businesses with efficiently generated district heating will continue to play an important role in the future, in particular in metropolitan areas. Feed-in of waste heat from the plants where it is produced is also of major importance alongside the generation of energy from various renewable sources (biomass, geothermal, solar thermal, photovoltaic, wind, etc.) and highly efficient cogeneration. Austria is still far from fully exploiting its potential in this area. In future, increased incentives will be offered for using waste heat by way of energy spatial planning instruments.  Climate and energy model regions and smart cities  for which support is granted under the Climate and Energy Fund  are successfully demonstrating these new systems and technologies in real-world conditions so that the transformation of energy and mobility systems can be brought onto the market quickly. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 141 of 268   To improve coordination between the parties involved in spatial planning  in particular the provinces  and energy experts and regional development services, the ÖREK (Austrian Spatial Development Concept) energy spatial planning partnership II was established in 2018. Work on implementing priority action recommendations and on applying and developing the energy spatial planning instruments which already exist will be carried out by the Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism as lead partner.     ii. Regional cooperation in this area (where applicable)  During the process of drawing up the draft National Energy and Climate Plan, regional Hungary, Slovenia and Italy, as well as with Poland, Croatia and Belgium. As part of this, the majority of Member States, including Austria, have chosen to invite each other to cooperation meetings. Each of these meetings saw several Member States come together to inform one another of the contents of their respective draft NECPs and to identify possible connecting factors enabling closer cooperation.  For further details, also see point 1.4, Regional cooperation     iii. (National and EU) financing measures, where applicable  To implement the planned measures under the National Energy and Climate Plan, there will be considerable need for investment, which must equally comprise contributions from public authorities (Federal Government, provinces, EU) and the private sector within the meaning of the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement (in particular Article 2.1.c PA). The auction of certificates in the EU Emission Trading Scheme generates income for Member States which may constitute a significant source for financing climate protection measures. The overall investment volume ultimately expected for achieving the targets is decisively determined by the assumed mix of regulatory, support and tax measures. The cost-effectiveness of the climate- and energy-relevant support landscape has an equally determining effect on investment as the expected effect of regulatory plans and/or the degree of effectiveness of new instruments (e.g. in the area -relevant financing flows, but can also constitute directly relevant contributions to adhering to the Energy Union objectives.  In light of the objective of budgetary sustainability, accompanying counter-financing strategies must be developed for the period 2021-2030. A process for identifying and gradually removing counter-productive incentives and subsidies is an important cornerstone of the strategic Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 142 of 268  accompanying measures for achieving objectives in a budget-friendly way. Last but not least, the coherence of the future shape of the European Union's multi-annual financial framework and relevant provisions of EU law with the objectives of the Energy Union also represents a relevant cost factor.  Austria will therefore focus on the following issues at both international and national level:  International and European level:   General support for the work at European level to implement the measures proposed by the European Commission as part of the Action Plan for a Sustainable Financial System of March 2018;  Rapid conclusion of the ongoing co-and the associated delegated acts; intensive involvement at expert, Member State   Finalising the work relating to the supervision of financial markets on risk identification and measurement of climate change-related risks;  the achievement of the Paris climate targets;  Promoting work on sustainable finance within the framework of the Capital Market Union));  climate targets.

Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 144 of 268  3.1.2. Renewable energy   i. Policies and measures to achieve the national contribution to the binding 2030 Union target (including sector- and technology-specific measures where appropriate)    Renewable Energy Expansion Act  Austria requires an energy system that is secure, sustainable, innovative, competitive and, consequently, affordable. There are considerable opportunities and challenges presented by consistently pursuing the 100% target, to which the Renewable Energy Expansion Act will make a significant contribution. Building on the Green Electricity Act 2012, which is responsible for some 17.3 percentage points of the approximately 73% of renewable energy in Austria, the new rules will continue developing the system in a positive way. Consequently, the aim of the   This omnibus Act comprising several articles is scheduled to enter into force in 2020 and will lay down the framework for expanding renewable electricity generation and introducing renewable gases into our energy system at a far quicker rate. In addition to adapting renewable electricity generation and therefore the Green Electricity Act 2012 to EU state aid rules, measures will be established for expanding and better incorporating renewable energy which will be dependent on the recast of the European Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (Renewable Energy Directive 2018) but also, in particular, on ambitious national targets.  An accompanying integrative approach aimed at achieving decentralised power generation in renewable energy communities, necessary sector coupling, integration of storage technologies and the use of digitalisation, and for which network infrastructure needs to be developed further, is dependent on parallel adjustments being made on a number of other legal issues:  In order to develop the necessary market structure, the Electricity Industry and Organisation Act 2010 and the Gas Act 2011 will be revised. In terms of sectoral coupling, it is necessary not only to consider interface issues in other areas, such as heating, mobility and energy efficiency, but also to lay the foundations for linking these areas which were previously partly considered in isolation. Furthermore, issues such as heating and measures needed in the area of transport and energy efficiency must be addressed primarily through additional legislative initiatives.  The development of an integrated network infrastructure plan should also be mentioned. On the one hand, the Energy Intervention Powers Act (EnLG 2012) transposes EU rules, such as in particular the Regulation concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply. On the other hand, modifications and information coming from experience with ongoing processes are Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 145 of 268  being taken into account in order to maintain the high level of supply security in Austria.     System responsibility From a systemic perspective, the two regulatory areas of financing and aid processing  as previously enshrined in the Green Electricity Act 2012  need to be supplemented in particular by the principle of system responsibility, which is gaining in importance as a result of the expansion of volatile forms of energy generation:  a. Direct or own-marketing of renewable electricity At present, renewable electricity must be taken from the settlement centre, irrespective of the time, and may therefore be fed into the grid by producers at any moment, even at negative prices. In future, a self-marketing principle will apply to larger, renewable energy generation installations. This is intended to create incentives for exploiting opportunities in new market segments with innovative partners and technology, and covers, for example, local energy communities and energy balancing and reserve markets. In this way, the grid load will be reduced and therefore the cost of operating the grid. At the same time, supply security will also be increased.  If renewable energy generation installations are cleared for direct and self-marketing, operation on all segments of the electricity market should be possible. In addition to general electricity trading, this applies in particular to the balancing and reserve market and subsequently to mechanisms for securing the grid reserve. Operating exclusions and market entry barriers such as pooling factors should be eliminated as far as possible or tailored to new entrants onto the market.  Small-scale producers are not required to operate on the market but are able to do so. In future, the settlement cendelivered by small-scale producers and enable them to obtain representative market prices, but would be available on the direct marketing segment and, therefore, to larger installations, in the event of unpredictable transactions (bankruptcy, etc.). In this way, firstly the transformation of the system would be supervised and secondly no renewable energy would be lost.  In order to qualify for support, facility operators must, in return, guarantee at an early stage that the principles of controllability and adjustability are observed by grid operators in order to optimise the system as a whole. Installations covered by existing funding agreements which currently do not provide for or may even forbid market operation, should also be helped to switch to this new system.  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 146 of 268  b. Renewable energy communities (see also point 3.2, sub-point viii) As part of the further development of Section 16a of the Electricity Industry and Organisation Act 2010, which first permitted in 2017 that energy-generating installations in renewable energy communities could form part of a single property, renewable energy communities must be established in accordance with the Renewable Energy Directive 2018. These communities enable bilateral supply contracts to be set up and, likewise, cooperative-type structures for the generation, storage and supply of renewable electricity, even beyond property boundaries. In so doing, it is possible to set up and operate local grid structures (microgrids) cost-effectively.  So that disincentives are not introduced  meaning the creation of unnecessary grid structures in parallel to grids which have already been set up and financed  appropriate options must be made available when further developing existing tariff systems for renewable energy communities and the financing mechanisms behind them. This must be ensured, for example, by means of local tariffs or corresponding rolling cost models in the system fee structure. Regionalisation and decentralisation of renewable electricity generation, taking advantage of will also improve supply security and the robustness of the system in general.  During the conception and design phase, the following parameters for the concrete implementation of renewable energy communities in a national context became apparent:   Renewable energy communities must be organised as associations, cooperatives or other partnerships with legal personality.  The members and the general conditions of membership comply with the requirements of the Renewable Energy Directive 2018.  In order to meet the proximity criterion of the Renewable Energy Directive, in the electricity sector the consumption systems of the members or shareholders must be connected to the generation installations of the community by means of a low-voltage galvanically connected distribution network in the same network area.  The main focus is common use of the energy produced.  With regard to the grid costs to be paid, the Electricity Industry and Organisation Act 2010 creates a basis for the adoption of a pro rata preferential grid tariff for shared use of the   It is envisaged that communities will have access to the new support system.  Tax relief for energy produced and consumed by photovoltaic systems within a community was adopted in the Electricity Tax Act.  By the end of 2022, the responsible ministry is to prepare an analysis of existing obstacles and development potential of renewable energy communities outside the electricity Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 147 of 268  sector.  Regarding the framework for self-consumption of energy from renewable sources within the meaning of Article 21 of the Renewable Energy Directive, it should be noted that several measures have already been taken to promote self-consumption with the amendment of the Green Electricity Act in 2017:   The share of self-consumption is the ranking criterion for applications for operational subsidies. The average level of self-consumption was 42% in 2018.  The investment support for photovoltaics was extended to include storage technologies.  The introduction of community energy generation facilities in Section 16a of the Electricity Industry and Organisation Act 2010 enables several parties within an apartment building or business premises to come together and jointly operate a generation facility and jointly use the energy generated for the community according to a self-selected key. Intra-community energy flows do not qualify as supply and are not subject to any duties or charges.  Apart from this, there has been tax relief available since 2014 for electricity generated from renewable energy sources and self-consumed up to an amount of 25,000 kWh. The tax relief  mentioned above and already adopted  also applies to energy generated and consumed within community energy generation facilities pursuant to Section 16a of the Electricity Industry and Organisation Act 2010.   c. Integrated grid infrastructure plan (see also point 3.4.2, sub-point i) A coordinated, integrated grid infrastructure plan will be drawn up with the involvement of the provinces and municipalities (taking into account spatial-planning concerns, etc.). For this to be done, legal amendments to the Electricity Industry and Organisation Act 2010 and the Gas Act 2011 will also be required.  d. Grid reserve and demand-side measures In future, grid reserve will be enshrined in the Electricity Industry and Organisation Act 2010. Units of grid reserve will be reduced to 250-500 kW so that smaller renewable generation units and -aggregated dispatch from decentralised structures by means of pooling.  e.  by means of biomethane from biogenic residue, hydrogen and other renewable gas production Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 148 of 268  methods (synthetic methane, etc.). Under the Renewable Energy Expansion Act, feed-in of renewable gas into the natural gas distribution system will be encouraged, for example by means of a  potentially gradual  quota system.  Feeding in gas rather than generating electricity from biomethane, as enshrined in the last amendment of the current Green Electricity Act 2012, makes the overall system more robust at the interface between electricity and gas. This is because the gas grid itself can act as a storage facility as it does not depend on absolute temporal synchronisation between generation and consumption as in the electricity system.  In order to guarantee the quality of renewable gases and its provision in the necessary quantities of origin must be transformed in an evolutionary manner. Not least as a requirement for transposing the Renewable Energy Directive 2018, guarantees of origin must be established not only for electricity and gas but also for heating and cooling.  The Renewable Energy Expansion Act will lay down that on the basis of certain criteria gas grid operators will have to take over parts of subsequent investments in renewable gas generation installations. The aim is for renewable gases to be produced locally and be fed directly into the natural gas grid. The sustainability of renewable gases will be governed by guarantees of origin.  As regards hydrogen and renewable gases in general, powers to regulate will be conferred based on the Renewable Energy Expansion Act 2020 which will allow an incorporation rate no greater than the level provided for in the applicable standard of the Austrian Association for the Gas and Water Industries (n.b. ÖVGW G 31).  The scope of the Mineral Raw Materials Act is to be extended to cover mining-related aspects of synthetic gas production in geological structures.  The long-term storage of electricity using hydrogen should be enabled and encouraged. It therefore is to be examined whether future investments related to the hydrocarbon industry (e.g. power-to-gas) can be taken into account when calculating the subsidy interest (Mineral Raw Materials Act).  To avoid promoting fossil fuels and to provide legal certainty for investors, hydrogen  and similarly biogas and any other renewable gases  should be classified under the Natural Gas Tax Act as part of the Tax Reform Act 2020, and included for tax relief.  f. Digitalisation potential and system support measures In conjunction with measures under the Renewable Energy Expansion Act 2020 and the Electricity Industry and Organisation Act 2010, installation and operating conditions and the general user-friendliness of storage facilities and recharging infrastructure relating to the expansion of Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 149 of 268  renewable energies should to be optimised.  This work will ensure the best possible controllability and adjustability of decentralised smaller and medium-sized storage facilities, particularly in the interests of supporting the system. System services would also be possible through recharging points, i.e. through vehicle batteries themselves. This would enable grid load to be optimised and the development of sustainable mobility to move ahead.     Support scheme  The existing support for green electricity will be overhauled as from 2020 so that more renewables can benefit from support and, at the same time, more electricity will be produced cost-effectively for every euro of funding. Even more than before, renewables will be made fit for the market and the market fit for renewables. This will be done through market premiums, investment support and, where appropriate, tenders. Funding efficiency will be optimised and adaptation of the electricity market, e.g. through new storage technologies, digitalisation or decentralisation will be increasingly required. By redesigning the support scheme, renewable electricity generation will become more easily integrated into the market. At the same time, a positive climate for investment (due to legal certainty and predictability) will be ensured and administrative obstacles removed.  Transformation processes applying workable solutions should accompany the transition from the old support scheme to the new support scheme, particularly for carrying out projects which are well into maturity.  a. Basic instruments  market premiums and investment support The transition from the current tariff support system and isolated (or in combination) investment subsidies to a market-driven and competitive support system will be rolled out under the Renewable Energy Expansion Act. It will build on market premiums and investment support and, where appropriate, include competitive and non-competitive tendering models.  The operational support variant, to be implemented in future as a market premium, is intended to have a 20-year term, as compared to the current situation. The specific basis in the sense of the average market price from a technology-based perspective and the exact conditions of the respective tenders are to be laid down in regulations.  The basic requirements for accessing funding will only change compared to the current situation where necessary based on previous experience. Pre-qualification and basic criteria in terms of predictability and legal certainty will therefore remain unchanged where possible or be subtly adapted or expanded. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 150 of 268   Despite the existence of funding, it must be ensured that through the transition to self or direct marketing, every provider is able to participate in the market in a way which is economically acceptable. Moreover, the aim of cost-efficiency will be achieved through tenders with the highest possible number of providers. Under these conditions, it is possible for producers to take responsibility for their product as market operators (price volume, energy balancing and reserve cost risk, grid services, etc.) and for support costs to be kept close to the economic optimum in a way which can be predicted. Consequently, despite the increased market risk posed by companies producing renewable energy, the standard for increasing technological leadership and implementing innovations in this area can be raised as much as possible.  Renewable electricity generation installations with a capacity limit of less than 250 kW qualify in principle for possible investment support. Any funding volumes, as with operational support, must be laid down in a regulation.  b.  -scale storage programme is intended to encourage private individuals and businesses to make greater use of roof areas for photovoltaic modules. Moreover, focus will implicitly be on a combination of solar panels and storage by applying a self-supply rate as a ranking criterion for investment support.  In future, buildings will not only have high energy standards but, in particular, will play an active role in providing energy and storing it for self-consumption purposes. To do so, the best possible use will be made of usable areas (on the roof and façades) of buildings (in particular new and renovated buildings) for installations and integrated solar panels. Increasing the number of solar panels in conjunction with storage technology, particularly in buildings, will also help to systematically reduce the pressure on the distribution and transmission network.  Abolishing the tax on self-produced electricity: Currently, the first 25,000 kWh of self-produced electricity is exempt from tax. As such, small-scale producers (private and smaller companies) currently benefit from tax relief. Commercial operators and private individuals will make more use of photovoltaic modules on their rooftops in order to produce energy. The tax on self-produced electricity was abolished as part of the reform of the tax system. This decision gives a tax advantage for energy produced and consumed by PV installations within a community.  By removing barriers to investment under legislation on residential buildings and installations, the role of buildings as platforms for generating energy will be supported. This includes, inter alia, amending the conditions under residential civil law on the use of shared photovoltaic systems.  c. Photovoltaics in general or on construction sites and on land In principle, photovoltaic systems on buildings and built structures should be given priority so that Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 151 of 268  other uses are not prevented on valuable land, in particular arable land and grassland. In addition to exploiting fallow land, land on commercial sites constitutes space which is similarly identified programme, another priority will be to develop larger photovoltaic systems, especially those using innovative solutions on land. With the experience gained in 2018 from awarding funding, it is possible to envisage extending the new system to sites used for landfill (and transport). Discussions are focusing on potentially extending the system further to include traffic embankments, noise protection walls, landfill sites and all types of industrial and commercial premises. As a strong incentive for installing solar panels in these areas, large photovoltaic systems with a capacity of 250 kW or more will also in principle be able to participate in tenders as an alternative to investment support.  d. Existing installations In principle, renewable energy generation installations, from solar panels to biomass plants, will continue to contribute towards the 100% renewable electricity target and towards a renewable heating supply. In particular, this covers existing wind and hydroelectric installations, and high-efficiency biomass plants in agriculture and industry. Land and resource take is minimised by retaining existing high-efficiency plants, thereby transforming the energy system in an environmentally-friendly way.  As such, biomass plants expiring in 2020 or later will be provided with a succession plan following the principles of the new support system. This will guarantee continued support for high-efficiency biomass plants when green electricity procurement and purchase contracts with such plants have expired.  In terms of modernising wind turbines, previous investments in existing sites will be maintained and can continue to be used, where technically and economically feasiby increasing output volume will therefore be possible. By participating in tenders, projects which can be carried out at existing locations will be able to benefit from market premiums.  For environmental reasons, revitalisation is also the preferred option for hydropower. This will need to be provided for accordingly in the support scheme.  Existing installations will be able to optionally switch to self-marketing. This will offer operators of such installations new opportunities and flexibility. Changes would involve extending the contract period to a maximum of 20 years and enabling operators to engage in direct or self-marketing in all market segments.  e. New (biogas and biomass) installations dependent on raw materials In order to meet the 100% renewable electricity target, high-efficiency cogeneration technology (CHP plants) based on solid biomass will also play a role in future. Such installations can play a Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 152 of 268  stronger role than in the past by helping to maintain the electricity and heating supply in metropolitan areas, in particular by helping to support the (electricity) grid, for example through bottleneck management and generally through energy balancing and reserves by means of market mechanisms.  To that end, a separate technology-specific tender for awarding market premiums to solid biomass installations will be held. In terms of biogas plants, the system launched under the 2017 amendment to the Green Electricity Act 2012 will be systematically developed, particularly in line -based and biogas-based energy generation technology, the approach to raw materials will have to be adapted, whether relating to the generation of renewable electricity or renewable gas. In general, an approach which considers waste or residue and by-product recycling should be taken so that the proportion of sustainable biomass plants can continue to be operated. In connection therewith, the aim of flagship project 5 (renewable heating) under #mission2030 is to implement measures with a view to more renewable energy in the heating sector, e.g. development of biomass, solar thermal, heat pumps, micro-CHP, etc. Optimal use of existing high-efficiency installations using the intended raw material mix  as described  is to be laid down as a principle so as to encourage transforming the energy system in an environmentally-friendly way.  e.1 Biomass Funding Enabling Act [Biomasseförderungs-Grundsatzgesetz]  In view of the expiry of many biomass funding agreements, green electricity plants based on solid contribution towards 100% (nationally balanced) renewable electricity. In order to prevent this from happening, a follow-up tariff regulation based on the principles of the Green Electricity Act 2012 was enacted in May 2019 as the Biomass Funding Enabling Act. The scope of application of the Biomass Funding Enabling Act extends to all solid biomass-based green electricity plants which have a funding agreement at the feed-in tariff under the Green Electricity Act 2012 which expires between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019. A maximum subsidy period of 36 months is envisaged, with the tariff amount to be defined in accordance with the principles of the Green Electricity Act 2012 for the determination of feed-in and follow-up tariffs within the framework of the provincial implementation laws.  f. Transformation management Projects suitable for funding under the existing system must be assimilated into a new system in order to capitalise on this potential in a cost-efficient and timely manner. This may be done, for example, by making it possible to participate in tenders (under certain pre-qualification conditions), or by simplifying other participation or award criteria.  g. Guarantees of origin for renewable energy Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 153 of 268  Not least as a requirement for transposing the European Renewable Energy Directive 2018, guarantees of origin must be established not only for renewable electricity and gas by way of a tradable good for energy sources but also for renewable heating and cooling. This change in the labelling of renewable energy sources and transformation products will develop the existing system of certification and guarantees of origin further, involving all relevant stakeholders associated with the regulatory authority Energie-Control Austria, and the current or future settlement centre.  h. Cross-border feed-in of renewable energy Renewable electricity installations which can be set up through a direct connection with the Austrian grid will be treated in the same way as installations to be constructed in Austria and will in principle be able to participate in tenders in order to obtain operational support. On the one hand, this transposes the requirements of the Renewable Energy Directive and, on the other hand, it must be implemented in a way which supports the serviceability of the system. Any prerequisites in terms of bilateral agreements for establishing a certain degree of reciprocity with neighbouring states have yet to be evaluated.     Further conditions  a. Administrative simplification of power line regulations (for more details see point 3.4.2, sub-point i) Power line regulations are due to be simplified by way of an exemption from approval under electricity law for medium-voltage power lines of up to 45 kV, whereby the current threshold of 1 kV will be increased to 45 kV.  b. Transposition of European solidarity mechanisms for electricity and gas Amendments to the Energy Intervention Act 2012 and the Gas Act 2011 are required by virtue of definition of protected customers, solidarity measures (authorisation to conclude agreements, arrangements for domestic implementation) and penalties for reporting breaches.  Amendments to the Electricity Industry and Organisation Act 2010 and the Energy Intervention Act 2012 are required by virtue of the EU Regulation on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector. Areas covered by the amendments will include determining a competent authority to carry out the tasks entrusted to Member States under the risk-preparedness Regulation. The most important area where amendments will be required is that of responsibility for drawing up risk-preparedness plans.  c. Institutional issues concerning settlement and statistics -Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 154 of 268  stop-renewable energy. The contact point would also cover several spatial planning and licensing-related issues before actual funding which may potentially be invested in such projects is started. The future body responsible for settlement (currently OeMAG) must have the appropriate basis and instruments to enable it to carry out the vital role of passing on information to the stakeholder group. In future, in view of the volume of financial resources in circulation, the Federal Public Corporate Governance Code (B-PCGK), which was essentially set up to cover how government shareholder and supervisory functions are carried out, will apply to the activities of the body responsible for settling the financing of renewable energy expansion.  A key focus for renewable energy funding is that of increasing self-supply, in particular from a system-based point of view by the producers themselves and through renewable energy communities. So that this continually increasing share of renewable energy can be precisely taken into account and included in the strategic planning for funding itself and in reporting on targets, appropriate rules for statistical recording must be laid down by the regulatory authority or settlement centre.     Timetable:  The Renewable Energy Expansion Act is set to enter in 2020.     Green Electricity Act Amendment 2019 (ÖSG Amendment)  The Green Electricity Act amendment adopted in October 2019 contains the following key points:   Wind power o All plants already approved by 2020 should be completed. o In order to reduce the existing waiting list for wind turbines, the support funding for 2021 will be brought forward and used for additional contracts during 2020. (Wind power quota 2021: EUR 11.5 million; remaining quota 2021: EUR 9 million). o A total of 622.4 MW of new wind power capacity will be created. The total amount of support funding is EUR 266.5 million.   Photovoltaics and small-scale storage systems o Extending subsidies both for photovoltaic systems and for storage systems for a further three years, taking self-consumption into account. o A total of EUR 108 million will be made available in investment subsidies for this purpose over the next three years (per year photovoltaics: EUR 24 million, storage Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 155 of 268  systems: EUR 12 million). o Subsidy limits for electricity storage: 50 kWh per plant (threshold in favour of small plants remains as already included in IA); 30% of investment amount; 200 EUR/kWh. o Photovoltaics and storage system quotas are exchangeable in cases of non-use and transferable to the following year; EUR 36 million for 2020, 2021, 2022.   Medium-sized hydropower plants o Additional resources (investment support) from EUR 30 million to a total of EUR 80 million. o Of the investment required to construct a plant, 15% will be provided. o The cap on the maximum subsidy amount is increased (from EUR 400 per kW) to EUR 650 per kW and (from a maximum of EUR 6 million per installation) to EUR 10 million per installation.   Small-sized hydropower plants o Due to a new quota calculation, no additional funds are necessary for queue reduction.   Biomass and biogas o Follow-up tariffs for biomass and biogas plants, with an estimated total of EUR 60.9 million for biomass (special quota for the follow-up tariffs of EUR 8.7 million) and for biogas a total volume of EUR 73.52 million. o Change in the calculation of the quota, allowing 14 new plants to be built in 2019 (instead of 11) and 21 in 2020.  The proposed measures represent an important bridging measure for the period before the Renewable Energy Expansion Act comes in to force.     Hydrogen Strategy  The Austrian Climate and Energy Strategy #mission2030 provides for the development of a hydrogen strategy. In order to achieve the desired restructuring of the energy system, renewable hydrogen can make a decisive contribution in the future as a key technology for sector integration and linking.  The Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism, in cooperation with the ministries responsible, has been developing an Austrian hydrogen strategy since March 2019. A steering group consisting of representatives of the Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 156 of 268  Technology, the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Ministry of Sustainability and Tourism has overall control of the process. In the course of developing the strategy, four working groups were set up, consisting of representatives of companies, science, associations, NGOs, ministries and the provinces. Stakeholder recommendations for development of the strategy were developed under the chairmanship of selected companies.  The four working groups dealt with the following topics:  1. Generation, infrastructure and storage Discussions will focus primarily on the necessary framework in the areas of generation, storage and infrastructure for establishing renewable hydrogen as a strategic measure for securing supply, in order to be able to use surpluses in electricity production in the future, as well as on an optimal design of the future market model, including the future roles of market participants.  2.  Among other things, discussions will focus on the framework for the increase and long-term substitution of natural gas with renewable gas in the gas grid, mechanisms for generating demand, identifying suitable locations, H2 fitness of the gas grid and obstacles to the feed-in of renewable gases.  3. Hydrogen in industrial processes Discussions will focus on the necessary regulatory framework and economic conditions for the use of renewable hydrogen in industrial processes, both at European and national level. This takes place both in relation to research (e.g. creation of experimental spaces) and to application.  4. Mobility and buildings  fuel cells in final consumption The working group Mobility. discusses the prerequisites for a roadmap for using renewable hydrogen to contribute to sustainable mobility, identifying timely fields of application especially necessary regulatory and economic framework conditions for the further development of renewable hydrogen in the building sector are outlined.   Each working group will draw up a final conclusion paper, which contains data-based objectives and, in addition, potentials and recommended measures, and which will be incorporated into the development of the Austrian hydrogen strategy. The strategy to be drawn up will also be subject to a public consultation process and decided upon by the Austrian Council of Ministers.     Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 157 of 268  Additional incentives for renewable energy expansion  Biofuels in the transport sector The 14% renewable energy target for transport under the Directive on the promotion of renewable energy (RED II), will be implemented by promoting e-mobility with electricity and hydrogen from renewable energy sources and, in relation to fuel, by promoting the use of biofuels by increasing the share of bioethanol in petrol and, in relation to diesel, by using synthetic diesel fuels from renewable sources with a proportion in the form of advanced biofuels.  Domestic Environmental Support The Domestic Environmental Support scheme [Umweltförderung im Inland, UFI] is the central support instrument under Austrian environment policy. It supports Austrian companies and public institutions with investment measures in particular for adoption of renewable energy sources and carrying out demonstration projects, in line with #mission2030.  In 2018 alone environmental funding supported 630 renewable energy projects. This triggered investments of around EUR 122 million and made around 278,000 MWh/a of renewable energy sources possible.  The Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism also supports the use of heat from renewable energy sources through environmental funding. By far the largest share of funding goes to constructing and operating regional, sustainable and climate-neutral heat supply systems. A separate quality management system for heating plants is obligatory in terms of environmental funding for all plants whose installed nominal biomass boiler output reaches or exceeds 400 kilowatts or whose network length reaches or exceeds 1,000 route metres. Accompanying quality control during the planning, construction and operation of biomass heating plants helps to improve the technical quality and efficiency of the plants. However, many other technologies for heat production in plants are also being promoted. Therefore, environmental support is also the most important instrument for the conversion of process heat in plants. The environmental impact of renewable energy sources was almost 113,000 megawatt hours per year.  For the target trajectory to 2030, an increased funding commitment from the UFI for the period 2021 to 2030 is to be made available for operational and municipal projects to improve energy efficiency, use renewable energy or save energy. The Government funds are also intended to be used for thermal renovation measures on buildings. By securing these subsidies, the use of funds will be continually optimised.     ii. Regional cooperation in this area (where relevant) and  optionally  estimates of surplus energy production from renewable energy sources which may be transferred Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 158 of 268  to other Member States.  During the process of drawing up the draft National Energy and Climate Plan, regional Hungary, Slovenia and Italy, as well as with Poland, Croatia and Belgium. As part of this, the majority of Member States, including Austria, have chosen to invite each other to cooperation meetings. Each of these meetings saw several Member States come together to inform one another of the contents of their respective draft NECPs and to identify possible connecting factors enabling closer cooperation.   In the scope of the decarbonisation dimension, there was above all discussion of the following subjects for closer cooperation:   Transport;  Opportunities for cooperation and joint projects in the field of renewable energy expansion;  Coordinated implementation of existing EU directives (e.g. RED II) and  Exchange of best practice methods in the field of decarbonisation and energy efficiency.    For further details, also see point 1.4, Regional cooperation     iii. Specific measures on financial support, where applicable, including Union support and the use of Union funds, for promoting the production and use of energy from renewable sources in the electricity, heating and cooling, and transport sectors    Renewable Energy Expansion Act  Despite the steady expansion of renewable energy, the amount of funding which will be allocated and, therefore, the cost burden on households, businesses and industry will not be increased significantly compared to current levels. Further expansion of renewables will be cost-efficient and in line with the market. In so doing, aspects of the overall cost can and will be taken into account from a system responsibility perspective when considering how funds are allocated.  a. Fund allocation structure Funds will continue to be allocated on the basis of a metering-based system comprising the green Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 159 of 268  electricity flat rate (not linked to consumption) and the green electricity support payment (linked to consumption). Likewise, a relief mechanism will remain in place for socially vulnerable households.  b. Energy balancing and reserves financing framework The guideline on system balancing in the electricity supply system will prompt changes, including hority, Energie-Control Austria, and, primarily, the transmission system operator, Austrian Power Grid (APG), are working to implement individual sub-stages which are currently expected to include Industry and Organisation Act 2010 requires that further rules be adapted and a long-term framework established which enables costs to be allocated in a clear and transparent way to all parties active in the electricity system. Any funds from the special account must be transferred to the system of financing renewable energy systems in a way which reduces the cost impact.  c. Tax aspects and cost volumes Assessments by the Federal Ministry of Finance and the subsequent implementation of preferential tax treatment for hydrogen, biogas and other renewable gases and for self-produced electricity were undertaken.  The following measures will be implemented in accordance with #mission2030, by means of the Tax Reform Act 2020:   Tax advantage for biogas and hydrogen - Favourable tax treatment due to the allocation of hydrogen and biogas to the Natural Gas Tax Act  Tax exemption for sustainable biogas  Tax exemption for sustainable hydrogen  Tax advantage for liquefied natural gas  Tax exemption for self-produced electricity - Tax exemption for self-produced and self-consumed electricity if this was generated by a photovoltaic system.   In accordance with #mission2030, there are no other funds (from public budgets) associated with this project  save where otherwise defined in detail  other than the costs generated by funds allocated and therefore covered under the Renewable Energy Expansion Act 2020.  Other key financing instruments for promoting renewable energy in Austria, along with the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 160 of 268  existing Green Electricity Act and the planned Renewable Energy Expansion Act, are:   The Domestic Environmental Support scheme (under the Environmental Support Act) for operating investments in the heating sector in the non-ETS sector  The renovation plan for thermal renovation of buildings through replacement of heating -Domestic Environmental Support scheme (non-ETS sector)  Climate and Energy Fund (photovoltaic, solar thermal, bioenergy)  Provincial support for housing construction.     iv. Where applicable, assessment of support schemes for electricity from renewable sources which Member States are to carry out pursuant to Article 6 of the Renewable Energy Directive  Support schemes for electricity from renewable energy sources will be assessed in accordance with Article 6 of the Renewable Energy Directive when drawing up the Renewable Energy Expansion Act (which is currently taking place).     v. Specific measures to streamline administrative procedures, provide information and training, and facilitate the uptake of power purchase agreements.  A central point of contact and settlement centre for green electricity support, OeMAG Abwicklungsstelle für Ökostrom AG, was established under the Green Electricity Act 2012. Also, in order to relieve the burden on green electricity installation operators, administrative procedures were able to be reduced and simplified, for example by establishing a register of installations or by limiting the requirement to submit an application in respect of decisions of recognition.  Specific measures to streamline administrative procedures and provide information can also be      vi. Assessment of infrastructure measures needed for district heating and cooling produced from renewable energy sources  An assessment of infrastructure measures needed for district heating and cooling from renewable Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 161 of 268  energy sources will be carried out during the ongoing drafting of the Renewable Energy Expansion Act. The maintenance and optimisation of existing biogenic district heating networks is the subject of funding within the Domestic Environmental Support scheme and, due to the great importance and number of plants in Austria, is a funding priority area for which EU funds from the CAP will continue to be used.  In addition, an integrated network infrastructure plan (see also Point 3.1.2 i) is currently being prepared.     vii. Where applicable, specific measures on the use of biomass, including resource availability; measures on sustainable forestry  See point 3.1.1.i.     3.1.3.    i. Where applicable, measures affecting the EU ETS sector and assessment of the complementarity and impacts on the EU ETS  In accordance with Section 5(1)(9) of the 2015 support guidelines for the Domestic Environmental corresponding derived natiClimate and energy measures relating to ETS installations are not eligible for funding under those rules as not all of their achieved effects may count towards national objectives.  Based on Section 7 of the Energy Efficiency Act (monitoring report on climate and energy objectives), the Federal Minister for Sustainability and Tourism, in agreement with the Federal Minister for Digital and Economic Affairs and the Federal Minister for Finance, may introduce Environmental Support scheme towards the EU 2020 objectives is not hampered to any great  guidelines for the Domestic Environmental Support scheme).  In summer 2018, an exemption was agreed between the three Ministries:  ETS installations may also be granted project support under the Environmental Support scheme provided that the support is for eco-innovation within the meaning of Section 3(2) of the 2015 support guidelines for the Domestic Environmental Support scheme. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 162 of 268   Furthermore, the following eligibility criteria apply to eco-innovation in relation to ETS installations:   Support is limited to improving existing installations. Support is not granted for new installations.  The technology being tested has specific, quantifiable potential for circulation. The multiplier effect of the eco-innovation benefiting from support is clear.  Only one demonstration project is granted support for every eco-innovation benefiting from support. Project funding for ETS installations with comparable content in other locations or by other applicants will not be funded under the Domestic Environmental Support scheme.  The intended environmental impact (energy and CO2 savings) is significant, i.e. improvements made exceed the extent of effects which are known to occur through ordinary development of the latest techniques. The environmental effects underlying the support can be demonstrated and permanently monitored once the project has been implemented.    Initially, support for eco-innovation related to ETS installations is only possible for applications submitted up to 31 December 2020 and limited to a maximum of EUR 2.5 million of federal funding per year within the total annual commitment framework under Domestic Environmental Support. Eco-innovation support is being continued in the scope of Domestic Environmental Support.     ii. Measures to achieve other national targets, where applicable  Measures relating to the energy system and measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions may have an impact on atmospheric pollutant emissions.  In respect of five atmospheric pollutants, Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants emissions from 2005 to 2020 and 2030 by fixed percentages; this concerns sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The following table shows the reduction commitments:  Table 10: Emission reduction commitments pursuant to the NEC Directive for Austria  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 163 of 268   Atmospheric pollutant Reduction compared with reference year 2005 from 2020 Reduction compared with reference year 2005 from 2030 Sulphur dioxide (SO2) 26% 41% Nitrogen oxides (NOx) 37% 69% Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) 21% 36% Ammonia (NH3) 1% 12% Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) 20% 46%   In order to fulfil their emission reduction commitments, the Member States had to draw up a national air pollution control programme, which was to be reported to the European Commission by April 2019. The national air pollution control programme was therefore to be completed significantly earlier than the final National Energy and Climate Plan. Coordination with other commitments, particularly in the field of energy and climate, was an important element when drawing up the air pollution control programme. It can be clearly determined from previous model-based scenarios that, viewed as a whole, measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions also have positive impacts on the development of atmospheric pollutants. A related evaluation of      iii. Measures to achieve low-emission mobility (including e-mobility)  committed to significantly reducing diesel and petrol consumption in particular during the coming decade, carrying on until 2030 and beyond. A shift in focus in the case of new registrations to emission-free cars and light commercial vehicles was set as a target for 2030 by #mission2030. At EU level, additional impetus for the introduction of alternative vehicles through the new fleet targets, negotiated under the Austrian presidency of the EU Council, for manufacturers of cars and light and heavy commercial vehicles is expected by 2030. An important step towards low-emission mobility is therefore promoting the switch to alternative fuels (hydrogen from renewable energy, bio-CNG/bio-LNG and biofuels) in transport and electromobility using renewable energy. Under Austrian transport policy, the focus is on electrifying modes of transport as a building block for a modern and efficient transport system overall. A number of support measures, including expanding the necessary infrastructure, have been and continue to be used to promote the development of the market in alternative fuels for the transport sector and electromobility. Measures will be devised at all levels of government and implemented in close dialogue with stakeholders and businesses. The following areas will be covered: legal, tax and Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 164 of 268  support measures, non-financial incentives, simplification of technical and administrative procedures, further infrastructure development, R&D support, and a variety of specific municipal measures.  E-mobility plan In order in particular to enhance electromobility using renewable energies, a new e-mobility plan is being implemented in 2019 and 2020 by the BMNT and BMVIT together with car import companies, two-wheeled vehicle import companies and sports retailers, established as one of the 12 flagship projects under #mission2030. As 99% of CO2 transport sector are caused by road traffic, a decisive contribution to achieving climate goals is made by supporting the conversion to zero-emission and low-emission vehicles (purely electric, plug-in, hydrogen/fuel cell) and setting up the recharging infrastructure.  Enhancing electromobility by increasing transparency with regard to public recharging infrastructure The spread and availability of public recharging infrastructure are decisive factors influencing the user-friendliness of such infrastructure and are therefore factors in successfully establishing electromobility nationwide. In order to gain an overall picture of public recharging infrastructure in Austria, an official list of all public recharging facilities for electric vehicles in Austria is provided online at the initiative of the BMNT. The list provides information on the technical equipment, recharging options and charging power available at every public recharging site. The list of recharging points will increase transparency regarding the availability of public recharging infrastructure, stimulate competition between recharging infrastructure operators, boost the is currently prevalent.     iv. Where applicable, measures and timeline for the phase-out of energy subsidies, in particular for fossil fuels  Developmental pathways in relation to the development of greenhouse gas emissions are essentially determined by the form of the future framework conditions (in particular incentive and support system and economic parameters).  In order to ensure compliance of the incentive and support system with Article 2(1)(c) of the Paris Agreement, an intensive evaluation of the existing tax and incentive system is taking place in particular in the area of taxation. In addition to the identification of counterproductive measures and the measures already taken, it is currently being examined at expert level to what extent a stronger price signal for CO2 emissions in the non-ETS area could be efficiently and effectively implemented in the current configuration of the incentive and support system. This work firstly Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 165 of 268  involves internally establishing intensive dissemination of specialist knowledge on the subject of climate, in order to create corresponding targeted and linked specialist knowledge. Lively professional exchanges are also taking place with experts in the field of economics and climate science in order to obtain corresponding expertise here too. In addition, the measures in the field of budget, tax and regulatory policy in other EU states are also being recorded and analysed with regard to their effect with the help of external and independent expertise.  Evaluation of all incentive and support systems  In Austria, both at Federal Government and provincial level, there are numerous incentive and support instruments which either implicitly or expressly serve to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase the share of renewable energy or improve energy efficiency. The following instruments are to be particularly emphasised here.   Domestic Environmental Support scheme  including renovation initiatives in housing construction for private individuals, businesses and municipalities (also see point 3.1.2., sub-point i, Support scheme)  Energie.Frei.Raum: The Energie.Frei.Raum support programme of the Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism supports the testing of a systematic implementation of new market models for the integration of technologies in the field of renewable energy sources and of storage and energy efficiency technologies.  Introduction of energy management systems in SMEs: Subsidy support for the establishment and/or certification of an energy management system in SMEs. Identification and gradual removal of counterproductive incentives and subsidies  Under the leadership of the BMF and in consultation with the Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism (BMNT) and the Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT), a list of incentives and subsidies which are an obstacle to the climate and energy targets, including the associated implications for Austria, is to be drawn up.  The interministerial process for identifying and gradually removing counterproductive incentives and subsidies takes a sector-based approach here. On the basis of the most recent emissions data in the non-carried out into the ecological and financial effect of measures counteracting the climate and -ETS sectors are being analysed in order of decreasing greenhouse gas intensity (agriculture, buildings, energy and industry, waste management, etc.). Location and socio-economic data are likewise considered here, where available. The following parameter categories are taken into consideration in any case in this regard: (i) ecological effect (including released greenhouse gas emissions in the ETS and non-ETS area, contribution to the rate of renewable energy, contribution to energy Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 166 of 268  efficiency), (ii) budgetary effect (including direct effect on the state budget, relevant subdivision of the federal budget, indirect cost effects) and (iii) other effects (including employment effect, risk of lock-in or stranded investments).  The sector-based list of counterproductive incentives and support measures (for the ETS and non-ETS area) shall be continuously updated, including beyond 31 December 2019, and serves as a starting point for the gradual removal of measures classified as counterproductive. Where there are no counter-arguments (in particular of a location-related nature), the identified measures will be gradually removed in the scope of the 2021-2030 period, achieving a reduction of at least 2 million t of CO2eq in 2030.  developed in this regard:   Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 167 of 268  Working definition of counterproductivity:  Climate and Energy Strategy, a public measure is to be described as a counterproductive incentive or direct or indirect support measure/subsidy when its effects counteract compliance with the climate and energy targets that are binding under international and EU law and the implementation of the measure therefore results in (i) an increase in the greenhouse gas emission level, (ii) a reduction in the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and/or (iii) a reduction in energy efficiency. Negative effects on the greenhouse gas emission level (now and in the coming years, including long-term effects) are   Definition of a measure (complete list):  of counterproductivity may include the following support measures/subsidies or incentives: (i) direct subsidies (targeted subsidies and loans), (ii) indirect subsidies (including tax breaks) and other tax incentives, (iii) unused sureties/guarantees and (iv) targeted benefits in the scope of state regulation and other   Specific tax-ecological measures  Tax measures form a central component in the area of greening.  The incentive and support system also in particular has a multiplier function for regulatory measures. That means that only overall strategic approaches guarantee that the highest possible amount of CO2 can be cut.  As a further important step towards the greening of the tax system, essential measures which are also part of #mission2030 were agreed in the scope of the Tax Reform Act 2020. Further tax prioritisations will also be the subject of government negotiations in the next few weeks.  Further (tax) measures in the field of electromobility, hydrogen and greening of the commuter allowance are in particular currently under discussion.  The following measures have been agreed or already implemented in the area of the greening of tax law:  Transport   Tax exemption in the scope of the registration tax (standard fuel consumption tax) for electric vehicles. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 168 of 268   Tax exemption in the scope of the current motor vehicle taxation (motor vehicle insurance tax) for electric vehicles.  Cars and motorcycles are fundamentally excluded from the input tax deduction in the area of turnover tax. Exceptions are made for cars and motorcycles with a CO2 emission level of 0 grams. These are subject to a full input tax deduction in the case of acquisition costs up to EUR 40,000; between EUR 40,000 and EUR 80,000 the deduction is made proportionally, and from EUR 80,000 an input tax deduction is excluded. This measure applies to ongoing operational expenditure and acquisitions.  In the case of private use of company cars, monthly benefits in kind (in the area of the Income Tax Act) of 1.5% or 2% of the costs of acquiring the car are to be fixed, depending 2 value. That means that the preferential rate of 1.5% is to be applied to cars with a low CO2 emission level. No benefits in kind are to be fixed for cars with a CO2 emission level of 0 grams (electric vehicles).  The measure, implemented in the Tax Reform Act 2020, of consideration of the CO2 emission level as a basis for assessing the current motor vehicle taxation (motor vehicle insurance tax) for motorcycles and cars in respect of first registrations from October 2020 creates a (further) tax incentive for lower-emission motor vehicles.  Furthermore, the taxation, valid since 2014 and based on CO2 values, of the standard fuel consumption tax for cars is being amended with the Tax Reform Act 2020. An ecological reconfiguration of the standard fuel consumption tax is taking place in this regard. This is fundamentally intended to lead to an additional burden for cars with a higher CO2 emission level and relieve the burden on owners of vehicles with lower CO2 emissions. The increased consideration of the CO2 emission level in the standard fuel consumption tax will in future also apply in relation to motorcycles (account was previously taken of the cubic capacity here).  Hydrogen (as a fuel) currently falls under the taxation according to the Mineral Oil Tax Act. The Tax Reform Act 2020 provides for more favourable taxation of biogas and hydrogen through application of the rate of taxation of the natural gas duty (which is lower than the mineral oil tax). With regard to storage of biogas in a natural gas network, the blend is to be tariffed as a natural gas and the mixture as such subjected to the natural gas duty. There is also tax exemption for renewably produced hydrogen and sustainably generated biogas.  The Tax Reform Act 2020 will apply taxation comparable to the tax rate for (gaseous) natural gas under the Natural Gas Duty Act to liquefied natural gas (LNG). The tax rate will also apply to biogas and comparable liquefied hydrocarbons, where these are subject to the Mineral Oil Tax Act. Liquefied natural gas will also be exempt from tax where certain sustainability criteria (bio-LNG) are met. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 169 of 268   Cross-border train passenger transportation is subject to the reduced tax rate of 10% (domestic part of the transport route).  The reduced tax rate of 13% applies to passenger transportation services which are not exempt (not cross-border). Energy  Tax treatment of alternative forms of energy:   In continuation of the exemption, existing since 2014, for self-produced and self-consumed electrical energy from renewable energy sources (up to 25 000 kWh per year), the Tax Reform Act 2020 is introducing complete exemption from the tax on self-produced electricity (electricity duty) where electricity is produced for self-consumption by means of photovoltaic installations. Additional examination of tax exemption, including for further renewable energy sources.  Examination of exemption from electricity duty for rail electricity coming from renewable energy sources which is used as fuel for passenger and freight transportation in railway, underground, tram and overhead line transport.  Gaseous hydrocarbons from the utilisation of waste in the area of agriculture (including livestock farming, landfills, wastewater purification) and used oils (recovered, reprocessed mineral oils) using mineralogical methods or in non-energy use are completely exempt from mineral oil tax in the interest of safe disposal.    Public authority participations  Public authority participations have a direct exemplary function when it comes to implementing the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement. Against this background, a strategy for aligning the public participations of the Federal Government with the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement will be completed by 31 December 2020. In this context, attention should in particular be paid to ensuring that cost-intensive lock-in effects and/or stranded investments are avoided in the course of the gradual alignment with the climate and energy targets. Potential measures which will be examined in this regard include:   Promotion of green finance instruments as a tool for bolstering sustainable behaviour,  Green electricity generation through hydroelectric, wind and solar energy, and generation of the renewable energy sources biomethane and hydrogen  Gradual decarbonisation of industrial production processes, Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 170 of 268   Conversion of their own fleet of vehicles towards electromobility and hydrogen technology and  Greenhouse gas-reducing recycling of waste
