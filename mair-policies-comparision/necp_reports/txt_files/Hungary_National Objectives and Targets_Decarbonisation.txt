 2. TARGETS AND OBJECTIVES 2.1. Dimension of decarbonisation 2.1.1. GHG emissions and removals14 i. The elements set out in point (a)(1) of Article 4 The emissions of non-ETS sectors (buildings, waste sector, transport, agriculture, small industrial emitters and F-gases) are regulated by the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) up to 2020. Pursuant to the Decision, between 2013 and 2020, i.e. during the ESD period, Hungary may increase its emissions by 10 % compared to the emission levels of 2005. The Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) was adopted in May 2018, which sets national emission reduction targets for Member States for the 20212030 period, relative to the base year of 2005. To this end, GDP/capita-proportionate targets were set for Member States in the range of 040 %. Pursuant to the Regulation, Hungary's reduction target is 7 % between 2021 and 2030, i.e. during the ESR period. At the current stage, mandatory national targets15 in the 20212030 period may not yet be provided because pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/842, their calculation also requires 2018 emission values, which are not yet available in the professional process. (Annual values are published in a Union act.) ii. Where applicable, other national objectives and targets consistent with the Paris Agreement and existing long-term strategies; Where applicable, contribution to the EU commitment aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, other objectives and targets, including sectoral targets and adaptation targets, if available.  -by the European Commission in 2011, by 2050 GHG emissions in the entire economy of the EU should decrease by 80 % over the level measured in 1990. The EU emission reduction target is determined by the 2030 climate and energy framework approved by the European Council in October 2014. The document declares that the EU will reduce GHG emissions by at least 40 % by 2030 compared to 1990. The Long-term Strategy sets out the decarbonisation targets of Hungary up to 2050. To meet the long-term decarbonisation target, in addition to the targets referred to in point 2.1.1 i., this document sets out the following national targets up to 2030: GHG emissions should be reduced by at least 40 % by 2030 over the year 1990, i.e. in 2030 gross emissions may not exceed gross 56.19 million t CO2eq, thus the value for 2017 should be reduced by                                                       14 Consistency to be ensured with long-term strategies under Article 15.  15 I.e. emission allowances under Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2018/842.   7.6 million t CO2eq. The GHG intensity  i.e. GHG emissions per unit of GDP  of the Hungarian economy improved by 22 % since 2010, suggesting that climate protection does not impede economic growth, but can actually boost it. The positive trend is also confirmed by preliminary emissions data for 2018: GHG emissions declined by roughly 0.6 %, with 4.9 % GDP growth. It is our strategic objective to strengthen this trend, i.e. to further reduce the energy and GHG intensity of Hungary's generated national income in parallel with maintaining high-quality economic growth. Beyond reducing GHG emissions and improving the GHG intensity, Hungary also assigns a priority to promoting adaptation to the effects of climate change. At an international level the Paris Agreement defines the global adaptation objectives16 and the need to balance mitigation and adaptation measures. At the level of the EU, the (EU Adaptation Strategy), adopted in April 2013 by the European Commission, is the principal normative document for adaptation policies of Member States. To ensure climate change-proof investments, the objectives of the strategy mainly focus on the establishment of Member State adaptation strategies, support of adaptation capacity development, development of voluntary urban adaptation strategies, identification of insufficiently understood fields and the remedying of such deficiency, further development of the CLIMATE-ADAPT information platform17, integration of the field of adaptation in the Common Agricultural Policy and Cohesion Policy, enhancement of the resilience of infrastructures and development of related guidance, and the promotion of new insurance schemes and other financial services. As part of the Second National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS 2), Hungary adopted the National Adaptation Strategy (NAS)18. The NAS  in harmony with Union objectives and national needs  defines the following specific objectives for the period up to 2030: - Conservation of natural and semi-natural ecosystems; - Conservation of the reserves and quality, long-term use of natural resources; - Identification of the adaptation options of vulnerable regions, drawing up of region-specific adaptation strategies supported by the NATÉR19 system;                                                       16 Paris Agreement, Article 2(1)(b). 17 https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/ 18 Decision No 23/2018 of 31 October 2018 of Parliament on the Second National Climate Change Strategy relating to the 20182030 period, and providing a projection of the period up to 2050. 19 The NAS presents the results of the vulnerability assessment drawn up within the framework of the National Adaptation Geographic Information System (NATÉR, https://nater.mbfsz.gov.hu/). The NATÉR provides reliable and objective information on Hungary's climate, the effects of climate change and strategic risks relating to other long-term management of natural resources, and on possibilities affecting and influencing adaptation to these. The system also functions as a means of raising public awareness of climate literacy and a database serving climate change related  - Implementation of the flexible and innovative adaptation of vulnerable sectors (inter alia agriculture and forest management, tourism, energy, transport, buildings, telecommunications and communications systems); - Risk management and adaptation in horizontal areas of with key national strategic relevance (inter alia disaster management, critical infrastructure in water resources management and rural development); - Mitigation of the social impact of climate change, awareness raising, improvement of social adaptability; - Support of research and innovation relating to adaptation, publication of scientific research results. 2.1.2. Renewable energy i. The elements set out in point (a)(2) of Article 4 We will increase the share of renewable energy sources to at least 21 % within gross final energy consumption by 2030.20 Electricity Hungary plans to increase the share of energy production based on renewable energy sources within electricity consumption to at least 20 % by 2030.21 the electricity sector, which will increase from just under 680 MW in 2016 to approximately 6 500 MW by 2030, and significantly exceed 10 000 MW by 2040. The NECP projects wind power station capacities to approximate the current level (~330 MW) in 2030. In addition to maintaining existing hydroelectric power plants, the increase of small-scale hydroelectric power plant capacities is justified. Heating and cooling In the heating and cooling sector we see major potential for the efficient use of biomass in both individual heating equipment and in district heating, and options for using ambient heat through heat pumps. Currently only 10-15 % of Hungary's geothermal potential is exploited, even though the use of geothermal energy can offer a competitive alternative to other energy resources with the introduction of appropriate incentives. Considering Hungary's geological characteristics, we plan to exploit the geothermal energy potential in both district heat generation and in the agro-industry (e.g. heating of                                                                                                                                                                                   research. 20 The implementation of additional renewable energy capacities is possible at a growing cost. According to our current estimates, above a 20 % share of renewable energy, the unit funding requirement of domestic renewable energy recovery significantly increases. (Source: REKK (2018): Cost estimate of achieving the share of renewable energy by 2030 https://rekk.hu/downloads/projects/2019_REKK_NEKT_megujulo_final.pdf) 21 The value projected by modelling exceeds 21 % based on the WAM scenario.   greenhouses). The integration of the recovery of biodegradable municipal waste in useful heat generation is also a viable option. Transport Pursuant to the Renewable Energy Directive, fuel distributors are required to ensure that renewable energy accounts for at least 14 % of total energy consumption in the transport sector by 2030. To meet this target Hungary will increase the share of first generation biofuels produced from food crops and fodder plants to roughly 7 %, and the share of second generation (or advanced) biofuels produced from waste and biogas to 3.5 % in the final energy consumption of transport.22 The remaining share required to meet the 14 % target will be provided through the significant increase of electricity in transport. ii.

Estimated trajectories on bioenergy demand, disaggregated between heat, electricity and transport, and on biomass supply by feedstocks and origin (distinguishing between domestic production and imports). For forest biomass, an assessment of its source and impact on the LULUCF sink Demand In 2016 total bioenergy consumption amounted to 2 361 ktoe, most of which (73 %) was consumed by households. According to our estimates, the use of bioenergy will increase by approximately 30 % with additional measures. Most of this growth will be driven by electricity and district heat generation, the industrial and services sectors. In contrast, retail biomass consumption will significantly decline by 46 % by 2030. The use of bioenergy will peak in the 2030s, followed by a moderate decline.

Most State forests are managed by State-owned forestry companies limited by shares under the shareholder control of the Ministry of Agriculture. Determination of the annual logging volume of State forestry holdings is an ecological question. Logging in conformity with the maintenance and cultivation of forests, providing for the necessary funds and ensuring the sustainability of forest management is planned in several stages. Ten-year forestry plans comprise the basis for three-year strategic plans and annual plans. Based on more than ten years of experience relating to the National Forest Programme, the main problem associated with private forest management remains the management of small-scale areas. Such management decreases the effectiveness of forest management and conservation, on the one hand, and significantly increases administrative burdens, on the other. Based on the National Forest Strategy, the appropriate integration of the fragmented forest holding structure and its improvement to the extent possible should be achieved by modification of the regulatory framework and with other State measures. The appropriate regulation of forest management partnerships can contribute to these efforts.23 Climate change has already caused unprecedented damage to forests, disrupting the planned course of forest management. Although domestic deciduous species, and measures already introduced in forest management and by forest holdings contribute to preventing larger scale damage to forests, such damage may be impossible to rule out, which (due to the necessary logging of dead trees) will lead to the temporary sharp increase in the availability of wood biomass, followed by its expected decline.

Where applicable, other national trajectories and objectives, including those that are long term or sectoral (e.g. share of renewable energy in district heating, renewable energy use in buildings, renewable energy produced by cities, energy communities and renewables self-consumers, energy recovered from the sludge acquired through the treatment of wastewater); With the spread of household-sized PV panels, a growing number of consumers can generate their own energy, which not only offers the option of a more active presence on the market beyond the conscious regulation of consumption, but also strengthens energy independence on a household scale. We wish to continue encouraging energy production for private purposes, based on renewable resources, strengthening the energy independence of consumers and consumer communities. In addition to the production of electricity with PV panels to satisfy consumer electricity demand (possibly including the energy demand of electric vehicles), this also involves the substitution of piped gas consumption or inefficient district heating with the use of geothermal heat, ambient heat, electric heating or biomass. We will promote initiatives aimed at satisfying municipal heat demand with local energy. In parallel with growth in decentralised production based on locally available renewable resources it is necessary to support initiatives ensuring the local consumption of electricity. This effort could reduce costs associated with energy supply and simplify the integration of renewable sources of energy. In relation to the above, encouragement and support of energy communities is the most important task. With regard to district heating, we aim to ensure that in the longer term the entire Hungarian district heating service, in the medium term the district heating systems of municipalities where the quantity of district heat supplied to the network reaches 100 000  relevant directive24, which can significantly increase the amount of national and EU funds serving development, and reduce the energy consumption of buildings and GHG emissions. Pursuant to the directive, district heating/district cooling is deemed to be efficient if operating with at least 50 % renewable energy, 50 % waste heat, 75 % cogenerated heat, or 50 % of a combination of such energy resources. 2.2. Dimension of energy efficiency i. The elements set out in point (b) of Article 4 Hungary's energy efficiency target is to ensure that the country's final energy consumption does not exceed the value of 2005 in 2030 (785 PJ), either. If final energy consumption exceeds the level for 2005, such increase should exclusively derive from carbon neutral energy resources
