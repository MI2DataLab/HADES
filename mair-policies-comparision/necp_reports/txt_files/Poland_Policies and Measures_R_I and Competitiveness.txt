 III. Policies and measures - Dimension Research, innovation and competitiveness 123  3.5. Research, innovation and competitiveness a) Policies and measures including those to achieve the objectives set out in 2.5 Responsible/involved parties*: MNiSW, MAP, MR, MFiPR * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. 1. Implementation of the State science, technology and innovation policy The targets and objectives of the national science, technology and innovation policy are set out within the seven strategic directions for research and development formulated in the National Research Programme (NRP) adopted by the Council of Ministers in 2011. These directions form the basis for the Council of the National Centre for and Development (Rada Narodowego Centrum  NCBiR) to develop strategic research and development programmes as part of which R+D projects are subsidised. Strategic programmes have been carried out since 2011, depending on the availability of budgetary funds, consecutively for all seven NRP areas. On 1 October 2018, an act reforming the science and higher education system in Poland took effect, i.e. the Higher Education and Science Law of 20 July 2018 (Journal of Laws, item 1668). Pursuant to the new regulations, the NRP will apply until the Council of Ministers adopts (no later than by 31 March 2020) a new state science policy as part of which the priorities and strategic research programmes will be updated. The updated strategic research directions in the field of energy and climate should be consistent wit the Strategy for Responsible Development (SRD) and, in the field of low-carbon technologies, additionally with the new Energy Policy of Poland until 2040. The expenditures on research and development activities in Poland are planned to be increased to 1.7% of the GDP in 2020 and to 2.5% of the GDP in 2030, and new rules for using these expenditures as part of the science and higher education reform carried out since 2016, better adapted to prevailing social and economic conditions, are planned to be implemented. This will lead, among other things, to an increase in the level and effectiveness of science in Poland, understood as providing results and products of scientific research of high cognitive quality and high social, economic and technological utility. As a joint effect of these actions, the innovativeness of the economy will be enhanced and the international importance and competitiveness of Polish science will increase. 2. Implementation of the Directions for Energy Innovation Development Programme In 2017, the Ministry of Energy developed the Directions for Energy Innovation Development (DEID). It is a document defining the broad innovation activity framework for the sector and institutions supporting it. The directions are to correlate strategic documents at the level of government administration and state agencies in the field of development and innovation policy for the energy sector. From the point of view of the implementation of the DEID, it is important to target public expenditures at the most attractive and at the same time the most urgent challenges, as well as to activate leading business entities operating in the Polish energy sector and to increase their involvement in, including financial commitment to, research, development and implementation activities. Pursuant to the objectives of the aforementioned document, projects in the following areas will be carried out: - an integrated and interconnected power system giving the central role to the energy user; - effective and flexible energy generation and the use of raw materials combining the reduction        III. Policies and measures - Dimension Research, innovation and competitiveness 124  of the impact on the environment with energy security; - diversification of energy generation and use technologies; - a green and energy-efficient city. The key factor for the development and implementation of innovation is the understanding of particular types of innovation and the development stages of a given technology. Innovation does not concern new technologies only, but also processes and organisational structures. Therefore, much attention has been devoted in the DEID to, among other things, new business models which are based on the application of technologies in a different manner or in another market segment. Moreover, to understand the fundamental problems of the phenomenon known as the valley of death, faced by companies not only in Poland but also worldwide, innovations have been divided according to their type and duration: - current projects  short-term incremental innovations (up to two years), - development projects  medium-term incremental projects (two to four years), - projects for the future  long-term breakthrough innovations (more than four or five years). In view of the above, in the period 2021-2030, efforts should be focused mainly on three levels: - support for new ideas and incubation, where a condition for success is the generation of as many low-funding and high-risk projects as possible, with short processing and decision making time, and the creation of a start-up community and an innovation ecosystem; - support for dissemination and commercialisation, where a condition for success is the commitment of venture capital and the involvement of large entities as customers and product consumers; - support for expansion and international development, where a condition for success is cooperation of large and medium-sized companies and support for international expansion through economic diplomacy. A weakness of the Polish system is undoubtedly the technology development and implementation stages which involves the need for technologies to be piloted and scaled. This is why, in the operation of existing institutions dealing with energy sector innovations or institutions established for this purpose, special emphasis is placed on precisely the aforementioned issues. To streamline efforts in the area of energy sector innovations, work carried out as part of research and analytical back-up facilities must be coordinated. The objective remains to be the optimisation of the use of funds allocated to research, development and innovation through streamlining the operation of various institutions. Cooperation between universities and companies should lead to an increase in the number of patents, and also in the exchange of personnel between academia and industry. An important issue is the enhancement of the exchange of knowledge with foreign centres and the implementation of placement programmes for researchers in energy sector entities. One of the tools may be course programmes sponsored by and created jointly with market entities, conducted by lecturers working on a permanent basis for the most renowned foreign centres and the cooperation of the Polish energy business entities with renowned foreign research centres. Moreover, in addition to researchers, sector company employees should be more involved in international cooperation, through study visits or educational programmes in Poland or work for foreign subsidiary entities. This is particularly important for creating and developing an innovation ecosystem which should  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Research, innovation and competitiveness 125  also cover cooperation with the following related sectors: chemical, information technology and telecommunications, motor industry or defence sectors. It is important to ensure that, within the framework of the regulations in force both concerning the energy sector (tariff system) and intersectoral ones (Public Procurement Law), entities investing in Poland in research, development and innovations be rewarded, e.g. by taking into account expenses on R+D+I and on cooperation with local research centres. It is also important that space be created for the implementation of new solutions. Investments in the energy sector, in particular in innovations, may leverage the development of the entire economy and should be analysed from the point of view of the maximisation of benefits for the Polish economy  not only in terms of standard economic parameters, but also in terms of their potential for the development of science and industry. Natural synergies exist between the energy sector and related sectors, e.g. the chemical, information technology and telecommunications, transport or construction sector. The use of these synergies is beneficial for companies operating in these sectors and offers new possibilities to consumers. Therefore, the criterion for the assessment whether to invest in the energy sector should be the maximisation of national value added, in particular the possibility of obtaining technologically advanced products and services. The achievement of the objectives set out in the strategic document Directions for Energy Innovation Development by 2030 will result in the strengthening of the synergy effect in the area of innovations between companies, public institutions and the science sector, leading to such effects as e.g.: - increase in expenditure on R+D+I in energy sector entities by 200% as compared with 2018; - revenues in energy sector entities from segments which were not included in the existing offer or were marginal in 2018 reaching 25%; - increase in employee innovation in energy sector entities; - utilisation of 30% of waste generated in the energy sector; - utilisation of at least 0.5 billion m3 of coal-bed methane (CBM) annually; - increase in the utilisation of coal-mine methane (CMM), ventilation-air methane (VAM) and abandoned-mine methane (AMM) by 100% as compared with 2018; - reduction of energy-consumption of buildings by 20% as compared with 2018; - 10% of industrial buildings being equipped with BEMS  (Building Energy Management Systems); - increase in the number of patent applications in energy sector entities and research institutes; - reduction of unit energy consumption in industry by 20% as compared with 2018; - increase in the number of agreements and understandings between the energy sector, industry and research units; - enhancement of the technological advancement and competitiveness of the Polish energy sector and reduction of the adverse impact on the environment.   System/Implementation of the Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) Programme in  Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) is a system supporting the commercialisation and  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Research, innovation and competitiveness 126  dissemination of innovative environmental technologies that consists in an impartial and reliable confirmation that performance and benefit claims put forward by a technology manufacturer are credible, complete, and based on reliable research results. The system is implemented in Poland through a strategic project that forms part of the Strategy for Responsible Development. ETV verifies the innovation of the solution in the context of the environmental effect of the technology from a life-cycle perspective. The pilot project is addressed to operators offering technologies in the following areas: water treatment and monitoring, materials, waste and resources, energy technologies. The ultimate ETV programme will depend on decisions taken at EU level and on the results of the evaluation of the EU ETV Pilot Programme. In addition to the above technical areas, the programme is also planned to cover: technologies for soil and groundwater monitoring and soil treatment, technologies and processes for cleaner production, technologies for limiting air pollution and monitoring and reducing emissions from stationary sources, environmental technologies for agriculture.   4. Implementation of and support for national smart specialisations (NSS) National smart specialisations are economic priorities determined by EU Member States and their regions in the area of research, development and innovation (R&D&I) under a given financial perspective. Smart specialisations are designed to contribute to the transformation of the national economy through modernisation, diversification of products and services, structural transformation and creation of innovative social and economic solutions. Analyses of endogenous economic advantages and cooperation with social and economic partners led to the establishment of a list of 15 national smart specialisations (effective from 1 January 2019), three of which are directly related to sustainable energy:  NSS 1. A healthy society  NSS 2. Innovative technologies, processes and products of the agri-food and forest wood sectors  NSS 3. Biotechnological and chemical processes, bio-products, specialty chemicals and environmental engineering products  NSS 4. High-efficiency, low-carbon and integrated energy generation, storage, transmission and distribution systems  NSS 5. Smart and energy-efficient building construction  NSS 6. Environment-friendly transport solutions  NSS 7. Circular economy  water, fossil fuels, waste  NSS 8. Multifunctional materials and composites with advanced properties, including nanoprocesses and nanoproducts  NSS 9. Sensors (including biosensors) and smart sensor networks  NSS 10. Smart ICT and geoinformation networks and technologies  NSS 11. Printed, organic and flexible electronics  NSS 12. Automation and robotics of technological processes  NSS 13. Photonics  NSS 14. Smart creative technologies  NSS 15. Innovative maritime technologies for specialised vessels, marine and coastal      III. Policies and measures - Dimension Research, innovation and competitiveness 127  structures and logistics based on maritime and inland waterway transport The result of the determination of NSSs is a system underlying the bottom-up creation of priority the development of the Polish economy is instrumental to the targeting of financial support to specialisations that are the most promising in developmental terms, thereby contributing to the improvement of innovation and competitiveness of the Polish economy and to the emergence of a knowledge-based economy.   5. Preparation and implementation of Technology Foresight of the Polish economy by 2040 The aim of Technology Foresight is to analyse the state of technological development of the Polish economy by 2040, identify technological trends and foresight technologies, and establish scenarios for the development of the Polish economy. Prior to foresight analysis, an analysis will be carried out of resources, activities and achievements of scientific units and enterprises in the field of technology development, as well as of technology trends. Technology Foresight of the Polish economy will contribute to the selection of the most competitive technological areas that will have a long-term impact on accelerating social and economic development and will be the areas of specialisation of the Polish economy towards 2040. The results of the analysis will form the basis for verifying and updating the list and descriptions of national smart specialisations. Thanks to this analysis, measures under National Smart Specialisation and the Responsible Development Strategy will be complemented with specific recommendations and actions aimed at implementing the vision of the future in the area of technology. b) Cooperation with other Member States in this area, including information on how the SET Plan objectives and policies are being translated to a national context. Responsible/involved parties*: MNiSW, MAP, MR, MFiPR * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. Cooperation with the European Commission and Member States as part of the SET-Plan Steering Group Due to the range of topics: science-energy-industry, Members States are represented in the Steering Group both by representatives of the ministries responsible for energy policy, and those responsible for research (Poland is represented by the representative of the Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education). At present, cooperation concerns primarily the participation in TWGs (temporary working groups), which are successively converted to IWGs (implementation working groups), the main task of which is to develop and then carry out implementation plans for the 10 key actions listed in the Commission Communication of 19 September 2015 on accelerating the European energy system transformation  an integrated SET Plan (C(2015) 6317). A total of 15 TWGs have been set up in line with the ten key areas specified in the aforementioned Communication (two different groups have been set up for the selected priorities in view of their complexity). Poland has joined two TWGs: TWG Ac   c) If applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including EU support and the use of EU funds. Responsible/involved parties*: MNiSW, MAP, MR, MI, MK, MFiPR 1. Obtaining of European funds by domestic research units and companies for research and innovation projects An analysis of the experience based on measures undertaken to day within the framework of the innovation policy conducted by Poland and the lessons learned from the implementation of the previous and current financial perspectives have highlighted the need to target support at areas that offer the greatest competition and innovation potential for the national economy. The current share  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Research, innovation and competitiveness 128  * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. of Polish entities in the Horizon 2020 framework research and innovation programme barely reaches 1%. Among the reasons for Poland's insufficient participation in framework programmes, one should point out, among others, the low capacity of Polish entities to generate projects that can successfully compete for European funding. The low level of this share is correlated with low national expenditures on research, development and innovation. On the basis of this experience, investments should be focused on areas ensuring an increase in the value added of the economy and its competitiveness in foreign markets. The basic instrument is support addressed to companies to enable them to undertake and develop (continue) R+D+I activities, owing to which companies will raise their competitiveness, relating to, among others, the following areas: - high-efficiency, low-carbon, flexible and integrated energy generation, storage, transmission and distribution systems; - smart and energy-efficient building technologies; - environment-friendly transport solutions; - minimisation of waste generation, including waste unfit for processing, and the use of waste for materials production and energy generation purposes (recycling and other forms of recovery). - research on clean coal technologies. At present, funding is provided to research and development projects that lead to innovations in the area of environmental and low-carbon technologies and technologies enabling an effective (economical) resource management. Innovative solutions to problems in the area of sustainable development, including low-carbon transport and renewable energy generation, identified by the public sector (e.g. through the pre-commercial public procurement mechanism) can also be developed. Moreover, the executive agency overseen by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education  the National Centre for Research and Development will subsidise the participation of Polish companies in R+D projects from the European Structural Funds, which should lead to carrying out between ten and twenty sector projects and research and innovation joint venture projects, including in the area of low-carbon emission technologies.   2. Energy storage facilities, including cells and batteries for electric vehicles The development of electromobility is consistent with the EU strategic direction presented in e.g. the Clean Mobility Package (an initiative related to batteries) and the European Commission Communication concerning innovations in the energy sector COM (2016) 763. This area must be covered by a support instrument as a market that is only at the stage of development. The solutions that are currently in operation are expensive acarried out in this area are characterised by a long payback period and a high-risk rate of return and therefore the private sector is not interested in investing on the required scale. New technologies in this area may have many applications, e.g. in the energy sector and in transport. 3. Support for the expansion of infrastructure for the distribution and sale of alternative fuels used in transport Alternative fuels are at an early stage of development or at the pilot or even experimental stage and therefore this area needs special financial support. Due to the low level of development of the    III. Policies and measures - Dimension Research, innovation and competitiveness 129  market, as well as the fact that it is a key element for bringing electric vehicles into universal use, vehicle charging and refueling infrastructure should be supported primarily from public funds. In all market analyses, the absence of infrastructure is indicated as the main barrier, and because of major differences in the profitability of projects carried out in various locations support should be provided in as flexible forms as possible. Poland intends to be an active partner in creating the European network of alternative fuel charging and refueling stations in accordance with the guidelines set out in Directive 2014/94/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure and the Clean Mobility Package published by the EC in November 2017. The Act on electromobility and alternative fuels implements Directive 2014/94/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure into Polish law. The act is to regulate the newly emerging market for the distribution and sale of alternative fuels used in transport and to enable the fulfilment of the obligation towards the EU. Due to the fact that air pollution and CO2 emission in Polish cities exceed pollution and emissions in most EU states, support should be sufficiently intense and instruments sufficiently flexible to ensure reasonably quick development of zero- and low-carbon transport. Due to increasing global competition in the market of alternative fuel vehicles and infrastructure and software for them, Poland finds it necessary to support domestic industry with public funds at this early stage of its development. This is consistent with the incentivising models for the so-called infant industries adopted in the world, as well as is underpinned in, among other things, the directions set in the EC Communication on accelerating clean energy innovation COM (2016) 763. 4. Implementation of the Power-to-Gas group technologies The implementation and development of Power-to-Gas technologies will make it possible to: - prevent electricity network congestion caused by over-generation of energy from the unstable operation of renewable sources; - optimise the use of the gas network (after power-to-gas transformation); - integrate the electricity and gas systems. The Power-to-Gas technology is currently used at an early stage of development. It should be assumed that the implementation of the technology on a scale having a real impact on the energy sector in Poland cannot be financed with the use of market mechanisms.   5. Construction of small-scale regasification plants with a cooling energy recovery module The purpose of the project is to construct a small-scale regasification plant with a cooling energy recovery module which might also operate as a plant supplying natural gas to make up for shortfalls in the transmission/distribution system. The implementation of the project would contribute to enhancing the flexibility of the operation of the transmission network and to improving the energy efficiency of the natural gas transmission system in Poland. The project enhances the use of LNG importing infrastructure and promotes the development of low-carbon energy sources. 6. Support for research and implementation projects relating to putting autonomous or partly autonomous alternative fuel vehicles into service The Act on electromobility and alternative fuels of 11 January 2018 introduces the possibility of using roads for testing autonomous vehicles, thus contributing to the development of this technology.  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Research, innovation and competitiveness 130  The issue of introducing autonomous vehicles into transport services has also raised interest in the European Commission, which in its report Autonomous cars: a big opportunity for European industry (published in January 2017 in Digital Transformation Monitor) indicated the main areas of benefits  not only for the European economy, but primarily for EU citizens. First of all, the improvement of safety should be mentioned (ADAS  Advanced Driving Assistance System) and the fact that smart and interconnected transport systems (ITS  Intelligent Transport Systems) will be brought into universal use, an expected effect of which is, among other things, the shortening of the time of transport of goods in the EU. The need to drive the vehicle being eliminated, semi-autonomous cars will save approximately one hour of spare time for the driver each day. In view of the above it is expected that part of work-related activities could be carried out already in the vehicle. In the opinion of some analysts, this may contribute to the improvement of employee productivity by as much as 10% to 15%. 7. Support for recycling batteries from electricity-fuelled vehicles This area needs to be covered by a support instrument as a market at the development stage. Electric vehicles have appeared on roads relatively recently and, consistently with European plans and the economic trend, their number will be growing. Taking into account the rare-earth materials from which batteries are made, the current and planned price and also the fact that they continue to preserve ca. 80% of their initial performance capacity, battery recycling is an area to develop. Moreover, recycling issues are also consistent with the sustainable growth and circular economy policies promoted in the European Union.   8. Use of mining waste and combustion by-products The minimisation of the impact on the environment, implying, among other things, the reduction of waste generation at source, must refer to the conditions and specific nature of particular industries. The mining industry has its characteristics and circular economy (circular economy, CE) targets should be adapted to them. The mining sector, by using natural resources as the main raw material, has limited possibilities of becoming a typical area of circular activities. In spite of this, mining companies, when conducting their medium- and long-term operations, should take into account those changes in the political, legislative and market environment which will affect their competitiveness, flexibility, efficiency and innovativeness in the future. In the mining sector, waste generation at source is reduced already at the stage of designing mineral exploitation as well as through the optimisation of the applied deposit mining technologies. Waste in the form of fly ash, slag, ash-and-slag mixture and reaction waste from exhaust gas treatment plants constitutes anthropogenic minerals (AM), whose pozzolanic and hydraulic properties have been known for years. They may and should be fully used by construction industry. Due to their specific properties, combustion by-products (CBP) and mining by-products may replace natural raw materials and thus reduce the need to mine them and emissions relating to this process. There is a great potential in Poland for using anthropogenic minerals in the process of mining site recultivation. This area will develop in Poland due to a considerable scale of mining (both deep and open-cast mining) in the recent decades and growing pressure to restore environmental conditions in mining areas and thus to increase their potential to be used for other purposes.  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Research, innovation and competitiveness 131    9. Creation of investment areas at former mining sites Development of former mining sites to assign them new economic functions along with a possibility of promoting them. Former mining sites are attractive in economic terms due to their location (agglomeration centres, vicinity of motorways) and the fact that they have utilities infrastructure, railway sidings, are zoned industrial in local zoning plans and occupy large areas. Possible measures in this respect will consist in the comprehensive preparation of sites for economic activity. The purpose will be to prepare investment sites, including economic activity zones, to be used for the needs of potential investors. Projects may be carried out that consist of the comprehensive preparation of an investment site, . recultivating or securing former mining sites (e.g.: landslides), site levelling, providing or supplementing infrastructure (i.e. sewage and rainwater systems, water supply networks and power, heat supply, telecommunications or gas supply networks etc.). Expenditures on internal transport infrastructure (internal roads) should be treated as a complementary element of the project and thus may only account for a smaller portion of the project budget. Investments in the information technology infrastructure (ITI) are permissible if they are necessary to provide comprehensive infrastructure for the investment site. They may consist in providing a telecommunications and data transmission network while excluding the site on which the investment project is being carried out. 10. Support for the producers of means of transport using alternative fuels Due to increasing global competition in the market of alternative fuel vehicles, Poland finds it necessary to support domestic industry with public funds at the early stage of its development. The main instruments stimulating the development of vehicle production should be repayable mechanisms, such as loans, capital entries and the acquisition of bonds. Non-repayable instruments should be applied only in exceptional and justified cases, particularly in relation to minor investment projects where the grant component is the final element completing the financial setup.     10. Supporting national research on clean coal technologies (CCT) EU climate and energy policy will affect the competitiveness of coal-fired power generation. One of the promising solutions is the alternative use of coal, i.e. a shift from normal combustion in power boilers to coal gasification and the use of the resultant synthesis gas to obtain methanol or hydrogen. The resulting products can be used to generate electricity using innovative IGCC systems, and in further stages also to power fuel cells or hydrogen cells. The use of clean coal technologies brings multiple benefits, such as: - ensuring greater energy security of the State, - diversification of raw materials for the domestic chemical industry, - technological development that will have an impact on economic development and improvement of Poland's competitiveness.   12. New directions of hydrogen use According to the assumptions of the draft Programme of Hydrogen Technology Development in Poland, the use of hydrogen serves three main purposes:  increasing the competitiveness of energy companies;    III. Policies and measures - Dimension Research, innovation and competitiveness 132   increasing energy security;  maximising gains for the Polish economy in connection with changes in the energy sector. The above mentioned Programme outlines the directions and potential opportunities for the use of hydrogen in, amongst others, the power industry and transport. One of the uses of hydrogen is to obtain a chemical element from a power-to-gas (P2G) installation, where redundant electricity can be used to produce hydrogen (typically produced from water in the electrolysis process). Currently, the hydrogen obtained in this way has three uses:  it is used in natural gas networks as a process input or, in pure form, in fuel cells;  for the conversion of carbon dioxide into methane; the resulting gas can either be fed directly into the grid or used to produce electricity (through a cogeneration module);  for the improvement of biogas quality, which is a promising way of increasing the use of biomethane and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Another way is to produce hydrogen-based liquid fuels (P2L), which can be CO2-neutral and contribute to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions while staying liquid. Liquid form makes energy transport and storage a much easier task. An option to use fuel cells and hydrogen for prosumer power generation, as elements of small hybrid systems connected to the power grid or operating in island mode is an interesting alternative avenue of development.
