Business4Climate is an innovative idea developed in 2017-2018 by Cyprus Employers and Industrialist Federation, in collaboration with the Cyprus University of Technology (scientific advisor) and the Department of the Environment. Climate4Climate initiative was developed as a pilot project to demonstrate how Cypriot enterprises can voluntarily commit and take action against climate change. Enterprises (other than those involved in the ETS) participating in the project have to sign of a voluntary declaration, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 8% by 2030. Up to date the declaration has been signed by 64 enterprises. It is foreseen that the implementation of the energy efficiency measures will start in 2020. It was decided that incentives are required for participating the enterprises in the project and step up their emissions reduction efforts by 2030. For mobilizing the enterprises, supporting schemes are under preparation from the Department of Environment, utilizing national funds. It is anticipated that the first supporting scheme will be in place in 2020. Enterprise that will manage to reduce their emissions, will receive as a reward, for each tCO2eq. reduced in a specific year, the Carbon Market Price in that specific year.   he period 2020-2022 Currently not available  14 Action plan for the road To be implemented during the period 2021-2030 as per paragraph 2.2.v:   implementati the measure will continue in 2024-Estimated Budget (only for modal shift)  1.890+11..003 for Private transpor57t 132  transport sector.  1.Modal Shift: Modal share of all modes of transport are set/will be set targets in the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans and the National Strategic Plan Actions/ measures include:  buses, etc.).  ding of infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists and public transport.  parking policy.    ation of high-quality public transport axes for other cities. 2.

Description of policy and measures to promote energy services in the public sector and measures to remove regulatory and non-regulatory barriers that impede the uptake of energy performance contracting and other energy efficiency service models lack of technical expertise, especially in preparing and managing public tenders. There is already an interest on the supply side (there are 19 ESCOs registered), the legal framework has been created, including supporting documents, awareness raising is ongoing and a number of projects are expected to be initiated soon. For further developing the energy service market in Cyprus, MECI, with technical assistance -term strategy for mobilising investment in renovating Cypr58and one by GIZ titled 59, that looked into the barriers that hinder the development of the ESCO market in Cyprus. These studies provide a list of solutions, measures and actions that can be taken by MECI in order to overcome these barriers. Among the finding are the lack of appropriate forms of finance, the lack of standardization, the inexperience of actors, the mistrust from the (potential) clients, the perceived business and technical risk, the small size of the projects and the high transaction costs, as well as need to remove procurement hurdles for energy efficiency services in the public sector. Some of these solutions will be taken forward within the period 2021-2030. Specific actions will include, inter alia, targeted trainings and capacity building of involved actors, information dissemination about the benefits of energy service contracts and opportunities for ESCOs to implement the outcomes of the obligatory energy audits performed by non-SME. There will also be an opportunity for ESCOs to participate in the energy efficiency obligation scheme via an electronic platform that will offer trading system for energy savings. The next update of the NECP will include more information on specific measures introduced about the above-mentioned.                                                             58http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/EnergySe.nsf/All/7E8188C6CD612FB5C22581C4002CD533/$file/Study%20Results%20Final%20Report%20Long%20trem%20strategy%20for%20mobilizing%20investments%20for%20renovating%20Cyprus%20national%20building%20stock.pdf 59http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/EnergySe.nsf/All/B5969066F97FB710C22581D80035DB7F/$file/Study%20results-%20Developing%20a%20national%20Energy%20Efficiency%20Strategy%20up%20to%202050.pdf 136  Especially for the public sector, an additional technical assistance from SRSS has been provided to the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Works (MTCW)60. Under Deliverable 4 of this project, a Guide on Energy Performance tendering specifications for the public sector has been prepared. MECI is currently preparing template procurement documents especially for Energy Performance Contracts in the Public Sector. The availability of these templates will be a positive step for promoting energy services and Energy Performance Contracts in the Public Sector. These documents will be communicated to public and wider public authorities in order to facilitate them, accompanied with a brief step by step guide for each tendering procedure.  3.2.1.4. iv. Other planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030 as well as other objectives referred to in point 2.2 (for example measures to promote the exemplary role of public buildings and energy-efficient public procurement, measures to promote energy audits and energy management systems, consumer information and training measures, and other measures to promote energy efficiency) With regards to energy efficiency in public procurement, MECI will strengthen monitoring related to purchasing highly efficient products and buildings by the central government. The monitoring will be implemented by requesting all central government authorities to inform MECI (every 3 years) about contracts signed in each calendar year that include provisions for high-energy-efficient products, services or buildings.  The main barriers identified that prevent a broader uptake of energy efficiency measures (such as limited financing, limited interest of final consumers for investing in energy efficiency, lack of spit incentives between tenants and owners in buildings, not fully functional market for energy services) will be adequately addressed in the post 2020 period. The measures will include, inter alia, adjustments in the existing legislative framework, development of guidance documents, targeted actions to increase of public awareness on the benefits of energy efficiency interventions, such as information campaigns and provision of training to selected target groups etc. Emphasis will be given on standardizing procurement procedures for energy services in public sector, as described in paragraph 3.2.iii Moreover, energy audits and energy management systems will be further promoted by providing targeted information to enterprises though workshops and seminars. In this area cooperation with other stakeholders will be strengthened and the energy efficiency network for businesses, established under the Business4 Climate initiative, will be utilized. With respect to the enterprises that are obliged to perform energy audits, MECI will strengthen compliance checks.                                                             60 Technical Assistance to the Cyprus Ministry of Transport, Communication and Works on Energy Performance Contracting, new energy efficient technologies and Cogeneration for public buildings 137  MECI will also consider measures for implementing the suggestions of the energy audit reports, such as directly linking of energy audit recommendations with support schemes (either with the direct financing of the enterprises or via energy service projects). Although the structure of the small domestic energy market currently does not leave big room for competition among energy suppliers, the introduction of the energy efficiency obligation scheme is expected to foster and accelerate the establishment of a functioning national energy service market. The existing regulatory provisions with regard to the building codes, energy performance certificates, will be further enhanced in terms of increasing monitoring and implementation. Capacity building activities for various stakeholders groups (e.g. building installers, energy managers, lawyers, bankers) will be designed to support the development and strengthening the capacities of individuals and institutions for the broader uptake of energy efficiency measures. Moreover, the introduction of standardised tools and procedures as well as electronic databases, online registries and communication platforms for energy efficiency professionals, are considered important. Such instruments will be operational in the post 2020 period and they will contribute to better monitoring the quality of services provided by the professionals in the energy efficiency sector.  However, the most important barrier for the achievement of the planned savings is the limited available budget. The private sector has been accustomed to be responsive only when a significant public subsidy is available, while the public sector tends to request full upfront capital coverage. For this reason, the transition to a more market-oriented financial support scheme will be definitely a challenge and a careful planning along with the mobilization of the appropriate financial and market instruments will be required. The aim from the side of the State is not to reduce its overall share in the support of the energy efficiency interventions, but mainly to drive the public financial resources to more cost-efficient support instruments and types of energy efficiency interventions with a higher leverage. All financing instruments will be designed to be cost-attractive as well as implementable in market terms. Programs with a fast market uptake (i.e. roof insulation, heat pumps, solar thermal) allowing both comprehensive and stand-alone interventions will be prioritized. The Energy Efficiency Obligation Schemes will bridge the regulatory and financial gaps to allow an upscale of the deemed beneficiaries.  Scaling up investments in the post 2020 period will require more private financing and more market- is the first step towards a more market-oriented financial support scheme. The success or not of this fund is closely associated with the involvement and cooperation with the domestic banking sector.  More information on specific measures introduced on the above-mentioned will be included in the next update of the NECP.  138  3.2.1.5. v. Where applicable, a description of policies and measures to promote the role of local renewable energy communities in contributing to the implementation of policies and measures in points i, ii, iii and iv Currently not applicable. This will be further examined in the revision of the NECP. Several workshops61 took place in Cyprus and various ideas and best practices, where exchange with other Member States. During the workshops it was highlighted that new obligation that arise from the new Directives will need to revise legislation, develop new tools and introduce new disruptive technologies and new concepts that will alert the end consumer to participate actively in the energy community.  3.2.1.6. vi. Description of measures to develop measures to utilise energy efficiency potentials of gas and electricity infrastructure RD) 02/2018  cation of a binding timetable for the mass installation and operation by the Distribution System Operator (DSO) of Smart Metering regulatory decision, the DSO has submitted a timetable for the implementation of the project, where based on the latest update from the DSO he is currently in the process of recruiting a consultant to help him implement the tasks. It is noted that on the basis of point 4 of the RD and the fact that Directive 2019/944 on common rules for the internal market for electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU, final customers are equipped with smart metering systems as provided by the new directive, in order to avoid the subsequent requirement for corrective measures, which may increase progress of this project, half-yearly progress reports will be submitted to CERA. Regarding any other measures and policies planned to be implemented during the period 2021-2030 that could contribute to the energy upgrade of the electricity infrastructure, a study was carried out by an external consultant (RSE) with the participation of MECI, the infrastructure, in particular with regard to transport, distribution, load management and interoperability, as well as the connection with power plants, including the possibility of mentioned among other things that "the level of efficiency of the electricity system in  Given the above, it has emerged that there is no need for any measures to reduce losses and some of the measures recommended by the consultant are already implemented by the DSO. One of the measure of the consultant was the increase of the level of the network voltage, which has been already adopted since many years by the DSO, with the practice                                                            61 FOSS Workshop , May 8, 2019 Energy Communities and Operational functional needs 139  adopted being that for new connections 22 kV is used and for existing connections when and where the DSO considers it necessary an upgrade from 11 kV to 22 kV is performed. Therefore, on the basis of the above, a timetable for upgrading predefined areas from 11 kV to 22 kV has not been elaborated. However, CERA has proceeded with a series of actions that may not directly target the energy upgrade of electricity infrastructures, but will allow more efficient use of the network by the consumers and better management by the DSO and TSO. These actions are listed below:  Issuance of regulatory decision 02/2019  Adminiselaboration of a thorough techno-economic study for the redesign of the transmission system and distribution system 2021-submit a study for the redesign of the system by the DSO and the TSO so that, among other things, it is possible to install more RES-E and eliminate the problems of lack of power absorption of new RES-E.

Regional cooperation in this area, where applicable The EU Cross-Border Operational Program "Greece-Cyprus" enhances regional cooperation since it aims at economic and social development along the maritime border between Greece and Cyprus. The vision for the Cooperation Area is to highlight the region as a pole of sustainable development in the wider South Eastern Mediterranean region in the direction of enhancing competitiveness. Under the European Regional Cooperation Program Interreg V-A GREECE CYPRUS 2013-2020, projects aiming on increasing the energy efficiency have been approved and are being implemented. The projects are financed 85% by the European Regional Development Fund and 15% by National Resources of Greece and Cyprus.  common - in the cross-border area - strategy for integrating the buildings of the public and wider public sector by 2030 and actions and measures related to the improvement of energy efficiency.

The academic / research community uses large data centers that consume large amounts of energy. The energy needs of the universities in Crete and Cyprus are very high and the cost of purchasing electricity is an important part of their operating costs. In addition, the geographical location of both Crete and Cyprus with high temperatures most of the year, make the use of heat exchangers in data centers necessary. The aim of the project is to apply methods for maximizing the energy efficiency and the smart energy management. At the same time, photovoltaics systems will be installed for generating a significant part of the electricity needed in the universities. In Cyprus the project concerns the installation and operation of RES and smart energy management systems in one complex of buildings in the University of Cyprus in Nicosia.
