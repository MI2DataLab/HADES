169 (199) 5.  IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF PLANNED INSTRUMENTS AND MEASURES  5.1 Effects of planned instruments and measures as described under Heading 3 on energy systems and emissions and removals of greenhouse gases, and comparison with projections on the basis of existing instruments and measures (according to the description under Heading 4).  5.1.1 Development forecasts relating to energy systems and emissions and removals of greenhouse gases and, if relevant, emissions of atmospheric pollutants in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/2284 in line with planned instruments and measures, for at least the ten-year period following the period covered by the plan (including the last year of the period covered by the plan), including relevant instruments and measures at Union level. The Swedish parliament has adopted a climate policy framework for Sweden, see Heading 1.2, in order to ensure that ambitious climate objectives are set, that the government will plan and take decisions to achieve the objectives, that the government and parliament follow up on  overall policies.268 A climate action plan is to be submitted for each term of office. Accounting and follow-up is to be carried out annually and the development of instruments and measures is to take place on an ongoing basis. Sweden thus has a system in place for achieving the climate objectives set, but has yet to plan all of the instruments required to achieve those objectives.  For the purpose of following up and improving some of the most important instruments implemented, Sweden is also working on what are known as control stations at intervals of one or more years. The purpose of these control stations is to continuously evaluate these instruments and, if necessary, adjust them.  Fuel switching/reduction obligation scheme On 28 June 2018, the government invited the Swedish Energy Agency to investigate and submit proposals on reduction levels for the period 2021 to 2030, whether a joint reduction level for petrol and diesel fuel should be introduced, and whether pure and high-blended liquid biofuels should be covered by the reduction obligation scheme or should continue to be promoted by way of a tax exemption. The Agency was also to investigate whether it was possible for the reduction obligation scheme to be made more cost-effective. The Agency reported on this issue on 4 June 2019 and supplemented the report on 25 October 2019. The process for establishing                                                       268 Bill No 2016/17:146, Report No 2016/17:MJU24, Parliamentary Letter No 296/17:320. 170 (199) progressively higher reduction levels for the years following 2020 is currently under way before the Government Offices and is expected to be completed during 2020.  The aim of the reduction obligation scheme is to reduce petrol and diesel emissions by blending them with biofuels having low life-cycle emissions. The amount of energy from biofuels required to meet the obligation is determined by the life-cycle emissions of the biofuels used. The higher the life-cycle emissions, the greater the volume of biofuels required for blending, and vice versa. The extent to which the use of fossil fuels decreases as a result of this obligation scheme is therefore not just determined by the reduction levels set for each year, but also by the biofuels used.  The amount of energy from biofuels required to meet the obligation is also determined by the amount of energy from fossil fuels used. Measures relating to energy efficiency, a transport-efficient society, and the electrification of the transport sector reduce the amount of energy from fuels covered by the obligation scheme. The reduction obligation scheme interacts with other instruments in this way, such as the bonus-penalty system that contributes towards increased electrification of the transport sector.  5.1.2 Assessment of the interaction between instruments (between existing and planned instruments and measures with a political dimension and between existing and planned instruments and measures with various dimensions) until at least the last year of the period covered by the plan, particularly in order to provide a solid understanding of the effects of energy efficiency and energy saving measures on the size of the energy system and in order to reduce the risk of unnecessary energy supply investments. The aim of sectoral energy efficiency strategies, see Heading 1.2, which are designed to help achieve the target of 50% more efficient energy use by 2030, is to establish dialogue at an early stage between the Swedish Energy Agency, various different sectors and relevant authorities on matters relating to appropriate indicative objectives and measures in each sector for contributing, in a cost-effective manner, towards achieving the national energy and climate targets. As a result of this work, carried out in association with relevant authorities and sectoral operators, a broad consensus can be reached, while also ensuring that those operators become increasingly engaged when implementing national policy. The key starting point for developing these sectoral strategies is the target of 50% more efficient energy use in Sweden in 2030 compared to 2005, but consideration is also to be given to the target of 100% renewable electricity production by 2040. These strategies must also take into account that Sweden is to have zero net emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by 2045 at the latest, in 171 (199) order to subsequently achieve negative emissions, and that the target for the transport sector is a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2010.  5.1.3 iii) Assessment of the interaction between existing and planned national instruments and measures, and between those instruments and measures and the climate and energy policy measures of the European Union.  Interaction between instruments and measures for air and climate Atmospheric pollutants and climate change are closely interlinked in many respects and represent a challenging area, due to their effects at both regional and global level. Future climate change will affect atmospheric pollutant concentrations, distribution patterns, depositions and exposure. The magnitude of these effects and the direction they take will depend on the evolution of climate change, amongst other things. In parallel with this, there are a number of atmospheric pollutants that have a climate-altering effect.  As emissions often come from the same societal activities, there is a strong incentive to coordinate strategies for air and climate measures and instruments in order to maximise environmental benefits. Ambitious action on climate change is crucially important in order to exploit synergies, avoid conflicts between objectives, and reduce costs for society as a whole. Air pollution control policy needs further development in a manner integrated with both climate policy and energy policy in order to be as effective as possible.  Energy efficiency and energy saving measures across various different sectors of society, including, for example, industry, transport, heating of premises and housing, and product performance, offer numerous opportunities for air and climate synergies. If Sweden achieves its target of increasing energy efficiency by 50% from 2005 to 2030, this may have positive effects on various different environmental areas.  Pursuant to the National Emissions Ceilings Directive269, Sweden is committed to reducing emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants. According to the latest estimates, Sweden will need to implement further measures to reduce emissions of ammonia by 2020 and nitrogen oxides by 2030270. With regard to environmental quality standards for outdoor air271                                                       269 Directive (EU) 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2016 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants, amending Directive 2003/35/EC and repealing Directive 2001/81/EC. 270 Environmental Protection Agency  Air pollution control programme  Draft strategy for cleaner air in Sweden (NV-06767-17). 271 Air Quality Regulation (2010:477). 172 (199) 272, a number of measures are needed in order to cut concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter (PM10) in congested areas. In order to be able to additionally meet the long-term generational goal of environmental policy, additional air pollution control measures to improve air quality273 and reduce depositions of acidifying and eutrophifying air pollution will also be needed to protect human health and the environment. In March 2019, the Swedish government adopted a National air pollution control programme that describes how Sweden plans to implement measures and instruments to satisfy the emissions reduction requirement set out by the National Emissions Ceilings Directive. It is crucially important that the periodic synergies with action on climate change.  The transport and use of bioenergy represent two areas of particular strategic importance in terms of potential synergies and conflicts between air pollution control and climate.  Developments within the transport sector will be crucial in terms of opof nitrogen oxides, but this will also affect progress in respect of other pollution control programme identified measures for achieving the 2030 climate target for the transport sector, as part of the measures covered by the Air pollution control programme to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides. Trends in emissions of nitrogen oxides will be strongly dependent on what proportion of the vehicle fleet is powered by internal combustion engines, particularly diesel engines, in the period to 2030. Positive measures for reducing emissions of both atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gases include increased electrification of the vehicle fleet, a more transport-efficient society, and energy efficiency.  Future strengthening of common EU rules on the CO2 requirement for light-duty vehicles and the introduction of corresponding requirements for heavy duty vehicles will also create positive synergistic effects on emissions of nitrogen oxides by 2025 and 2030. In practice, this requirement entails widespread introduction of electric vehicles.  Increased biomass consumption contributes towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, but may entail negative effects on air quality. During biomass combustion, emissions of atmospheric pollutants, including, but not limited to, particulate matter, black carbon, benzo(a)pyrene and                                                       272 Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe. 273 Here, particularly important atmospheric pollutants include particulate matter, black carbon, ground-level ozone and benzo(a)pyrene. 173 (199) nitrogen oxides, may increase if they are not offset by exhaust gas cleaning.  A transition to biofuels in the vehicle fleet reduces greenhouse gas emissions but does not help reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides. Emissions of nitrogen oxides from diesel cars run on fossil diesel are approximately the same as from diesel cars run on biodiesel. Emissions of nitrogen oxides from cars run on biogas are slightly lower. Therefore, in order to satisfy is important to have a more transport-efficient society and increased   5.2 Macroeconomic and  as far as possible  health, environmental, educational, skills-related and social consequences, including with regard to fair transition (in terms of costs, benefits and cost efficiency) of planned instruments and measures as referred to under Heading 3, until at least the last year of the period covered by the plan, including a comparison with projections based on existing instruments and measures. It has been highlighted in several reports that the costs of climate change for society may be very high. Perhaps the best known of these is called the Stern Review274, which was published in 2006 and is named for its lead author, Sir Nicholas Stern. In his report, Stern notes that if the world does not take action, the overall long-term costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5% of global GDP each year, now and forever. If a wider range of risks and impacts is taken into account, the estimates of repeated in a research article from 2015 and elsewhere. The negative effects would impact a wide range of stakeholders. From a global perspective, the Swedish government believes that meeting these targets is also a step towards equality, as, in many countries, women are generally more at risk from climate change, work in more exposed environments, and suffer to a greater extent than men from the disasters caused by climate change. Limiting global warming also contributes, in a positive way, towards achieving several other environmental quality targets. The environmental quality targets that are most affected by climate change, either directly or indirectly, are those relating to air, eutrophication and biodiversity.  -term climate objectives primarily depend on how the objectives are achieved and under what conditions. The ease or difficulty with which targets are achieved depends on factors such as technological development and behavioural changes, which are difficult to predict. For example, digitalisation may                                                       274 Stern, Nicholas  Review on the Economics of Climate Change (2006). 174 (199) accelerate and facilitate development that helps achieve climate targets. If the rest of the world does not adapt, the cost of achieving Swedish climate targets increases. The positive consequences of climate change adaptation in Sweden may also be diminished if the rest of the world does not adapt, for example the possibility of exporting Swedish climate solutions and environmental technologies may be restricted.  In its two reports A climate policy framework for Sweden (SOU 2016:21) and A climate and air pollution control strategy for Sweden (SOU 2016:47), the Environmental Objectives Council, see Heading 1.3, compiled a number of estimates of the socio-economic consequences of achieving the milestone targets for 2030 and 2040, the milestone target for the transport sector, and the long-term emissions target. Many of these estimates were obtained using different models, which, in turn, have different points of focus and are based on different assumptions relating, amongst other things, to the structure of the instruments and global developments, as well as links between different parts of the economy. This means that, although the results of the model calculations are not directly comparable with one another, they can help create an overall picture of the socio-economic consequences.  With regard to the milestone target for 2030, the Environmental Objectives Council entrusted the task of calculating the socio-economic costs275 to the National Institute of Economic Research based on a number of assumptions identified by the Council. The assumptions mainly relate to the transport sector, for example future energy efficiency. On the basis of these assumptions, calculations show that a cost-effective climate policy for the milestone target, compared with a less ambitious climate target, may result in a GDP in 2030 that is 0.2 to 1.5% lower than the baseline scenario. However, the National Institute of Economic Research stresses that there is a great deal of uncertainty associated with the calculations and that some costs are not represented in the results. Moreover, the National Institute of Economic Research considers that a more accurate cost estimate cannot be provided until an instruments package has been developed. The Environmental Objectives Council considers that the possibility of using complementary measures may help reduce the costs of achieving the milestone target, as well as other climate targets. Furthermore, the possibility of using complementary measures should also help reduce the costs of achieving other milestone targets.  The consequences of achieving the milestone target in the transport sector are comparable to the consequences of the milestone target for 2030, as the instruments and measures used to meet those targets are substantially the same. There is an even greater degree of uncertainty in the calculations surrounding the milestone target for 2040 and the long-term emissions                                                       275 SOU 2016:47 175 (199) target. How those consequences will affect various different stakeholders depends on the structure of future instruments and on global developments. Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector must be reduced considerably. The stakeholders that are most dependent on the transport sector today may be affected to a relatively greater degree, unless this is offset by technological developments that make climate-smart transport cheaper and more accessible. Therefore, research and innovation are required in order to facilitate the development of climate-smart transport, in parallel with a policy to help make alternatives available. For example, continued digitalisation may provide an alternative to physical resources and also contribute to efficiency gains within the transport sector, due, for example, to improved logistical solutions and more efficient traffic management.  With regard to industry in general, climate change adaptation in Sweden and worldwide will result in benefits for certain sectors, while others may be negatively affected. Services and products that are more climate-friendly will provide advantages over more emissions-intensive competitors. Similarly, climate change adaptation will affect the labour market by creating new jobs in companies and sectors with low emissions intensity or that offer sustainable solutions, for example as a result of an increased production of bio-based fuels and agricultural materials to replace products made from fossil raw materials. Since the long-term target covers greenhouse gas emissions from all activities in Sweden, this may also have an impact on industries currently operating under the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Milestone targets do not cover the trading sector, however, meaning that the medium-term consequences for industry primarily concern developments within the trading system. The long-term emissions target, which also includes emissions falling under the EU ETS, requires a more ambitious approach in the EU ETS. The strengthening of this system must be carried out in such a way as to avoid increasing the risk of carbon leakage. While a policy for achieving climate targets may have a positive effect on attaining several other environmental quality targets, for example with regard to Clean air and A good built environment, there may also be conflicts between targets based on the manner in which climate change adaptation occurs.  5.3 Overview of investment needs  5.3.1 Existing investment flows and assumptions on future investment with regard to planned instruments and measures.  Investments in electricity production The results of the calculation under this heading are based on the EU -term 176 (199) scenarios276. The outcome will be different if a similar analysis is carried out for any of the other scenarios in the report.  In the model calculations, investments are made in a large number of electricity production technologies (for example various different classes of wind power technology). The respective production technologies were first evaluated individually and then in the following main groups: hydroelectric power, nuclear power, cogeneration (within district heating systems), industrial back pressure, wind power, solar electricity, condensate production and gas turbines. The model only covers investments in electricity production. Any capital costs for existing production facilities that have yet to be written off are not included in the model.  Figure 39 shows new investments in production capacity for each model year277.  Figure 39. Investments in capacity (additional GW per five-year period).   Source Target GW/5 år GW/five-year period Period 2020 2020 period Vattenkraft Hydroelectric power Ind mottryck Ind. back pressure Kondens+gasturbin Condens.+gas turbines Kärnkraft Nuclear power Vindkraft Wind power Kraftvärme Cogeneration Solel Solar electricity                                                        276 Swedish Energy Agency   277 In practice, each model year relates to a period of five years, i.e. the model year 2030 covers, for example, years 2027.5-2032.5. The investments shown in the figure are thus made during a five-year period, rather than in each year covered by the five-year period in question. For example, this means that, between 2037.5 and 2042.5, investments corresponding to approximately 12 GW are made in electricity production. 177 (199) Source: Swedish Energy Agency.  It should be noted that no indication as to total installed capacity can be inferred from investments in capacity. The sum of new investments over a longer period may exceed the installed capacity. Some investments are in fact made in order to replace previous investments that have expired as a result of the age limit (the technical lifespan) and that have different utilisation timeframes (i.e. different energy-to-capacity ratios). Nuclear power investments are made in order to extend that lifespan, from a technical lifespan of 35 years to 60 years.  Figure 40 shows investments in monetary terms. It is assumed that the entire investment is charged to the model year in which it is made. This refers to the immediate investment cost, i.e. the investment costs excluding interest costs during the construction period. As in Figure 39, each model year actually represents a five-year period. The investment is charged during this period. In order to obtain the annual investment during a certain year, divide the five-year period (model year) that includes the year in question by five.  Figure 40. Investments in millions of SEK per five-year period, charged to the model years (five-year period) during which the investment is     Source Target  -year period) Period 2020 2020 period Vattenkraft Hydroelectric power Ind mottryck Ind. back pressure Kondens+gasturbin Condens.+gas turbines Kärnkraft Nuclear power Vindkraft Wind power Kraftvärme Cogeneration Solel Solar electricity  178 (199) Source: Swedish Energy Agency.  Despite the fact that investments in cogeneration capacity, expressed in GW, are lower than investments in wind power, for example (see Figure 39), the difference calculated in terms of monetary investment, in SEK, between wind power and cogeneration is much smaller. This is because the entire cogeneration investment is allocated to electricity production, including investments for district heating production. For waste-based cogeneration, for example, the specific investment cost is thus very high per unit of electricity. If some of the investment cost is allocated to heat production, which may be reasonable, then, naturally, a reduced cost is allocated to electricity production. However, there is no clear, objective answer as to how such allocation is to be carried out.  An alternative method of calculating investments is to annualise278 them over the economic lifecycle of each investment and according to its imputed interest. This is shown in Figure 41, where each individual investment is annualised and allocated to its respective technology group. In other words, the annualised investment cost is the same as the annual capital cost. It is the individual calendar year that is relevant here, rather than the five-year periods given in Figure 40. The costs associated with historical investments, where parts of the economic lifecycle remain to be charged, are not included here. It is thus not a total capital cost for electricity production that is shown, but merely new investments from 2020 onwards, albeit not those in respect of which a decision to adopt has already been made. Therefore, it is not possible on the basis of Figure 41 to establish whether the total capital costs associated with electricity production will increase or decrease in the long term.                                                                   278 An annualised cost is an annual cost (payment) that includes both an interest cost (based on the imputed interest) and an amortisation. As a result of this annualisation, the investment is thus repaid in equal instalments each year (the annual cost) over the economic lifecycle of the investment. 179 (199) Figure 41. Investments in millions of SEK/year annualised over the economic lifecycle and based on the imputed intereincluded here).

The annualised investments increase over time, as investments are made on an ongoing basis (but to varying degrees in accordance with Figure 39) over the calculation period. This means that the annualisations accumulate, that is to say that the annualisation of new investments during model year x is added to the annualisations resulting from investments made during the preceding model years (x-1, x-2, etc). Written-off investments that no longer contribute to the sum of annualised investments serve to counteract an increase over time. The fact that the growth rate of the annualised investments decreases towards the end of the calculation period, for example with regard to solar electricity and wind power, may be interpreted as meaning that new investments are largely offset by written-off investments that no longer entail any capital cost.  Investments in the national grid There are four main driving forces behind network (national grid) investments:   Connection of new electricity production, with the majority 180 (199) consisting of new wind power. The greatest volume of wind power is expected to be connected in the north of Sweden.  The increased need for connections between the Nordic countries and between the Nordic countries and continental Europe.  Considerable increases in consumption in metropolitan areas result in substantial network investments in order to secure the supply of electricity to these areas. Together with the expected phase-out of nuclear power in the south of Sweden, this also from north to south.  Network development is also driven by the need for reinvestments. The oldest parts of the Swedish national grid will need to be renewed over the coming decades.  The network investments reported in the System Development Plan279 during the planning period for the years 2018-2027 amount to SEK 60 billion, of which SEK 45 billion is expected to be paid out during the planning period for the years 2018-2027. Of this sum, SEK 22 billion is made up of reinvestments in existing stations and lines, with the remaining SEK 23 billion consisting of new investments, see Figure 42 and Figure 43.

In 2016, Nordic Energy Research, the platform for joint energy research and policy development under the Nordic Council of Ministers and financed jointly by the Nordic governments, published the report Nordic Energy Technology Perspectives 2016281 in collaboration with the International Energy Agency, and a report into regional long-term, cost-effective, low-carbon emissions technology roadmaps for the Nordic countries. The study provides a detailed scenario-based analysis into how the Nordic countries can achieve a near carbon-neutral energy system in 2050 (Carbon Neutral Scenario, CNS), and compares this with a Nordic 4°C Scenario Scenario.  The analysis carried out in Nordic Energy Technology Perspectives 2016 is centred on a scenario where Nordic energy-related CO2 emissions drop by 85% by 2050. The name  the Carbon Neutral Scenario (CNS)  reflects wording used in official targets, although carbon neutrality requires offsets to be used for the remaining 15%. The roadmap for CO2 reduction established in the CNS scenario should therefore be seen as a minimum requirement. In order to limit global warming to 1.5°C, in line with the Declaration on Nordic Carbon Neutrality from January 2019282, it is likely that additional measures will be needed in order to reduce emissions.  Nordic Energy Research has also drafted a follow-up report on progress towards carbon neutrality in the Nordic countries: Tracking Nordic Clean Energy Progress 2019283. The report tracks Nordic progress towards a carbon-neutral society by highlighting major trends and examples where Nordic solutions may have a global impact. The report was launched in October 2019. Some of the most important results from the report include:   For the period 2013 to 2016, the Nordic countries are on track to achieve carbon neutrality, even with higher than expected GDP growth, but it is likely that further measures will be needed to continue this trend.   The positive trend is seen mainly in the power and heating sectors, which contribute with significant reductions in CO2 emissions, from 60.7 MtCO2 in 2007 to 37.4 MtCO2 in 2016, in line with the intermediate CNS target of 19.2 MtCO2 in 2030.                                                        281 https://www.nordicenergy.org/project/nordic-energy-technology-perspectives/. 282 https://www.regeringen.se/48febb/contentassets/afd1e82263dc4fbba6a1b0c15357faee/declaration-on-nordic-climate-neutrality. 283 https://www.nordicenergy.org/publications/tracking-nordic-clean-energy-progress/ 183 (199)  The share of renewable energy in total energy input for the Nordic countries combined increased from 29% in 2006 to 39% in 2016.   The share of electric vehicles in the light-duty vehicle fleet is on track for the 2020 level of 4.1%, in line with the Carbon Neutral Scenario (CNS).   For particularly challenging sectors, it is noted that:  o Energy consumption and emissions in the industry sector have decreased, but it is difficult to reduce process emissions.  o - (transport), and sustainability remains a challenge.  o CCS must be demonstrated on a large scale.
