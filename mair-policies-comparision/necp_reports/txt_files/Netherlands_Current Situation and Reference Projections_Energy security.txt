4.4 Energy security dimension As discussed in Section 4.2, the energy mix is expected to change in the coming decade. The consumption of natural gas and coal will decrease, while the use of renewable sources will increase. The national and international transport of electricity will rise as a result of the increase in renewable electricity generation and the (partially resulting) price developments. This will necessitate modifications to the electricity and gas network (see Section 4.5). This section discusses the trends and projections based on the KEV per energy carrier. 4.4.1 Natural gas security of supply The Netherlands has substantial stocks of natural gas that have been extracted on a large scale since the 1970s, both in order to meet the domestic gas demand and as an export commodity. Most natural gas in the Netherlands is located in the Groningen gas field. For years, joint annual gas production from the Groningen gas field and the small fields fluctuated around 80 billion cubic metres, but this figure began to drop from 2015, both due to the restrictions on extraction operations from the Groningen gas field and the declining supply from the small fields. In the gas year 2018/2019, the extraction level from the Groningen field was 17.5 bcm. Following the recommendation of the State Supervision of Mines (SODM), at the start of 2018, the government decided to fully phase out gas extraction from the Groningen gas field by 2030119. From mid-2022, gas extraction in Groningen can be zero in an average year, assuming that the underground gas storage Norg can be structurally filled with pseudo-Groningen gas120. This does not mean that the field can be closed immediately in 2023. It cannot be ruled out that gas extraction will remain necessary even after 2022, for example, to provide for high gas demand on a cold winter's day. Domestic consumption of natural gas amounted to almost 50 bcm a year until it peaked in 2010, after which consumption began to decrease. Current consumption is around 35 to 40 bcm per year. Due to the decision to fully phase out gas extraction from the Groningen gas field, the Netherlands will have to become a net gas importer. The point at which this will happen depends on the measures the government puts in place in order to phase out gas extraction and reduce domestic demand. This will also take into account the security of supply of surrounding countries, within the context of the European Regulation on the security of gas supply in the EU. This is necessary because Belgium, Germany and France depend on gas from the Groningen gas field for a portion of their gas supply. The gas extracted from this field is known as low-calorific gas, whereas the gas that is extracted elsewhere in the world, including from the Dutch small fields, is known as high-calorific gas. As such, customers in Belgium, Germany and France, similar to customers in the Netherlands, are physically dependent on gas from the Groningen gas field, or more precisely, dependent on low-calorific gas that is supplied from (1) the Groningen gas field and (2) the GTS conversion plants where high-calorific gas is converted into low-calorific gas through the addition of nitrogen. Belgium, Germany and France will have to reduce their dependence on low-calorific gas from the Netherlands to zero between now and 2030 by transitioning to high-calorific gas or other forms of energy. In order to phase out extraction in the short term, exports abroad will be reduced in accordance with the relevant agreements, additional nitrogen will be purchased and an additional nitrogen plant will be constructed that, according to the schedule, will be commissioned by the end of the first quarter of 2022 (GTS, 2018). A nitrogen plant allows high-calorific natural gas to be converted into low-calorific natural gas. In the longer term, the domestic demand for low-calorific and other natural gas by homes and companies will be reduced. As of 1 July 2018, there is no longer a requirement for newly built housing to have a gas connection. In this case, an "all-electric" solution is an alternative for these newly built housing areas, in addition to geothermal energy or other types of renewable energy. For existing buildings, heat grids fed from renewable sources are also an option.                                                  119 Letter to Parliament on Gas Extraction in Groningen, 29 March 2018, Parliamentary document 33 529, no. 457 120 Letter to Parliament on the Gas extraction level in Groningen in 2019-2020, 10 September 2019, Parliamentary document 33 529 no. 678 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    In recent years, imports have rapidly increased as a result of declining gas extraction in the Netherlands. While (net) imports in 2005 accounted for almost 23 bcm, this has now increased to close to 54 bcm in 2017 (Eurostat, 2018) Natural gas is mainly and increasingly imported from Norway and Russia. Imports from Russia more than doubled to 9.4 bcm between 2010 and 2017. At the same time, imports of Norwegian natural gas have also doubled to 26 bcm. Imports from Germany have increased tenfold to 8.2 bcm, imports from Denmark and the United Kingdom fell sharply between 2010 and 2016 due to declining production in those countries, but rose again in 2017. Natural gas is also imported in the form of liquid natural gas (LNG). LNG is supplied by tanker, in contrast to gaseous natural gas, which is transported via pipelines. In 2012, the Netherlands only imported around one bcm of LNG (calculated in gaseous form), whereas this amount had already more than doubled to 2.1 bcm in 2017. Despite increasing imports, the security of supply of natural gas for the Netherlands seems to have been secured for the years to come, through our own - albeit decreasing - production (Groningen field, small fields) and an effective gas market on which a large number of suppliers operate. In addition, the demand for gas will decrease due to the use of low-calorific gas being phased out and the transition to sustainable alternatives. 4.4.2 Security of supply of coal In the Netherlands, coal is used to generate electricity and produce steel. The Netherlands has large coal reserves, consisting of almost 1,300 megatons of mineable reserves, while only 12 megatons is used for domestic consumption (TU Delft, 2018). Since the 1970s, coal mining has been discontinued in the Netherlands and as a result the supply of coal depends entirely on imports. Coal imports amounted to 108 megatons in 2017, making the Netherlands one of the top ten coal importers worldwide. A large portion of the coal is subsequently exported to other European countries. There are relatively few concerns with regard to the security of supply of coal. It is widely available on several continents (Statistics Netherlands et al., 2018). Imported coal primarily comes from Colombia (25%), the US (19%), Germany (17%), South Africa (13%) and Russia (12%) (Statistics Netherlands, 2019c). During this decade, domestic consumption of coal is likely to decrease as a result of the coal-fired power plants being closed under the Energy Agreement. As indicated in previous chapters, in the Coalition Agreement the government decided to halt the use of coal-fired power plants to generate electricity by 2030121, the first of which will closed by the end of 2019 (This will further reduce dependence on coal imports). 4.4.3 Security of supply of crude oil Crude oil is the Netherlands' most important import product, good for circa 6% of the total import value (Statistics Netherlands, 2019c) A large percentage of the crude oil is directly exported to other European countries (approximately 40%), with the rest being processed in the refining sector and most of it subsequently exported as oil products. Crude oil is primarily imported from Russia, Norway, the United Kingdom, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. Imports from Saudi Arabia have fallen significantly since 2000, while imports from Russia have increased. Due to the major uncertainties on the future production and prices of crude oil per country and possible trade with the Netherlands, no forecasts are available on the future origin of oil. The Netherlands has a relatively large and efficient refining capacity, more than enough to be able to satisfy domestic demand. Future developments are uncertain. The demand for oil products is expected to decrease in OECD countries, but will rise in non-OECD countries, (IEA 2018). This shift in demand will lead to a large number of investments being made in the refining sector in Asia, particularly in China and India. In addition, there will be major investments in refineries in the Middle East, due primarily to the strategy of countries in this region, which focuses more on the supply of oil products and less on the supply of crude oil. Due to the new refining capacity, global competition for available raw materials and markets in this sector will increase further. In Europe the consumption of oil products has stagnated in recent years (Eurostat, 2017). There is a relatively high demand for diesel compared with that for petrol, which has resulted in the import of diesel and the export of petrol. However, it is uncertain how the market for these petrol exports, particularly North America and the west coast of Africa, will develop in the future. Based on global and European trends, it is expected that the throughput of oil in the Dutch refining sector will decrease. The projection assumes that the conversion of crude oil into petroleum products will shrink by around 12% between 2018                                                  121 121Letter to Parliament - Elaboration of the agreement on coal-fired plants in the Coalition Agreement, 13 December 2017, Parliamentary document 30 196, no. 567. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   and 2030. Although this results in a decrease in the energy consumption of the Dutch refining sector, the product portfolio of petroleum products is also changing, which in turn leads to increased energy consumption per unit of fuel produced. The most important explanation for this is that fuel oil for shipping bunkers must meet stricter sulphur requirements from 2020 onwards due to IMO requirements, so a larger proportion of this fuel must be desulphurised.  In order to reduce the risks of disruptions in the supply of crude oil, the Netherlands has a mixed system for holding strategic oil stocks. Both industry and the government (through the Netherlands Petroleum Stockpiling Agency, COVA) are required to hold emergency stocks of oil under the Petroleum Products (Stockpiling) Act (Wet voorraadvorming aardolieproducten) 2012. Any company that supplies the Dutch market with more than 100 kilotons of eligible petroleum products per calendar year is required to hold 5% in excess amounts as a mandatory stock. This equates to approximately a total of 13.5 days of net imports. The COVA is responsible for supplementing this up to the total mandatory stock of 90 days of net imports. 4.4.4 Security of supply of electricity Domestic generation capacity in the Netherlands has increased from almost 21 MWe in 2000 to over 34 MWe in 2017 (Statistics Netherlands, 2019d). Due to the increased generation capacity, the export of electricity has also risen from 4 billion kWh in 2000 to almost 19 billion kWh in 2018. During this period, imports fluctuated between around 15 billion kWh (in 2009 and 2010) and over 30 billion kWh between 2012 and 2015 and almost 27 billion kWh in 2018 (Statistics Netherlands, 2019e). The KEV expects imports and exports will increase in the period leading up to 2030, due to the strong growth in generation capacity based on wind energy and solar power. The import balance is expected to increase up to and including 2020, but a further increase in renewable energy generation will increasingly reduce the need for net imports. From 2023 onwards, the Netherlands is expected to become a net exporter of electricity. Fluctuations in electricity generated from solar and wind energy can be absorbed due to the increase in connection with foreign countries. The electricity security of supply standard, the Loss Of Load Expectation (LOLE), is an expectation value of up to four hours per year when insufficient generation capacity is available to meet demand. The security of supply of electricity is considered with and without the import and export of electricity. Up to 2024, domestic generation capacity will be sufficient to satisfy the standard (TenneT, 2018). LOLE will rise slightly to 2.5 hours a year (see Table 4.5) in the coming years, but will remain within the norm. This is due to decreasing capacity surplus as a result of thermal energy being phased out while the demand for electricity is increasing. The substantial increase in solar and wind energy makes a limited contribution to security of supply - for as long as storage is insufficient - due to its intermittent nature. Under normal circumstances, around 2025, situations of temporary import dependence could occur. This does not necessarily constitute a problem to supply security, since connections with other countries provide sufficient capacity to absorb such dependence (see also section 4.5). In the past, the Netherlands has also had periods of import dependence (such as between 2005 and 2007). What's more, the Netherlands has a substantial amount of relatively modern conserved gas capacity, which with favourable market conditions could qualify for deconservation in a relatively limited period of time.
