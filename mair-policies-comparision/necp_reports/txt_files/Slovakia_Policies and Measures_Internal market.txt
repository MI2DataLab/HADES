3.4. Dimension: internal energy market34 3.4.1. Electricity infrastructure  i. Policies and measures to achieve the targeted level of interconnectivity as set out in Article 4(d) As mentioned in point 2.4.1 NECP, the targets for the interconnection of European electricity networks at the level of the Member States are also met in the context of the current and planned transmission capacities of the Slovak Republic in the event of a conservative approach to the envisaged load and development of RES by transposing the National Action Plan to 2030. However, the trend in these two parameters influencing the size of the import and export capacity of the Slovak TS depends on a number of factors reflecting the socio-economic development and the national economic orientation of the SR, which can to a certain extent be created by national policy and goals set at national level.  ii. Regional cooperation in this area35 To support the preparation and implementation of cross-border investment projects in the field of electrical infrastructure, bilateral cooperation in particular is carried out at the level of the TS operators concerned. Wider regional cooperation to support cross-border transmission projects and other key electricity infrastructure projects is not currently needed. Discussions on future cross-border connections are taking place within the ENTSO-E System Development Committee. iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds The financing of any SEPS transmission infrastructure projects is secured through the payments of system users for electricity taken. The principles and rules are determined by the Slovak Regulatory Office for Network Industries. National support mechanisms (financial) to support the construction of transmission infrastructure are not in place. Selected key infrastructure projects (e.g. the set of buildings for the  project) are co-financed by the BIDSF support fund, managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to reduce the impact of the early shutdown of the V1 nuclear power plant at Jaslovsk√© Bohunice.                                                  34 Policies and measures shall reflect the energy efficiency first principle. 35 Other than the PCI Regional Groups established under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013.  3.4.2. Energy transmission infrastructure i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.2, including, where applicable, specific measures to enable the delivery of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and other key infrastructure projects To support the smooth implementation of PCI projects, Slovak legislation has adopted the relevant legislation (the Energy Act, Construction Act, etc.) as a one-stop-shop approach in the sense of Art. 8(3)(c) of Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) No 347/2013. This enables the Slovak Ministry of Economy to monitor the PCI project authorisation process in the Slovak Republic and to effectively accelerate the issue of relevant permits.  ii. Regional cooperation in this area36 See the previous section, point 3.4.1 ii. iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds See the previous section, point 3.4.1 iii. 3.4.3. Market integration i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.3 The objectives of the Slovak Republic in integrating the electricity market in all timeframes, increasing the flexibility of the energy system and related projects are based on and in line with the requirements of the aforementioned European legislation that is directly applied in the conditions of the Member States (i.e. the relevant market network regulations). Therefore, these objectives, as defined today, do not result from conceptually set goals at national level, nor from national policies and official government decisions in the area concerned. Promoting gas market integration is aimed primarily at projects that increase the flexibility of the transport service under optimal operating conditions and maximise the use of existing infrastructure. The result should be end-user access to secure and affordable gas supplies. The implementation of network regulations in the gas sector based on transnational legislation created conditions for integrating gas markets and increasing their liquidity. In the coming period, measures that will contribute towards their further development by reducing the administrative burden on the entities concerned will be put into practice. ii. Measures to increase the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy generation such as smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, real-time price signals, including the roll-out of intraday market coupling and cross-border balancing markets See previous sections, point 2.4.3 iv. and v. Measures in the development of smart metering systems and smart grids (Energy Policy of the Slovak Republic, Chapter 3.5.10):                                                  36 Other than the PCI Regional Groups established under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013.   to incentivise an electricity system operator to actively monitor the development of smart grid technologies in order to apply relevant technologies where this is cost-effective from the point of view of system security and securing energy supplies cost-effectively;  to continuously review the scope of SMS deployment and increase the penetration of SMS in a cost-effective way, to maximise the full-scale benefits of deploying SMS and developing intelligent networks while taking into account technological progress;  to ensure that SMS technical parameters meet the requirements of European energy efficiency legislation, in order to create the conditions for informing consumers so they can effectively manage their consumption;  to ensure that SMS technical parameters support solutions for SN construction and development by ensuring interoperability of SMS components and adequate communication capabilities;  to support local or broad testing of the SN and, in the time horizon to 2035, the development of intelligent cities, municipalities and regions, the development of system management in the direction of the construction of the SN at the level of the Slovak distribution systems and transmission system;  to create the conditions for building local smart grids with almost equilibrated balance with minimum flows in or out;  to make use of SMS and SN to support electromobility;  to increase the number of households equipped with smart appliances and SMS with the possibility of remote supervision of the electricity consumption pattern of households;  to develop the conditions for storing electricity as close as possible to the point of consumption. iii. Where applicable, measures to ensure the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets RES and storage measures are contained in the Clean Energy for All Europeans package and are the subject of the transposition of Directive of the EP and Council (EU) No 2018/2000 on promotion of renewable energy sources, published in December 2018, and EP and Council Regulation (EU) No 2019/944 on common rules for the internal market in electricity, published in June 2019. iv. Policies and measures to protect consumers, especially vulnerable and, where applicable, energy poor consumers, and to improve the competitiveness and contestability of the retail energy market Act No 251/2012, on Energy, defines vulnerable and protected customers. A vulnerable household electricity consumer is a household electricity consumer whose life functions are dependent on electricity or is heavily disabled and uses electricity for heating and has reported and demonstrated this fact himself or through his electricity supplier to the operator of the distribution system to which his/her point of sale is connected, in the manner given in the market rules; a vulnerable household  gas consumer is gas customer in a household that is vulnerable to household gas is a household gas user who is heavily disabled and uses gas for heating and who has reported and demonstrated this fact himself or through his gas supplier to the operator of the distribution network to which his/her point of sale is connected, in the manner given in the market rules. Act No 250/2012, regulating network industries defines the following categories as vulnerable customers: 1. a household electricity consumer, 2. a household gas consumer, 3. a small enterprise. v. Description of measures to enable and develop demand response including those addressing tariffs to support dynamic pricing37 In the context of the modernisation of power stations, transmission and distribution networks, new possibilities for communication between energy companies and their customers are gradually being introduced through smart energy networks, smart home households, and smart meters.  This modernisation will also be reflected in time in the tariffs that will be an offer tool for energy suppliers. Their principal benefit is energy saving. An indispensable requirement for the use of dynamic tariffs is that a household must have an intelligent electricity meter installed and a smart home controller that controls smart sockets, as well as heating, the hot water boiler, air conditioning and other smart home appliances. The open questions are the forms of communication with the supplier operator, or in the form of an information SMS when the supplier sends information about cheaper electricity in a certain time interval, without the personal involvement of the customer, and direct communication of the supplier with an installed smart meter. 3.4.4. Energy Poverty i. Where applicable, policies and measures to achieve the objectives set out in point 2.4.4 The elimination of energy poverty is a long-term process of adopting legislative adjustments, inter-ministerial measures, and setting up support mechanisms and systemic and operational solutions. This process is ongoing in Slovakia. As regards legislation, there are several generally binding legal norms in force in Slovakia that create the conditions to address energy poverty: - Act No 321/2014 on energy efficiency and on amendments to certain Acts, set out measures to promote and improve energy efficiency and contribute towards reducing energy poverty - Act No 250/2012 on regulation in network industries, implementing the EU Third Energy Package for the Internal Market in Electricity and Gas of 2009  - Act No 443/2010 on subsidies for the development of housing and on social housing, providing subsidies for the elimination of systemic defects in apartment buildings                                                   37 In accordance with Article 15(8) of Directive 2012/27/EU.  - Act No 150/2013 on the State Housing Development Fund, which provides loans for the insulation of existing apartment buildings  - Act No 417/2013 on assistance in material need and on amendments to certain Acts, as amended, on the basis of which it is possible to provide a housing allowance, which is part of the total assistance provided in material need  - Decree No 18/2017, laying down price regulation in the electricity sector  - Decree No 248/2016, laying down price regulation in thermal energy  - Decree No 223/2016, laying down price regulation in the gas sector  As part of the economic policy measures to support economic growth approved by Government Resolution No 227 of 15 May 2013, a number of tasks were imposed with direct or indirect impact on energy poverty issues, such as: - Assessment of the subsidy programme to support energy efficiency and to secure funds for the implementation of the measure in relation to the possibilities of the State budget, - Assessment of the implementation of the subsidy programme to support renewable energy sources and to secure funds for the implementation of the measure in relation to the possibilities of the State budget, preparation of a Memorandum of Understanding on not increasing the tax, levy and fee burden on entrepreneurs; in this context, the role can be understood as adopting laws that will not result in rising energy prices, - Provision of loans for thermal insulation of existing apartment buildings (State Housing Development Fund), - Creating employment programmes, including providing investment incentives to increase employment. Consistent implementation of the set legislative framework will lead to a reduction in the energy intensity of households and thus to a reduction in the number of people suffering from energy poverty. Despite the effective implementation of these measures, there is a high probability that there will still be energy-poor households. Therefore, operational solutions are being prepared in Slovakia that should contribute towards consumer protection: - A clearly defined procedure for energy companies for when a household finds itself in a situation where it cannot pay for energy. Such households may be offered the option of a repayment calendar, or the possibility of installing a special electricity meter that limits consumption to a certain value (credit meters) - The use of appropriate mechanisms to motivate energy consumers to manage their consumption - New housing allowance legislation is in a late development stage. Housing costs include expenditure on rent, energy, water and other housing-related services. The introduction of a housing allowance under new legislation will contribute towards reducing the housing burden on low-income households and will consequently reduce the risk of poverty. The actual housing allowance should be a directed, direct, financial support by the state for households in apartment buildings, intended in particular to cover, or more exactly, reduce that portion of apartment household costs, for legal forms of housing, that have a direct impact on the retention of accommodation and which an apartment household typically cannot afford to pay for in part or in total because of the value of those costs or the low income of the household members. So this will not be a flat-rate benefit, the accommodation allowance will be paid only for apartment households that meet the statutory requirements.  Some systemic solutions have been elaborated in government departments in relation to energy poverty: - Development and support of information systems for the collection and integration of data on the population and the subsequent use of this data in the assessment of energy poverty in the population - Prioritize support for job creation in sectors and regions whose renewal, restructuring and development will create the preconditions for increasing their contribution towards economic growth and hence employment growth In April 2018, the National Reform Programme of the Slovak Republic 2018 was adopted, describing the structural measures that the Government of the Slovak Republic plans to implement, especially in the next two years. This programme is being implemented and continuously updated with the aim of reducing unemployment, reducing poverty and material need as such, and thus reducing energy poverty
