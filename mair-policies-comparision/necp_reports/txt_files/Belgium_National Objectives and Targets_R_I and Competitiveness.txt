99 2.5. Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness i. National objectives and funding targets for public and, where available, private research and innovation relating to the Energy Union, including, where appropriate, a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met Belgium has committed to the objectives set out in Lisbon and the Europe 2020 strategy with a view to achieving the target of investing at least 3% of GDP in R&D. Public authorities will account for 1%, whilst the private sector will cover 2% of R&D funding. Gross domestic expenditure will be expressed as gross domestic expenditure on , and reported to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in particularthe data from the Regions and Communities. These data are available at http://www.innovationdata.be/i/KNO_RDGT_1/Total-RD-expenditure. Responsibility for research and innovation policy in Belgium is shared between the Federal Government, the three Regions and the Communities (see also Chapter 3. Policies and measures). More detailed information on the Federal Government and the Regions is given below.  Federal State From 2020, between 5% and 10% of the R&D budget will be spent on climate- and energy-related projects. At federal level, the Energy Transition Fund will be used to promote innovative projects. maintain its nuclear expertise and know-how, particularly in relation to the responsible management of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. This will ensure a high level of safety and avoid unnecessary burdens for future generations. In an international context, Belgium will continue its research into innovative solutions for highly radioactive waste and for classifying materials from nuclear fusion reactors. Maintaining these skills should also enable the continued production of radioisotopes in Belgium. Belgium also wants to remain a world-class player in R&D and innovation in key areas such as: (1) nuclear medicine and the production of medical radioisotopes; (2) research into new materials; (3) particle accelerator technology, and (4) transmutation of radioactive waste. It has therefore decided to build a new large-scale research facility known as MYRRHA (Multi-purpose hYbrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications). This is described in the Strategy Report on Research Infrastructures Roadmap drawn up by the ESFRI (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures).  Flemish Region Reinforcing Research and Development in the area of energy and climate The aim is to have a balanced policy of research and innovation that focuses as much on untargeted long-term scientific research as on targeted basic research in order to triple the development and subsequent deployment of innovations. - Lay a firm foundation for excellent scientific research that can serve as the basis for long-term solutions  - In addition, engage in research and innovation to support new and existing business activities stemming from energy and climate challenges with a view to maintaining and reinforcing a local manufacturing industry capable of participating in sustainable European and international value chains. - As a result of the above objectives, support the energy transition together with the social and economic transitions in order to achieve the Flemish energy and climate objectives.  100 Walloon Region (a) Clean energy and technologies, R&I national strategies and the overall vision for R&I The thematic priorities will be determined based on the strategic priorities of the Walloon smart specialisation strategy for research and innovation (RIS3), which is currently being revised. Emphasis will be placed on those subjects in which the Walloon Region has recognised expertise, in line with the European roadmap (SET Plan) and the themes of the cluster of the future Horizon Europe framework programme. The following energy, climate and mobility priorities have been identified:  smart/integrated communities, including positive energy districts, smart power grids, and connected, automated and autonomous mobility;  integration of storage systems;  energy efficiency of buildings;  new fuels (including electricity) and sustainable vehicles;  management and recovery of CO2 in production processes;  climate projections, predictions and modelling and new associated services;  traffic and network management;  rail technologies. Facilitating consumer participation and the acceleration of progress towards the future smart energy system anagement and recovery of CO2 regard to reducing the production of CO2. The latter priority also covers the capture and recovery of anthropic CO2, particularly in value-added products such as synthetic fuels. The Energy Union Diversifying and  of carbon, but not its geological storage.  storage therefore involves s and Hydrogen Joint U Although traffic and network management and rail technologies are not covered by any of the Energy Union priorities, they will contribute to sustainable mobility. R&I in the development of the next generation of renewable energy technologies is not a priority in Wallonia. Having said that, the roll-out of renewable energies, green heat, geothermal energy and district heating systems is included in the objectives of the Walloon Energy and Climate Plan. R&I in renewable energy technologies may be funded at the request of businesses.  (b) SMART national objectives and concrete funding targets Part of the public annual budget allocated to research and development is earmarked for energy projects. Within relevant projects, energy can be the sole theme or one of the themes (for example, a project aiming to develop a new machine that will consume less energy in use, but that will also have a lower maintenance cost).  101 The budget amount earmarked for energy projects is EUR 43,000,000 on average (2012-2017 average). Nearly --theme projects. The average annual amount granted by Europe to co-financed projects (Structural Funds) is EUR 1,900,000 (2011-2017 average).  The average annual amount granted by Europe through the Horizon 2020 research framework programme,  2,000,000 (2014-2019 average). The average annual amount granted by Europe through the Horizon 2020 research framework programme, EUR 1,400,000 (2014-2018 average). The aim is that, by 2030, EUR 110,000,000 of public money will be spent every year on research and innovation with regard to the energy and climate objectives. This amount will come from the following sources:  Walloon budget: EUR 75,000,000  European programmes: EUR 20,000,000  Innovation Fund: EUR 10,000,000  Structural Funds: EUR 5,000,000 The additional amounts needed in order for EUR 75,000,000 to be allocated every year from the Wallon budget to the energy and climate theme will come from other resources earmarked for this theme, given that research and innovation with regard to other themes must not suffer a funding cut.  (c) Setting benchmarks against which the national/regional progress will be measured The amount allocated from the Walloon public budget to research, development and innovation projects is EUR 321,000,000 on average (2012-2018 average). Other parts of the research budgets, such as funding of universities and research centres, can also be added to this figure (see http://www.innovationdata.be). The Walloon private budget allocated to research is around EUR 2,000,000,000 every year. Walloon GDP stands at EUR 96,600,000,000 (2012-2018 average, current euro). The proportion of the total Walloon budget (public and private) allocated to research in relation to Walloon GDP is therefore EUR 2,321,000,000/EUR 96,600,000,000 or 2.40%. The proportion of the Walloon annual public budget allocated to R&D projects that is earmarked for energy projects is around 13% (2012-2017 average). may be around EUR 200,000,000 every year. The proportion of Walloon GDP allocated to energy research (private and public) is therefore put at 0.26% on average (EUR 246,900,000/EUR 96,600,000,000). If private research pursues the same objectives as public research, the amount allocated to this research should rise to EUR 460,000,000 every year by 2030, which would equate to 0.59% of GDP in 2030 for public (Walloon and European funding) and private energy and climate research. 102 In summary Current and 2030 budgets allocated to energy and climate research and innovation Wallonia  Forecast for 2030  GDP 2012-2018 96,600,000,000   Walloon public budget for research (2012-2018 average) 321,000,000   Walloon private budget for research 2,000,000,000   Walloon public/private budget for research 2,321,000,000   Walloon public budget for energy research (2012-2017 average) 43,000,000 75,000,000 Walloon public budget for climate and environment research (2012-2017 average) not available Budget received from Europe (Structural Funds) for energy research (2012-2017 average) 1,900,000   Budget received from Europe (Structural Funds) for climate and environment research (2012-2017 average) not available Budget received from Europe (Horizon 2020) for energy research (2014-2019 average) 2,000,000 20,000,000 Budget received from Europe (Horizon 2020) for climate and environment research (2014-2019 average) 1,400,000 Budget received from the Innovation Fund  NER300 0 10,000,000 Walloon private budget for energy research  200,000,000 460,000,000 Walloon private budget for energy climate and environment research not available Walloon-Europe public/private budget for energy research 246,900,000 570,000,000 Walloon-Europe public/private budget for climate research not available   ii. Where available, national 2050 objectives related to the promotion of clean energy technologies and, where appropriate, national objectives, including long-term targets (2050) for deployment of low-carbon technologies, including for decarbonising energy and carbon-intensive industrial sectors and, where applicable, for related carbon transport and storage infrastructure Flemish Region Research and innovation for a Flemish low-CO2 and low-carbon circular industry in 2050 Identification of, and support for, innovative research in order to develop cutting-edge technologies (for 2-neutraal/Flandre neutre en CO22-neutral Flanders).  Further encourage the demonstration of low-CO2 technologies Targeted support for demonstration projects and pilot projects in relation to low-CO2 technologies.  103 Speed up the deployment of innovative low-CO2 technologies in Flanders Use economic support instruments in a more targeted manner and in conjunction with other Flemish support instruments.  Walloon Region -  iii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to competitiveness Federal State The Energy Standard, which depends on the pattern of use and energy intensity, must ensure that the various components of the energy cost in Belgium are no higher than those in neighbouring countries, so that the competitiveness of Belgian businesses and the purchasing power of families are maintained.  Flemish Region Encourage and monitor the competitiveness of the Flemish economy in the energy and climate transition This objective firstly involves monitoring the impact of energy and climate regulations, in terms of their definition and implementation, on the competitiveness of the Flemish economy, particularly its high-energy-intensity industry. Increasing the competitiveness and technological leadership of Flemish businesses in global low-CO2 value chains will also be targeted.
