OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 1.1. Summary 1.1.1. Political, economic, environmental, and social context of the plan  The Paris Agreement (PA) signed in 2015 established long-term objectives to contain the rise in the average global temperature to a maximum of 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The international community made the commitment to make every effort to ensure that this rise in temperature would not exceed 1.5°C, which science has defined as the maximum increase for life on the planet to continue without excessive disruption. It also set out objectives to increase the capacity to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and to mobilise financial resources in a manner consistent with low-emission trajectories and resilient development. This Agreement thus represented a paradigm shift in the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, explicitly recognising that the challenge of climate change can only be overcome if everyone contributes to the effort. The main commitments of this agreement are to achieve a balance on a global level between human emissions and emissions removal during the second half of the century, to prepare -Term Strategies to Reduce E In 2016, during the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Portugal adopted the target of being carbon neutral by 2050, having developed a Roadmap for Carbon Neutrality 2050 (Roteiro para a Neutralidade Carbónica  RCN 20trajectories and guidelines for the policies and measures to be implemented within this time frame. The RCN 2050 was published by means of Council of Ministers Resolution No 107/2019 of 1 July 2019 and constituted the long-term development strategy for low greenhouse gas emissions submitted to the UNFCCC on 20 September 2019. In keeping with the conclusions of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C, RCN 2050 also concluded that greater efforts must be made during the 2021-2030 decade to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG), this being an essential decade to align the national economy with a carbon neutral trajectory. Thus, ambitious but attainable goals were established, coordinated with the RCN 2050 objectives for the 2030 horizon. These are set out in the National Energy and Climate Plan, which is the main national climate and energy policy tool for 2021-2030, aiming to achieve a carbon neutral future. The challenges society faces require concerted action between energy and climate policies, since this is the only possible way to achieve a carbon-neutral economy and a society that both promotes economic growth and better quality of life. To this end, NECP is a fundamental tool to ensure that energy and climate goals for 2030 are achieved and it is a forward--term objectives. It is important to note that Portugal has a prominent position internationally in relation to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and developing sources of renewable energy, having achieved particularly positive results in recent years. In 2017, Portugal recorded a 17.5% reduction in GHG emissions, as compared to 2005. Even though 2005 witnessed exceptional conditions, culminating in a spike in emissions, Portugal has consolidated a trajectory of decarbonising the national economy.NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 2   Portugal has striven to attain progressively higher levels of incorporating renewable sources in various sectors, having achieved a total share of incorporation that is significantly higher than the European average, with an s equally relevant in the electricity sector and it is currently ranked third in the European Union for countries that have a higher level of incorporating renewable sources (+26.8 p.p. over figures for 2005). As a result of this evolution, Portugal has managed to reduce its external energy dependence (-9.1 p.p. as compared to 2005), increasing domestic energy generation and reducing the consumption of primary energy (- 17.0% as compared to 2005), thus also ensuring greater supply security. The contribution of this sector to the Portuguese economy should also be noted, having created an entirely new industrial and corporate segment, generating employment, promoting regional development, stimulating the export of goods and services, driving innovation and scientific research which attracts international investment and stimulates the internationalisation of national companies.

This means that Portugal has managed to generate wealth with lower emissions and lower energy consumption, with clear benefits for the economy and for society. This trajectory is expected to be maintained over the coming decades, as Portugal moves toward an increasingly less intensive carbon and energy economy, based on renewable sources and improvements in energy consumption by adopting more sustainable practices throughout the value chain, optimising processes and production, adopting new low-carbon technologies and promoting greater awareness of the need to pursue this path.

In 2018, GDP increased 2.1% in volume, 0.7 p.p. less than in the previous year, which in nominal terms translates into a 3.6% increase, standing at 201.6 billion euros. Net external demand contributed -0.7 p.p. toward the variation in GDP volume, there being a more accentuated slowdown in Exports of Goods and Services than in Imports of Goods and Services. The positive contribution of domestic demand fell to 2.8 p.p., reflecting the less intense growth of Investments.

This plan is a draft version as provided for in Article 9(1) of this Regulation. NECP, as the main instrument for energy and climate policy for 2021-2030, is organised in accordance with the structure set out in part 1 of Annex I of the aforementioned Regulation. It addresses, in a preliminary manner at this stage, the aspects set out in this structure. NECP includes a description of the current situation in Portugal with respect to energy and climate and covers the five dimensions of the Regulation: decarbonisation, energy efficiency, supply security, the internal energy market and research, innovation and competitiveness. It also defines the national contributions and policies and measures planned to comply with the different general commitments made by the Union, including the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, renewable energies, energy efficiency and interconnections.  1.1.2. The five dimensions of the Energy Union strategy  In 2016, during the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Portugal adopted the objective of being carbon neutral by 2050, having developed a Roadmap for Carbon Neutrality 2050 (Roteiro para a Neutralidade Carbónica  trajectories and guidelines for the policies and measures to be implemented within this time frame. The RCN 2050 was the long-term development strategy for low GHG emissions submitted to the UNFCCC on 20 September 2019.  In keeping with the conclusions of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C, RCN 2050 also concluded that greater efforts were required during the 2021-2030 decade to reduce greenhouse gases, this being an essential decade to align the national economy with a carbon neutral trajectory. Thus, ambitious but attainable goals were established, coordinated with the RCN 2050 objectives for the 2030 horizon. These are set out in NECP, which is the main national climate and energy policy tool for 2021-2030, aiming to achieve a carbon neutral future. Achieving carbon neutrality in 2050 means gradually abandoning a linear economic model, based on fossil fuels, focusing on an economy that is sustained by renewable resources and uses resources efficiently, implementing circular economy models that enhance the territory and promote territorial cohesion. National efforts to reduce emissions, set against the broader context of actions at a global level, will also assist in significantly reducing adaptation costs, with clear economic benefits. Responding to this challenge will be truly transformational with regard to some of the main aspects of life in society, particularly in relation to production and consumption standards, the relationship with production and the use of energy, the way in which cities and living, working and leisure spaces are designed, as well as transport and mobility needs. In addition to being a technological challenge it is also a challenge to be face by society, which will greatly depend on support and adoption by all. In such a global context, the inevitability of energy transition is recognised given the urgent need with respect to climate change and the need to change the economic model, particularly with regard to fossil fuels. Portugal has clearly committwith a view to reducing NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 5   its GHG emissions. In addition to the energy sector, all other sectors of the economy will be required to contribute to achieving these emission reductions, through the guidelines and measures set out in this plan as well as in RCN 2050. For the 2030 horizon, it is particularly important to define a strategy and objectives to help consolidate this path and which allow a competitive national economy to be consolidated, which is resilient and increasingly low-is based on a strategic vision for the 2030 horizon.    PROMOTING THE DECARBONISATION OF THE ECONOMY TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2050, AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COUNTRY, BASED ON A DEMOCRATIC AND FAIR MODEL OF TERRITORIAL COHESION WHICH EMPHASISES THE CREATION OF WEALTH AND THE EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES   Although all sectors of activity contribute toward reducing emissions, the energy sector will contribute the most during the next decade, playing an especially relevant role in energy transition towards a decarbonised society.  2030 horizon is based on a combination of different policy options and measures as well as technological options, seeking to encounter synergies between the different alternatives. The path to a carbon neutral economy requires joint action in several strategic areas, with priority being placed on energy efficiency, greater diversification of energy sources, an increase in electrification, reinforcement and modernisation of  infrastructure, development of interconnections, market stability and investment, reconfiguration and computerisation of the market, incentives for research and innovation, promotion of low-carbon processes, products and services, and improved energy services and informed choice for consumers. Energy efficiency is vital for complying with the decarbonisation of society and as a response to the need for a competitive economy and a resilient, safer and self-sufficient energy system. Portugal is committed to the  energy sector, with a view to sustainability and cost effectiveness. Experience shows that the challenge of energy efficiency is the same as, or greater than that of renewable energies. Both the objectives for energy efficiency as well as those for renewable energies will have to be achieved on a cost-effective basis and jointly with other strategic priorities, such as interconnections, aiming for the real integration of the country into the Energy Union and the need to become carbon neutral. However, the supply security must always be ensured. Energy transition in Portugal will undoubtedly involve the electricity sector. Portugal has enormous potential to develop a highly decarbonised electricity production sector, both through the availability of renewable endogenous resources such as water, wind, sun, biomass and geothermal power, as well as through the fact that it has developed a reliable and secure electricity system which is capable of dealing with the variability brought about by the focus on renewables and which will be the target of important evolution in the next decade. The focus for the electricity production sector for the 2030 horizon mainly involves solar energy and, to a lesser extent, wind energy. With regard to wind energy, the focus will be mainly on hybridisation, new equipment and repowering, three ways of increasing the production of electricity from renewable sources which minimise costs for the consumer and the environment as they optimise the network investments which have already been made. NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 6   In the case of solar energy, particularly photovoltaic solar energy, highly competitive prices for this technology when compared with other conventional solutions combined with an abundance of the resource ensure that this is an energy source that offers many benefits for consumers. With an electricity production system which has a strong renewable base, the aim is to promote and reinforce the use of electricity in the different sectors of activity and the economy, with particular emphasis on transport, but also on industry and the residential and services sectors.  Energy transition and decarbonisation are not limited to only technological evolution through the replacement or implementation of new technologies or the use of new forms of energy. Participation by consumers will also play a significant role, where they will be more active as consumers/producers of energy and as agents for changes in behaviour which will have considerable impact. A more informed consumer represents better, more efficient and sustainable choices and a consumer at the centre of decision making is a more active consumer in the transition to a carbon neutral society, who is available to participate in the structural changes required to meet this challenge. With the consumer as an informed and active agent in the market, and with instruments to protect more vulnerable consumers, a further strategic priority for 2030 will be addressed; that of fighting energy poverty and consumer vulnerability. To reinforce renewable installed capacity, particularly for solar photovoltaic generation, Portugal opted for auctions to allocate reception capacity in the network with three main objectives: (i) to confer greater clarity and predictability for the licensing processes to generate energy; (ii) to create a mechanism to allocate capacity that suitably responds to the fact that this is a scarce public resource that needs to be managed as such; (iii) to ensure that for each network point being auctioned the winning bids are projects that contribute most toward reducing the electricity tariffs paid by consumers. Portugal held the first auction in 2019, specifically for solar photovoltaic energy, with a total of 1 400 MW divided over 24 lots. The outcome of this auction, which ensured the lowest prices in Europe and global minimums that directly translated into effective gains for consumers, made it possible to outline a path where the results provide a glimpse of the multiplier potential of this mechanism in future auctions and its considerable contribution to achieving national objectives in relation to renewable energy. In the short-add injection capacity to the network, resulting in the allocation of at least 2 GW of new renewable capacity, including dispatch capability, building on the success of the auction that was held in 2019. To promote distributed production and self-consumption of power from renewable sources, a new legal framework was developed, Decree-Law No 162/2019 of 25 October 2019, which: (i) allows and promotes individual self-consumption; (ii) allows and promotes collective self-consumption; (iii) allows the forming of energy communities. The legal establishing of these activities will allow individuals, companies and other public and private entities to produce, consume, share, store and sell energy produced from renewable sources, thus actively participating in energy transition. This new regime comes about in a context of complementarity, by combining centralised instruments to promote clean energies with decentralised processes which, due to their nature, reinforce social and territorial cohesion while helping reduce inequality. This will be achieved by creating jobs, improving the competitiveness of companies throughout national territory and by combating energy poverty. It will also generate a significant reduction in network and distribution costs, reduce losses and optimise energy production solutions. For its obvious advantages, but also in relation to the challenges it presents, the promotion of self-consumption of renewable energy, whether individually or collectively or through energy communities, will in the short-term, be accompanied by an information and support programme for implementing self-consumption projects. The aim is to reduce information asymmetries and support companies, municipalities and citizens in the development of such systems. Of special note among the initiatives to be implemented is a support programme for establishing self-consumption in partnership with municipalities, which assists both technically and with a view to obtaining financing. NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 7   The vision of an electricity production system which is highly decarbonised, decentralised and computerised, with focus on the consumer/energy producer as an active participant in the system which ensures suitable levels of quality of service and supply security, will not be possible to achieve without new design and strategic guidance which takes all these new variables into account. Smart networks, management support systems, producer and/or consumer aggregators, bidirectional smart meters, storage systems, local production of energy, active consumers, flexibility in supply/demand, electric vehicles, among other factors, are the variables which need to be considered when building the model for the network of the future. To guarantee real integration of all the variables, regardless of the configuration to be adopted, it is important to form a strategic vision of the national electricity network which will allow national targets and objectives for the 2030 horizon to be met. In the residential sector, efforts will be made to reinforce the thermal comfort of homes both in terms of heating as well as cooling, with emphasis on insulation solutions and the trend toward electrification in this sector. A continued push for urban rehabilitation will provide the opportunity to incorporate improvements in energy and hydro efficiency, low-carbon materials and sources of renewable energy, contributing toward overcoming energy poverty. In the service sector, some potential that still exists to increase the electrification of consumption will be explored, while increasing the energy efficiency of installed equipment and the use of renewable energy sources will play a fundamental role. Also with regard to infrastructure, energy interconnections are essential to the development of the internal energy market, ensuring the supply security, improving the functioning of energy systems, increasing the competition and stability of energy markets, promoting the integration of markets, greater fairness and balance in the definition of energy costs and prices and contributing to compliance with EU energy and climate targets. Regional cooperation is also vitally important and will be reinforced with a view to fostering closer ties among Member-States, especially Spain and France, to monitor and assess interconnection projects that meet the interconnection needs of energy markets and systems. With a view to transitioning the energy sector, the current infrastructure to receive, store, transport and distribute natural gas will play an important role in allowing the introduction, distribution and consumption of renewable gases, particularly biomethane and hydrogen, in various sectors of the economy, making it possible to incorporate higher levels of renewable sources of energy in final energy consumption. Particularly worthy of note in this regard is the production and incorporation of renewable gases such as hydrogen and biomethane, as early as the next decade, promoting a more intense substitution of fossil fuels and f the importance of renewable gases, particularly hydrogen, is based on the fact that they allow the storage of energy and the preparation of other renewable fuels, contributing toward achieving national targets to incorporate renewable sources in final energy consumption and to decarbonise consumption, with particular emphasis on industry and mobility (especially manufacturing and railways). Against this backdrop, the Portuguese government is promoting an industrial policy centred on hydrogen and renewable gases, and will define public policies that guide, coordinate and mobilise public and private investment in projects in the production, storage, transportation and consumption of renewable gases in Portugal. This new orientation stems from the fact that Portugal has very favourable conditions for installing an industry to produce green hydrogen, with export potential, wherein the main advantage is the low cost of producing the electricity from renewable sources.       NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 8   The development of an industry to produce green hydrogen in Portugal has the potential to drive an entirely new economy, coupled with the enormous potential to decarbonise various sectors. Renewable gases, particularly hydrogen and biomethane, have the potential to play an important role in promoting the decarbonisation of sectors of the economy that currently have few alternative technological options and where electrification in the short and medium-term could result in significant costs. Renewable gases have the potential to substitute fossil fuels in industry (e.g. combustion processes and even as a raw material), the road transport of passengers, railway transport (avoiding the costs of electrifying lines), river transport of passengers and goods. Portugal could thus focus on varied solutions with different technologies and territorial dispersion that create value and decarbonise energy consumption. The Portuguese government is striving to create the necessary conditions and mechanisms to make it possible to recognise and enhance the value of renewable gases (hydrogen and gases obtained from chemical reactions of hydrogen and biomethane) in the national market, promoting dialogue with investors and market operators so as to find cost-effective solutions to create a true renewable gas economy. The development of an industry to produce green hydrogen in Portugal has the potential to drive an entirely new economy, along with the enormous potential for decarbonisation. Mechanisms are expected to be implemented in the short-term aimed at: (i) regulating the injection of renewable gases into the national natural gas network; (ii) implementing a guarantee of origin system for renewable gases; (iii) concentrating financial resources available in national and European funds to support energy production through the production of renewable gases, particularly hydrogen and biomethane; (iv) assessing the setting of binding targets by 2030 to incorporate renewable gases into the natural gas network. Specifically, the installation of an industrial unit in Sines to produce green hydrogen (1 GW) is currently being studied, fuelled by solar energy and based on strategic partnerships both nationally as well as on a European level. This includes a strategic partnership with Holland, with the potential to include other Member-States, thus providing a European dimension to the project as a means of ensuring Community funding and finding partners for the consortium. This industrial-scale project to produce green hydrogen focuses on leveraging solar energy as a factor for competitiveness (the cost of electricity represents the greatest component of the cost of production and Portugal has an enormous competitive advantage when compared to other countries because it has lower electricity generation costs), industrial transformation and the opportunity to increase exports. Portugal has highly favourable conditions for installing this type of industry, namely in Sines, considering the multiple advantages of this site  availability of a deep water port, transport and storage infrastructure and connections to the natural gas transmission network, an industrial zone with current and future hydrogen consumers and the availability of land.  Industry will play an extremely important role as it is one of the key areas where innovation and the creation of be critical on the road to identifying and creating innovative, efficient and green solutions with close to zero emissions, in the coming 30 years; Although this is a sector where decarbonisation is expected to occur at a slower pace, it is nonetheless a sector that is highly motivated in relation to matters of resource efficiency. Diverse sector roadmaps are currently underway toward a more decarbonised future for this industry, emphasising a circular economy, through industrial symbioses and the recycling of resources, and it could prove to be a great asset in the 2030 time frame. This sector will also be strongly influenced by automation and digitalisation, with growing levels of electrification and greater use of biomass in conjunction with other forms of renewable energy, such as solar thermal energy. The decarbonisation of mobility and transport is especially important in terms of the 2030 horizon, as this is one of the most significant sectors in terms of national GHG emissions. The next decade will see a paradigm shift in this sector. Profound changes are expected with a view to decarbonising the sector, with traditional fossil fuels being gradually replaced by electricity, advanced biofuels and hydrogen, achieving substantial environmental and efficiency gains. The future of mobility is a sustainable, autonomous and shared future. It is a future in which users have greater power to manage their own mobility as a result of increasing digitalisation. NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 9   However, the paradigm shift is not just limited to technological innovation. A continued emphasis on public transport, which changes the mobility patterns of the Portuguese and reverses trends witnessed in recent years, is one of the most important measures aimed at decarbonisation and energy efficiency. Increased demand for passenger mobility will be met both by more public transport, using low-emission vehicles, as well as through the spread of shared transport, with emphasis on the increased use of active modes of transport for short-distance mobility. By 2030, electric mobility and advanced biofuels will be the most cost-effective tools for decarbonisation in the field of transport, however, other low-carbon mobility alternatives will also be implemented, such as hydrogen-powered vehicles. The decarbonisation of mobility is also intrinsically linked to the spatial planning models for cities, economic and leisure activities and their implications in terms of mobility needs, as well as implications in terms of collective mobility versus individual mobility. Cities have been active agents in decarbonising the economy and it is of vital importance to make the most of this dynamic to create low-carbon cities. In the field of goods transport, logistics management will be extremely important, including reverse logistics and the management and optimisation of fleets. By 2030, electric light vehicles to transport goods will play a key role, as will biofuels and hydrogen in the context of heavy vehicles. Railways are an important component for the decarbonisation of the medium and long-haul transport of goods and investment will thus be intensified in this infrastructure, including decarbonisation by electrification and other energy vectors, such as hydrogen, along with the modernisation and expansion of rail systems. Maritime transport will also be decarbonised, emphasising new forms of energy, promoting short-distance transport and maximising connections and the interoperability of railway goods transport with commercial ports. Changes in behaviour with regard to mobility is another aspect that must not be overlooked, both in relation to mobility decisions as well as the adoption of more efficient behaviours by promoting eco-driving and the use of new technologies to encourage sustainable mobility behaviours.  To complete this decarbonisation strategy, it is also vital to include the waste and wastewater sector, which, even though it currently represents a small percentage in total emissions calculations, is a sector that is expected to undergo substantial changes by 2030. In effect, to comply with the goals set out in the Landfills Directive only a maximum of 10% of urban waste produced will be deposited in landfills by 2035. There will thus also be a paradigm shift in the need to increase recycling and reuse waste, focusing on a more circular economy that generates less waste. The first priority will thus be to reduce the production of waste, followed by reinforcing the separated collection of urban waste, with emphasis on the biological treatment of bio-waste and the intensive use of solutions to reuse and recycle materials. It is essential to ensure the rational use of existing water resources and to satisfy the needs of all consumers, including environmental consumers. Unexplored national potential for hydroelectricity production will be assessed by establishing rigorous criteria to select sites to install large new hydroelectric projects, which will help comply with the energy goals that have been established, considering and assessing the environmental, social and economic components in an integrated manner.          NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 10   Moreover, as energy costs are one of the main components of the operating and exploration costs of water supply and wastewater services, with a direct impact on tariffs, energy management is now one of the main challenges facing entities responsible for managing these services. Recognising the advantages of an integrated and multidisciplinary approach to system management (hydraulic aspects, water quality, reliability, energy management, operations and maintenance), the government has promoted actions that make it possible to: (i) increase the resilience of public water supply systems, by improving their performance, particularly in relation to reducing water loss; (ii) increase the resilience of wastewater systems, by eliminating unlawful connections, adapting WWTP to extreme climate phenomena and reusing treated wastewater; (iii) increase the resilience of rainwater drainage systems, by eliminating leaks, shutting off water flows during periods of intense rain and reusing rain water; (iv) reducing the energy consumed in water services, by improving energy and hydro efficiency and increasing the level of energy self-sufficiency of WWTP and other facilities. The agriculture sector will also make an essential contribution toward decarbonising the Portuguese economy. Albeit at a less intense pace than other sectors, changes are expected to be implemented over the next decade that will make it possible to reduce emissions, with emphasis on more sustainable agriculture, by disseminating integrated production practices, along with the expansion of organic agriculture, conservation and precision agriculture, reducing emissions associated with animal effluents and the use of synthetic fertilisers and promoting carbon sinks derived from increased organic matter in soils, namely by promoting biodiverse pastures. This type of agriculture will also improve the efficient use of water, enabling productivity gains and saving water, which is a scarce commodity that must be preserved. It will also be necessary to investigate new forms of animal diets to obtain improvements in the digestibility of animal feeds, with a consequent positive impact on the reduction of emissions. It will also be important to rethink the entire food chain, from the choices we make with regard to what to eat, reducing wasted food, how plants and animals are produced for food, pressure on soils and water, but also on sea and fish resources. It is similarly important to showcase and replicate best marketing practices in short agri-food circuits, which reduce energy consumption and polluting emissions due to the reduced need to package, transport and refrigerate products. In the case of forestry and other land use, suitable agroforestry management is essential to progressively reduce burnt areas, increasing productivity and reinforcing ecosystem services that promote and contribute toward combating desertification and enhance the value of the land, as one of the pillars of territorial cohesion. The potential of carbon sinks, particularly forests, will have to be reinforced and carefully managed during spatial planning. Investment will be required in management practices and models which promote the carbon sink role of forests and increase their resilience to climate change and help minimise the risk of fires and soil degradation. The path to carbon neutrality is also the path to innovation and knowledge and qualification and training. Research and innovation oriented toward new technologies will play a fundamental and transversal role in overcoming the challenges of decarbonisation and energy transition. The development of new technologies and the improvement of existing low-carbon technologies requires significant effort in research and innovation which will be achieved by adopting an ambitious and wide-ranging agenda which address all parts of the technological development cycle up to and including the sale of such technologies. To this end, an essential role will be played by national support mechanisms oriented toward technological research and development  solutions, NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 11   smart networks, advanced biofuels, deep-sea geothermal energy, concentrated photovoltaic, ocean energy, energy integration, the conversion and storage of energy, low-carbon processes, the circular economy and precision agriculture, among other relevant aspects. Achieving this objective requires changes to our economy, our territorial model and our society. This is why it is essential that this transition be implemented in a planned manner, involving different sectors of our society and the different regions. It is also necessary to look at the economic and social aspects of this transition, ensuring that it occurs in a fair manner. Different analyses carried out internationally demonstrate that adopting policies for a profound decarbonisation of society has a positive impact on the economy, employment and society.  Eurofound has pointed out that in Portugal, decarbonisation policies compatible with the Paris Agreement will lead to an increase of more than 1.1% in GDP and a positive impact of 0.4% on employment. The reduction in particulate emissions, precursors of ozone and nitrogen and sulphur oxides, will also have a positive impact on air quality and improve public health, especially in dense urban areas. The investment associated with decarbonising the economy drives innovation and qualified employment, above all in green sectors. To promote the creation of jobs associated with new investment, it is necessary to prepare employment in sectors that will have to adapt. It is thus fundamental to consider the specificities of the different sectors and prepare specific measures for the most energy-intensive sectors, focusing on supporting the transition, both with regard to reconverting activities as well as with respect to workers, particularly in regions that could be most affected by this transition. It is hence particularly important to create competences aimed at the jobs of the future. Furthermore, internalising the environmental impact associated with fossil fuels and progressively eliminating tax exemptions on these fuels can have different consequences on society, even though it is a fairer measure. It is thus vitally important for associated tax revenues to be recycled for the benefit of society, supporting decarbonisation projects, reducing the onus on labour and minimising the associated social impact. This transition must also not accentuate energy poverty. Situations of energy poverty must be identified and obviated by means of measures aimed, above all, at urban rehabilitation, to promote energy efficiency in buildings, especially focusing on insulation and measures to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. In this regard, focusing on the decentralised production of electricity based on renewable energy communities and the improvement of collective systems that attenuate maintenance costs can be solutions, as they make it possible to reduce energy costs and ease the financial burden on families. This path is already being implemented. As has been recognised internationally, this transition will be financed not just by public funds but also implemented through the private sector and families. Thus, aligning public and private financial flows and tax policy with decarbonisation and energy transition objectives is vital to the success of this transition. Implementing this transition entails promoting investment in diverse sectors of activity. In this regard, the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027, which is still being discussed, is particularly relevant as it will provide one of the main sources of funding for decarbonising the economy in coming years. This is because it is expected to contain a commitment (still being negotiated) to allocate 25% of the overall budget to expenditure for climate action. The preparation of the funding plan for the 2021-2027 period will reflect the guidelines set out in this plan, more specifically in relation to the axes of sustainable mobility, decarbonising industry, renewable energies and energy efficiency, smart and sustainable cities, carbon sinks, sustainable agriculture and bioeconomy, among other relevant aspects. NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 12   This new energy model for carbon neutrality represents a unique opportunity for Portugal. In relation to the economic recovery which the country has achieved in recent years, the challenge of energy transition is seen as an opportunity which will allow the economy to be leveraged. The aim is to achieve sustainable development based on a democratic and fair model which promotes the advance of civilization and technology, the creation of jobs and prosperity, the creation of wealth and territorial cohesion while also preserving natural resources. The path to the decarbonisation of the economy is also an opportunity for economic growth. A society tending towards carbon neutrality, based on a circular economy which conserves resources at their highest economic value is also one which creates better qualified employment, more sustained wealth and more shared well-being.   1.1.3.   Portugal has strong arguments for continuing to be at the forefront of energy transition and aims to achieve a carbon neutral economy. This is why both nationally as well as on a European level that Portugal has advocated higher ambitions to reduce GHG, to incorporate sources of renewable energy in various sectors, energy efficiency and interconnections within the 2030 horizon. This is reflected in the following goals:  Table 2- Portuguese targets for the 2030 horizon EMISSIONS (Without LULUCEF; in relation to 2005)  ENERGY EFFICIENCY  RENEWABLES  RENEWABLES IN TRANSPORT  ELECTRICITY INTERCONNECTIONS -45% to -55% 35% 47% 20% 15%   Figure 4  Evolution in total emissions of CO2 for the 2030 horizon (Mton CO2)    Figure 5 - Estimated evolution in primary energy consumption - EE target (Mtoe)    Figure 6 - Evolution in the contribution of renewable energies in final energy consumption     NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1.

As such, NECP was developed with an emphasis on the participation of society, whose contribution is vital for a strategic vision for the next decade. In relation to the economic recovery which the country has achieved in recent years, the challenge of energy transition is seen as an opportunity which will allow the economy to be leveraged. The aim is to achieve sustainable development based on a just and cohesive transition which promotes the advance of civilization and technology, the creation of jobs and prosperity, while also preserving natural resources. The path to the decarbonisation of the economy is also an opportunity for economic growth and territorial improvement. In line with the strategic vision defined for the five dimensions of the Energy Union and Climate Action, the following figure shows national targets and contributions defined for the 2030 horizon under NECP.

Achieving all these targets, all of which are interconnected, will contribute toward making the vision of carbon neutrality a reality.                                                                      2 % reduction in primary energy consumption  NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 14   Figure 10 - Portuguese targets for the 2030 horizon    1. DECARBONISE THE NATIONAL ECONOMY Ensure a path to reducing national emissions of greenhouse gases in all sectors of activity, namely energy and industry, mobility and transport, agriculture and forestry and water and wastewater, and promote the integration of mitigation targets into sectorial policies (mainstreaming).   2. PUT ENERGY EFFICIENCY FIRST Reduce the consumption of primary energy in various sectors in a context of sustainability and cost-efficiency, focusing on energy efficiency and the efficient use of resources, prioritising the rehabilitation and renovation of buildings and promoting zero-emissions buildings.   ENERGY DEPENDENCE Reinforce the diversification of energy sources through a growing and sustainable use of endogenous resources, promote an increased electrification of the economy and encourage R&D&I in clean technologies.   4. ENSURE SUPPLY SECURITY Ensure that a resilient and flexible system is maintained, diversifying energy sources and origins, reinforcing, modernising and optimising energy infrastructure, developing interconnections and promoting the integration, reconfiguration and digitalisation of the energy market, maximising its flexibility.   5. PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY Decarbonise the transport sector, fomenting modal transfers and better functioning of collective transport networks, promoting electric and active mobility and the use of clean alternative fuels.   6. PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY AND PROMOTE CARBON CAPTURE Reduce the carbon intensity of agricultural practices and promote effective agro-forestry management, contributing toward increasing the capacity of a natural sink.   7.

Overview of the current policy situation 1.2.1. National and EU energy system and the policy context of the national plan  The Paris Agreement (PA) signed in 2015 established long-term objectives to contain the rise in average global temperature to a maximum of 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The international community committed to make every effort to ensure that this rise in temperature does not exceed 1.5°C, which science has defined as the maximum increase for life on the planet to continue without excessive disruption. It also set out objectives to increase the capacity to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and to mobilise financial resources in a manner that is consistent with low emission trajectories and resilient development. This Agreement thus represents a paradigm shift in the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, explicitly recognising that the challenge of climate change can only be overcome if everyone contributes to the effort. Its main commitments are to achieve a balance on a global level between human emissions and emissions removal during the second half of the century, to successively prepare and communicate the -Term Strategies to reduce  NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 16   The European Commission has introduced a series of strategic packages which seek to address the different aspects of this global challenge. Of note among these packages are the 2030 Climate and Energy Package and Clean Energy for All Europeans, which have the aims of promoting energy transition in the 2021-2030 decade and complying with the Paris Agreement while also safeguarding economic growth and the creation of jobs. To this end, pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of 11 December 1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, the European Union approved a set of ambitious goals that aim to achieve by 2030: (i) 32% of energy share from renewable sources in gross final consumption, (ii) 32.5% reduction in energy consumption, (iii) 40% reduction in GHG emissions as compared to 1990 levels, and (iv) 15% of electricity interconnections. It is also important to use the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development  by the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September 2015 as a reference. This document addresses various dimensions of sustainable development (social, economic, environmental) and promotes peace, justice and effective institutions. Agenda 2030 is a universal agenda, based on 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and 169 targets to be implemented by all countries and compliance presupposes the integration of these goals and targets in policies, processes and actions developed as part of national, regional and global plans. More recently, after the publication of the IPCC special report on the impact of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, which reinforces the urgency of actions to combat climate change, on 28 November 2018 the European Commission presented a proposal for a long-term strategy for a prosperous, modern, competitive and carbon neutral economy  - is carbon neutral and prosperous in relation to the climate by 2050. According to this strategy, forecasts indicate that the policies and goals that have already been established for the EU as a whole will enable a reduction in GHG emissions of about 45% by 2030 and about 60% by 2050. However, to contribute effectively toward the goals of the Paris Agreement, the EU must be carbon neutral by 2050, which corresponds to reductions of 80%-95% in GHG emissions. Thus, it is vital to delineate the best path to achieve this goal, aligning actions in key areas, investing in cost-effective and low-carbon technological solutions, promoting the active participation of citizens and ensuring fair transition. Equally relevant in the context of the current NECP are proposals now underway for the post-2020 period concerning the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2021- 2027. Thus, the CAP Strategic Plan (CAPSP), to be submitted by Member States to the Commission, must be duly aligned with the policy orientations, action lines and action measures set out in the current NECP. At a national level, in 2016 the Portuguese government committed to achieving carbon neutrality by the end of 2050 and outlined a clear vision for the profound decarbonisation of the national economy, as a contribution toward the Paris Agreement and in keeping with efforts that are underway internationally. The Roadmap for Carbon Neutrality 2050 (RCN 2050) was developed and approved to implement this plan and formed the long-term development strategy for low greenhouse gas emissions submitted to the UNFCCC on 20 September 2019, identifying the main vectors for decarbonisation and action lines to achieve a carbon neutral society by 2050. To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, it is necessary to reduce GHG emissions by between 85% to 90% as compared to 2005 and achieve carbon sequestration of between 9 to 13 million tonnes of CO2 by 2050. Achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 requires the total decarbonisation of the electricity generation system and urban mobility, profound changes in the way how we use energy and resources, focusing on circular models, along with promoting carbon sequestration capacities through forests and other land use. In keeping with the IPCC special report on 1.5° C and the Paris Agreement targets, the most significant reduction in emissions would occur during the 2021-2030 decade. Pursuant to this framework, by 2030 emissions must be reduced by between 45% and 55% as compared to 2005, which means increasing the established goal (40%) by between 5 and 15 percentage points. In 2040, emissions must be reduced by between -65% to -75% and by -85% to -90% by 2050. NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 17   The current National Energy and Climate Plan was developed in cooperation with the tasks of the Roadmap for Carbon Neutrality 2050, using different interactions with society promoted in this context to achieve the pathway and orientation that have been set out for this long-term exercise for the 2030 horizon. Portugal is a nation that has proved itself in relation to climate policy, having surpassed the targets set out by the Kyoto Protocol and it is on track to comply with the goals established for 2020 to reduce GHG emissions, increase energy efficiency and promote renewable sources of energy. For the 2030 horizon, the first step toward implementing the national plan of the European Climate and Energy Package for 2030 was taken in 2015 with the approval of the Strategic Framework for Climate Policy (Quadro Estratégico para a Política Climática  - QEPiC)3, with a view to decarbonising the economy and ensuring that Portugal had better conditions to overcome the challenges created by the Paris Agreement. QEPiC established an integrated, complementary and coordinated framework of climate policy instruments for the 2020/2030 horizon, coordinated with air policies, having approved the National Programme on Climate Change (Programa Nacional para as Alterações Climáticas - PNAC 2020-2030), which identifies guidelines for policies and measures capable of ensuring compliance with the new emission reduction goals for 2020 and 2030, and the National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change (Estratégia Nacional de Adaptação às Alterações Climáticas  - ENAAC 2020). These strategies established that Portugal would reduce its GHG emissions to values of -18 % to -23 % in 2020 and -30 % to -40 % by 2030, as compared to figures for 2005, contingent on the results of European negotiations, and sectorial goals were also set out to reduce GHG emissions. The establishment of these goals was set out in the previous National Low Carbon Roadmap 2050 (Roteiro Nacional de Baixo Carbono 2050 - RNBC), which was the first exercise to model national long-term emissions, carried out at a national level. It identified that it was possible to achieve reductions in national emissions of between -50% and -60%, as compared to 1990, which corresponds to a reduction of -60% to -70% in the energy sector as compared to 1990. It can be seen, however, that the potential for reducing emissions that was modelled at the time has already been exceeded today, essentially as a result of a quicker evolution in technology than had been anticipated. This resulted in a revision of the said goals to be even more ambitious in reducing GHG emissions in the medium and long-term, carried out within the scope of the current RCN 2050. The Inter-Ministerial Commission for Air, Climate Change and Circular Economy (CA2) was also created in 2015 as was the National System for Policies and Measures (Sistema Nacional de Políticas e Medidas - SPeM)4, which integrates policies and measures with a view to decarbonising the various sectors involved. As a result of efforts under SPeM and under the aegis of the CA2, a set of sectorial measures was identified to decarbonise the economy, which was the starting point for identifying the lines of action and action measures set out in the current plan. In relation to renewable energy and energy efficiency, with a view to integration, Portugal currently has a National Action Plan for Renewable Energy (Plano Nacional de Ação para as Energias Renováveis - PNAER 2020)5 and a National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency (Plano Nacional de Ação para a Eficiência Energética - PNAEE 2020)6, to promote renewable energy and make energy efficiency a priority for energy policies. In terms of background, it is important to note that Portugal, in the context of Agenda 2030 for sustainable development, had already defined SDG 13  Climate Action to be a priority target. The identification of SDG 13 as a prio Affordable and Clean Energy for all. In addition to the aforesaid targets, SDG 4  Quality Education, SDG 5  Gender Equality, SDG 9  Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure and SDG 10  Reduced Inequality were also identified as priorities                                                             3 Council of Ministers Resolution No 56/2015 of 30 July 2015 4 Council of Ministers Resolution No 45/2016 of 26 August 2016 5 Council of Ministers Resolution No 20/2013 of 10 April 2013 6 Council of Ministers Resolution No 20/2013 of 10 April 2013  NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 18    The challenge for coming years is to ensure that the national authorities, the private sector and civil society implement the commitments that have been made internationally to reduce GHG emissions, simultaneously raising the percentage of renewables in the energy mix while improving energy efficiency and the capacity for interconnection, as well as gradually increasing the level of ambition in complying with the Paris Agreement. NECP also contributes toward achieving other sustainable development targets, especially SDG 1  Eradicating Poverty, SDG 3  Good Health and Well-being; SDG 4  Quality Education; SDG 8  Decent Work and Economic Growth; SDG 9  Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11  Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 12  Responsible Consumption and Production and SDG 15  Protect Life on Land. The Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, approved under the Clean Energy Package for all Europeans, presented by the European Commission in 2016, requires all Member States to prepare and submit an Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) to the European Commission for the 2021-2030 horizon. This plan also requires Member States to set out targets, objectives and the respective policies with regard to decarbonisation, GHG emissions, renewable energies, energy efficiency, energy supply security, the internal market and research, innovation and competitiveness, as well as a clear approach as to how to achieve these goals and targets. NECP will be the main instrument for energy and climate policy for 2021-2030.  1.2.2. Current energy and climate policies and measures across the five dimensions of the Energy Union  Portugal already has a vast set of sector instruments in the area of climate action and energy, which has allowed the country to efficiently implement commitments made at a Community and international level. In this regard, the National Programme on Climate Change (PNAC 2020/2030), approved in 2015 by Council of Ministers Resolution No 56/2015 of 30 July 2015, the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy 2013-2020 (PNAER) and the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency 2013 - 2016 (PNAEE), approved in 2013 by Council of Ministers Resolution No 20/2013 of 10 April 2013, are especially worthy of note. They have now been substituted by the current National Energy and Climate Plan. Moreover, the following list identifies the main sector policy instruments at a national level that are currently in force or at a final phase of implementation, which contribute toward compliance with the goals and targets concerning energy and climate as set out in the current NECP. They also contribute toward aspects of the Energy Union  decarbonisation, energy efficiency, energy security, internal energy market and research, innovation and competitiveness. These instruments are worthy of note owing to their transversal nature, especially the National Programme for Spatial Planning Policy (Programa Nacional da Política de Ordenamento do Território - PNPOT), Circular Economy Action Plan (PAEC) and the Roadmap for Carbon Neutrality (RCN 2050), which comprise the three main axes of the Environment and Climate Action policy. They respectively represent policies for improving the territory, a circular economy and decarbonising society. The coordination and interconnection of these three axes, as well as energy transition, are essential aspects to consider in the context of preparing the current NECP.

Key issues of cross-border relevance  Of note is the agreement in 2006 between Portugal and Spain to create the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL) with the aim of establishing interconnections with commercial capacity of 3 000 MW so as to promote and reinforce price convergence between both markets, as well as strengthen supply security. With regard to regional cooperation in relation to trans-border interconnections, the signing of the Madrid Declaration in 2015 and more recently the signing of the Lisbon Declaration in July 2018 (at the Energy Interconnection Summit) led to a commitment by Portugal, Spain, France and the European Commission to build the necessary infrastructures for implementing an efficient and decarbonised internal energy market. This is particularly important with respect to the trans-border interconnections for gas and electricity networks in Member States which have not yet reached a minimum level of integration into the internal energy market, as is the case with Spain and Portugal. More recently, the Valladolid Declaration was signed in November 2018 between Portugal and Spain in which both Governments emphasised the importance of energy supply security at a European level and the need to NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 23   foment trans-border and inter-regional interconnections to achieve greater integration of the Iberian market/Iberian Peninsula with the rest of Europe, thus promoting the Energy Union and maximising existing European funding mechanisms. With the aim of meeting the challenge to incorporate renewable energies and the development of MIBEL, both governments reaffirmed the importance of the internal and external MIBEL interconnection.  1.2.4. Administrative structure for implementing national energy and climate policies  and energy policies, insofar as it allows not only the progress being achieved to be assessed but also ensures compliance with the commitments made at a Community level pursuant to the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Effort Sharing Regulation. On an international level, it ensures compliance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It is thus important to maximise already existing national monitoring structures, adapting them to this new and more integrated reality of energy and climate policies.  The National System for Policies and Measures (SpeM) will be used to this end, which was created by Council of Ministers Resolution No 56/2015 of 30 July 2015 and subsequently governed by Council of Ministers Resolution No 45/2016 of 26 August 2016, adapting it to include the monitoring of the policies, measures and forecasts that impact on energy transition. This system therefore promotes the debate, design and assessment of progress being made to implement the policies and measures that help reduce GHG emissions and assist in energy transition. This is in line with the targets set out at a national level in this integrated Plan, reinforcing the responsibility of the sectors to incorporate these dimensions into their sectorial policies. It also aims to help meet the monitoring, reporting and forecasting requirements set out in the Governance Regulation, which are largely derived from the requirements previously set out in Regulation (EU) 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 (MMR). Moreover, considering the existing synergies between climate and energy policies and policies and measures for Air, SPeM will continue to support monitoring as well as forecasts in this context. It will also ensure suitable coordination with the National Emissions Inventory System by Sources and Removal of Air Pollutants by Sinks (Sistema Nacional de Inventário de Emissões por Fontes e Remoção por Sumidouros de Poluentes Atmosférico - SNIERPA) and the monitoring and reporting system set out in the National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change (ENAAC 2020). A platform to monitor and report on the impact of the transversal and sectorial policies and measures concerning climate change and energy transition will also be developed, in conjunction with the sectors, by defining indicators and identifying the respective regulatory, financial and taxation instruments.  Governance Model Considering the strategic and transversal nature of energy transition, which has an impact on diverse levels of the economy and society, it is essential for the governance model to reflect the political commitment to this theme and to be implemented by means of effective action and support for progress in the transition. Thus, coherent coordination of the different components set out in this plan entails defining a system of governance, with suitable instruments, without prejudice to the specific competences assigned to the different sectors. The political effort invested in the transition to a competitive, resilient, low-carbon and circular economy which is fully integrated with the targets for economic growth resulted in the creation of the CA2 in 2015 of the NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 24   Inter-ministerial Commission for Air, Climate Change and the Circular Economy (CA2). This commission is presided over by the member of the government responsible for the environment, climate action and energy transition and includes representation by government departments in the sectors of energy, spatial planning, treasury, agriculture, the sea, the economy and innovation, transport, health, tourism, civil protection, regional development, local government, foreign affairs and cooperation, education and science and by representatives of the regional governments of the Azores and Madeira. This Commission provides policy guidelines with regard to climate change and air and also coordinates and integrates climate change policies in sector policies, while monitoring the implementation of the relevant sector measures, programmes and actions that are implemented. The specific competences of CA2 are set out in Official Order No 2873/2017 of 6 April 2017. These competences include the monitoring of compliance with commitments assumed by Portugal on a national and Community level and with regard to the United Nations, the promoting and monitoring of relevant national plans on climate change and circular economy, the validation of proposed policy options and measures with respect to mitigation, monitoring and support for establishing national positioning in international negotiations. Thus, once again using governing structures that already exist at a national level, this Commission will also monitor energy policy and sector policies impacting on national targets concerning air, climate change, circular economy and energy, considering the synergies between these themes. It will also promote, supervise and monitor NECP. To this end, the proposed model aims, firstly, to ensure a long-term political commitment, since the transition to a carbon neutral society is extremely relevant nationally and internationally and impacts on the economy and society, while also presenting an opportunity for Portugal. The governance model covers the following levels:  Figure 12 - Overview of the governance structure  Key PT EN COORDENAÇÃO POLÍTICA POLICY COORDINATION COORDENAÇÃO TÉCNICA SISTEMA DE ACOMPANHAMENTO E PROJEÇÕES TECHNICAL COORDINATION MONITORING AND PROJECTION SYSTEM Comissão para a Ação Climática (CAC) Commission for Climate Change (CAC) Grupo de Coordenação do PNEC PNEC Coordination Group Sistema Nacional de Política e Medidas (SPeM) The National System for Policies and Measures (SPeM)   The Commission for Climate Action is responsible for NECP policy coordination and will act as a structure to promote decision making on a politcy level. To this end it will be necessary to: (i) rename the CA28; (ii) determine that this Commission is responsible for promoting, supervising and monitoring NECP; (iii) update Official Order No 2873/2017 accordingly. Close coordination with other inter-ministerial commissions must be ensured, considering the importance of this theme for European development and funding policies, as well as to comply with national commitments for SDGs. This will thus ensure policy monitoring, while simultaneously defining priorities, validating responsibilities and setting implementation deadlines.                                                             8 Created by Council of Ministers Resolution No 56/2015 of 30 July 2015 (QEPiC) and amended by Council of Ministers Resolution No 190-A/2017 of 11 December 2017 (PAEC). Operational regulations approved by Official Order No 2873/2017 of 6 April 2017 by the Minister for the Environment.  NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 25   The Coordination Group will be responsible for the technical coordination of NECP and will coordinate and promote the preparation and revision of NECP complying with commitments made pursuant to the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and will facilitate the implementation of the policy guidelines set out in NECP. This group to coordinate NECP will be managed by the Portuguese Environmental Agency (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente, I.P. - APA) and by the Directorate-General for Energy and Geology (DGEG). To this end, it will be necessary to: (i) determine its formal creation and (ii) define its composition and competences. The system to monitor and prepare forecasts for NECP will be based on the current system (SPeM) created by Council of Ministers Resolution No 45/2016 of 26 August 2016 and aims: to involve and reinforce the responsibility of sectors to integrate climate aspects into sector policies; ensure accompaniment,  monitoring and reporting on the implementation of policies and measures and their effects, and reporting for forecasts of GHG emissions and otNECP and ENAR. For this purpose, the following will be necessary: (i) ensure greater dynamism among sectors, creating thematic groups that can meet autonomously, maintaining close coordination with Air Policies by providing greater autonomy; (ii) the coordination of each of the thematic groups will be shared between the NECP Coordination Group and the entity/entities with specific competences in the respective sector (coordinator of the thematic group  current SpeM focal point, other elements  the current SPeM involved entities); (iii) determine that SPeM is the system to monitor NECP policies, measures and forecasts; (iv) suitably adapt Council of Ministers Resolution No 45/2016 of 26 August 2016; (v) develop a reporting platform for transversal and sector policies and measures in conjunction with the sectors, identify the respective funding, regulatory, taxation and other instruments and build indicators and goals.   1.3. Consultations and involvement of national and EU entities and their outcome 1.3.1. Involvement of the national Parliament  Pursuant to the Constitution of the Republic of Portugal, the government is responsible, by means of its administrative competences, for carrying out all acts and implementing all measures necessary to promote socio-economic development and satisfy collective needs, which includes approving the National Energy and Climate Plan 2030. The National Energy and Climate Plan 2030 (NECP 2030) was approved by a majority in the Council of Ministers on 19 December 2019, by means of a Council of Ministers Resolution, which is awaiting publication. The national Parliament was involved with respect to the public consultation procedures that were held.   1.3.2. Involvement of local and regional powers  During the course of preparing NECP, meetings and consultations were held with delegations of entities from the Autonomous Regions of Madeira and the Azores pursuant to their autonomy and specific competences. At a local level, the respective entities participated in consultation processes associated with drafting the Plan.   1.3.3. Consultations with stakeholders, including social partners, and engagement of civil society NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 26   Institutional and civic participation was encouraged during the technical tasks of the process of preparing NECP and entities representing different sector interests actively cooperated in proceedings through diverse discussions of NECP in various locations around Portugal. This exercise benefited from the process of preparing the Roadmap for Carbon Neutrality 2050, which involved participatory dialogue with society. Various technical sessions were held with agents from the sector and a cycle of thematic sessions was organised in various locations around the country, focusing on transport (Porto), forestry (Pombal) energy (Lisbon) and fair transition (Lisbon). The entire process of preparing NECP  documents, images and videos of the various sessions  can be consulted on the website www.portugalenergia.pt, which will be constantly updated over the course of this process. Public presentation of NECP The process of broad participation while preparing NECP began with a public presentation of the main lines of action for the 2021-2030 period, which took place during a public session held on 28 January in Lisbon. This session was attended by a wide cross-section of stakeholders in this sector, higher education institutions and goals and targets for 2030, its vision for this time frame, strategic objectives and the main lines of action. Decentralised presentation sessions These sessions sought to disseminate the proposals set out in RCN and NECP and to foment debate around the challenges and opportunities they pose for society. Presentations were given in different parts of the country attended by members of the government, with emphasis on holding various sessions in higher education institutions. A total of five presentations were held between January and March 2018 (Coimbra, Porto, Évora, Faro and Funchal), which included a debate with the participation of diverse specialists from varied areas of energy and climate.  Figure 13 - Decentralised presentation sessions  Themed workshops  Thematic workshops were held with a view to discussing in further detail specific themes relevant to achieving goals and targets. The results obtained during these sessions were considered while preparing the current NECP proposal. NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 27    Thematic workshop on Energy efficiency and Energy Poverty (Lisbon, 18 March) This workshop was organised by the Energy Agency (Agência para a Energia  ADENE) and involved specialists from the energy and climate sectors as well as other specialists and representatives of stakeholders in sectors associated with the respective themes. Its main objective was to promote an in-depth discussion on the themes of energy efficiency for buildings and energy poverty, themes that are crucially important to ensure a fair, democratic and cohesive energy transition, creating conditions to achieve the targets set out for 2030 and ensuring carbon neutrality by 2050.  Thematic workshop on Research, Development and Innovation (Lisbon, 3 April) This workshop was organised in partnership with the National Laboratory for Energy and Geology, (Laboratório Nacional de Energia e Geologia - LNEG) and the Directorate-General for Energy and Geology (DGEG). It involved specialists from the energy and climate sectors as well as other specialists and representatives of stakeholders in sectors associated with the respective themes. Its main objective was to promote an in-depth discussion on the themes of Research, Innovation and Competitiveness, a vitally important theme to create the conditions to achieve the targets set out for 2030 and ensure carbon neutrality by 2050.  Thematic workshop on industry (Aveiro, 17 April) This workshop was organised in partnership with the Directorate-General for Energy and Geology (Direção Geral de Energia e Geologia  - DGEG), the Portuguese Environmental Agency (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente - APA) and the Energy Agency (Agência para Energia - ADENE) and involved specialists from the energy and climate sectors, representatives of technological centres and associations connected with the field. Its main objective was to promote discussion on the theme of Industry, crucially important to create the conditions to achieve the targets set out for 2030 and to ensure carbon neutrality by 2050.  Public consultation After the round of presentations and thematic workshops was concluded, the results of which were incorporated into the current version of the document, a public consultation process was held between 7 May and 5 June 2019. After this process, 59 contributions were received from diverse sectors of the economy and society. These contributions were analysed and incorporated into the version of NECP presented herein.   Strategic environmental assessment To comply with Decree-Law No 232/2007 of 15 June 2007, which sets out the system to assess the effects of given plans and programmes on the environment, transposing Directive No 2001/42/EC of 27 June 2001 and Directive No 2003/35/EC of 26 May 2003 to national legislation, a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) was carried out for NECP 2030. The purpose of SEA is to support the decisions made with regard to the plan, by identifying, describing and assessing its strategic environmental effects, so as to determine opportunities and risks for sustainable development. SEA is based on identifying factors that are critical for making decisions, by which the aspects that are most important and relevant to national territory are analysed and assessed in terms of the environment and sustainability, encompassing the sectors included in NECP. This process began by preparing the Scope Definition Report (SDR) and the respective procedures for consulting with the Entities with Specific Environmental Responsibilities (ESER), pursuant to Decree-Law No 232/2007. Sixteen entities were consulted during this process between 9 July and 9 August 2019 and inputs were obtained NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 28   from 9 entities9: APA, DGT, ANMP, CCDR Centro, CCDR LVT, GPP, IAPMEI, ICNF and IMT. An Environmental Report (ER) and the respective non-technical summary were prepared based on these inputs and these documents were similarly submitted to the aforesaid 16 ESER and were made available for public consultation between 7 October and 28 October 2019. Seven replies were submitted in relation to ESER contributions to the consultations, namely, from APA, IMT, GPP, DG Território, CCDR Algarve, CCDR Alentejo and DGAE. Five entities participated in the public consultation process.   1.3.4. Consultations with other Member States  Consultations with other Member States were conducted through the regional cooperation mechanisms set out in Chapter 1.4 of this plan. It should also be noted that some of the topics with greater trans-border relevance covered by this plan have been discussed with more relevant Member States, particularly Spain and France, in forums such as the High-Level Group (HLG) in relation to interconnections in Southwest Europe. The Luso-Spanish Summit in Valladolid was also important for strategic commitments in matters which are relevant to NECP, more specifically with respect to interconnections, MIBEL and strategies to comply with the Paris Agreement. The Lisbon Summit, held in July 2018 (2nd Interconnection Summit) between Portugal, Spain, France and the European Commission, is equally of note in this regard. Consultation is currently underway with Spain in relation to the current version of NECP. A request has already been made to provide the final version of the Spanish NECP for consultation purposes.   1.3.5. Iterative process with the European Commission  Since 2015, Portugal has actively participated in the European Commission Technical Working Group on Integrated National Energy-Climate Plans (TWG NECP), maintaining open communication with the European Commission and other Member States. Through the status updates at the meetings of this Working Group and the quarterly questionnaires, Portugal kept the European Commission regularly informed of work underway to develop the National Plan. Of note with regard to this working group more recently was the holding last September of the bilateral meetings on energy efficiency and renewable energies. Portugal has also participated on a technical level in the Special Groups, JRC-IDEES (Joint Research Centre Integrated Database on the European Energy System) and POTEnCIA model (Policy-Oriented Tool for Energy and Climate Change Impact Assessment), thus contributing to the ongoing improvement of the database and to the improvement of assumptions and fine tuning of the projection models developed by these groups. As part of the initiative of the European Semester promoted by the COM, a COM delegation was received in November 2019 to discuss a number of topics associated with preparing NECP. Another COM delegation was also received in the same month and two meetings were held with this delegation, one with the DGEG team and the other with the Portuguese Environment Agency (APA) team, to discuss topics concerning the preparation and contents of the final version of NECP.                                                             9 Portuguese Environmental Agency (APA); Directorate-General for Territorial Planning (DGT); Foundation for Science and Technology; Entity for Public Administration Shared Services (eSPap); Department of Planning, Policies and General Administration (GPP); Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation (IAPMEI); Institute for the Conservation of Nature and Forests (ICNF); Institute for Habitation and Urban Rehabilitation (IHRU); Institute for Mobility and Transport (IMT); Directorate-General for Economic Activities (DGAE); Commission for Regional Coordination and Development for Northern Portugal (CCDR Norte); Commission for Regional Coordination and Development for Central Portugal (CCDR Centro); Commission for Regional Coordination and Development for Lisbon and the Tagus Valley (CCDR LVT); Commission for Regional Coordination and Development for the Alentejo Region (CCDR Alentejo); Commission for Regional Coordination and Development for the Algarve Region; (CCDR Algarve); and the National Association of Portuguese Municipalities (ANMP)  NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 29    1.4. Regional cooperation in preparing the plan 1.4.1. Aspects subject to joint planning or coordination with other States  Pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, Portugal participated in two initiatives aimed at promoting regional cooperation. The first initiative was promoted by the French Government, in which Portugal participated along with other nations, including Switzerland, in a session to present the French NECP. It also provided an opportunity to discuss themes associated with defining the plans, based on the NECP that was presented. The second initiative was promoted by the Spanish Government, in which both Portugal and France participated in a meeting where the parties presented their NECPs and the discussions centred on the internal energy market and energy security, especially in relation to energy interconnections.   1.4.2. Explanation of how regional cooperation is considered in the plan  In addition to that mentioned in point 1.4.1, it is important to note that Portugal, as part of foreign policy has promoted numerous interactions with neighbouring Member States, particularly with Spain, at this initial stage of the NECP development process so as to ensure a suitable level of involvement and agreement in areas of cooperation. Therefore, some of the topics with greater trans-border relevance covered by this plan have been discussed with more relevant Member States, particularly Spain and France, in forums such as the High-Level Group (HLG) in relation to interconnections in Southwest Europe. The Luso-Spanish Summit in Valladolid was also important for strategic commitments in matters which are relevant to NECP, more specifically with respect to interconnections, MIBEL and strategies to comply with the Paris Agreement. At this summit, and with particular relevance for regional cooperation, the importance of the Iberian Working Group on Renewable Energies was reiterated, as a contribution to promoting joint work by both countries in relation to energy transition. Also, of note in this regard was the 2nd Interconnections Summit, which resulted in the signing of the Lisbon Declaration by Portugal, France, Spain and the European Commission, with a view to reinforcing regional cooperation for the Energy Union and better integrating the Iberian Peninsula into the internal energy market. At this summit, the three countries agreed on a series of common guidelines with respect to energy and climate policy.
