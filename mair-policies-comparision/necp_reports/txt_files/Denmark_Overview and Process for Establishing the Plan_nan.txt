        5  1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN  1.1 Executive Summary  (i) Political, economic, environmental, and social context of the plan On 27 June 2019 a new Danish Government was formed. The Social Democrats reached agreement with the Red-Party to form a one-party minority Government led by the Social Democrats. The parties agreed to the document titled A fair direction for Denmark.  The parties agreed that the Government will promote a sustainable policy under which Denmark resumes leadership of the green transition, significantly increases its ambitions concerning the climate, environment and nature, and ensures that Denmark is in compliance with the Paris Agreement. The Government has the ambition of being among the world governments that do most  both domestically and abroad  to combat climate change and the deterioration of our environment and nature. In order to reach those targets, a very significant effort will be required throughout the tenure of the Government, which must take place in a socially balanced way. On December 6, 2019 the Government reached an agreement on a new Climate Act with 8 out of the 10 parties in the Danish Parliament. The act will include a legally binding target to reduce greenhouse gases by 70% by 2030 (relative to 1990 level), to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, and to set milestone targets based on a five-year cycle. It is stated in A fair direction for Denmark that a reduction target by 70% by 2030 is a very ambitious goal, and it will be particularly difficult to realise the last part of the goal, i.e. from 65% to 70%. This will require currently unknown methods and, therefore, also a close collaboration with the Danish Council on Climate Change and other experts. The climate act will be followed by climate action plans, which will contribute to ensuring that national reduction targets are met. The Climate Action Plan in 2020 will include sector strategies and indicators as a minimum for central sectors as agriculture, transport, energy, construction and industry. Moreover, Denmark has already taken the first steps towards establishing a professional and efficient energy sector as the basis for the transition to a sustainable green society.  In June 2018 all Parties of the Danish Parliament at the time reached a political Energy Agreement renewable energy, energy efficiency improvements, research and development and energy regulation. The measures and policies decided in the agreement are now in the process of being implemented.          6  (ii) Strategy relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union Decarbonisation -  GHG emissions and removals  On December 6, 2019 the Government reached an agreement on a new Climate Act with 8 out of the 10 parties in the Danish Parliament. The act will include a legally binding target to reduce greenhouse gases by 70% by 2030 (relative to 1990 level), to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, and to set milestone targets based on a five-year cycle. Moreover, the Danish Government will develop Climate Action Plans that will outline concrete policies to reduce emissions in relevant sectors.  Decarbonisation -  Renewable energy The Government has set a very ambitious national target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 70 % in 2030 compared to 1990 levels. To reach this target new initiatives will be adopted which will accelerate the transition to renewables in the energy and transport sector.  Moreover, Denmark has set an ambitious course towards at least 55 % renewables energy in gross final consumption in 2030. That will give an important contribution towards the 2030 EU-target for renewable energy. In June 2018 the Danish Parliament agreed on a policy framework for the energy policy from 2020 to 2024 that will specify the first significant steps towards that achievement. As a result, the renewable capacity and renewable shares are expected to rise steadily in all sectors throughout the period.  Energy efficiency The energy efficiency effort in Denmark has been a highly prioritised policy area since the oil crisis of the 1970s. Denmark has therefore developed a great expertise in energy efficiency, which has made it possible to keep energy consumption largely unchanged in spite of significant economic growth over the last four decades. Due to continuing economic growth and the construction of several datacentres, the Danish energy consumption is expected to increase slightly in the period 2021-2030 by app. 1 Mtoe in primary energy consumption and 0,5 Mtoe in final energy consumption. However, Denmark is planning a number of initiatives and measures for the period 2021-2030 in order to reduce its energy consumption and fulfil its energy saving obligation. The most prominent new energy saving measure for the period, is a subsidy scheme from 2021-2024 targeting private enterprises and buildings, which is projected to save app. 1,2 Mtoe. This is supported by other measures related to energy efficiency and renovation in public and private buildings, which is projected to generate app. 0,66 Mtoe in savings.  Energy security  Denmark currently has a high level of energy security. The Danish gas production will decrease during the next three years as the Tyra facility will be shut down, but the overall energy mix in Denmark is expected to keep a relatively stable trend in its transition towards a green energy system. The continued high level of energy security is ensured through decreased dependency on import from third countries through i) Denmark increase in its renewable energy share largely, ii) Denmark domestic oil and gas production, and iii) Denmark cooperation with         7  neighbouring countries to keep the interconnectivity level high.  It is also ensured through increased flexibility in the energy system, through systematized monitoring of adequacy of the supply in different sectors, through emergency plans and the historical development of a resilient energy system.  Internal energy market  Denmark currently has a high level of interconnectivity and Denmark will uphold and increase interconnectivity through projects coordinated with neighbouring countries. This includes a list of PCI projects and reinvestments in existing interconnectors.  Moreover, Denmark is currently focusing on the functioning and integration of electricity markets, with a focus on developing cross-border markets for balancing products. Regarding cross-border capacity, improvements are expected due to the DG COMP decision on the DK1-DE interconnector as well as measures from Svenska Kraftn√§t for the Swedish interconnectors. Denmark is also focusing on the increase of flexibility in the energy system and the development of better functioning markets in order to facilitate new actors and technologies.  Research, innovation and competitiveness The new Danish Government wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70 % by 2030 compared to the 1990 level as well as reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Denmark must be known as a nation of green entrepreneurialism. Therefore, new technologies and solutions must be developed and deployed.  Denmark has committed to spend 580 mill. DKK in 2020 and 1 billion DKK in 2024 on research, development and demonstration (R&D) of new technologies related to energy and climate. A large share will go to the EUDP programme, which funds projects in line with SET Plan objectives. Moreover, the new Danish government has proposed to increase spending to green research, development and demonstration by 1 billion DKK in 2020. It is expected that a large part of this funding will go to climate-related research and innovation, including research and innovation in clean energy. Furthermore, Denmark wants to intensify export promotion activities in the energy sector  both in scale and volume  to a total of 174 million DKK from 2019 to the end of 2024. (iii) Overview table with key objectives, policies and measures of the plan Table 1 presents an overview of key objectives, policies and measures of the plan.           8  Table 1. Overview of key objectives, policies and measures Dimension Key objectives Key policies and measures Decarbonisation -  GHG emissions and removals Denmark will reduce greenhouse gas emission by 70% in 2030 compared to 1990. The most recent Danish Climate and Energy Outlook (2019) shows that GHG emissions in 2030 will be 46% below 1990 with the effects of implemented and adopted policies and measures, where RE- and EE- policies and measures are key policies and measures. Policies and measures contributing to the achievement of the 2030 target are expected to be decided after the submission of the NECP, in the climate action plans. Denmark will work towards net zero emissions in the EU and in Denmark by 2050 at the latest. Implemented and adopted RE- and EE- policies and measures are key to the emission reductions achieved until now. Additional policies and measures to be decided after the submission of the NECP are expected to also contribute to the achievement of the long-term target in 2050.  -ETS greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 at least by 39% relative to  Policies and measures adopted with the 2018 Energy Agreement promoting RE and EE (see description below under RE & EE).  Additional policies and measures to be decided after the submission of the NECP, including new measures to be adopted in the climate action plans.  Transport sector transition A Commission for Green Transition of Passenger Cars is expected to provide recommendations for policies and measures that will contribute to the green transition of the transport sector.

Ensure that emissions do not exceed removals as accounted in the LULUCF sector Ban on burning of straw residues on fields, public afforestation and a grant scheme for afforestation on private agricultural land and subsidy for conversion of arable land on organic soils to nature. Decarbonisation -  Renewable energy The parties of the Energy Agreement from June 2018 have allocated funding that sets a course towards a renewable energy share of approximately 55% by 2030. The agreement will also lead to a RE share in electricity above 100% of consumption, while ensuring that at least 90% of district heating consumption is based on energy sources other than coal, oil or gas by 2030.  Technology-neutral RE tenders, three new offshore wind farms of at least 800 MW each,  reduction of the electrical heating tax, reduction of the electricity tax, support of geothermal energy and an analysis of modernizing heat.

To be updated after the adoptation of the climate action plans. Energy savings in accordance with the requirements of art. 5 in the energy efficiency directive To be updated after the adoptation of the climate action plans. Energy security Stable and reliable energy supply Laws on responsibilities regarding electricity supply, gas supply and emergency plans. A new planning target is to be set by the Minister of Climate, Energy and Utilities regarding security of electricity supply. The parties of the Energy Agreement from June 2018 have allocated funding that sets a course towards a renewable energy share of approximately 55% by 2030.  Policies and measures adopted with the 2018 Energy Agreement including: Tenders for new renewable energy production facilities, Market Model 3.0, a Smart Energy plan, lowered taxes on electricity,  an analysis of the future tariff design, support of geothermal energy, etc. Moreover, the energy storage fund of 2019.

Research, innovation and competitiveness  Support reduction of greenhouse gas emission by 70 % in 2030 compared to 1990 by developing new technologies and systems in energy, transportation and agriculture. The Energy Agreement states that by 2024 Denmark has a spending target of 1 billion DKK on research, development and demonstration of new technologies related to energy and climate. Morover, with the research reserve agreement 2020, the Government and all the political parties has agreed to increase spending to green research, development and demonstration by 1 billion DKK  in 2020.. Denmark must be known as a nation of green entrepreneurialism. In June 2019, the Government has declared that it will further increase funding to green research and demonstration programs. With the research reserve agreement 2020, the Government and all the political parties has agreed to increase spending to green research, development and demonstration by 1 billion DKK  in 2020.  Denmark has decided to launch export promotion activities for at total of 174 mill. DKK from 2019 to 2024.             10  1.2 Overview of current policy situation (i) National and Union energy system and policy context of the national plan Denmark has a strong tradition of broad political Energy Agreements. In 2012, a broad majority in Parliament reached an Energy Agreement defining initiatives covering crucial energy policy areas for the period 2012-2020. Also, the parties to the 2012 Energy Agreement agreed by 2018 to commence discussions on additional initiatives for the period after 2020, which was concluded with the Energy Agreement from June 2018. Supported by all political parties of the Parliament at the time, the Energy Agreement from June 2018 sets the scene for the Danish energy policy going beyond 2020. The policies and measures decided in the agreement are now in the process of being implemented. On December 6, 2019 the Government reached an agreement on a new Climate Act with 8 out of the 10 parties in the Danish Parliament. The act will include a legally binding target to reduce greenhouse gases by 70% by 2030 (relative to 1990 level), to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, and to set milestone targets based on a five-year cycle. efforts. The overall EU targets for 2020 and 2030, and the national burden sharing that follow from some of these constitute key reference points for the Danish national policies in this area.  The underlying regulations that support the achievement of those targets also constitute a central part of the national regulation and measures to achieve the overall targets. Furthermore, Denmark benefits greatly from being part of a well-functioning internal market for energy in the EU. This is one of the keys to integration of large amounts of renewable energy into the energy system, and will thus only become more important in the years to come.  (ii) Current energy and climate policies and measures relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union See section 1.1 for summery of polices and measures relating to the five dimensions. For more detailed description see chapter 3.  (iii) Key issues of cross-border relevance  As a small country taking part in the integrated Nordic electricity market, cross-border aspects of the energy system have become more and more relevant for Denmark. Especially in light of the increasing amount of fluctuating energy in the energy system, Denmark sees an increased importance of a well-functioning and integrated energy market across borders. Thus, knowledge of the energy mix and policies, as well as co-operation with our neighbouring countries is increasingly important. The North Seas region, which has a large renewable energy potential, is also a key issue of cross-border relevance. The North Seas Energy Cooperation will be explained in section 1.4.  Denmark also participates in the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP). In this forum Denmark collaborates with Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Finland, and Sweden on issues of cross border relevance in regard to infrastructure, markets, gas and electricity, security of supply and integration of renewables.          11  Moreover, Denmark cooperates with Great Britain on the Viking Link project. Viking Link is a 760 km long electricity interconnector between Denmark and Great Britain under construction. The interconnector will enable more effective use of renewable energy, access to sustainable electricity generation, and improved security of electricity supplies. Viking Link will increase the security of electricity supplies in both Denmark and Great Britain. In Denmark, Viking Link will increase the value of wind power. Better possibilities for cross-border electricity trading will contribute to lower wholesale prices for electricity in Great Britain. To meet international and domestic renewable and climate change targets, Great Britain and Denmark are generating more power from renewable sources, including offshore wind. By its nature, wind generation is intermittent and interconnectors provide an effective way to manage these fluctuations in supply and demand. capacity gives rise to a need for extra reserves in the western Danish power grid in order to ensure a balance in the transmission system in case of a defect in Viking Link. The reserves will be obtained via the Danish-German border and through a closer operational cooperation with German TenneT. Moreover, Denmark cooperates with Poland and Norway on The Baltic Pipe project. Direct access of Eastern and Central Europe to gas deposits in Norway will improve the supply security by opening a permanent corridor for the delivery of gas while increasing the competitiveness and price pressure among gas suppliers. The pipeline is also embedded in the climate protectito decarbonize their economies. Baltic Pipe will enable Poland to reduce their coal consumption. As gas emits about half the amount of CO2 compared to coal, the Baltic Pipe Project can contribute to the global reduction of CO2 emission by supporting the phase-out of coal. Furthermore, Baltic Pipe can support the integration of renewable energy sources such as green gas and biogas into the gas transmission system.  Denmark also participates in German-cooperation that aims to ensure security of electricity supply in the framework of the internal energy market. A declaration among the participating countries was signed in 2015, and the different topics of common interest.  (iv) Administrative structure of implementing national energy and climate policies  To prepare the National Energy and Climate Plan, a project group has been established between the Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities and the Danish Energy Agency. The overarching responsibility of the development of the plan is held by the Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities while the Danish Energy Agency is responsible for the modelling and scenario development. Moreover, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Environment and Food, Ministry of Industry, Business and Financial Affairs, Ministry of Taxation and Ministry of Transport and Housing has contributed and been consulted on the plan.           12  The implementation of energy and climate policy is done in the same manner as other sector legislation and is implemented in the Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities. The Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities consists of the Department, the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, the Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency, the Danish Meteorological Institute, the Danish Geodata Agency, the Danish Energy Agency and the associated independent bodies the Danish Energy Regulatory Authority, Energinet and the Danish Council on Climate Change.  Figure 1. Organizational chart of the Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities  The Danish Energy Agency is responsible for the entire range of tasks linked to to energy production, supply and consumption, as well as Danish efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The Agency supports the economical optimisation of utilities that in addition to energy includes water, waste and telecommunication. The agency is also responsible for user conditions, supply obligation and telecommunication statistics as well as water supply and waste management. The Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency provides the public and private sector with high quality data. The task of the Agency is to provide the foundation for political decisions through reliable data which can be combined, and to ensure that geo and administrative data create value across the public sector. The Agency supplies the public sector, citizens and businesses with data, giving them more intelligent and accurate knowledge about society. DMI  The Danish Meteorological Institute provides meteorological services in Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Greenland and the surrounding waters and airspace. Meteorological services include forecasting and warnings and the monitoring of weather, climate and related environmental conditions in the atmosphere, on land and at sea. The Institute carries out Denmark's international meteorological obligations and is the point of contact for exchanging information internationally.         13  The Danish Geodata Agency is responsible for surveying, mapping and land registering of all of Denmark, Greenland, the Faroe Islands and all waters associated with these. GEUS  The Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland is an independent Danish research and advisory institution operating in the areas of environmental geology, water resources, energy and mineral resources. GEUS collects and stores data and is responsible for research, consultancy and communication related to the exploitation and protection of the natural geological resources of Denmark and Greenland. The Danish Utility Regulator regulates the Danish markets for electricity, natural gas and district heating. In the electricity market, the regulation focuses on the network companies. The Authority sets the allowed price for electricity companies with an obligation to supply. In the natural gas market, the regulation also focuses on the network companies. The Authority also sets the price for natural gas supplied by the natural gas companies with an obligation to supply. Energinet is the Danish national transmission system operator (TSO). It is an independent, state-owned company that owns Denmark's electrical and natural gas grid. It also maintains a supply of natural gas. Energinet's primary responsibility is to control and maintain the national electrical transmission grid and the national gas distribution grid. The Council on Climate Change is an independent body of experts. It provides recommendations on climate initiatives in the transition to a low-carbon society based on independent professional analyses centred on the overall objective for 2050.             14  1.3 Consultations and involvement of national and EU entities and their outcome  (i) Involvement of the Parliament  The content of the National Energy and Climate Plan is among other things based on the Energy Agreement of 29 June 2018 adopted by all parties of the Danish Parliament at the time. Moreover, the signatory parties to the agreement are continuously involved and informed about the implementation of the Energy Agreement.  The Danish Parliament has also received the Danish National Energy and Climate Plan, before it was handed over to the Commission.   (ii) Involvement of local and regional authorities There has not been a specific involvement of local or regional authorities, but the involved in the hearing of the plan, as well as the organisation representing the different regions in Denmark, the so- The Local Government of Denmark (KL) has sent a response to the public hearing notice. In the response, KL stresses that in the agreement between the Government and will on an on-going basis involve the municipalities in the work with the green transition, with the purpose of quthat they have not yet been involved in the work with the new climate act and climate action plan.  Moreover, KL underlines strategic energy planning as an important tool in regard to the transition to a renewable energy system. The organisation stresses that strategic energy planning should be a mandatory task for the municipalities, and that the government should set clear guidelines and provide the necessary resources for this. In addition, KL highlights the need for strengthening the possibilities to set up new and bigger onshore wind turbines. KL also advocates for an external fund for multifunctional land distribution and homogeneous requirements for solar PV across state, regions and municipalities. Furthermore, KL argues that the Danish district heating system secures a stable heating system for the citizens. They argue that the commitments in the form of connection and continuation requirements should be reintroduced. Moreover, KL argues for further development of the energy and CO2 account. Finally, KL argues that the government should create better incentives for the utilization of surplus heat.   (iii) Consultations with stakeholders, including social partners, and engagement of civil society and the general public  The Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities has a structure in place where relevant stakeholders get the opportunity to take part in a hearing via the so-called EU Special Committee. The committee consists of approx. 100 stakeholders, interest groups, organisations, NGOs, companies, public institutions etc. The NECP was sent to the EU Special Committee on 22 November 2019, with the opportunity to comment on the plan on 2 December 2019 at the latest. Moreover, the NECP was published on The Danish Ministry         15  consultation. The Ministry has received 12 responses to the public hearing notice from the following respondents: SYNERGI, DANVA, The Danish Construction Association, Confederation of Danish Industry (DI), Danish Ministry of Defence Estate Agency, The Danish 92 group, Wind Denmark, Energinet, Finance Denmark, The Danish Forest Association, the Danish Business Authority and Local Government Denmark. The Danish Consumer Council informed that they did not have any comments. support the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 70 % in 2030. In the following, the responses will be summarised according to the main concerns and themes addressed in the responses, also bearing in mind the five dimensions in the Energy Union. Energy Efficiency Comments in regard to energy efficiency were made by a range of respondents. In general, the stakeholders express that Denmark should increase energy efficiency efforts and highlight the socio-economic potentials of focusing on energy efficiency. Moreover, stakeholders highlight that an increased Danish energy efficiency effort also will ensure Danish leadership and Danish export of energy efficient solutions. In addition, several stakeholders advocate for a national energy efficiency target and for the need for new energy efficiency measures after 2024. The key issues raised can be summarised as follows:  - Energy saving requirements for all public sector buildings (art. 5 in EED). The stakeholders welcome that the Government is working on a plan for energy efficiency in government buildings in 2021-2030 (EED, art. 5). The stakeholders stress that the requirements should also apply to municipalities and regions and some suggest a 3% target.  - Energy saving obligations (art. 7 in EED). The stakeholders stress that Denmark should live up to the energy saving obligation. Moreover, the Government is urged not to notify taxes as part of the fulfilment of the energy saving obligation.  - The long-term renovation strategy: The stakeholders encourage the Government to make an ambitious long-term renovation strategy. Moreover, they argue, that additional benefits, for instance better housing standards and indoor climate benefits should be included in the strategy.  - New finance sources for energy efficiency in private buildings: Several stakeholders argue that there is a need for better financing sources for energy efficiency in private buildings. Many private homeowners have a low knowledge of energy efficiency and there is a lack of attractive financing options in some parts of Denmark.  - The building job scheme: Some also mention that the building job scheme should be revised to make it possible to accumulate the yearly tax allowance over a number of years to undertake bigger and deep energy renovations. The scheme could also be extended to include demolition of buildings in poor energy conditions.           16  - Energy Performance Certificates: One respondent argue that the quality and control of the Energy Performance Certificates should be improved. Moreover, the access to the underlying data should be improved.  Decarbonisation, Renewable energy and internal energy market  Several stakeholders express their support for further deployment of renewable energy, in particular wind power, as a means to meeting the Governments objective of reducing  established before 2030, and another stakeholder encourages the Government to establish with the aim of further deployment of large-scale offshore wind.  In order to maximise the use of the wind resources around Denmark, some stakeholders suggest strengthening exports of electricity to neighbouring country Germany, arguing that when green electricity is exported, this may well replace coal-powered electricity in Germany, thereby having significant benefits for the climate.   Some also mention the importance of giving priority to Power-to-X, i.e. producing liquid fuels from excess wind power electricity. In this context, a national centre for energy storage as well as further deployment of solar PV and onshore wind is also suggested. Several mention Power-to-X as one of several building blocks in an effort to ensure sector coupling, which is highlighted by several stakeholders. By using green electricity to produce hydrogen, renewable energy can be used in transport, and synergy across sectors can be achieved. Sector coupling is also claimed to be able to significantly contribute to increased use of surplus heat (in the industry sector) through heat pumps, thereby contributing to a more energy efficient and green district heating system while at the same time using green electricity. Some underline that public support in Denmark as well as other EU countries are needed for the first large scale hydrogen production facilities. Moreover, some encourage the Government to promote the use of green fuels such as hydrogen based on green electricity in international sea and air transport, even if these sectors are not part of the national 70 pct. reduction objective.  On biomass, one stakeholder stresses that bioenergy accounts for a significant share of overall energy, but that this role could be further increased through the use of wood in construction of buildings, thereby contributing to storage of CO2. Another stakeholder stresses that current conversion from coal to biomass is a bad solution for the climate, claiming that large heat pumps already today constitute an economically feasible solution to replace coal fired production in district heating. Research, development and competitiveness One respondent encourages the Government to increase the support to research and development and another respondent highlights the need for research in CO2 uptake and storage, which they point to, is also already happening. Moreover, a stakeholder encourages the Government to make new initiatives to ensure the terms of competition for the industry and the green industry. In line with this, some stakeholders argue that the use         17  of high national CO2 taxes can lead to a decrease in competitiveness and CO2-leakage. Finally, one respondent notes that the NECP will not result in administrative consequences for the business sector.   Compliance with Governance regulation on public consultation One of the stakeholders argue that the public hearing is not in compliance with the Governance regulation requirements for public consultation and involvement as described in Article 10 and 11, as well as preamble 28. This criticism is particularly related to the public hearing only allowing 10 days (or six working days) to work out responses to the hearing. The same stakeholder encourages the Government to instead undertake a thorough public consultation as part of the process for working out the climate action plan.  The same stakeholder also points out that scenarios in chapter 4 of the NECP are worked out with price assumptions for gas, which are derived from the IEA New Policies Scenario in World Energy Outlook  a scenario which is not compatible with objectives in the Paris-agreement on climate change. This stakeholder notes that the Danish Parliament in 2018 has adopted a decision to, in such cases, if relevant and possible, include sensitivity analysis covering Paris agreement compatible scenarios and price assumptions.  Government remarks to public consultation responses The Government welcomes all responses and will consider the points made in the future work with the climate action plan and other climate and energy initiatives.  The Government is particularly pleased to note the overwhelming support by stakeholders for the Governments target   The Government has already taken concrete steps on some of the points mentioned by the stakeholders. On 2 December 2019, the Government reached agreement with the Red-the Finance Act 2020. As an example, the parties agreed to initiate a preliminary study of -to-X technologies.  In regard to the comments to the energy efficiency effort, the Government is aware that the current measures fall short of reaching the energy saving obligations under article 7 of EED. The Danish Government is committed to fulfill the energy saving obligations under article 7. Measures and instruments contributing to the obligation will be outlined in the upcoming climate action plan.   As regards compliance with Article 10 and 11 of the Governance Regulation, the Government acknowledges that 10 days of hearing under normal circumstances is relative short, bearing in mind the complexity of the plan. However, this also has to be seen in relation to the fact that the NECP does not introduce any new political objectives or policies and measures, as well as NECP scenarios towards 2030 are already published in the Danish Climate and Energy Outlook 2019 (DECO 2019).         18  Over the past year, the draft NECP has been available on the websites of the Ministry as well as the Danish Energy Agency, including a description of the Governance Regulation and the process towards a final NECP in 2019. This has not resulted in any comments or questions. In the years to come the Government will on an on-going basis include independent experts, popular movements and interest organisations with the purpose of qualifying and  Moreover, the Government has taken concrete steps to ensure a close cooperation with the Danish business community on the climate agenda. On 13 November, the Danish Prime represents all branches of Danish business. The Danish business community plays a central role in the green transition and with the climate partnerships, the Government wants to work closely with the business community on how to contribute to solving the climate challenges. The Government remains open to discussing the elements of climate and energy policy with all stakeholders in future processes towards achieving the political objectives. Strategic environmental assessment The NECP has not been subject to a strategic environmental assessment pursuant to the SEA directive. The Danish NECP is a generic and strategic plan, for which the criteria of the SEA directive does not comply. The Danish NECP reports on adopted and planned energy and climate objectives, policies and measures. Hence, the plan provides a holistic overview of Danish energy and climate politics but the reported objectives, policies and measures are founded on other agreements, e.g. the Energy Agreement from 2018 and A fair direction for Denmark from June 2019. The plan in itself does therefore not set the framework for future development, as these are set in other agreements, plans and programmes. However, future concrete plans which set the framework for future development and where land use is concerned and affected will be subject to a strategic environmental assessment. (iv) Consultations with other Member States  Cooperation, coordination and general dialogue is taking place with the Nordic countries via the Nordic Council of Ministers. An ad hoc networking group has been established with participation of the NECP coordinators in the Nordic Countries. This networking group has met to discuss issues of common interest and to share knowledge.  Moreover, consultations with other member states have been conducted through different events and conferences. Denmark participated in the consultation of the Dutch National Energy and Climate Plan on 25 September 2019. Furthermore, the National Energy and Climate Plans were discussed at a Nordic energy seminar on 1 October 2019 in Island. Nordic-Baltic Energy Conference in Tallinn on 24-25 October 2019. These events have served as a platform to exchange information and to enhance cooperation.          19  countries of The North Seas Energy Cooperation (Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Norway and Sweden) and the Nordic countries. Denmark did not receive any comments.  (v) Iterative process with the European Commission Dialogue with the European Commission has taken place within the structure of the Technical Working Group on the National Energy and Climate Plans. Moreover, Denmark has held bilateral meetings with the European Commission.            20  1.4 Regional cooperation in preparing the plan (i) Elements subject to joint or coordinated planning with other Member States  North Seas Energy Cooperation Denmark is part of the wider North Seas region, which has a large renewable energy potential. The European Commission has estimated that offshore wind from the North Seas can cover up to 12 % of the electric power consumption in the EU by 2030.  Offshore wind generation and grid infrastructure projects may have cross-border effects on energy prices, security of supply and the environment, including availability of marine space as well as the pace of innovation. The North Seas countries therefore have great benefits to gain from cooperation.  The North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC) is a voluntary, bottom up, market-oriented, regional cooperation initiative established in 2016, which seeks to create synergies and to avoid incompatibilities between national policies and to share knowledge on international best practices and foster joint strategies where possible and beneficial. The aim is to coordinate and facilitate further cost-effective deployment of offshore renewable energy, in particular wind, ensuring a sustainable, secure and affordable energy supply in the North Seas countries through increased and better coordinated offshore wind deployment as well as potential joint projects or cluster projects. The NSEC focuses on a step-by-step approach with the perspective of further integration and increased efficiency of wholesale electricity markets in the longer term, while contributing to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, in average wholesale price spreads and enhancing security supply in the region.   The North Seas Energy Cooperation consists of 10 countries with participation from the European Commission: Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark.  Regional cooperation As regards to preparing this plan, Denmark made use of the NSEC, in which experts in the support groups shared information and experiences on specific aspects, for example on barriers and best practices of national offshore wind development and in particular on aggregation of national renewable energy trajectories for offshore wind until 2030 and market integration.  Denmark furthermore consulted on its National Energy and Climate Plan in the area of planned offshore wind deployment until 2030 and related grid planning aspects with the other North Seas countries.  The support groups under the cooperation focus on the following subjects:  Support group 1: Maritime Spatial Planning and environmental assessment Support group 2: Development and regulation of offshore grids and other offshore infrastructure Support group 3: Support framework and finance for offshore wind projects Support group 4: Standards, technical rules and regulations in the offshore wind sector         21   Maritime Spatial Planning and environmental assessment Within the North Seas Energy Cooperation, Denmark contribute to the work on establishing common environmental impact assessment methodology. In order to reach our energy and climate targets within the EU, there is a need to better understand the possible ecological limits of large scale wind development in the North Seas. Further work is needed on maritime spatial planning and environmental assessment to be able to utilise the potential of the North Seas. To increase knowledge and support the deployment of offshore wind in the North Seas, the North Seas countries will continue to cooperate closely on maritime spatial planning, environmental research, cumulative impact assessment of wind farms between responsible authorities for energy, maritime spatial planning and environment.   Offshore Grids and other Offshore Infrastructure The NSEC serves as a platform to jointly work on concepts for potential joint wind offshore projects and for coordinated electricity infrastructure including transmission infrastructure.  Denmark works together with the other North Seas Energy Cooperation countries on the possibilities for concrete cooperation projects. Besides joint offshore wind projects that would be connected to and supported by several Member States, this includes the work on possible 'hybrid' solutions that would use cross-border solutions for connecting offshore wind farms to the grid and seek synergies with interconnection capacity between countries, and on the corresponding market arrangements.  Denmark is therefore contributing to the development of possibilities for cooperation on hybrid projects and identifying and addressing possible legal, regulatory and commercial barriers. By coordinating on increased interconnection among the countries in the NSEC, an increasing amount of excess production of energy could flow across borders to meet demand in a well-functioning internal energy market.  The NSEC has identified a list of potential areas and projects in the region, where joint projects could be particularly beneficial. These include: (1) IJmuiden Ver offshore wind farm to UK, (2) CGS IJmuiden Ver  Norfolk, (3) COBRA Cable, (4) DE offshore wind farm connected to NL and (5) North Seas Wind Power Hub.  The NSEC is working on developing concrete concepts for the implementation of selected projects from the above list. The NSEC will continue to work on the actions plans for the specific hybrid projects which can also be taken further at a national and regional level. Furthermore, the cooperation will continue to work as a forum to reflect on how to deal with the uncertainties about the regulatory treatment of hybrid projects at EU and national level and as a forum to discuss options for addressing these issues.  Support Framework and Finance of Offshore Wind Projects As regards to measures, Denmark benefits from the NSEC in several ways. The work in the NSEC provides a platform for exchange of best practice regarding the design of support schemes and to develop and work on new concepts tackling new challenges concerning         22  support for offshore wind as well as to develop possible options for future joint offshore wind projects. Denmark works in the NSEC to coordinate the timing of tenders, to exchange best practices on the design for offshore wind support schemes and to identify, where possible, common principles as well as possible options for alignment of support.  As regards to coordination of tenders, Denmark regularly shares information regarding its national tender schedule with the other NSEC countries with the aim of identifying possible overlaps in time and enabling the most continuous tender pipeline across the North Seas region to ensure that tender processes maximize competition and deliver most value for money to consumers. Denmark is ready to take into account, amongst other criteria and where possible, this overview of tender schedules in its future tender planning to avoid unnecessary bottlenecks and to provide a steady capacity pipeline to involved stakeholders without stop and go cycles. Denmark shares and discusses in the NSEC the estimated national offshore renewable trajectory, information on its national offshore deployment plans and best practices in the design of offshore wind tenders.  At the Ministerial meeting in Esbjerg on the 20th of June 2019, North Seas countries agreed to work together to achieve an indicative aggregated installed offshore wind capacity of Member States of the NSEC of at least 70 GW by 2030 based on national planning. The indicative contribution of Denmark to this aggregate capacity in 2030 is approximately 5 GW considering only already concluded political agreements (see also section 2.1.2). In order to reflect the dynamics of offshore wind deployment in the region, this aggregate planned capacity of at least 70 GW for 2030 can be translated into an overall trajectory with indicative milestones for the region of approximately 25 GW in 2020 and 54 GW in 2025. In the NSEC, Denmark also contributes to the work of analysing and developing options for further mobilisation of investment capital for joint projects, for instance through EU funds such as European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) as well as institutional investors. Such future joint projects could be cross-border projects for renewable energy in accordance with the CEF proposal. Harmonisation of rules, regulation and technical standards The North Seas Energy Cooperation is working on aligning standards and technical requirements that could contribute to further reducing costs of offshore wind deployment. The focus is on aligning rules, regulation and technical standards within five identified areas. These include: (1) Aviation, marking and lights, (2) Health and safety, (3) Certification of regulatory requirements, (4) Park layout and site investigation and (5) Approaches to research. The NSEC works to develop proposals and recommendations for implementation in close cooperation with industry. The aim of those recommendations is to achieve cost reductions whilst at the same time be achievable. The cooperation will continue to work on aligning standards and technical requirements as well as exchange of best practices to reduce unnecessary regulation and costs for the industry.          23  The current mandate for the North Seas Energy Cooperation will expire at the end of 2019. As presidency, Denmark is working on securing a prolongation with a new working programme, which tackles the increasing focus on reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050 and the indispensable role that offshore renewables in the North Sea plays in reaching this goal. The new working programme will intensify the focus on maritime spatial planning, establishing the necessary transmission grids to connect off-shore wind to consumers and businesses, and the need for further cooperation in identifying and developing hybrid projects. It has already been decided to establish tree ad hoc working groups to intensify analytical work on how to make progress on three hybrid projects. Moreover, the cooperation will increase its level of ambition by securing a governance structure, where issues can and must quickly be raised on a political level and thereby securing the necessary progress.  Nordic Council of Ministers Denmark is a member of the Nordic Council of Ministers, which is the official body for inter-governmental co-operation in the Nordic Region. This cooperation covers both climate and energy with separate Ministerial meetings, committees, and technical working groups.   The Nordic Prime Ministers have agreed on a new vision for the Nordic cooperation, which entails an increasing focus on the green transition of the Nordic region in order to support already well establish cooperation on both climate and energy matters will be intensified even more in the years to come, and a larger part of the budget in the Nordic cooperation will allocated to these areas.  In 2020 Denmark will hold the rotating presidency for the Nordic Council of Ministers. As the first presidency to implement the new vision of the Nordic cooperation Denmark will initiate new projects in the field of energy and climate. Priority areas will be decarbonisation of the transport sector, Nordic cooperation in global fight against climate change, the Nordic electricity market, and Power-to-X. Nordic climate cooperation The Nordic cooperation on climate focuses on projects related to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reaching climate neutrality in the Nordic countries.  There is a Nordic working group for Climate and Air that will contribute to the implementation of the Programme for Nordic Co-operation on the Environment and Climate 2019-2024. The mandate of the group is to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution and to seek synergies between initiatives related to climate and air.  During the Danish presidency in 2020, Denmark will launch a project that aims to contribute to the decarbonisation of the transport sector with a primary focus on more sustainable aviation.  Nordic energy cooperation The Nordic cooperation on energy focuses on the Nordic electricity market, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and many other energy related matters. At their meeting in 2019         24  the Nordic energy ministers decided on a new vision for the Nordic electricity market cooperation. This entails that by 2030 the Nordic countries aim to have the most competitive, innovative and consumer-oriented electricity market which contributes to reaching the ambitious Nordic climate targets.  As a new initiative, a new ad hoc working group on national energy and climate plans has been established. The mandate of the group is to provide a forum for cooperation on the  group functions as a contact point for regional consultation of the Danish NECP.  The Nordic Council of Ministers cooperates closely with the Baltic countries. The Baltic countries are therefore involved with a broad range of projects and initiatives in the Nordic cooperation including e.g. a new ad hoc working group on CCS/CCUS. The Nordic and Baltic countries also organise joint events on current energy issues of common interest. A Nordic-d thus provides a platform for exchange of views and sharing of knowledge between the Nordic and Baltic countries on their plans. Nordic energy research cooperation Nordic Energy Research is an institution under the Nordic Council of Ministers, which functions as a platform for cooperative energy research and policy development. As a new initiative Nordic Energy Research has undertaken a close dialogue with the Nordic research in the Nordic region. Close cooperation between the Nordic countries on energy research will thus continue in the years to come. (ii) Explanation of how regional cooperation is considered in the plan  As explained in the previous section Denmark benefits from regional cooperation in several ways. The NSEC provides an important forum for cooperation on offshore wind, while the Nordic Cooperation has a much broader scope.
