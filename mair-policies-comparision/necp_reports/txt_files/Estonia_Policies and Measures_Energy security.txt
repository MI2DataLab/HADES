Energy efficiency topics are also dealt with in the Committees of the Senior Officials of the Baltic Council of Ministers, as appropriate. These collaboration formats are described in chapter 1.4.ii. viii. Financing measures, including EU support and the use of EU funds in the area at national level It is planned that European Union support and Union funds should also be used in EU budget period years 2021 to 2027. Planning of the subsequent EU budget period is in the initial phases.  Energy Security Dimension 133 i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.3134 The general principles for safeguarding energy security in Estonia are established in Chapter 135: Energy security can be ensured through security of supply, security of infrastructure, interconnectivity with the energy networks of the other EU Member States and the diversity of energy sources. To reduce dependency on imported energy sources, it is of primary importance for Estonia to increase energy efficiency. The EU strategy to make the best use of and develop indigenous energy resources creates a favourable environment for the security of the energy supply. For Estonia that means making use of oil shale and peat in as rational as possible a manner, and the wider deployment of renewable energy technologies. Functioning transmission connections with the Baltic States, Nordic countries and Poland ensure the security of energy supplies by reducing dependency from one supplier or a limited number of suppliers. The stability of the liquid fuel market is ensured with the EU measure of maintaining the liquid fuel stock. The trend for Estonia is to generate electricity and thermal energy from renewable energy sources. In the generation of thermal energy, a better balance is required between the used energy sources, and conditions must be created for switching the larger heat producers from natural gas to other fuels. Necessary security and safety requirements must be applied in order to ensure the business continuity of the energy systems and protection of the energy infrastructure. Energy security is handled as a critical service for ensuring the societal continuity and security development plan 2015-requirements for providers of vital services are described in the Emergency Act. To achieve energy security, it is necessary to ensure security of supply, security of                                                            133  134 Consistency must be ensured through preventive action and emergency plans under Regulation [as proposed by COM(2016) 52] concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and repealing Regulation (EU) No 994/2010, as well as the risk preparedness plans under Regulation [as proposed by COM(2016) 862] on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector and repealing Directive 2005/89/EC. 135 National Security Concept https://www.riigiteataja.ee/aktilisa/3060/6201/7002/395XIII_RK_o_Lisa.pdf# infrastructure, interconnectivity with the energy networks of other EU Member States and the diversity of energy sources. The document also emphasises that to reduce efficiency. Cybersecurity The recommendations of the European Commission regarding cybersecurity in the energy sector provide for the implementation of cybersecurity readiness measures in real time. This primarily means that network operators, suppliers of technology and providers of vital services must meet the requirements of the relevant standards, private and public network service levels; the zoning of networks for the planning and implementation of appropriate cybersecurity measures; establishment of communication, monitoring and cooperation protocols, risk analysis and authentication mechanisms. Member States must inform the Commission of implementation of the Commission's recommendations within 12 months or by April 2020 at the latest, and thereafter every two years via the NIS (Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems)136. The E-state Academy develops a cybersecurity index on the basis of which Estonia holds second place after Czechia in cybersecurity137. This position shows the readiness and systemic approach of Estonia in ensuring cyber security. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications coordinates cybersecurity policymaking and implementation of the strategy, as well as cooperation between the relevant public authorities and the broader community. On a strategic level, coordination takes place via the Cyber Security Council by the Security Committee of the Government of the Republic. In addition to the Government Office and ministries, other organisations that help to ensure cybersecurity in Estonia are the Information System Authority, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority, the Estonian Internet Foundation, the State Infocommunication Foundation and Enterprise Estonia and Startup Estonia138. The vision of the Estonian cybersecurity strategy for 2019-2022 is that Estonia will be the most cyber-safe digital country. By coping efficiently with cyber risks, Estonia is able to ensure the safe and uninterrupted functioning of the digital society by relying on the joint capabilities of the national authorities, a knowledgeable and participatory private sector and outstanding research competence. Estonia is an internationally recognised trendsetter in the area of cybersecurity that supports state security and contributes to the growth of the competitiveness of companies operating in the area. Society as a whole perceives cybersecurity as a shared responsibility in which everyone has a role to play. Various economic sectors in Estonia need 1.5 times more ICT specialists than now each year. The professional cyber skills of specialists working in companies in sectors that deal with the provision of essential services are of crucial importance for society. The objective is to ensure the necessary labour force for both the state and the public sector by developing talented                                                            136 European Commission recommendation on cybersecurity in the energy sector https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/commission_recommendation_on_cybersecurity_in_the_energy_sector_c2019_2400_final.pdf 137 Cyber security index https://ncsi.ega.ee/ 138 Cyber Security https://www.mkm.ee/et/tegevused-eesmargid/infouhiskond/kuberjulgeolek young people in formal education as well as through extra-curricular activities and training cybersecurity specialists in conformity with the demands of the labour market139. Companies that provide essential services in the energy sector have a risk analysis and plan for the business continuity of essential services140 that contains, among other things, the managing of the risks of cyberattack141. The electricity system  The following NDPES 2030 measures contribute most directly to ensuring security of supply and the achievement of related targets (see Table 13):  Measure 1.1 Development of electricity production; and  Measure 1.2 Efficient transmission suitable to meet the needs of the electricity sector Under Section 4(41) of the Electricity Market Act, the regulator (the Competition Authority) may require the system operator to invite tenders for the creation of new production capacities, energy storage devices or energy efficiency/demand-side falls below the capacity reserve established in the grid code. The following measures are applied for achieving the targets described in Chapter 2.3 (see Annex ): EN1 Renewable energy support and support for efficient cogeneration of heat and power EN9 Increasing the share of the weatherproof grid EN11 Synchronisation of the Baltic electricity system with the synchronous areas of Continental Europe Investments in the Baltic States made within the framework of the project for the synchronisation of the Baltic States (see point 2.4.2), which help eliminate bottlenecks in Estonia and also in the other Baltic States and increase the preparedness of external connections and the flexibility of the electrical system to respond to rapid changes in power generation also contribute to the resilience of the electrical system. The Estonian government is planning to pay support for the use of biofuels to power stations that enable co-incineration but are not competitive due to the increasing price of the permitted carbon emission credit. This makes it possible to increase national energy security and improve domestic production capacity. Estonia also plans to start organising technology-specific reverse auctions for bringing electricity from renewable energy sources to market. This would make it possible to organise reverse auctions for bringing controllable production equipment to market, and that would in turn contribute                                                            139 Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Estonia https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/kyberturvalisuse_strateegia_2022_eng.pdf 140 Vital services https://www.siseministeerium.ee/et/eesmark-tegevused/kriisireguleerimine/elutahtsad-teenused 141 Manual for the preparation of risk analysis and business continuity plan for providers of vital services https://www.siseministeerium.ee/sites/default/files/dokumendid/Kriisireguleerimine/toimepidevuse_riski analuusi_koostamise_juhend_nov_2017.pdf to the stability of the electricity system. Gas transmission system The following NDPES 2030 measure contributes to ensuring the security of gas supply and achieving the related targets (see Table 14)  Measure 1.3 Safeguarding the gas supply. The main instrument for achieving the objectives described in chapter 2.3 is building the Balticconnector gas connection between Estonia and Finland. No additional national measures for increasing energy security are planned for the period 2021-2030. At the same time, the private sector is considering implementing projects that would contribute to the security of the gas supply (e.g. AS Tallinna Sadam and AS Alexela Invest are considering building an LNG terminal in Paldiski together). District heating systems To ensure the security of supply in district heating systems, the District Heating Act 142 provides for additional commitments for the power companies. The power company is the provider of the lifeline services for the district heating systems where more than 50 GWh/year of thermal energy is transmitted to the customer and that are located in the local government unit with a population of at least 10 000. In very large systems, where the consumption of thermal energy is at least 500 GWh/year, it is compulsory to provide the possibility of using the amount of reserve fuel that would ensure the heat supply over three twenty-four hour periods. Liquid fuels To ensure the continuous availability of liquid fuels, the provisions of Directive EU 2009/11 and the Liquid Fuel Stocks Act are observed143, and from 19 November 2013 the requirements of maintaining the stock provided for in the energy program of the International Energy Agency and one of the NDPES 2030 measures are also implemented:  Measure 1.4 Maintenance of gas reserve. In addition to general reserve quantity, the Liquid Fuel Stocks Act establishes that the quantity that is equivalent to at least 30 day average quantity of the corresponding domestic energy product in the previous calendar year must be maintained in Estonia. 53% of the reserves were on Estonian territory in 2018. Oil shale The possibilities for using oil shale and the demand for oil shale products are associated                                                            142 https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/103032017012?leiaKehtiv 143 https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/101072017019?leiaKehtiv with the increasing stringency of the international energy and climate policy targets. Under the -also remain an important fuel in the period 2021-2030, and the following measures (NDP for the use of oil shale 2030)51 will be applied for ensuring the security of the oil shale supply:  Measure 1.1. Promoting of the sustainable mining of oil shale;  Measure 1.2. Reducing the negative impact of oil shale mining on the natural environment and water supply;  Measure 2.1. Increasing the efficiency of oil shale utilisation; and  Measure 2.2. Reducing the negative environmental impact of the use of oil shale. To replace the production capacity involved in closing ageing oil shale incineration blocks (619 MW by the end of 2019 and 658 MW in  subsequent years144) during the period 2021-2030, this plan will apply measures for the construction of new renewable energy production capacities (measures EN1 and EN2 in Annexes III and IV of this draft).  ii. Regional cooperation in this area The electricity system In addition to the regional groups in the PCI, the electricity TSO (Elering AS) cooperates in the security of supply area in the following formats: 1. Balti regional security coordinator (hereinafter Balti RSC) 2. Cooperation organisation BRELL of the system operators of Belarus, Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. coordinator by guaranteeing its support in increasing the region's security to the Baltic system operators through the provision of necessary services. The Baltic RSC is one of the five regional security coordinators in Europe that cover all system operators in Europe. The objective of the services provided by RSCs is to enhance preparations for real-time management of electrical systems. The main functions that the regional security coordinator performs are: 1. Coordination of the interruptions of electrical system equipment with cross-border effect; 2. Preparation of Europe-wide reports on interruptions, coordination of interruptions and detecting inconsistencies; 3. Quality assurance of the common grid models used by the system operators and assembly of the regional and Europe-wide common grid model, including                                                            144 Competition Authority 2019 Report on electricity and gas market in Estonia in 2018 https://www.konkurentsiamet.ee/index.php?id=23346 uniform standard, assessment of the quality of the model and giving feedback to the system operators; 4. Assessment of the adequacy of regional production and transmission capacities for a short and medium period in the future, including an assessment of the adequacy of the pan-European production and transmission capacities and an assessment of whether production is adequate. 5. Coordinated calculation of cross-border transmission capacities, including the calculation of regional transmission capacities on the basis of a single methodology and the coordination of capacities among system operators. 6. A coordinated analysis of the operational security of electrical systems, during which bottlenecks in operational security are identified using the single grid model, and possible solutions are coordinated with system operators. The Baltic RSC continuously collaborates with the RSCs of the Nordic countries as well as those of Central Europe, in order to ensure better collaboration on the borders between the regions. The RSC's role is to supervise and support; all final management decisions in the system are made by the system operators who actually manage the system.145 The Estonian electricity system belongs to the same synchronous area with the electricity systems of Belarus, Russia, Latvia and Lithuania (UCTE). In standard situations, the system operator for Russia ensures the automatic regulation of the frequency of the Estonian electricity system (except when the Estonian electricity system operates in isolation from other electricity systems). The BRELL cooperation organisation of the TSOs of Belarus, Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania was established in order to organise synchronous operation in the UCTE, incl. maintaining frequency within required limits,. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have implemented a coordinated balance control in their electricity systems as of 01.01.2018. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are seen as a joint balance area and one of the Baltic system operators is responsible for balancing the overall balance in the Baltic States. To minimise the deviation from the summarised alternating current of the Baltics, back-up capacities are started up within required amounts from the joint list of operators that can provide supply for balancing the system.146 Gas transmission system As the gas system operator, Elering AS is involved in the Regional Gas Market Coordination Group (RGMCG) of the Baltic States and Finland. In addition to the system operators of the relevant States, the controllers and the ministries responsible for the area also belong to the working group.                                                            145 Elering AS.

Balancing rules https://elering.ee/sites/default/files/attachments/Bilansi%20tagamise%20ehk%20tasakaalustamise%20eeskirjad%2001.2018.pdf In addition, a working group was established between the 3B+FI countries (North Eastern gas supply risk group) under Article 3(7) of the Security of Supply Regulation (EU 2017/1938) to jointly prepare a risk analysis of the security of supply of natural gas and the plans for preventing and resolving emergencies. Representatives of the ministries, regulators and gas transmission system managers participate in the working group. Solid fossil fuels Estonia does not have any regional or international agreements that deal with the supply of solid fossil fuels. Nevertheless, Estonia has joined one international agreement that could theoretically affect the supply with solid fossil fuels. An act on accession to the treaty on Spitzbergen that was adopted by the Riigikogu on 4 February 1930147148, enables Estonia to mine minerals in Sptizbergen, among other economic activities. Estonia does not plan to commence mining-related economic activities in Spitzbergen. iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds. The Estonian TSO (Elering), in cooperation with the Latvian, Lithuanian and Polish the Baltic electricity system with the synchronous areas  The TSO finances activities related to the development of the electricity grid from the network fee collected from consumers. The resources from the so-are also used for building cross-border interconnectors. The intention is to use EU co-financing to fund the measure. The Baltic States synchronisation project has been on the list of EU Projects of Common Interest (PCI) since 2013. Construction of the third Estonia-Latvia interconnection, for example, has received co-financing for implementation of the measure. Project financing has been applied for within the framework of this financing period, and the financing of these projects will also be necessary in the next EU financing period. An accurate review of the status and activities of the project is available on the ENTSO-E web page62, which describes the project.                                                            147 https://dea.digar.ee/article/AKriigiteataja/1930/02/18/4 148 https://dea.digar.ee/article/AKriigiteataja/1930/02/18/5
