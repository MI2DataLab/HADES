4.2 Dimension decarbonisation  4.2.1 GHG emissions and removals  4.2.1.1 Trends in current GHG emissions and removals in the EU ETS, effort sharing and LULUCF sectors and different energy sectors214  Total GHG emissions and removals Sweden emitted 5.7 million tonnes CO2 equivalents of greenhouse gases (excluding LULUCF) in 2017. Sweden's emissions have fallen by 26% since 1990. Most of the reductions occurred in 2003-2014. The emissions varied between a maximum of 76.9 tonnes CO2 equivalents in 1996 and a minimum of 52.7 tonnes CO2 equivalents in 2017. Annual variations are due primarily to temperature fluctuations, rainfall patterns and the economic cycle. Sweden has a net uptake of carbon dioxide. The net sink varied in the period 19902017. The total net uptake in 2017 was 44 million tonnes CO2 equivalents, which corresponds to 83% of the total emissions. See Figure 12 for total emissions and uptake in Sweden.                                                       214 All information in this section comes from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency  National Inventory Report Sweden 2019, Greenhouse gas emission Inventory 19902017. 124 (199)  Figure 12 Total emissions and uptake in Sweden, 19902017.

The long-term reductions in emissions occurred primarily between 2003 and 2014. The reductions can be explained partly by the measures taken, for example the transition to renewable energy and energy efficiency, and partly by stagnation in industry. The measures that influenced emissions were carried out over a longer period; some of them began before 1990.  Emissions in the non-traded sector Emissions of greenhouse gases in the non-traded sector were around 32 million tonnes CO2 equivalents in 2017. That means a 0.7% reduction between 2016 and 2017 and a 32% reduction since 1990. Emissions from domestic transport accounted for half of the emissions in the non-traded sector in 2017. These emissions fell by 3% between 2016 and 2017 and were 19% lower in 2017 than in 2010. This reduction can be explained largely by an increase in the use of diesel and biofuel, both in the form of low biodiesel blends and, increasingly, pure biodiesel. The replacement of old passenger 126 (199) cars with new, energy-efficient vehicles also helped to reduce emissions.  Emissions from Swedish installations within the EU ETS Emissions from Swedish installations that are part of the EU's emissions trading system fell by 18% between 2005 and 2017. Domestic aviation that belongs to the ETS also reduced its emissions by 18%. However the developments differed between industries and periods. Emissions from electricity and district heating have fallen by around 26% since 2005, largely due to a reduction in the use of fossil fuel. Emissions within the sector vary from year to year, mainly as a result of differences in temperature and rainfall.  4.2.2 Projections of sectoral developments with existing national and Union policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) Sweden's total greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 were 26% lower than in 1990. The scenario indicates that total greenhouse gas emissions will continue to fall. With the current policy, the estimated emissions in 2030 are 35% lower than in 1990 (see Figure 15).  Historic emissions and scenarios by sector are presented in Table 26215. Emissions from domestic transport come from: passenger cars, light and heavy goods vehicles, buses, motorcycles and mopeds, trains, and domestic aviation and maritime traffic.  The LULUCF sector has contributed to an annual net sink in Sweden in 19902017 and is expected to continue to do so during the scenario period.    Figure 15.

The remaining emissions from activities on Swedish territory must be at least 85% lower than in 1990. Sweden has also set intermediate targets to help achieve the overall environmental quality object of Limited Impact on the Climate (see Section 2.1.1).

LULUCF) will continue to fall, but not to the extent required to achieve the 2045 target. Total emissions in 2045 are predicted to be 3441% lower than in 1990. That is an emissions shortfall of 4247 million tonnes CO2 equivalent in comparison with the target, or 3136 million tonnes if complementary measures are fully utilised. This can be compared with the total emissions of 52.7 million tonnes in 2017. The scenario shows that further measures are needed to achieve the target.  4.2.3 Renewable energy  4.2.3.1 Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in each of these sectors. Table 27 shows the developments in the total share of renewable energy and the share of the electricity, transport and heating/cooling sectors218 since 2005. The shares shown in Table 27 are taken from the official reports made in Shares219, the calculation tool used in the Renewable Energy Directive220.                                                        218 The heating and cooling sectors cover industry, housing and services, and district heating. 219 Shares is a calculation tool which harmonises the calculation method for all Member States. The tool is provided by Eurostat and ensures that Member States use the same method to calculate the share of renewable energy. 220 Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. 129 (199)  Table 27 Share of renewable energy according to the calculation tool provided in the Renewable Energy Directive, total and by sector, 20052017, per cent.  2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Total share of renewable energy  40.5  42.6  44.1  45.2  48.1  47.2  48.7  51.1  51.9  52.4  53.6  53.8  54.5 Electricity 50.9 51.8 53.2 53.6 58.3 56.0 59.9 60.0 61.8 63.2 65.8 64.9 65.9 Transport221 6.2 7.1 8.0 8.3 8.9 9.2 11.7 14.8 17.7 19.9 22.9 28.8 27.2 Heating and cooling  51.8  56.3  58.7  61.0  63.6  60.9  62.2  65.8  67.1  67.9  68.6  68.5  69.1  Total share of renewable energy by technology/energy source The share of renewable energy in relation to gross energy consumption in 2017 is 54.5%, as shown in Figure 17. That is 0.7% higher than in 2016. since 2005222.  Figure 17 Development of the share of renewable energy in 2005-2017 and indicative trajectory up to 2020, per cent.  Source Target Vägledande förlopp, 2020 Indicative trajectory, 2020 Faktisk andel förnybart Actual share of renewable energy  The share of renewable energy depends on the development of energy consumption in overall, and specifically on the development of renewable energy consumption. Energy consumption in 2017 was 410 TWh, which is the virtually the same as 2016. Energy consumption has been relatively stable since 2005, at just over 400 TWh, in spite of the fact that the population has risen by just over a million in the same period.  229 TWh223 of renewable energy was consumed in Sweden in 2017 according to the calculation method given in the Renewable Energy Directive224. That is 4 TWh more than in the previous year, most of which is                                                       221 Some fuels are double counted in the renewable energy share according to the calculation method provided in the Renewable Energy Directive. 222 The indicative trajectory is a trajectory for the development of the share of renewable energy which is calculated by a formula given in the Renewable Energy Directive (REDI). It shows the rate the share must achieve in each Member State. 223 As the electricity certificate system is run jointly with Norway and more than half of the renewable electricity is generated in Sweden, electricity is transferred statistically to Norway. 5.4 TWh of the 229 TWh were transferred to Norway in 2017. The transfer corresponds to 1.3% of Sweden's share in 2017. 224 Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. 130 (199) due to the rise in biofuel consumption in the transport sector and the further expansion of wind power. The total increase since 2005 is 61 TWh. The consumption of biofuels and wind power make the biggest contribution to the high renewable energy consumption, as shown in Figure 18. The contribution of heat pumps225 rose from 7 TWh in 2005 to 16 TWh in 2016.

In 2017, biofuels accounted for 57% of renewable energy according to the Renewable Energy Directive; their share has not fallen below 55% since 2005. Biofuels are used mainly in industry and for district heating. However, the largest increase in recent years has been in the transport sector, where the consumption of biofuels has risen. Figure 19 shows the consumption of biofuels by sector.                                                          225 Heat pumps are included here as heat absorbed, subject to some limits. 131 (199) Figure 19 Consumption of biofuels by sector, 2005-2017, TWh   Source Target Industri Industry Fjärrvärmeproduktion District heating Transporter Transport Bostäder m.m. Housing etc. Elproduktion Electricity generation  Hydropower makes the next biggest contribution to the large share of renewable energy, both historically and in 2017, when it accounted for 29% of renewable energy.  Wind power has grown by the highest percentage since 2005 and accounts for 8% of renewable energy; that is slightly more than heat pumps, which accounted for 7% in 2017. Solar power accounted for 0.2% of renewable energy in 2017.  The share of renewable electricity generation by energy source/technology The share of renewable electricity generation in relation to total electricity consumption in 2017 was 65.9%, one per cent higher than in 2016. In 2005, the share was 50.9%. The higher share in 2017 as compared with 2016 is mainly due to an increase in wind power.  In 2017 96 TWh electricity was generated from renewable sources226, 66 TWh227 from hydropower, 17.2 TWh228 from wind power and 10.3 TWh from biomass in combined heat and power plants and in industry. The remaining 2 TWh were produced with from renewable waste, bio-oils and a small amount of solar power.                                                        226 A temperature correction is applied to electricity generated from hydro- and wind power using the method given in the Renewable energy Directive. 227 Temperature-corrected value, actual production was 64.6 TWh. 228 Temperature-corrected value, actual production was 17.6 TWh. 132 (199) Electricity consumption fell from 151 TWh in 2005 to 145 TWh in 2017 in spite of the fact that the population increased from 9.05 million to 10.12 million in the same period. This is mainly due to a 5 TWh reduction in electricity consumption in industry between 2005 and 2017. Figure 20 shows the development of electricity generated from renewable sources and electricity consumption.

This is a 1.5% reduction from the previous year. The reduction between 2016 and 2017 is due to the increase in the volume of biofuels which are not double counted, which have replaced some of the biofuels which are double counted. The share of renewable energy in the transport sector in Sweden has increased significantly since its 2005 level of 6.2%.                                                          229 Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. 133 (199) Figure 21 Actual consumption of renewable energy and electricity (TWh) as a proportion of renewable energy with and without double counting (%), 20052017.

As HVO has the same chemical composition as fossil diesel, a high proportion can be added to blends with fossil diesel, which are the fuels primarily used. The biofuel with the next largest share is biodiesel in the form of FAME followed by ethanol and biogas.  Biofuels produced from raw materials covered by Annex IX to the Renewable Energy Directive230 are double counted in the Directive. This affects the share of renewable energy in Sweden, as a small proportion of HVO and a large proportion of biogas is currently produced from raw materials counted in Annex IX.  The renewable part of the electricity used in transport is also rewarded in the calculation method in the Renewable Energy Directive. The electricity consumption reported by Sweden, which is shown in Figure 21, is for rail transport.                                                       230 Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources.  134 (199)  The electricity consumption of cars and other vehicle for road transport is not reported as there are no official statistics for this.  Without using the double counting calculation method given in the Renewable Energy Directive, the share of renewable in the transport sector was 22% in 2017.  Renewable share in the heating and cooling sector by technology/energy source The share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector231 in relation to energy consumption was 69.1% in 2017 and therefore 0.6% higher than in 2016, as shown in Figure 22.

The largest increase is in wind energy, which is expected to rise by 35 TWh between 2020 and 2040. Biofuel consumption is also expected to rise by 15 TWh by 2040. In the scenarios, biofuel consumption is distributed relatively evenly between industry, the housing sector and electricity for generating heat in CHP plants; but there is also a small increase in the transport sector.

The result depends on the conditions set in the model, especially those for future technology and electricity prices. The actual expansion of wind will very probably exceed the result in Referens EU,                                                       235 Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. 138 (199) at least in the short term, as many projects are currently being planned and built.  If the share of electricity generated from renewable sources is compared with the total amount of electricity generated instead, the result for 2040 is lower, at around 84%. This is mainly due to the fact that the scenario still contains some nuclear power and some of the electricity is generated with fossil fuels from waste and steel production residues. Sweden will therefore not achieve its target of 100% electricity generated from renewable sources by 2040.  Renewable share in the transport sector up to 2040 The scenario estimates that, when calculated by the method given in the Renewable Energy Directive236, the share of renewable energy in the domestic transport sector will rise from 27% in 2017 to 48% in 2030 and 52% in 2040, as shown in Figure 26. The share of renewable energy in 2017 is relatively low, in spite of the increase in the amount of HVO, because only a certain amount of the HVOs is produced from raw materials covered by Annex IX to the Renewable Energy Directive and therefore double counted. The introduction of the reduction obligation system in Sweden is expected to increase the share of double-counted biofuels during the lifetime of the system237. Section 3.1.1 provides more information about the reduction obligation.  However, in Referens EU, the consumption of biofuels, particularly HVOs, increases most, which contributes to a sustained increase in the share of renewable energy. Electricity consumption is also expected to rise in line with the share of electricity generated from renewable sources, and therefore increases the share of renewable energy.  Total energy consumption in the transport sector falls during the period covered by the scenario, which also increases the share of renewable energy.                                                          236 Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. 237 The fuels that reduce climate emissions the most tend to be those that are double counted. See the list of raw materials in Annex IX to Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. 139 (199) Figure 26 Consumption of renewable energy and electricity (TWh) calculated according to the method in the Renewable Energy Directive and share of renewable energy with and without double counting (%), 2005-2040.

This is mainly due to the expected rise in the consumption of biofuels in industry and for district heating. The use of heat pumps also increases with the introduction of waste heat238 into the calculations from 2025 onwards. Energy consumption for heating and cooling increases slightly between 2020 and 2040 in the scenarios, which reduces the share
