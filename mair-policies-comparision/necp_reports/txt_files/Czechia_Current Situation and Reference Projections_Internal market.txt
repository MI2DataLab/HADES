4.5  4.5.1 Electricity interconnectivity153 i. Current interconnection level and main interconnectors154 The methods of determining the degree of electricity interconnectivity may vary according to what the total available transmission capacity of all the profiles of the given system is related to. The 10 % interconnection target under the Barcelona Agreement is measured as the ratio of net transmission capacity to installed production capacity  with an emphasis on the integration of the internal electricity market. The current State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic determines the degree of integration into  transmission capacity in relation to the maximum load determined by the share of the total export/import capacity of the transmission system in the given year and the outlook for the maximum net load of the transmission system for the given year. For the purpose of comparing the two above methods of determining the degree of electricity interconnectivity, the outlooks of interconnectivity rates (export/import) for the years 2019, 2024 and  reiterated that the determination of to ensure complete comparability of outputs, the calculation would have to take place under fixed and identical conditions, especially for security reserves, which mainly take into account the circular flows,                                                            153  The National Plan of the Czech Republic is not the basis for the preparation of spatial planning documentation. 154 With reference to the overviews of the existing transmission infrastructure compiled by the Transmission System Operators (TSOs). 33%37%46%45%45%49%49%48%0%10%20%30%40%50%60%20162020202520302035204020452050 -249-  which develop over time. Due to uncertainties in the energy environment, especially in the energy mix, these values can be considered as indicative.

The transmission system in the Czech Republic is operattransmission in the required volume and with high reliability. The continuous renewal and development of the transmission system by its operator leads to the increased transfer capacity of the elements during the reconstruction and replacement of the equipment, and thus the transmission system provides with high reliability the connection and output of the capacity of large sources, distribution supply and the required cross-border transmission of electricity.

The gas system consists mainly of: (i) pipeline infrastructure with different operating parameters; (ii) control actuators  border transfer stations, compressor stations, distribution nodes, closures, measuring fittings etc.; (iii) gas storage facilities for the storage of natural gas; (iv) generating facilities of conventional and non-conventional gas which can be injected into the gas system; (v) off-take and transfer points. In terms of the operational role, it is possible to divide the system into two hierarchical units:  Transmission system  high-pressure gas pipeline system (VHP, HP), actuators and related objects connected with foreign gas systems. The transmission system is further subdivided into the transit system and national transmission system.  Regional and local distribution systems  system of high-pressure, medium-pressure and low-pressure gas pipelines (HP, MP, LP), actuators and related technological objects used for the distribution of gas to final customers. Within the Czech Republic gas is further transferred from the transmission system to distribution systems and directly connected customers. In addition, there are 8 gas storage facilities connected to the transmission system. Supply is ensured through 968 transfer stations where a commercial gas quantity meter is installed. Gas quality is measured at 27 nodes in the system. Transmission system  -253-  Gas pipelines for international transit and domestic transmission with the length of about 3 820 km in total, with nominal diameters from DN 80 to DN 1400 and with nominal pressures from 4 to 8.4 MPa,  NET4GAS. The transmission system provides especially for the following functions: (i) transmission of natural gas from long-distance international gas pipelines to transfer stations or to adjacent transmission systems; (ii) supply to selected customers159; (iii) transmission of gas to the storage facilities in the gas injection mode and transmission of gas from the storage facilities to consumption points in the gas use mode. The transport system can be divided into four main branches. The North branch leads connects the North and South branches. In the Southeastern part of the country, the Moravian branch provides gas supplies to the Moravian regions and connects to the Polish transmission network. The North, South and West branches are connected in key distribution nodes of Jirkov, Rozvadov,  Figure 11: Transmission system of the Czech Republic  Source: Expected long-term balance between gas supply and demand (OTE, a.s., 2017) Individual transfer points are connected to transit and domestic transmission systems, in total there are 96 transfer points to distribution networks and storage facilities. The transmission system is interconnected by seven border transfer stations with neighbouring transmission systems. Eight clients are connected directly to the transmission system. The following table shows the transmission system pipelines.                                                              159  In order for a customer to be able to directly receive supplies from the transit system, it must meet the technical criteria given by the transmission operator and must off-take at least 100 GWh of gas energy from the VHP system or at least 10 GWh from the HP system annually.  -254-  Table 93: Pipeline routes of the transmission system Specification Operating overpressure (MPa) Pipeline width (mm) Pipeline lengths (km) Transit system 4.0 to 8.4 800 to 1 400 2 471 Gazela gas pipeline 4.9 to 8.4 1 400 166 National transmission system 2.5 to 6.4 150 to 700 1 181 Source: Expected long-term balance between gas supply and demand (OTE, a.s., 2017) Reverse gas flows in the transmission system During the Gas Crisis in January 2009, a provisional reverse flow was made in the West-East direction, which allowed not only to supply customers in the Czech Republic but also in Slovakia. The gas was to the Czech Republic. As a result, gas supplies to customers in the Czech Republic were not reduced.  The implementation of the reverse flow within the European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR) involves the following structures / modifications: 1. Modifiamount of gas transmitted from Germany to the Czech Republic from 18 m3 per day to 25 m3 per day. 2. Modification of the pipeline at the interconnection point Hospozín allowed an increase in the amount of gas transmitted between Olbernhau and Waidhaus up to 15 million m3 per day. 3. Modification of the pipeline at the Kralice nad Oslavou compressor station allowed the use of compression work for gas transmission in the west-east direction. 4.  5. compressor station enabled the use of compression work for the transmission to Slovakia. 6. to Slovakia. 7. tem allowing the reverse flow was completed in 2011. Transit system The task of the transit system is to ensure the transmission of natural gas by very high pressure pipelines (VHP) to other countries and to ensure gas supplies to domestic customers. Thanks to the liberalisation of the gas sector, the use of the transmission system is determined by the market where the system users who want to transmit gas through the system compete for the transmission capacity. The exception is the Gazela gas pipeline, which is exempt from third party access (rTPA) to transmission capacity until the end of 2034. This exception is only granted for the transmission capacities in the direction Brandov-Waidhaus. This means that system users cannot compete for the capacity of this gas pipeline in auctions, as all of the capacity has already been allocated through an alternative allocation mechanism.  -255-  Between 2015 and 2016, projects increasing the capacity by 12 million m3 a day were successfully completed on the transmission systdirection Rozvadov    e, a single -fired power plant. National transmission system The task of the national transmission system (NTS) is to transmit gas from the transit system to the distribution transfer stations. The NTS consists of gas pipelines with lower widths (150 to 700 mm) with operating pressures of 2.5 to 6.4 MPa. The total length of the national transmission system routes is 1 181 km. The connection to the transit system is at six transfer nodes. Due to the existing pressure conditions, compressor stations are not installed on the national transmission system, but all gas storage facilities operated within the Czech gas system are connected to the system. There is also a connection to the Slovak gas system on the NTS (Mokrý Háj). This connection is currently not being used. Border transfer stations the transmission systems of TSOs of the neighbouring countries, gas volume and quality are measured at border transfer stations (BTS). These places are, on the Czech-Háj (BTS on the Slovak side), on the Czech-Czech-Bavarian border, Waidhaus (BTS on the German side) and, on the Czech-Polish border, Cieszyn (BTS on the Polish side).

In the case of the Czech Republic, two virtual interconnection points are planned:  - VIP Brandov  GASPOOL with German Gaspool trade zone as of 1 November 2018; - VIP Waidhaus with the German NCG trade zone as of 1 March 2019. All available fixed and interruptible capacity will be offered at the VIP. No capacity beyond the existing contractual relationships will be offered on physical interconnection points that will become part of the VIP.  Compressor stations The required pressure in gas pipelines is generated by four compressor stations, which are located in South branch. All compressor stations are capable of bidirectional operation. Total installed capacity of the compressors is 243 MW. Table 95: Total installed capacity of compressor stations (MW) Compressor station name Number of combustion turbines and their output Installed capacity  5x 6 MW + 2x 13 MW 56 MW Kralice nad Oslavou (north branch) 5x 6 MW + 2x 13 MW 56 MW  9x 6 MW + 1x 23 MW 77 MW  9x 6 MW 54 MW Source: Expected long-term balance between gas supply and demand (OTE, a.s., 2017) Gas storage facilities A total of 9 storage facilities are currently in operation in the Czech Republic, of which 7 reservoirs being of the deposit type, 1 of the aquifer type (Lobodice) and 1 of the cavern type (Háje). The main role of storage facilities in the system is to cover peak demand in the heating season, which could not be covered by gas imports. Traders use them for economic reasons, because in the heating season, gas prices are usually higher than in low season. Finally, the storage facilities are an important element of the system in terms of security of gas supply in crisis situations.  In recent years, the dynamic properties of storage facilities in the Czech Republic have been improved by an increase in their deliverability. The available capacity of the storage facilities connected to the Czech system totals 3 177 million m3, and their maximum deliverability is 70 million m3 per day. The capacity of the storage facilities located in the Czech Republic totals 3 753 million m3, and their maximum deliverability is almost 79 million m3 per day.  -257-  Figure 12: Gas storage facilities  current state and plans for expansion  Source: Expected long-term balance between gas supply and demand (OTE, a.s., 2017) Chart 90: Development of the capacity of natural gas storage facilities in the Czech Republic  Source: Expected long-term balance between gas supply and demand (OTE, a.s., 2017) 05001.0001.5002.0002.5003.0003.5004.000200920102011201220132014201520162017million m3Storage facilities capacityStorage facilities capacity usable for CR -258-  Chart 91: Development of the deliverability of natural gas storage facilities in the Czech Republic  Source: Expected long-term balance between gas supply and demand (OTE, a.s., 2017) Chart 92: Share of the capacity of natural gas storage facilities in domestic consumption  Source: Annual Report on the Operation of the Gas System of the Czech Republic 2016 (ERO) Distribution systems The task of the distribution system is to transport gas to end customers.

Pipeline systems of distribution networks are the most extensive part of the entire gas system. They are operated at different pressure levels, as high pressure (from 0.4 to 4 MPa), medium pressure (from 5 kPa to 0.4 MPa) and low pressure (up to 5 kPa) pipelines. For reasons of supply reliability, individual regional distribution systems (over 90 000 customers) are operated in a grid configuration and can be mutually interconnected with back-up connections. No compressor stations are operated, and no gas tanks are connected within distribution. In a few cases, distribution networks are connected to foreign systems  this concerns the supply of island areas or, where relevant, back-up cross-border supply facilities. Currently, regional distribution networks are operated by three entities:  GasNet provides distribution in the North, Central, West and East Bohemia and also in South and North Moravia. It is further divided into 4 sub-regional networks.  E.ON Distribuce provides distribution in South Bohemia.   provides distribution on the territory of the capital city of Prague. In addition to regional distribution networks, there are local distribution systems, often operated within major industrial plants. Recently, there has been a growing number of cases where operators of these local systems take over local distribution from municipalities, which previously invested in their construction but do not want to operate them. At present, 65 local distribution systems are operated. ii. Projections of network expansion requirements at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)160 4.5.2.3 Projections of infrastructure expansion requirements in the electricity sector Transmission system development In order to ensure the safety and reliability of operation, the transmission system operator prepares every two years the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of the Transmission System of the Czech Republic. The plan presents two types of measures, which are briefly summarised in the following list and are described in detail further below:  strategic solution: strategic investments in the medium and long term leading to the strategic development of the electricity system (maintenance, new lines, gradual phase-out of the 220 kV network);  dynamic measures: partial investment technical measures allowing the connection of customers (often limited or conditional) within a shorter period than is possible with the strategic solution. In particular, this concerns connecting new sources to the transmission system or developing TS/DS transformation links. Strategic solution Renewal of station equipment and lines The TSO renews the TS station equipment and lines to the extent ensuring the required security and reliability of TS operation. The typical lifetime of power equipment  especially lines  is 40 years and is affected by the method of maintenance and the conditions of the environment in which the equipment                                                            160 With reference to the national network development plans and TSO regional investment plans.  -260-  is operated. Replaceable parts of the equipment are replaced after the end of their lifetime; correct maintenance can extend the lifetime of pole structures up to twice the lifetime. After each replacement of lines and insulators, the line failure rate decreases. Strengthening transmission capability TSOs prepare and implement systemic measures to strengthen the TS transmission capability, to modernise and duplicate existing lines and to build new lines, and to expand and modernise substations. The construction of new 400 kV lines aims to supplement and reinforce the 400 kV system and to replace the 220 kV network. The 220kV network tasks will be gradually assumed by the reinforced 400kV network by 2040. The possibilities of building new lines in the new corridors are limited and the preparation is lengthy (10 years or more). Therefore, when renewing the 400 kV line, TSOs build double lines within the routes of the existing lines. The following table summarises the construction of new lines. Table No 96: Length of new lines in the TS until 2050 (km) Construction of TS lines Length of new 400kV lines in 20172025 Length of new 400kV lines in 20262050 Construction of TS lines within a new route 189 70 Construction of double TS line within the original line route 572 629 Total length of new TS lines 761 699 Source: Expected long-term balance between gas supply and demand (OTE, a.s., 2017) International co-operation Within the interconnected ENTSO-E, coordination is important in the planning of future forms of electricity networks and their further cooperation. The list of projects of common interest specified in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/89 also contains five p161. These projects meet not only the requirements for ensuring the safety and reliability of the transmission system operation, but also contribute towards the European targets with regard to the security of the operation of the entire interconnected system. Reactive power compensation in the TS Decentralised production and higher cabling rate lead, in particular at a time of lower load, to an increase in the generated reactive power in the DS and the associated increase in voltage at the given transfer station TS/110 kV. The duplication of transmission lines will increase the transmission capacities, but will also increase the reactive power generated by TS lines. In order to maintain voltage within the appropriate limits, TS uses available reactive power compensation tools and plans to build more than 1 000 MVAr of compensation facilities. Dynamic measures                                                            161  Projects of Common Interest are updated as needed and the provision of these specific projects in the National Plan does not mean that these projects can be considered binding.  -261-  At the same time as the above, often time-consuming, measures, short- and medium-term solutions are also sought, which are acceptable for a transitional period. These include, in particular, TS line modernisation with an increase in the permissible line temperature to 80°C, dynamic line loading, automatic power reduction of sources and deeper coordination of transmission and distribution network operation. New TS substations and transformer power The TS/110 kV transformation link will be strengthened only for 400/110 kV transformation, with the transformation power to increase by 9 550 MVA by 2050. With respect to the phasing out of the 220/110 kV (4 200 MVA) transformation, the overall increase in TS/110 kV transformer power will be 5 350 MVA by 2050, with the projected increase in peak consumption by 2050 being between 600 and 3 400 MW (depending on the scenario) compared to the values measured in winter 2017. The development of installed TS/110 kV transformer power is shown in the following figure. The construction of new substations in the TS responds to the long-term trends in the given area, such as the decommissioning of large sources in 110 kV networks, the development of consumption and also the phasing out of the 220 kV system. By 2025, this involves the construction of a new 400/110 kV transformation in 4 orth and Milín). In the period 2026Tábor and Rohatec, which will gradually replace the 220 kV substations. The following figures show the anticipated development o Chart 93: Installed power of TS/110 kV transformers (GVA)  Source: Expected long-term balance between gas supply and demand (OTE, a.s., 2017) New technologies in the transmission system The implementation of new elements is motivated by efforts to maintain the reliability of operation under new conditions. Specifically, this involves increased demands on interstate electricity transmission and increasing representation of decentralised sources and their expected future  -262-  development. With limited possibilities to construct line structures, new technologies are already introduced in the Czech transmission system to increase the transmission capabilities of the lines and to increase the reliability and efficiency of TS operation. These include in particular:  the construction of compact equipment in the TS;  dynamic loading of the TS elements to increase network transmission capabilities;  higher dispatcher control functions (prediction models, operation optimisation, protection against defects,  business models);  remote control of TS substations;  automatic power reduction on sources to prevent the occurrence and spread of network failures. Other potentially useful technologies not yet used in the Czech transmission system include the use of high-temperature conductors or superconductors and the flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS). If unsuitable operating parameters are indicated, the above new technologies can be used to eliminate the unsuitable states. The development of the transmission network is shown in the following figures. Figure 13: Czech transmission network development scheme (as of 2028)   Distribution networks Development of 110 kV networks The development of 110 kV networks is prepared for a shorter period of time, so the operation of these networks is analysed in detail only for 2025. The development of 110 kV networks is based on the current needs of regions and the economic potential of distributors. The individual distribution  -263-  companies must prepare the development so as to permanently meet the requirements of customers for the supply of electricity and the requirements of producers for power output. The development of distribution networks is influenced by changes in the TS, especially in the TS/110 kV transformation link, which affect both the development of the 110 kV networks in the respective node areas and their operational connection. The development is mainly focused on strengthening and reconstruction of the existing 110 kV lines. The new 110 kV substations are planned according to the expected load according to the requirements of customer in the respective regions. The construction of 81 new 110 kV stations is being prepared. Their location is shown in the following figure and their distribution and number in the following table. The following table gives an overview of the lengths of new and reconstructed 110 kV lines.

In addition to the construction of new lines and renovation of existing lines, HV and LV networks will make increasing use of new technologies, which should keep the currently relatively comfortable operation and increase operational reliability. In addition to strengthening and expanding existing distribution networks, the following elements will be used in the development of the TS:  increasing share of cabling of distribution networks;  development and implementation of automation elements on HV voltage level and also LV enabling central and autonomous control of these networks;  development of automated voltage control systems even at lower voltage levels;  control of the production of active and reactive power of decentralised sources according to the needs of network operation;  control of selected parts of distribution networks according to network operation needs and preparation for implementation of needs and requirements of new entities on the electricity market (prosumers, aggregator, smart home);  network-driven electricity storage, including storage by DSO;  development of data and telecommunication infrastructure at high voltage level for network management options;  Implementation of smart metering  AMM;  use of non-frequency support services to optimise the operation of distribution networks. Increase in the installed capacity of new decentralised sources will greatly influence the development of high-voltage and low-voltage networks. The operational needs of the distribution networks, particularly in the field of stress profile support, will require greater integration of new decentralised sources into the DS control system. Also, in accordance with the DS Operating Rules, this aspect determines the size of the decentralised source power supply to the particular HV or LV network. Networks will be gradually fitted with devices allowing bidirectional communication between the DSO and the consumers / network nodes. At the same time, a number of autonomous devices will be used, which, on the basis of data exchange, will be able to evaluate the state of the network and take appropriate steps to make the system more efficient without the intervention of the dispatcher. These include, for example, automatic reconfiguration of connection in the case of a failure, re-connection to the electricity system after a failure, etc. In this context, the use of reclosers, intelligent section breakers, HV/LV transformers  -265-  with an on-load tap changer and other similar devices. These measures, together with the regulatory capabilities of decentralised sources, will make it easier to integrate more of these sources into the DS. Distribution companies implement pilot projects to verify the security, operational reliability and clarity of distribution network management with new technologies. The use of and, primarily, the manner to manage new technological elements in distribution networks should allow:  power balance closure of the production  consumption chain, including maximum storage at the distribution network level;  efficient utilisation and coordination of production, consumption and storage in the DS to reduce transmission losses in networks and to minimise the reserved power at TS/110 kV transformations;  more efficient operation and management of networks with maximum automation. 4.5.2.4 Projections of infrastructure expansion requirements in the gas sector Role of the gas industry in general Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the Czech and European economy will lead to new system solutions. Therefore, in the future it is possible to anticipate the use of conversion potential of the gas sector, which would allow the storage of currently unnecessary gaseous energy. This would help reduce overload of the transmission network, strengthen energy security and reduce emissions. Typically, this would enable the production of hydrogen by electrolysis (Power2Gas technology) and possibly its methanisation into the form of synthetic methane. The decarbonisation process and the development of new technological solutions will have an impact on the use of the gas system in the Czech Republic.  It is currently not possible to precisely determine the impact of decarbonisation in the European and Czech context on the Czech gas network and the concrete information on how this network will be used with a view to minimise the transmission system developed to a large extent in both the EU and the Czech Republic, and it is therefore appropriate to keep developing this infrastructure for future use for both natural gas and new types of gases. A combination of natural gas with CCS or CCU may be considered for the storage or utilisation of carbon produced from natural gas splitting. The possible future use of gas infrastructure can therefore be crucial to meeting the energy needs of end customers. Transmission system The planned changes in the transmission system are updated every year in the form of the NET4GAS Ten-Year Development Plan. The plan is subject to approval by the ERO; the last proposal is from 2018 for the period 20192028. The investment projects of the development plan are divided into four areas: (i) connection of gas-fired power plants; (ii) output to the domestic zone; (iii) connection of new storage capacities; (iv) increase of cross-border capacities. As part of the system development plan, the development of maximum daily consumption and output capacity in individual regional networks and regions is also analysed. The results show that the output capacities into the regional distribution systems are several times higher than the maximum daily consumption in the given regions. The exception is Northern Moravia, which is supplied with only a single line of the national transmission system. The current situation is only partly satisfactory, but the requested capacity for gas injection into the local storage facilities exceeds the technical capacity of the system and in the heating season the system would not be able to cover the demand in the region without storage facilities. Such a situation greatly complicates the possibility of connecting new large gas  -266-  pipeline project (Moravia Capacity Extension).

All cities with more than 5 000 inhabitants and a total of 78 % of all municipalities have been connected to gas supply. The development of distribution is minimal in HP networks  only units of km per year. Increases are more likely to be expected in local MP and LP networks where new routes increase by approximately 100 km per year. The State Energy Policy assumes that in the period until 2040 natural gas will allow for a gradual transition away from the use of solid fuels in final consumption and small heat supply systems, partial compensation for the loss of supply from coal-fired plants nearing the end of lifetime, and a partial departure from liquid fuels in transport. Distribution networks will play a key role in fulfilling this assumption. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure their high reliability and security of operation in accordance with European standards and their necessary development in line with the growth of final gas consumption. In order to ensure reliability of operation, the distribution companies are currently focusing primarily on the renewal of existing networks and other facilities where they invest considerable funds. The high standard of safe operation will be maintained, in particular, by continuing technical risk mitigation, which is an integral part of the planned network restoration.  In terms of development of the distribution system, this will involve the connection of existing coal-fired sources in their transition to natural gas, the connection of new energy-efficient cogeneration and micro-cogeneration units, especially in the case of inefficient heat supply systems, connection of new CNG and LNG filling stations and creation of conditions for connecting biomethane-producing stations. It should be stressed that in many cases this will only involve the cost of building the connection because there is enough network capacity within the range of the above facilities. Both the renewal and development of distribution networks are made more difficult by high administrative complexity, especially at the investment preparation phase. Here, the State should amend legislation to create the conditions for a major acceleration of the preparation and execution of line energy infrastructure. It will also be necessary to ensure territorial protection of areas and corridors for the regeneration and development of distribution systems through spatial planning tools. Among the crucial aspects in the planning of investment projects is also the economic aspect of the distribution system operation, which consists in increasing the efficiency of distribution, thereby optimising the cost of network operation in relation to the distributed gas quantity, and improving network economy. Where effective, new modern trenchless technologies are used in the construction of networks to reduce already-high execution costs. 4.5.3 Electricity and gas markets, energy prices165 i. Current situation of electricity and gas markets, including energy prices                                                            165  During the finalisation of the national non-paper plans, the European Commission has published information about which information is considered relevant in this respect. This is a range of information on market concentration, liquidity, etc. Much of this information is already provided in this section, and much of this information is also monitored and reported by the relevant organisations, in particular ACER and CEER. The Czech Republic will try to complete this information in a coherent manner in the relevant progress report.   -271-  4.5.3.1 Legislative context EU Directives and the Regulation on market liberalisation and ensuring the principle of regulated access to networks, namely Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 2003/54/EC; Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity, are implemented through the functioning electricity market. In the liberalised gas market, this involves the implementation of Directive 2009/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas and repealing Directive 2003/55/EC and Regulation (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1775/2005.   At the end of 2016, the European Commission (EC) has published proposals for changes that have a significant impact on the future structure and functioning of the European energy market. The set of EU promote the transition to clean energy. The aim is to make the electricity market more efficient and transparent, to increase the share of renewables in energy, to increase energy savings and to strengthen the position of consumers. 4.5.3.2 Market model According to the energy-only market proposal, short and long-term market equilibrium should be effectively ensured by market mechanisms according to the established market framework. In practice, this means that responsibility is shared among market participants, market operator and system operator, i.e. between non-regulated and regulated entities. From the administrative perspective, it is possible to say that a significant part of the system balance planning preceding the hour of supply is left to the market participants, while ensuring the balance between electricity supply and demand at each moment of operation is entrusted to the transmission system operator. Markets are organised in consecutive time zones and their results are binding on individual participants. Physical energy exchange takes place in real time, where equality of electricity supply and demand must apply at all times. Planning of the system operation is carried out by the transmission system operator on the basis of commercial results in the electricity markets. Based on these data, the TSO plans the system load and the required reserve power to ensure safe operation of the electricity system. -take / delivery from/to the electricity system in a quantity other than that based on the trading position of the entity, raises the need for electricity system regulation by the TSO and is therefore subject to a financial penalty. Figure 15 then shows the time trajectory of the markets.  -272-  Figure 15: Target model of electricity market in the EU  Source: European Commission: Electricity Market Functioning: Current Distortions, and How to Model Their Removal A functioning and transparent day-ahead electricity market with the follow-up intraday market is the cornerstone of the European electricity market model. The intraday gas market is dominant in the gas sector in this respect. Bids on the day-ahead or intraday market represent expectations of the market participants for the following day. Changes in weather forecasts, unexpected outages in the production base or in industry indicate that a deviation from planned consumption/production is inevitable. The deviation from planned consumption or production values is then charged in the billing, depending on the magnitude and direction of the deviation compared to the system deviation.   These deviations have to be compensated by the TSO in real time so that the European synchronous electricity system is in equilibrium at all times (this equilibrium is represented by a stable 50 Hz activating support services and purchasing in the balancing market for regulatory energy, which will be replaced in 2020 by the Trans European Replacement Reserves Exchange (TERRE), and in emergency cases by purchasing from abroad. Depending on the trades on the balancing market, the TSO activates support services. The costs incurred to ensure the power balance of the system are then spread among market participants based on the magnitude of their deviation. Compared to the electricity market, where all deviations are settled financially at the price determined be used in the gas sector to evaluate and settle deviations. The reason is the natural storage capacity of the gas system. It enables the trading position of clearing entities to oscillate within the set flexibility so that, if these limits are not exceeded, there are no additional costs of balancing these deviations. Deviations at or below these limit values do not affect the smooth and safe operation of the gas system. 4.5.3.3 Overview of the market situation in the Czech Republic The rights and obligations of individual participants in the electricity and gas markets are laid down in Act No 458/2000, on the conditions for business and on the performance of State administration in the energy sector and amending certain acts, as amended (the Energy Act), and implementing decrees to this Act. Electricity sector Electricity sector is further regulated by ERO Decree No 408/2015, on electricity market rules (the 127/2017 (effective from 1 June 2017).   -273-  The electricity market model in the Czech Republic is based on the principle of balancing responsibility  Electricity market participants are subject to balancing responsibilities and may contractually transfer  Under Section 22 of the Energy Act, electricity market participants are defined as:  i) electricity producers; ii) transmission system operator;  iii) distribution system operators;  iv) market operator;  v) electricity traders; vi) customers.  The table and figure below show the number of registered electricity market participants by participant type at the end of 2017 and the year-on-year change compared to 2016. Table 101: Number of electricity market participants  Source: Annual Report on the Electricity and Gas Markets in 2017 (OTE, a.s.) Gas sector The gas industry is regulated by the Energy Act and primarily by the related ERO Decree No 349/2015, Implementing Decree No 416/2016 (effective from 1 January 2017).

Table 102: Number of gas market participants  Source: Annual Report on the Electricity and Gas Markets in 2017 (OTE, a.s.) Supplier change  electricity market From 1 January 2006, the electricity market in the Czech Republic has been open to all customers, each of whom may choose any electricity supplier. In the Central System of the Market Operator (CS OTE), each supplier change is related to a specific off-take point (OP), i.e. the meter point where electricity is transferred and accepted between two market participants (where electricity is taken off). Any change of supplier, which replaces a trader of a vertically integrated undertaking, will require a new registration of the off- off-take of electricity by individual suppliers to the Czech system and their assignment to the relevant changes in recent years.  -275-  Table 103: Number of electricity supplier changes  Source: Annual Report on the Electricity and Gas Markets in 2017 (OTE, a.s.) In 2017, there were 357  comparison of the supplier changes in recent years shows that in 2016 the retail electricity market experienced a major revival in terms of supplier changes. As follows from the statistics on the number of supplier changes registered in the Central System of the Market Operator, consumer interest in electricity supplier change has remained almost the same in the past two years. In recent years, there has been an increase in wholesale electricity prices on energy exchanges, and a number of smaller vendors, who have so far offered cheaper electricity than large suppliers have been forced to reflect this development in their price offers. Competition in the electricity market thus constantly forces individual suppliers to improve the supply of their business products. When changing the electricity supplier, apart from the actual price of the commodity, the final consumer is interested in the accompanying services. Customers have a relatively wide variety of electricity supply offers, allowing them to find the optimal product for their needs. This is in turn reflected in an increased customer motivation to change the electricity supplier. Supplier change  gas market As of 1 January 2007, all final gas customers have the right to a free supplier change and thus also the possibility to influence part of their total gas supply costs. Thus, 2017 marked the seventeenth year of open gas market where every gas customer could select the supplier of their choice. The market tomer off-take points (OPs) where a supplier change replaced a trader belonging to the given network or the registration was explicitly requested by that trader. The remaining OPs (i.e. off-take points of the trader belonging to the given network) are regientire metered gas supply and off-take of individual suppliers and, at the same time, their assignment to pplier changes for OPs by off-take category in individual months of 2017 is shown in the following figure.  -276-  Table 104: Gas supplier changes for OPs by off-take category in 2017  Source: Annual Report on the Electricity and Gas Markets in 2017 (OTE, a.s.) The above table shows the number of OPs by off-take category with supplier change in the individual months of 2017. For the year 2017, there were 227 545 changes, which is approximately 23 500 more than in 2016 (203 950 changes). This is an almost 12 % year-on-year increase in supplier changes.

Electricity trading in the Czech Republic also involves balancing responsibility (including trading in balancing energy and balancing energy market).                                                            166  In 2017, there were 227 545 supplier changes per year, in 2018 there were 263 425 supplier changes (see OTE: https://www.ote-cr.cz/cs/statistika/mesicni-zprava-plyn/zmeny-dodavatele?date=2019-01-01).  -277-  Energy legislation requires market participants  balance responsible parties  to register their bilateral transactions in the OTE system through the entityrelationship diagrams (ERDs). The time slots for individual electricity market activities are shown in the following figure. Figure 16: Time arrangement of electricity market  Source: Annual Report on the Electricity and Gas Markets in 2017 (OTE, a.s.) Bilateral transactions As noted above, when market participants sell or purchase electricity through bilateral transactions, they are required to register these transactions in the OTE system.  The bilateral national electricity supply transactions were submitted to the market operator for registration by the individual balance responsible parties in the form of entityrelationship diagrams (ERDs) by 13:30 hours on the day preceding the day on which the supply was to take place; this was also the closing time for the bilateral transaction. The OTE system registers only the amount of bilateral trade electricity, without its price. The financial settlement of these transactions takes place directly between trading parties outside the OTE system; OTE is not the central counterpart of these trades. The registration of these entityrelationship diagrams is, among other things, subject to the condition of the financial security of the balance responsible party given the possible imbalances of the balance responsible party that these transactions might cause. By means of bilateral transactions, OTE system registers trades concluded through both classical bilateral contracts as well as brokerage platform trades, forward exchange trades, etc. In 2017, OTE system registered 99.95 TWh in the form of national entityrelationship diagrams. The following figure shows the amount of electricity traded and registered in OTE system in 2017. In addition to the above, there are also electricity trades with financial settlement on commodity exchanges, which serve to hedge long-term risks against the rise/fall in electricity prices.  -278-  Chart 98: Amount of electricity traded (purchase and sale) registered in OTE system in 2017  Source: Annual Report on the Electricity and Gas Markets in 2017 (OTE, a.s.) The value of contractually concluded cross-border export trades amounted to 23 576 GWh in 2017; imports amounted to 10 388 GWh in 2017. The breakdown of these transactions in individual months of 2017 is shown in the following figure.  Chart 99: Amount of electricity traded through export and import in 2017  Source: Annual Report on the Electricity and Gas Markets in 2017 (OTE, a.s.) Organised short-term electricity market The organised short-term market in the Czech Republic is an important form of electricity trading. Thanks to a substantial increase in liquidity in recent years, the energy market participants have a reliable guarantee that they can buy or sell the relevant commodity in response to the current situation in the and purpose of the short-term market is not only to reduce the risk of imbalance, but also to increase the security and reliability of supplies. The essential importance of liquid short-term markets is also pricing, when the prices of transactions on these markets are used as a basis for the settlement of financial instruments traded on commodity exchanges or serve as a guideline for the prices of other contracts between the supplier and the customer.  Table 106: Comparison of the basic parameters of individual markets  -279-   Source: Annual Report on the Electricity and Gas Markets in 2017 (OTE, a.s.) Day-ahead electricity market The day-ahead electricity market in the Czech Republic is based on the principle of the implicit allocation of cross-border capacities (MC) and is operated jointly with the Slovak, Hungarian and Romanian markets under the name of 4M MC. These four day-ahead markets are coupled by PCR, which is also implemented in the interconnected MRC region. The day-ahead market of the Czech Republic operated within 4M MC on the MC principle, market participants in the CZ, SK, HU and RO therefore satisfy their electricity purchase or sale requirements for the next day in all four market areas without the need for explicit transmission capacity. The development of volumes of electricity traded on day-ahead market is illustrated in the following figure. Chart 100: Development of volumes of electricity traded on day-ahead market in 20022017   -280-  Source: Annual Report on the Electricity and Gas Markets in 2017 (OTE, a.s.) The volume of electricity trades concluded on the OTE day-ahead market in 2017 reached a new annual maximum of 21.75 TWh. The total volume traded on day-ahead market in the Czech Republic in 2017 represented about 1/3 of domestic net consumption. The average price of trades on OTE day-ahead market reached EUR 36.46/MWh in 2017. Chart 101: Volume of electricity traded and the average price on the day-ahead market in 2017  Source: Annual Report on the Electricity and Gas Markets in 2017 (OTE, a.s.) Intraday electricity market Through an organised intraday electricity market, traders anonymously offer or demand electricity on a trading day, up to a limit of 60 minutes prior to delivery or off-take. Intraday trading opens at 15:00 for all trading hours of the following day. The volume of trades concluded in 2017 on the intraday electricity market reached almost 545 GWh. Chart 102: Volume of electricity traded on intraday market in 20052017  Source: Annual Report on the Electricity and Gas Markets in 2017 (OTE, a.s.)    -281-  Balancing energy market A specific trading venue just before the time of delivery or off-take is the balancing energy market. In this market, participants may, up to 30 minutes before the trading hour, offer or demand electricity only in the form of positive or negative balancing energy, where in both cases the transmission system operator is the counterpart of that trade. It is therefore the last possibility for market participants to adjust their business position. Balancing energy purchased in this market helps the transmission system operator to effectively control and equalise the power balance of the electricity system. Several factors influence the liquidity of the balancing energy market. The primary effort of the transmission system operator is to reduce the costs of support services. Market participants then create pressure by imbalance prices, which forces the balance responsible party to exercise the option of minimising its imbalance at a time close to the trading hour. This market is expected to be gradually phased out with the implementation of Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/2195 of 23 November 2017 establishing a guideline on electricity balancing.  Chart 103: Volume of balancing energy traded on the balancing market in 2017  Source: Annual Report on the Electricity and Gas Markets in 2017 (OTE, a.s.) 4.5.3.5 Trading on the gas market in the Czech Republic The gas market model is based on the principle of balancing responsibility where a gas market participant with the right of regulated access to the transmission system or distribution system has balancing responsibility The business unit is one gas day starting  In the Czech Republic, gas is traded through:  bilateral trading;  organised short-term market;  intraday market (IM);  market with unused flexibility. Electricity trading in the Czech Republic also involves the balancing responsibility.  -282-  In addition to the above, there are also gas trades with financial settlement on commodity exchanges, which serve especially to hedge long-term risks against the rise/fall in gas prices.  Nominations are divided into:  transmission nomination  a command for the transmission of gas at the entry and exit points of the border transfer stations (BTS), i.e. the export and import of gas from/to the transmission system in the Czech Republic, an order for the transmission of gas at the input or output points of virtual gas storage facilities for the transmission of gas to the customer off-take point directly connected to the transmission system with a reserved capacity of at least 5 000 MWh per day;  storage nomination  an order to inject or deliver the said amount of gas to or from the virtual gas storage facility;  distribution nomination  an order to distribute gas at the entry points of gas production plants and at the entry and exit points of cross-border gas pipelines (CGP), i.e. export and import of gas from/to a given distribution system in the Czech Republic;  delivery nomination (DN) and the off-take nomination (ON)  transactions that are carried out via VTP between individual traders (gas transfer at VTP); what is nominated at VTP must be delivered / off-taken. All nominations are registered by the balance responsible party with the market operator or the relevant operators by 14:00 hours of the day preceding the commencement of the gas delivery day. After this time, transmission nominations are matched with neighbouring transmission system operators, distribution nominations are matched with neighbouring distribution or transmission system operators, storage nominations are matched between the transmission system operator and the gas storage facility operator, and virtual trade point nominations are matched between the individual balance responsible parties. However, market participants have other options to adjust their trade position. Until almost the st its position by sending a renomination or a corrective nomination of its obligations. Quantity is nominated as one-off nomination for the entire gas day. The time arrangement of the gas market is shown in the figure below.  -283-  Figure 17: Gas market time arrangement valid for 2018  Source: Annual Report on the Electricity and Gas Markets in 2017 (OTE, a.s.) Organised short-term gas market The short-term gas market in the Czech Republic is represented by the intraday gas market. It allows market participants to continue trading even during the gas day. The intraday gas market for the given ends one hour before the end of the gas day when the delivery occurs. In 2017, the intraday gas market saw trades totalling 3 747 GWh of gas. The average price of gas traded in the intraday market in 2017 was EUR 18.02/MWh.  Chart 104: Amount of gas traded and average prices on the intraday gas market in 20102017   -284-  Source: Annual Report on the Electricity and Gas Markets in 2017 (OTE, a.s.) The OTE Index is determined on the basis of prices obtained on the intraday gas market organised by the market operator. The course of the OTE Index and the prices realised on EEX exchange in Germany (Daily Reference Price for the NCG zone) and the CEGH exchange in Austria during 2016 and 2017 are shown in the figure below. Chart 105: Comparison of the OTE Index and prices realised on the EEX and CEGH exchanges in 2016 and 2017  Source: Annual Report on the Electricity and Gas Markets in 2017 (OTE, a.s.) The high correlation of gas prices in the OTE market and the EEX exchange proves the sufficient cross-border capacities and maturity of the Czech short-term organised gas market. ii. Projections of development with existing policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) The gradual European integration of electricity markets extends the possibilities for mutual trade and makes it possible to make better use of the potential of electricity production in individual countries. At the same time, however, the interconnection leads to the natural interaction of the individual national energy systems. Over the last few years, there were ongoing preparations, within spot trading in electricity, for the coupling of the regional project 4M MC to MRC on the basis of the implicit flow-based allocation of cross-border capacities within CORE, established by the CACM Regulation and consisting of 13 EU Member States167. The PCR solution is already being used in price-coupled markets in Europe and its further use can therefore be seen as a basis for a future pan-European solution.  Concerning intraday trading in electricity, 2018 saw the conclusion of the implementation of a platform for the single intraday continuous trading with the implicit allocation of cross-border capacities within the Cross-Border Intraday Coupling (XBID) project, which was established as the technical solution for the single intraday coupling in Europe under the MCO Plan. The XBID project responds to market needs by creating a more transparent and efficient continuous trading environment that enables market                                                            167  France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Luxembourg and Romania.  -285-  participants to easily trade their intraday positions across EU markets without the need for explicit allocation of transmission capacity. Within the creation of a single gas market in the EU, the integration of gas markets lags far behind the integration of electricity markets. In addition to infrastructure projects that are geared towards facilitating the reservation of capacities for gas traders or making areas that are not directly coupled accessible for trading (e.g. between the Czech Republic and Austria through TRU168), no integration projects are currently under discussion with the aim of coupling organised gas markets in our region. In this context, the Czech Republic is working on completing the internal energy market, specifically the internal gas market, in particular by removing infrastructure bottlenecks and market barriers between the Czech Republic and its neighbours, namely Poland and Austria
