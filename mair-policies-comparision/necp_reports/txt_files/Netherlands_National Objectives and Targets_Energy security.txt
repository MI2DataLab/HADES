2.3 Energy security dimension i. Increasing the diversification of energy sources and supply from third countries, increasing the flexibility of the national energy system and coping with an interrupted or limited supply of an energy source Natural gas The national target for natural gas is an uninterrupted, secure supply of natural gas to end consumers (households, institutions and companies) by way of an effective gas market. Given that the earthquakes in the Groningen field are an increasing source of concern and attention in relation to the safety of Groningen residents, the focus is on achieving security of the supply to end users (namely households and institutes). In addition, it concerns (low-calorific) natural gas with a special quality, which is not available elsewhere (but can be converted using nitrogen from high-calorific gas). Action is currently being taken to reduce natural gas extraction from the Groningen field from circa 17.5 billion m³ in 2018/2019 to zero by 2030 at the latest.55 For 2019/2020, the permitted amount of natural gas extraction from Groningen has been reduced to 11.8 billion m³, assuming an average yearly temperature.56  Oil Oil is, in itself, already a diversified product. The origin of oil processed in the Netherlands can be traced back to a number of sources. The oil market is a global market that is not formally regulated by state actors. The security of the oil supply mainly depends on the stability of net export countries and unimpeded passage along the major oil routes throughout the world. In spite of everything, oil will continue to be a key component of the energy mix and the raw materials market over the coming years.57 The market is created by the interplay between supply and demand, in which both the use of oil for energy and feedstock compete. Disrupted supply will result, almost immediately, in unrest on the market and a rapid increase in prices, and will have a major economic impact. In order to prevent any negative economic consequences, Member States of the EU and the IEA keep emergency oil stocks that can be used collectively by Member States to mitigate any unrest on the oil market. Merely possessing these stocks means that use of the oil embargo as a weapon - as in the 1970s - is far less effective. Consequently, the stocks themselves contribute to stabilisation without the need to actually use them. Electricity As a result of decarbonisation of the energy system and the growth of energy from renewable sources, the share of weather-dependent electricity being generated is increasing. In order to continue to guarantee supply security of electricity and energy in general, the energy system must be more flexible. This can be achieved by developing more demand response, energy storage and contributing to interconnection. The large-scale conversion of electricity to hydrogen is an important part of this challenge. After it is converted, the energy can be stored more effectively and for longer, and end use can also be decarbonised, for which existing technology offers few alternative options, such as heavy transport and high temperatures in industry. Security of the electricity supply continues to be monitored in a quantitative manner by TenneT TSO. An electricity supply that is reliable as well as affordable and sustainable is an important objective of Dutch policy. The competitive electricity market contributes to this, including through the system of programme responsibility and the imbalance market. The growth in the share of intermittent sources will result in an increase in the demand for flexibility on the market. The Netherlands already has a high degree of flexibility, which allows it to respond to the elimination of supply and demand in a way that is in line with market conditions. The Netherlands does not have separate targets related to increasing flexibility in the system. Flexibility in the form of demand response, storage or adjustable capacity is interwoven in the electricity market and is traded across the various markets without flexibility being a clearly identifiable                                                  54 Letter to Parliament dated 28 June 2019 on the proposal for a Climate Agreement - Parliamentary document 32813-342 55 Letter to Parliament on Gas Extraction in Groningen, 29 March 2018, Parliamentary document 33 529, no. 457 56 Letter to Parliament on the Gas extraction level in Groningen in 2019-2020 33 529 no. 678 57 Rules related to holding petroleum products  Parliamentary document 33 357, no. 6 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    factor.58 ii. Increasing the diversification of energy sources and suppliers based in third countries In the field of natural gas, efforts focus on significantly reducing the production of low-calorific natural gas from Groningen in the short term (see also Chapter 1). In addition, users of low-calorific natural gas are being encouraged to switch to renewable energy sources, or to high-calorific gas if there is no alternative.59 For years, annual natural gas production from the Groningen field and the small fields has fluctuated around 80 BCM, but decreased sharply as of 2015, due to restrictions at the Groningen field and the reduced supply from the small fields. There is no specific policy aimed at the diversification of suppliers of natural gas from third countries, given that the Netherlands has a very open and liquid gas market (the Title Transfer Facility, TTF) on which a large number of parties operate. On the TTF, natural gas is traded based on energy content and not quality (high-calorific or low-calorific natural gas). With regard to diversification, the Netherlands believes it is important to maintain the required infrastructure (including with regard to the rise of LNG). Apart from that the Dutch natural gas network has an excellent connection to networks in surrounding countries and gas from a large number of countries reaches the Netherlands. Given this situation and the ambition arising from the Paris Climate Agreement to phase out natural gas by 2050, there is no specific policy focusing on the diversification of natural gas suppliers and/or reducing dependence on third countries. The latter apart from the measures that are being taken to stimulate gas extraction from small Dutch fields offshore. The Netherlands also has sufficient transport and storage capacity of natural gas, which has enabled it to prepare for the decline in domestic production. Gas storage facilities in the Netherlands currently offer approximately 14 billion m³ in storage capacity (working volume), allowing coverage of seasonal fluctuations and peaks in gas demand. A large number of small consumers in the Netherlands depend on natural gas. In order to prevent small consumers from being cut off from natural gas during an extremely cold spell as a result of a shortage in production and transport capacity, the grid operator GTS has a statutory obligation to reserve volume and capacity, which enables it to supply small consumers with natural gas. GTS is responsible for peak supply to small consumers when temperatures fall in the range of -9°C to -17°C. The transport infrastructure takes into account a temperature of -17°C, enabling GTS to transport the required volumes in these situations.60 There are no objectives to increase the diversification of energy sources and suppliers from third countries for electricity. The targets for decarbonisation and expansion of the share of energy generated from renewable sources will lead to a further diversification of generation techniques on the electricity market. See Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 on this matter. In addition, the government is committed to increasing the security of supply of raw materials for the energy transition under its circular economy policy, especially for critical metals (such as for solar PV panels, wind turbines and batteries for electric cars). Innovative design, recycling and materials substitution are being promoted in order to achieve this.61 iii. Reducing dependence on energy imports from third countries At the European level, the Netherlands is committed to the use of sustainable biofuels and this enables a reduction of energy imports from developing countries to be achieved. The government also intends to increase the production of so-called more advanced sustainable biofuels in the Netherlands.62 Natural gas extraction from the small Dutch fields, where safe and responsible, is preferred over gas imports, partly to limit dependence on third countries. However, no other measures are being taken to reduce dependence on third countries.                                                  58 Energy Agenda - Parliamentary document 31 510 no. 64. 59 Letter to Parliament on Gas Extraction in Groningen, Parliamentary document 33 529, no. 457. 60 Security of Supply Gas Act Decree, Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 2004, 170. 61 Letter to Parliament on the Government's response to the transition agendas for the circular economy  Parliamentary document 32 852, no. 59. 62 Government assessment of the Climate Agreement Mobility sectoral platform, 5 October 2018, Appendix to Parliamentary document 32 813, no. 220. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    The Netherlands relies on the effective operation of the Dutch gas market, the TTF. The TTF has recently demonstrated that it can cope without any problems with the substantial decrease in gas extraction from Groningen (of over 50 billion Nm³ in 2013 to 17.5 billion Nm³ in 2018/2019). The Netherlands has no specific policy aimed at reducing dependence on oil imports from third countries either. As explained above, the oil market is an unregulated global market that in itself is highly diversified in terms of sources. As long as the market continues to operate, security of supply is guaranteed and the market determines the price and allocation of the available oil around the world. It is expected that, despite the reduction of greenhouse gases and efforts to make the energy mix more sustainable, oil and the products refined from it will remain a key component of the energy and raw material mix for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the Netherlands, being a Member State of the EU and the IEA, takes the security of the supply of oil and the stability of the oil market extremely seriously. If called on to do so by the EU or IEA, the Netherlands will use a share of its strategic oil stocks in a joint effort to maintain the stability of the oil market. The Netherlands is already prepared to do so and is able to implement the measure immediately, if required. Lastly, the Netherlands has no specific policy for reducing imports of electricity from third countries.  iv. Increasing the flexibility of the national energy system, by means of domestic energy sources, demand response and energy storage As long as, and in so far as the built-up environment and businesses are still dependent on natural gas, domestic gas extraction or imports are necessary. In addition the preference is for gas extraction from small fields due to the climate benefits and because it is better for the economy. High-calorific gas is extracted from the small gas fields, a large share of which is converted into low-calorific gas through quality conversion. The Netherlands intends to boost gas extraction from small gas fields in the Dutch part of the North Sea. There is no direct link between the amount of gas extracted from the Groningen field and the amount of gas extracted from the small fields. Reduced gas extraction from the Groningen field can - if the demand for low-calorific gas remains constant, which means that more high-calorific gas must be mixed with nitrogen, or the conversion of large-scale consumers from low-calorific gas to high-calorific gas - lead to a higher demand from the Netherlands for high-calorific gas. This additional demand for gas must be satisfied via the international market for high-calorific gas. It is only possible to extract gas from existing small fields faster on a very limited scale and temporary basis.63 Regulation of the electricity market will be organised over the next few years by the legislative agenda so that investments in the use of flexibility (also by/from small consumers) will be rewarded in accordance with the market. With the increase in the number of smart meters consumers could also, if they wish, respond to real-time prices, whether or not assisted by aggregators. Furthermore, any obstacles to storage will be eradicated.64 The transition to electric vehicles can contribute in this regard.                                                  63 Letter to Parliament on gas extraction from small fields dated 30 May 2018, Parliamentary document 33 529, no. 469. 64 Legislative agenda, Parliamentary document II, 2017-2018, 30 196, no. 566.
