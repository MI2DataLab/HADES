Current primary and final energy consumption in the economy and per sector (including industry, residential, service and transport) primary energy consumption equalled 1 025 PJ, with (following energy conversion, transmission and distribution, not including non-energy use) 774.68 PJ128 reaching consumers. Final energy consumption for 2017 fell short of the 2005 level by around 10 PJ, notwithstanding that the Hungarian GDP grew on average by 1.5 % annually between 2005 and 2017.129 Composition of final energy consumption in 2017: industry (22 %), transport (23 %), households (36 %), and commerce and services (11 %).

In 2013 consumption reached the level of 2005, and in 2017 it even exceeded the level by around 18 %. As a positive development, however, energy consumption in transport falls short of the 2005 level, and energy consumption in the services sector and by households significantly declined over the year 2005. It should also be noted, however, that Hungarian households have again been consuming more energy since 2014.

SWD (2017) 397 final. 132 Energy intensity indicates the amount of energy necessary for manufacturing a product or performing a process. 133 Also taking into account energy consumption in transport.  Unfavourable trends emerge when analysing energy efficiency on a sectoral level.134 Although energy consumption is becoming increasingly efficient in the services sector (energy intensity has dropped by more than one half), energy efficiency in both the industrial and transport sectors  with a significantly higher share of energy consumption in recent years  has declined. Although energy efficiency in the industrial sector followed a positive trend between 2000 and 2009 (energy intensity decreased during this period), a moderate overall decline is observed since 2009.  Figure 22  Energy intensity in the national economy, industry, agriculture and services135 between 2000 and 2017136 Source: Eurostat HU EN Energiaintenzitás  toe/millió Ft (2010-es áron számolva) Energy intensity  toe/HUF million (at 2010 prices) Nemzetgazdaság National economy Ipar Industry Szolgáltatások Services  Agriculture, forestry and fishery                                                       134 The analysis is based on the old methodology, taking into account that sectoral data based on the new methodology are not yet available in the Eurostat database. 135 Intensity was calculated on the basis of the GDP (at 2010 prices, in HUF) in relation to the national economy, and on the basis of added value (at 2010 prices, in HUF) in relation to industry. 136 Transport, and passenger and freight transport is discussed separately. Due to statistical/classification difficulties, efficiency was analysed with different methods.   In the first half of the decade, although deteriorating energy efficiency in industry was to some extent offset after the crisis by improving fuel consumption in the transport, passenger and freight transport sectors (the period between 2009 and 2013 is essentially characterised by stagnating carriage of goods and a sharp decline in energy consumption137), the situation has worsened since 2013 in this area as well. For the above reason, improvement of the useful efficiency of energy consumption in transport should be a priority for future development.

In 2015 the energy used to heat one square metre of a residential building in Hungary (20.9 koe/m2) exceeded the EU28 average by 37.5 % (after adjustment of climate differences), and no significant progress has been made compared to the level in 2005 in Hungary, either (21.1 koe/m2).139 In consequence of these effects energy efficiency indicators deteriorated in 2015 and 2016 on an aggregate level as well. The final energy consumption per household also reflects this trend: Although energy consumption per household decreased from 64.3 GJ to 52.1 GJ between 2010 and 2014 , the final energy consumption of households increased by 7.4 GJ on average between 2015 and 2017.140 The trends of recent years suggest the necessity of reconsidering the energy efficiency measures applied so far, developing new incentives, introducing the obligation scheme141 and the effective exploitation of awareness raising potential. Without the encouragement of energy efficiency investments and implementation of additional measures there is the risk that Hungary will remain stuck on the level of developing countries with high energy and carbon intensity, and will be unable to benefit from economic advantages offered by high energy efficiency. EU obligations are also aimed at improving energy efficiency (Energy Efficiency Directive142, Energy Performance of Buildings Directive143). In the summer of 2018, the indicative 2030 energy efficiency target of the EU was raised from 27 % to 32.5 %, which also requires Hungary to make additional efforts. Based on the foregoing, in the future we are assigning a greater priority to the efficient use of energy. In the coming years, one of the key measures of energy efficiency policies will be to apply the principle of  in day-to-day decision-making. Applyin as prescribed by Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action  contributes to achieving all of our main energy and climate policy objectives and to improving the competitiveness of the Hungarian economy. In parallel with the key objective of maintaining the existing energy intensive industrial sectors, future industrial investments should be made in low energy and GHG intensive, high-tech industrial sectors, with a focus on energy efficiency targets, enabling support of the sustainable and competitive development of the Hungarian economic structure. Taking into account the high 40 % share of primary energy used for the heating and cooling of buildings in Hungary, the upgrade of residential buildings and non-residential buildings is also a priority. We are planning to develop cost-effective incentives within the framework of an energy                                                       139 European Commission (2017): Energy Union Factsheet  Hungary. SWD (2017) 397 final. 140 Data on final energy consumption is provided by Eurostat, while the number of households is based on HCSO data. 141 Under the obligation scheme, Hungary requires energy distributors and/or retail energy trade undertakings to introduce programmes and implement measures resulting in evidenced energy savings for final customers. 142 Directive (EU) 2018/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 amending Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency. 143 Directive (EU) 2018/844 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 amending Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings and Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency.  efficiency obligation scheme, which drive energy efficiency investments to areas with the highest energy consumption and energy efficiency potential on a market basis. Improvement of the efficiency of energy consumption in transport is also a task to be resolved. This task is also justified by finite fossil energy sources, increasing energy consumption, and the very close, positive correlation between energy consumption and environmental pollution.144 ii. Current potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling145 To determine the potential it is necessary to update the assessment referred to in Article 14(1) of Directive 2012/27/EU. iii. Projections considering existing energy efficiency policies, measures and programmes as described in point 1.2.ii. for primary and final energy consumption for each sector at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)146 Final energy consumption Under the WEM scenario, Hungarian gross final energy consumption will significantly increase until 2030, by around 18 % over the year 2016.

Source of actual data: Eurostat HU EN  Agriculture Ipar Industry Lakosság Retail Közlekedés Transport Szolgáltatás Services   The biggest increase during this period was measured in industry, with a rise in energy consumption of approximately 48 %. A significant increase was also observed in the transport sector. Notwithstanding that transport vehicles are becoming more efficient, this effect cannot entirely offset rising demand for mobility. In the retail sector, however, a decrease is also measured up to 2030 under a scenario without additional measures, and the pace of the declining trend is even more pronounced in the 2030s. The 15 % increase in the services sector is significantly smaller than in industry between 2016 and 2030, followed by stagnating energy consumption in the sector. Although the use of coal-related products is mainly on the rise, primarily attributable to growing industrial coal use, the share of coal in 2030 still falls short of 3.5 %. The 20 % increase in electricity consumption between 2016 and 2030, however, is substantial.  Figure 25  Composition of gross final energy consumption in the breakdown of fuels under the WEM scenario, ktoe Source of actual data: Eurostat  HU EN Szén Coal Olaj Oil Gáz Gas Villamos energia Electricity  District heat Megújuló Renewables  As regards composition of fuels, due to its marginalised role in electricity generation, coal is losing relevance, its consumption falls by one half by 2030, and its total share within primary energy consumption will be around 3 %. The use of nuclear energy indicates a significant increase, which will peak in 2030, when the new and old units of the Paks Nuclear Power Plant will operate in parallel. A substantial increase is also expected in relation to renewables; by 2030 consumption will increase by approximately 56 % over the year 2016. Electricity imports will significantly decline in 2030; on an annual level Hungary will become almost entirely self-sufficient with the parallel operation of the Paks units, followed by a rise in imports in the second half of the 2030s, in parallel with the decommissioning of the currently operating units.

Retail Notwithstanding the spread of better and more energy efficient heating solutions, total heating energy consumption will increase as a result of two important factors. Firstly, despite a shrinking population, the total inhabited floor area will increase. Secondly, the heated floor area will also increase, i.e. the unheated or underheated area is decreasing. These effects entail the rise in energy consumption up to 2030, which, however, will be followed by a declining trend. Owing to the substantial energy efficiency potential of technologies, we forecast decreasing energy  consumption for cooling. A moderate increase is expected in the use of DHW up to 2030, followed by a declining, stagnating trend. The energy consumption of refrigerators, freezers and washing machines will significantly decline, as the turnover rate of these equipment is relatively high, and new equipment are considerably more energy efficient. A similar trend is forecast for lighting. The energy consumption of other equipment will initially increase in parallel with economic development, but in this case, too, Hungary can expect substantial savings after 2025.

Consumption of both fuels will moderately increase up to 2030, but it will not at any time exceed 5 % during the almost 15-year  period. In parallel with stagnating consumption of district heat, electricity consumption is also expected to significantly decline as a result of new equipment with improved energy efficiency. With the significant increase in the penetration of household equipment, by 2040 electricity consumption will fall to one third of its level. Coal and oil consumption will almost completely disappear; their consumption will amount to only a few PJ even by 2030.

Firstly, the energy consumption of cars will moderately decrease, followed by a stagnating trend. In contrast, the energy consumption of goods vehicles will significantly increase in the next decades, particularly in the category of small and medium-sized vehicles. Although rail and urban rail transport will significantly increase by 2030, by around 30 %, its share within energy consumption for transport purposes will only amount to 3.5 % in 2030. The energy consumption of buses will significantly decline, which is attributable vehicles with low consumption.

In the longer term the increase is mainly caused by electricity and gas based energy consumption. While oil accounted for 92 % of total consumption in 2016, this figure will fall to 77 % in 2030.    Figure 32  Composition of energy consumption in the transport sector in the breakdown of used fuels under the WEM scenario, ktoe Source of actual data: Eurostat HU EN Olaj Oil Gáz Gas Villamos energia Electricity Megújuló Renewables  Services sector Under the WEM scenario, energy consumption will increase by 15 % in the services sector.

In addition to renewables, electricity consumption will also rise significantly by 2030 due to the energy consumption of equipment and lighting. Natural gas consumption will increase by 13 %, while coal and oil consumption will decrease by around 17 % in the same period. Agriculture, forestry and fishery The energy consumption of the agriculture, forestry and fishery sector will significantly increase to 761 ktoe in 2030.

A falling, stagnating trend will follow after the decommissioning of the old units. A substantial increase is observed in relation to material consumption, rising from 1.8 Mtoe in 2016 to 2.7 Mtoe by 2030. We forecast a moderate increase in distribution losses caused by rising final customer demand.
