2.3 Dimension Energy security  Based on the strategic objective of integration into the energy systems of the European Union and promoting harmonious, competitive and efficient development of the energy sector, efforts are being made to implement the essential elements of the NEIS, namely energy independence, competitiveness and sustainable development. By becoming an EU member in 2004, Lithuania joined the single EU framework, becoming part of the EU's single economic market, which enabled r rapid growth of the Lithuanian economy and other areas of national significance. However, in the energy context, the conditions remain almost unchanged as Lithuania has remained systematically and infrastructurally linked to the Russian energy system. Following the definitive closure of Unit 2 of Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant on 31 December 2009, Lithuania's dependence on a single external energy supplier has been further reinforced. Considering that it did not have energy interconnections with the EU mainland and that all natural gas and most of electricity were purchased from a single monopolistic supplier, Lithuania started implementing infrastructure projects of regional importance to interconnect the Lithuanian and EU energy systems. The goal is therefore to continue the activities undertaken, to make proper use of the potential of projects of strategic importance that have been completed or are still in progress, in particular through integration into the energy systems of the EU, and to promote harmonious, competitive and efficient development of the energy sector, thereby reducing the influence of a single (monopolistic) energy supplier: by increasing the use of local and renewable resources, developing competitive local energy generation capacities and diversifying imports of energy resources that cannot be replaced by local sources.   Electricity sector The Lithuanian electricity system is connected to the Belarussian, Russian, Latvian, Polish and Swedish electricity systems. It should be noted that at present the Lithuanian-Latvian-Estonian-Belarussian electricity systems are part of the IPS/UPS system operated by the Russian electricity system operator. However, Lithuania and the Baltic States are seeking to become an independent part of the decentralised European electricity system and to move towards transparent European standards of electricity system management. In this context, particular attention is devoted to the Synchronisation Project, which would synchronise the Baltic States' electricity systems with the continental European network. The Synchronisation Project is defined in all strategic documents. Lithuania remains dependent on imported energy. This is best reflected in the energy dependency rate, which was 74.7% in 2018 and increased 1.8 percentage points compared to 2017 and is still well above the European Union (EU) average (55.1% in 2017). Lithuania imports most of its electricity. Electricity demand in Lithuania was 13.1 TWh in 2018. In 2018, almost three quarters of electricity was imported and 3.5 TWh produced to meet Lithuania's needs. Electricity production in the country decreased by 16.1%, representing 62.8% of total electricity production from renewable energy sources in 2018. The main reasons why more 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 39   electricity is imported than produced are economic, i.e. electricity is imported from wherever it is the cheapest. Under NEIS, electricity imports will be replaced by local electricity generation: it is planned that electricity generation in Lithuania will account for 35% of total final electricity consumption in 2020 (65% will be imported), 70% (30% imported) in 2030, and 100% in 2050. The electricity transmission system operator AB LITGRID, which is responsible for the reliable operation of the electricity transmission system in accordance with the procedure established by law, prepares an annual development plan for the 400-110 kW  networks of Lithuanian electricity system (hereinafter referred to as -ich is to anticipate possible changes in electricity and power needs, generating powers and generation in the long term, to anticipate the scope of development and restoration of the transmission network and to determine indicative investments, in view of the current situation of the electricity system and decisions.   Capacity mechanism Secure supply of electricity is a key element of the European Union's climate change and energy policy. The latter includes a number of basic elements, one of which is the adequacy of the electricity system, underlining the need to ensure sufficient capacities and grid capacity to meet the electricity needs of consumers by assessing the availability of generating sources and interconnections and the load characteristics of electricity networks. Based on the probability assessment of the adequacy of the Lithuanian electricity system carried out in 2018 by Kaunas University of Technology for the periods 20192024 and 20252030, a lack of available reliable capacity to ensure the adequacy of the Lithuanian electricity system reaching the expected loss of load expectation (LOLE) has been identified as 8 h per year as of 2025 (after desynchronisation from the IPS/UPS system), which increases to 29.5 h per year under the PPM scenario. 37 In order to ensure the adequacy of the Lithuanian electricity system and to reduce the likelihood of loss of load to 8 h under the PPM scenario, a capacity mechanism is currently being developed in Lithuania to ensure reliable operation of the Lithuanian electricity system and an adequate level of security of electricity supply after 2025 (after the electricity system has been de-synchronised from the IPS/UPS system). The capacity mechanism being developed is expected to ensure effective competition in the electricity sector while minimising the burden on electricity consumers. The planned capacity mechanism will be technologically neutral, as it will be open to both existing and future electricity-generating electrical installations to be installed (built) by participants in the capacity auction before the capacity submission period as well as to installations operated by storage and independent electricity demand aggregators. The capacity mechanism being developed will allow the initiation of a procedure for the provision of economically and technically feasible capacities. Natural gas sector Lithuania does not have its own natural gas resources, therefore all natural gas consumed in Lithuania is imported. Since the start of operation of the  (LNG) terminal in 2014, sources of supply have diversified and Lithuania is able to obtain sufficient natural gas from international LNG markets. Annual consumption of natural gas in Lithuania is about 2.4 billion m3. Around a half of the natural gas consumed in Lithuania is consumed by AB Achema, the largest producer of nitrogen fertilisers and other industrial chemical products in the country, and the largest plant of this kind in the Baltic States.                                                            37 https://www.entsoe.eu/outlooks/midterm/ 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 40   The construction of a liq-long natural gas monopoly in Lithuania and enabled competition. Lithuania is now able to independently secure gas supply for itself (and to supply significant quantities to the countries of the Baltic region) through the LNG terminal alone in the event of disruption of supply from Russia or lack of competitiveness. Around 50% of the natural gas consumed in Lithuania is imported each year via terminal. These substantial changes in the natural gas sector led to the disappearance of the difference in import prices of EUR 10/MWh and above between the Lithuanian market and the Western European natural gas markets, and Lithuania, previously one of the EU Member States paying the highest prices for natural gas imports, became one of EU Member States paying the lowest prices for imported natural gas. Taking into account the results achieved, the global dynamics of the liquefied natural gas market and the potential of the regional natural gas market to ensure a competitive and reliable supply of natural gas, it is strategically important for Lithuania to ensure long-the Seimas adopted a decision providing that Lithuania will ensure the long-term supply of LNG after 2024 spread over the whole of the LNG terminal's expected operational life, rather than over the 10-year lease period of the LNG storage tank as is currently the case.  Although Lithuania currently has an alternative source of natural gas supply, the LNG terminal, it is not yet connected to the continental European gas pipeline network. The Gas Interconnection Poland-Lithuania (GIPL) project is currently under way which will enable Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, as well as Finland (it should be noted that by the end of 2019 the Balticconnector pipeline will connect the Finnish gas networks with the Estonian gas networks) with the gas networks of continental Europe. GIPL will integrate the gas markets of the Baltic States and Finland into the single EU gas market, create access to alternative sources and routes of gas supply and increase the competitiveness of the gas market as well as security and reliability of gas supply by creating both additional gas transmission capacities and the possibility of EU solidarity mechanisms in the event of an emergency, allowing more flexible and efficient use of Polish and Lithuanian trading zones, and strengthening their regional role.  Oil sector Oil is found in Lithuania, but the quantities are not large, so virtually all consumption is imported. It should be noted that Lithuania has the only oil refinery in the Baltic States and therefore imports of crude oil are more than sufficient for Lithuania's needs. The design capacity of the oil refinery of AB ORLEN Lietuva is 15 million tonnes of oil per year. In order to make better use of the production capacity, other feedstock such as gas condensate, heavy fuel oil and medium distillates are also processed. In the past, Lithuania was supplied with oil via an oil pipeline, but with the launch of the reverse import- Its annual design capacity is 14 million tonnes of oil per year. In recent years, the country's consumption of petroleum products has been around 2.1 million tonnes. The domestic market is dominated by petroleum products of AB ORLEN Lietuva and only a small proportion of certain types of oil products are imported from other countries. Rail or road transport may also be used to supply petroleum products. Lithuania has the full technical capacity to diversify the supply of oil and petroleum products. As mentioned above, the potential of the Lithuanian oil sector fully meets the needs of the country's oil 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 41   consumers. The majority of petroleum products produced in the country are supplied to foreign markets. Lithuania currently has the full technical capacity to both export to and import oil and petroleum products from various countries and sources around the world. The country has accumulated sufficient State stocks of petroleum products to protect against petroleum product supply disruptions. For more than two decades already, the oil sector has been operating under market conditions, i.e.:  there are no legal restrictions on the import of fuel from EU countries or from third countries;  the prices of petroleum products are not regulated by the State (with the exception of liquefied petroleum gas supplied to group installations);  for petroleum products, only the rates of excise duty and the value added tax are fixed by the State;  it should be noted that mandatory quality indicators for petroleum products have been established but there are entry or import quotas.  Supply security and stockpiles The Law on Electricity38 establishes the foundations for safe and secure operation of the electricity system and the generation, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity. Article 23(1) of that Law provides that the electricity transmission system operator is responsible for the stability and reliability of the operation of the electricity system, the performance of the national balancing function in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania, the provision of system services, the operation, maintenance, management and development of interconnections with the electricity systems of other countries, by reducing the capacity constraints in the transmission networks and taking into account the needs of electricity system and electricity grid users. Article 76(1)(2) of the same Law stipulates the National Energy Regulatory Council should cooperate with foreign national energy regulators to ensure that the transmission system operator has one or more integrated system(s) at regional level covering two or more Member States for capacity allocation and for ensuring the security of the electricity network. The supply of electricity in the event of an emergency is limited or suspended in accordance with the Rules of Electricity Supply and Use39. The Lithuanian natural gas transmission system, operating in normal mode, is able to ensure the supply of supplied to the country from alternative sources. As a result, risks to gas supply are significantly reduced, in particular due to geopolitical factors. An alternative gas supply also reduces the risk of gas supply due to technical failures. On 25 October 2017, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 concerning measures to safeguard security of gas supply and repealing Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 ('the Regulation concerning measures to safeguard security of gas supply'), the objective of which is to safeguard the security of gas supply by ensuring the proper and continuous functioning of the internal market in natural gas, by allowing for exceptional measures to be implemented when the market can no longer deliver the gas supplies required and by providing for the clear definition and attribution of responsibilities among natural gas undertakings, the Member States and the Union regarding both preventive action and the reaction to concrete disruptions of gas supply. This Regulation also provides transparent mechanisms, in a                                                            38 Reference to the Lithuanian Law on Electricity: https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/TAR.F57794B7899F/mouDoNqiIt 39 Approved by Order No 1-38 of the Minister for Energy of the Republic of Lithuania of 11 February 2010 on the approval of the Rules of Power Supply and Use. 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 42   spirit of solidarity, for the coordination of planning for, and response to, an emergency at Member State, regional and European Union levels. The Ministry of Energy has been designated and notified as the competent authority for the implementation of the measures provided for in this Regulation. In assessing the capacity of the transmission system to deliver gas to customers in the event of a supply disruption, the calculation of the N-1 criterion established in the Regulation concerning measures to safeguard security of gas supply has shown that this security of gas supply indicator is met in Lithuania. The supply of petroleum products in the event of an emergency is carried out in accordance with the Plan for the application of restrictions on the supply and use of petroleum products40. It lays down measures to stabilise the supply and/or consumption of petroleum products when an energy emergency is declared as a result of a reduction in the supply of petroleum products to such an extent as to endanger the safety, health or economic activity of the population. According to EU and Lithuanian legislation, the country's stockpiles of petroleum products and oil must be sufficient to cover most of the following needs: 90 days of average daily net imports or 61 days of average daily inland consumption. A part of the stockpiles consist of special stockpiles held and managed by the State enterprise Lithuanian Energy Agency (hereinafter referred to as the State, and the amount accumulated by the Agency must be sufficient for at least 30 days, based on the average daily domestic consumption in the preceding calendar year. The remainder of the reserve is accumulated by the obliged undertakings.
