Impacts of planned policies and measures described in Section 3 on the energy system and GHG emissions and removals, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures (as described in Section 4).  5.1.1. Projections of the development of the energy system and GHG emissions and removals as well as, where relevant, of emissions of air pollutants in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/2284 under the planned policies and measures at least until 10 years after the period covered by the plan (including for the last year of the period covered by the plan), and relevant Union policies and measures  energy and climate, in the short, medium and long term. It develops a possible trajectory for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to achieve carbon neutrality in 2050, the essential target of the scenario. This scenario was used as reference for the 2018 review of the National Low-Carbon Strategy and the MEP. The carbon budget calculation and the guidelines of the SNBC 2 project (described in Section 3) are based on the WAM scenario and projections.   The construction of this scenario was based firstly on an analysis focused on a carbon-neutral France. This served as the basis for an exploration of various potential avenues and the identification of certain  This is a long-term scenario because it covers energy and climate issues up to 2050. In the short term, it explains the possible transformations in the various sectors in view of the public policy measures driven by the Government and the constraints associated with the development of low-carbon technologies and the international macroeconomic context.  5.1.1.1. Summary of the scenario and WAM projections by sector  Transport  The target of neutrality by 2050 means that the transport sector needs to be almost completely carbonfree, either by switching to electric vehicles or by switching to biofuels and biogas. However, a quantity of non-bio-based fuels is still permitted up to 2050 for air transport and international marine bunkers.   It is assumed that demand for mobility is increased but gradually uncoupled from economic growth, and strong assumptions have been made in terms of efficiency and engine type. The scenario utilises all of the following five levers: carbon-free energy consumed by vehicles; energy performance of vehicles to limit energy consumption; control of growth in demand; modal shift; and optimisation of the use of vehicles for transportation of passengers and goods.  Electrification, which is approximately two to three times more effective than internal combustion solutions in terms of vehicle energy yields, is given priority in the long term, in particular for private vehicles (100% of sales of new private vehicles to be electric from 2040). This involves ambitious development, because it assumes a five-fold increase in the number of sales of electric vehicles by 2022 (corresponding to the commitment made in the Strategic Contract for the Automobile Sector for 2018 2022). In 2030, the number of new vehicle sales in the scenario is 35% electric private vehicles and 10% rechargeable hybrid private vehicles. Major efforts are also made in relation to vehicle efficiency, in  309    particular for internal combustion vehicles. The scenario aims in particular to achieve a level of 4 l/100 km for sales in 2030. New electric vehicles reach a level of 12.5 kWh/100 km by 2050 (approximately 40% less consumption than current figures).  A more balanced mix (renewable gas, electricity, biofuels) is sought for goods transport because of the more significant constraints on engine systems associated with this form of transport. Electrification is slower than for private vehicles. Significant energy efficiency efforts are also undertaken for heavy goods vehicles: depending on engine type, efficiency gains of between 35% and 40% are obtained by 2050.  The energy efficiency gains and carbon-free operation apply to all transport modes. In particular, the scenario provides for a gradual development of biofuels in aviation up to a rate of 50% by 2050. Maritime and river transport is fully carbon-free for domestic emissions by 2050 and 50% carbon-free for international bunkers.  The scenario assumes that traffic increases will be controlled for both passenger and goods transport, with a modal shift towards active mobilities, public transport and mass transport along with optimisation of vehicle use.  Passenger traffic in passenger-km for all modes combined increases by 26% between 2015 and 2050 but on a more moderate basis than in a trend-based scenario, in particular because of the development of increases four-fold from 2030. Public transport develops significantly, with growth in corresponding modal share of 7 points, along with shared mobilities and carpooling. In all, this makes it possible to contain private automobile traffic, which falls by approximately 2% between 2015 and 2050.   Goods traffic in tonnes-km grows by 40%, but to a more limited degree than in a trend-based scenario, because of the development of the circular economy and short circuits. Rail and river freight develops. The load rate for heavy goods vehicles increases, and the growth in heavy goods traffic is limited to 12% by 2050.

Demographic assumptions suggest that the volume of new builds continues to fall until 2050.   311    The scenario also assumes that a large majority of the stock of buildings, starting with the dwellings that -on average by 2050. In the residential sector, the pace of renovation reaches around 370,000 full renovation equivalents89 on average over the 20152030 period and then increases to achieve 700,000 full renovation equivalents on average over the 20302050 period. The tertiary sector experiences a similar pace of renovation.  The energy mix is fully carbon-free. This is based on the electrification of non-heating uses and a more varied energy mix for heating, in particular with substantial use of heat pumps and district heating systems. Gains in efficiency are assumed for all equipment used in buildings.  The scenario also provides for a fall in the energy requirement for certain items as a result of the dissemination of technologies enabling a reduction (smart management system, effective mixer taps, etc.), a different organisation of buildings (bioclimatic design) and virtuous individual behaviours (heating temperature lowered by 1 °C by 2050).    Figure 83: Final energy consumption for buildings in the WAM      89 The energy gain achieved during a full renovation equivalent corresponds to the gain achieved during renovation of an entire building to a very high-performance level. The scenario does not provide for any distribution between renovation in stages or all-in.                          312     Agriculture  The scenario is based on the implementation of all technical levers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to their full potential (legume crops, optimisation of the nitrogen cycle, reduction in surplus proteins in animal feed, ploughing practices, etc.), on the development of agricultural systems (agroforestry, bioagriculture, grass-based production, limits on anthropogenic development), the modification of domestic demand (alignment on nutritional guidelines by 2035, fall in food waste) and on the growing production of biosources energy and materials by the agricultural system.  In terms of energy consumption, energy efficiency and the control of requirements make it possible to halve consumption by 2050. Significant electrification takes place through the use of heat pumps or electric tractors where this is possible.  The agriculture sector plays an important role in the production of bio-based energy resources, in particular through waste recovery. Close to two thirds of the biomass mobilised by 2050 comes directly or indirectly from the agricultural sector.  Figure 85: Agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in the WAM          313    Emissions de gaz à effet de serre du secteur agricole dans l'AMS  Émissions de gaz à effet de serre dans  Emissions de GES en MtCO2eq Agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in the  WAM  GHG emissions in MtCO2eq  Figure 86: Agricultural final energy consumption in the WAM    Agricultural final consumption in the WAM  Consommation en TWh  Consumption in TWh  Charbon  Coal  Produits pétroliers raffinés  Refined petroleum products                         100 1990 2015 2020 2030 2040 2050     314     Forests/Land sector  Forests contribute to the scenario as carbon sinks, through the production of bio-based materials that can be substituted for high-emission materials, and through the production of biomass (wood energy, products related to wood processing industries, and wood waste). Smart and sustainable forest management make it possible to gradually increase the carbon pump while improving its resilience to climatic risks and better preserving biodiversity. The forest area increases, encouraged by afforestation. Harvesting increases gradually from 44 Mm³ in 2015 to 59 Mm³ in 2030 and 75 Mm³ in 2050, which requires substantial mobilisation efforts, and goes against the current trend, especially in private forests. The use of wood as a material is very strongly encouraged rather than for energy uses for wood leaving forests. The production of wood products with long lifetimes (especially those used in construction) triples between 2015 and 2050, which increases carbon sinks of wood products. Downstream, better collection of end-of-life wood products makes it possible to increase production of this type of biomass. Ultimately, the carbon sink in the forest and wood sector is maintained despite a drop in the sink in current forests caused by increased harvesting, thanks to the carbon sink for wood products and new forests.  The following graphic shows the changes in the carbon sink in the land sector as a whole, encompassing forest and other land (crops, meadows, anthropogenically developed land, etc.). Through forest management, achievement of the target of zero net anthropogenic development in 2050 and consideration of the carbon stored in agricultural land, this net carbon sink increases between 2030 and 2050, after little change between 2015 and 2030.  Figure 87: Historical (solid line) and projected (dotted line) changes in the forest and land sector carbon sink                 315    MtCO2eq  MtCO2eq  Forêts  Forests  Cultures  Crops  Prairies  Meadows  Zones artificielles  Anthropogenic areas  Variation du stock de carbone dans les produits bois  Variation in carbon stock in wood products  Autres  Other  Puits de la forêt et du secteur des terres  Carbon sinks in forests and the land sector    Industry/waste  In the industrial sector, the scenario is based on the process efficiency and electrification. Energy efficiency gains vary across sectors. In 2030, the scenario assumes gains of between 10% and 30%. In 2050 gains increase between 20% and 40%. The electrification rate increases slightly between 2015 and 2030 (from 38% to 43%) and then more quickly until 2050, covering more than 70% of final consumption by that date.  A circular economy is introduced, with recycling rates that increase drastically and increased use of ecodesign. Waste is almost entirely recovered.   The industrial sector also sees its non-energy emissions fall thanks to greater use of materials with low carbon impacts (low-carbon cement, bio-based chemistry, carbon-free hydrogen, etc.). More systematic use of wood in materials should also enable a reduction in the use of materials with a higher carbon footprint.  The competitiveness of industry is preserved vis-à-vis competing industries in regions of the world with less stringent climatic requirements, in order to retain a level of production similar to 2015 and therefore limit imports with excessively high carbon content.         Final energy consumption in industry in the  WAM  Figure 88: Final energy consumption in industry    316    Consommation en TWh  Consumption in TWh  Charbon  Coal  Produits pétroliers raffinés  Refined petroleum products  Gaz (dont gaz renouvelable)  Gas (including renewable gas)  Biocarburants  Biofuels  Électricité  Electricity  Chaleur vendue  Heat sold       Energy production and CCS  The energy sector is almost completely carbon-free90. The energy mix in 2050 is made up of renewable and recovered heat (90 to 100 TWh), biomass (400 to 450 TWh) and carbon-free electricity (balance remaining of 600 to 650 TWh, some of which is used for conversion to other final energy vectors: hydrogen, gas, etc.). In 2050, the production of renewable gas is within a range from 195 to 295 TWh105. The share of gas used in the residential and tertiary sectors is decreasing significantly.    90 -105 The top end of the range corresponds to gas conversion of all non-electrified heavy goods vehicles, all nonelectrified consumption of heat in buildings and the production of more electricity from gas. The only remaining would be solid biomass consumption in industry and biofuel consumption in air transport. Hydrogen is included in these estimates.                                    317    Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are also mobilised, on a prudent basis. In 2050, these technologies would make it possible to avoid around 6 MtCO2/year in industry and to achieve a dozen or so MtCO2 each year in negative emissions for biomass energy generation installations (BECCS).        Figure 90: Emissions in the energy generation sector in the WAM   Some lessons drawn from the scenario  Near-total decarbonisation of energy generation needs to be based solely on the following energy sources: biomass resources (waste from agriculture and wood products, wood energy, etc.), heat from the environment (geothermal, heat pumps, etc.) and carbon-free electricity. Given the current structure of the economy and its substantial focus on liquid and gaseous fuels, a certain tension results in relation to biomass resources. These resources have therefore been allocated as a priority for uses with high added value and few possibilities for substitution. The following graphic indicates the indicative distribution applied in the scenario. We can see a slight overrun in terms of consumption of biomass resources compared to potential for production of biomass resources. Works subsequent to the SNBC will make it possible to adjust the scenario on this specific point. This slight overrun does not significantly change the results of the modelling and thus does not undermine the suggested trajectory.       Figure 91: Distribution of potential biomass production and consumption sectors in the WAM                                 318     The constraint in terms of biomass thus means that gas consumption until 2050 should fall and that, over the same period, electricity consumption should increase, as indicated in the two graphics below, despite the substantial fall in energy consumption within that period. The first indicates the sector-based trajectory of national gas consumption in the case of the low hypothesis of the scenario. Total gas consumption in the high hypothesis is also shown.   319    Figure 92: Total gas consumption in the WAM scenario       The second shows national electricity consumption excluding network losses.

Trajectory for reducing emissions in the WAM scenario by sector and compliance with 2030 and 2050 targets   Trajectory for reducing emissions  The trajectory for reducing greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the WAM scenario, broken down by sectors, is described in the following graphic.  Figure 94: Trajectory for GHG emissions and sinks in France between 2005 and 2050 in the WAM scenario    Emissions et puits de gaz à effet de serre (en  MtCO2eq)  GHG emissions and sinks (in MtCO2eq)  Budgets carbone  Carbon budgets  Agriculture et Sylviculture  Agriculture and silviculture  Traitement des déchets  Waste treatment  Résidentiel et Tertiaire  Residential and tertiary buildings  Secteur des terres  Land sector   321    Emissions brutes tendancielles  Gross emissions under the trend-based scenario  Industrie manufacturière  Manufacturing sector   Energy industry  Transports  Transport  Capture et Stockage du Carbone  Carbon capture and storage    Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by sector  The emission reductions by sector to 2050 are shown in the following table:  Sectors  Emission reduction by sector in the WAM scenario compared to 2015  Transport  -97%  Buildings  -95%  Agriculture/silviculture (excluding LULUCF)  -46%  Industry  -81%  Energy production  -95%  Waste  -66%  Total (excluding LULUCF)  -83%  LULUCF  64%    Thus, the sectors that are essentially carbon-free in 2050 in the WAM scenario (transport, buildings and energy generation) show the highest emission reductions (more than -95% compared to 2015). Conversely and schematically, the sectors for which unavoidable residual emissions have been considered in 2050 according to current knowledge (agriculture/silviculture, industry and waste) show lower emission reductions.   Although the agriculture and silviculture sector has the lowest emission reductions, the efforts set out in the WAM scenario for this sector are just as ambitious as for other sectors. The assumptions applied to 2050 in fact represent a very substantial change to French agricultural practices compared to 2015, in particular:   25% fall in dairy cattle;   33% fall in non-dairy cattle;   82% fall in surplus nitrogen;    84% increase in intermediate catch crops;    60% in intermediate energy crops.   322    Lastly, the emission reductions in the LULUCF sector clearly demonstrate the assumptions made for this sector, namely maximisation of the carbon pump compared to 2015 (+64%) while mobilising biomass to channel more wood into the economy.

The sectors for which unavoidable residual emissions have been considered in 2050 according to current knowledge (agriculture/silviculture, industry and waste) show emission reductions that are lower, but nonetheless significant compared to the WEM.   Lastly, the WAM scenario enables a moderate mobilisation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to increase carbon sinks. In 2050, these technologies would make it possible to avoid around 6 MtCO2/year in industry and to achieve a dozen or so MtCO2 each year in negative emissions for biomass energy generation installations.        5.2. Macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmental, employment and education, skills and social impacts, including just transition aspects (in terms of costs and benefits as well as cost-effectiveness) of the planned policies and measures described in Section 3 at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures  The SNBC-MEP scenario has been subject to a macroeconomic assessment performed by two modelling teams91 and a social impact analysis on household billing and energy poverty92. The main results are available in the report accompanying the SNBC, which is pub  91 CIRED using the Imaclim model and ADEME and CGDD using the ThreeME model.  92 CGDD using the Prometheus model.   325    5.2.1. Macroeconomic impact  The results of the assessment suggest a double dividend, both economic and environmental, from the long-term SNBC. The energy transition does little to modify the trend-based trajectory of GDP. The energy transition would provide additional GDP in the order of 1% to 2% in 2030 and 3% by 2050 compared to the trend-based scenario. It would also result in the creation of 300,000 to 500,000 extra jobs by 2030 and 700,000 to 800,000 jobs by 2050 compared to the trend-based scenario, in an international context of low-carbon transition and efficient recycling of carbon taxation.  Jobs increase across all sectors of the economy except in those associated with fossil fuels, fossil-fired and nuclear power plants, as well as road goods haulage.  The bulk of indirect and spin-off jobs created are in the tertiary sector, because that sector represents 80% of GDP.  In terms of skills, the Government will support the following, in particular through the Skills Investment Plan (PIC):   enabled the launch in 2019 of the commitment to expand employment and skills (EDEC) within the electricity sector);   training for job seekers in energy transition professions through a dedicated call for projects  training development:  o initial training: accrediting ministries will organise a review each year of:   the development of their diplomas and the degree of integration of interdisciplinary approaches and systemic control, which are essential for energy transition;   the attractiveness of diplomas covering energy transition;   the appropriateness of reviewing the diplomas of each Professional Advisory Committee (PAC), subject to advice from professional disciplines; the MTES will continue to inform the work of the PAC from    the accrediting ministries in order to ensure that ecological transition is taken into account properly in the associated reference information;  o in-service training: as part of its future tasks, France Compétences will lead discussions on updating changes in the professional areas and the requirements for adapting professional training throughout life. The various disciplines will be responsible for ensuring the development of the reference systems for their areas and for specific in-service training for their sectors (CQP) when a need for this is identified. The question will be asked at least every two years.    5.2.2. Social impacts  Energy transition has long-term benefits for household bills, with gains in energy performance winning out over energy price increases. Over the transition period, the impact on household budgets is variable: costs for investment in the renovation of dwellings; increase in energy bills for households with gas and fuel oil heating in poorly insulated dwellings that have not yet undergone renovation; gains on energy bills for households making the transition quickly. While investments in energy transition are profitable in the long term, the transition phase requires support, particularly for lower-income households.   326    The SNBC 2 and MEP 2 have both been subjected to strategic environmental evaluation.     While households may be impacted, where energy consumption is unchanged, by certain measures intended to promote energy transition, it is crucial to enable them to contribute fully to this transition by protecting their purchasing power. The actions intended to support households to reduce their consumption make it possible to reduce total household bills despite any price increases. The most vulnerable households must be given particular attention, so that energy transition can be an inclusive process.  To achieve this objective, incentives are provided to enable households to improve the energy efficiency of their dwellings and their travel, and to reduce their energy consumptions, and thus their bills. These provisions have three goals:   support and encourage households to continue moving towards energy transition;   limit the impact on purchasing power of households;   protect the most vulnerable households, with a view to social justice.    In this context, several existing measures will be extended and others will be implemented for both housing and mobility. In particular, these measures include tax incentives intended to promote virtuous behaviours, by encouraging users of the most polluting energies to switch to cleaner options. To support households in their efforts to adapt their homes to energy transition, two kinds of measures are introduced:   Actions to raise awareness and provide information will be undertaken when the mechanisms are deployed and implemented. For example, this is the objective of the FAIRE campaign, sponsored by ADEME.   Several mechanisms aim to support households in funding improvements in the energy quality of their homes: the primary tools include the CITE programme from the ANAH, which has continued to ramp this programme up in 2019. These mechanisms make it possible to support households, prioritising those with the lowest incomes, to perform works to improve the energy performance of their homes, and thus reduce their energy consumption and therefore their bills. These two mechanisms will evolve in 2020 to become more incentive-focused (transformation of the CITE into a bonus; merger of this bonus x Agilité scheme to improve financial incentives for low-income and very-low-income households).    Mobility is the other major pillar of energy transition for households, and is all the more important because the forms and methods of mobility are expected to develop over the coming years. Two farreaching measures are implemented to accelerate the renewal of the automobile fleet, to promote new, more environmentally efficient vehicles by providing increased assistance to the most disadvantaged households:   the bonus for purchasing a new electric vehicle is kept at a high level (27% of the purchase price technology and usage gains, with a maximum budget amount increased by 50% compared to   in 2018, and then 2019, the bonus has been extended to continue the replacement of a large number of old vehicles with new or used ones with much lower emissions:  o the emission ceiling for eligible vehicles has been reduced to 117 gCO2/km  (compared to 130 gCO2/km in 2018); o the bonus is doubled for the households with the lowest incomes and for working people in the first five income deciles living at least 30 kilometres from their place of work or required to travel long distances for their professional  327    -electric vehicle, new or used;  o the bonus is increased to make it more attractive to convert to a rechargeable hybrid or with sufficient range, new or used, irrespective of income level;  o fluent households.    employers to contribute to the travel costs to and from work for their employees by carpooling or 00/year and is tax-free and not subject to social security contributions. Bicycle users can also be reimbursed for their travel costs when travelling for professional purposes.  country has coverage by suitable mobility infrastructures and services, in particular by strengthening the organisation of services by public transport systems or appropriate mobility solutions for certain low-density areas. This also implies constant, careful vigilance of the issues associated with accessibility of these services, in particular for individuals with disabilities or reduced mobility but also for individuals who are vulnerable in economic, social or energy terms, who may require specific support systems.  Alongside these two main measures, the Government is putting in place financial incentives that will make it possible for authorities responsible for organising mobility services to themselves organise or contribute to funding social mobility services, and to pay individual mobility grants, to facilitate personalised support for vulnerable people, especially in terms of access to employment and training.  The gradual development of offers of aggregated distributed curtailment, accompanied by curtailment tenders, will also make it possible to develop new levers for competitiveness of electricity prices for private customers, while using residential electricity consumption to help balance the network, providing increased purchasing power and better control of energy consumption.  To protect the most vulnerable households for the purposes of ensuring social justice, the Government widened the scope of the energy allowance in 2018, with the average amount being higher than the amount of the social energy tariffs it replaces. The amount of the energy allowance has been increased with the lowest incomes, thus an extension of the base by 2.2 million households.  Low-income households can also obtain grants from housing funds in the individual departments. Energy suppliers are also being encouraged to take steps to support disadvantaged groups through the white certificates (WC) for energy poverty, which were extended and increased in 2018. These WC will also make it possible to deploy support programmes for sustainability in isolated areas and for people in situations of economic or social vulnerability.  The fuel poverty obligation for the new period for WC in 20182020 has been increased to  400 TWhcumac, in addition to the 1,200 TWhcumac of the traditional obligation, namely 1,600 TWhcumac. for all sectors combined. A decree currently being issued should extend the period by one year (2021) for this annual obligation, thus bringing the total to 2,133 TWhcumac for the 20182021 period (1,600 between 2018 and 2020).  The Government is therefore putting in place tools for households to ensure that the MEP targets are achieved in a manner that is inclusive and socially just.  5.2.3. Environmental impacts of the SNBC   328    The strategic environmental evaluation of the draft SNBC 2 reveals some probable significant positive effects on the following environmental challenges:   The limiting of greenhouse gases, the primary objective of the strategy, thanks to the guidelines provided for all sectors responsible for emissions or with storage potential.   The increased resilience of local areas to climate change and limited natural resources, thanks to the guidelines relating to regional development and the building sector.   The limiting of resource depletion and the development of the circular economy, thanks to the guidelines on prevention and management of waste, recovery of local resources and promotion of bio-based materials.   The preservation of the quality of the soils and water and management of spaces, thanks to the guidelines in the agriculture and forest-wood sectors intended to reduce pollutions in the soils and increase associated carbon storage. The strategy also proposes guidelines intended specifically to limit the anthropogenic development of the soils. The development of low-carbon processes and technologies and the installation of new infrastructures must, however, be studied carefully to avoid effects in terms of soil and water pollution. The MEP contains environmental recommendations on this issue.  The strategic environmental evaluation also raises several other points for attention, in particular in relation to:   The preservation of biodiversity and the consumption of natural, agricultural and forest spaces. The increased use of biomass may cause indirect impacts associated with an intensification and extension of agricultural and forest production systems. The environmental recommendations made by the National Biomass Mobilisation Strategy are specifically intended to limit impacts of this type.   The management of non-energy mineral resources associated with the development of renewable resources and the electrification of transport (production of batteries, photovoltaic panels, networks, etc.), and the energy renovation of buildings. These issues are considered in more operational terms in the MEPs, the National Energy Renovation Plan and the France Resources Plan.   Air quality, potentially impacted by the use and burning of biomass, and by building energy renovation actions (maintenance of interior air quality using ventilation systems). This subject is integrated into the SNBC guidelines and addressed more operationally in the National Air Pollutant Reduction Plan and the Housing Energy Renovation Plan. The probable positive impacts of the SNBC on exterior air quality should also be noted, particularly linked to the guidelines on the decarbonisation of energy and the large-scale electrification of transport.    5.3. State of play of investment needs  5.3.1. Existing investment flows  Climate investments in France in 2017  The Landscape of Climate Finance is a research programme sponsored by I4CE (Institute for Climate Economics) and supported by ADEME. Each year it gathers information about climate investment expenditures in France and analyses how these expenditures are funded. This analysis covers both private investments, made by households and undertakings, and investments by public bodies: Government, local authorities, social housing providers and infrastructure managers.    329    According to the Landscape of Climate Finance published in 201993, climate investments amounted to  orests and non-energy industrial processes.        building sector for the construction and renovation of housing and in the transport sector for the purchase represented almost all amounts invested in energy generation, industry and agriculture. Investments in the public sector made by the Government, local authorities, social housing operators and infrastructure maintenance of infrastructures.     5.3.2. Budgetary and tax expenditures to prevent climate change  Each year, the Government reports to Parliament on the public expenditures associated with its climate policy in the cross-94. This document summarises all fiscal efforts made by all Government departments in terms of preventing climate change.    capture the actual contribution of a climate change prevention programme. For comparison purposes, the Landscape on Climate Funding described above includes all these investments in its analysis. There is also a difference in scope in relation to research and by the I4CE study.  According to the 2019 policy document, the total amount of budgetary and fiscal expenditures contributing to preventing climate chang  93 https://www.i4ce.org/wp-core/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/I4CE-Panorama-des-financements-climatr%C3%A9sum%C3%A9-2018-FR.pdf  94 https://www.performance-publique.budget.gouv.fr/sites/performance_publique/files/files/documents/dpt2019/DPT2019_climat.pdf   330    Budgetary expenditures contributing to preventing climate change increased by 24.8% between 2017 and 2019, while tax costs fell by 44.9%. The significant fall in tax costs can be explained primarily by the reduction in 2019 in the tax costs associated with the CITE tax credit (52% reduction in the total amount of the tax credit between 2019 and 2017). This tax credit was in fact refocused on the equipment presenting the greatest leverage effects, with doors, windows and insulating shutters being excluded from the scope of the tax credit in 2018 (environmental cost/benefit ratio deemed insufficient).  Certain measures for revenues. This is the case, for example, for the taxation of the most polluting vehicles (penalty) as part of the automobile bonus/penalty mechanism intended to balance the expenditures generated by the bonus awarded to the most economical vehicles. In addition, since 2017, a portion of the revenues from the domestic consumption tax on energy products (TICPE) is channelled to the special allocation account for energy transition (CAS TE), which is used primarily to fund the support for electrical renewable energies, curtailment of electricity consumption and injection of biomethane.   The climate policy is also based on resource allocations, including a portion specifically funded by general budget. For example, the ANAH has been mainly funded since 2013 by the revenues from the auctioning of EU ETS quotas. In 2017, the ANAH was therefore allocated resources generated by the offers support and financial assistance to owner-occupiers with limited resources wanting to undertake renovation works to enable energy gains.     5.3.3. Forward-looking assumptions on investments on the basis of the proposed policies and measures  The quantity of average annual investments required for energy and climate transition is estimated as 2023, 20232028, 2028lopment of low-billion is for energy and electricity grids.   The above estimates correspond to the investments necessary for energy transition in the broad sense and take into account, for example, the entire cost of low-emission vehicles or the entire cost of lowemission transmission infrastructures. Within these investments, it is possible to evaluate the portion corresponding to additional costs compared to investments that do not incorporate the energy transition target (consideration only of the additional cost for low-carbon vehicles compared to their internal meet other targets). By adopting this more restrictive accounting approach, the additional investment the coming three carbon budgets.  are detailed in the tables below for each of the periods of the carbon budgets (average annual amounts by period), and then for the period to 2050.     2019-2023  2024-2028  2029-2033  2034-2050  Buildings  14  18  22  28   331    Transport  21  36  52  85  Energy and networks  11  10  11  13  Total  46  64  85  126          2019-2023  2024-2028  2029-2033  2034-2050  Buildings  14  18  22  28  Transport  3.5  6.5  10  18  Energy and networks  7  5.5  6  8  Total  24.5  30  38  54       It should be noted that some of these investments may generate significant cost savings (for example in terms of carbon-free vehicles or energy renovation). Substantial public and private investments will therefore be necessary to achieve carbon neutrality. This does not mean that new resources will need to be mobilised each time. Some of the investments to be made correspond to expenditures that would have been incurred in any case, for example to build housing and replace the vehicle fleet. The issue is that these investments contribute to the decarbonisation of the economy.
