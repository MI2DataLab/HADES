4.3. Dimension energy efficiency Poland overachieved its national energy efficiency target understood as realising by 2016 final energy savings of at least 9% of the average inland consumption of such energy in 2001-2005. Poland has seen a steady decrease in the energy intensity, and 2010 was the only year when energy intensity showed an upward trend. The decreasing primary and final energy intensity is due to the rate of energy consumption being outpaced by the GDP growth rate. In 2006-2015, the average annual rate of improvement in energy intensity exceeded 3%. When adjusted for climate conditions, the rate was slightly lower. The years 2005-2015 saw an increase in the share of the transport and service sectors in the final energy consumption, and a drop in the share of industry, households and agriculture. The share of transport grew from 22% to 28%, and that of services from 12% to 13%. Households remained the largest consumer despite a drop in their share from 35% to 31%. The share of industry declined from 26% to 24%, and that of agriculture from 8% to 5%. The above changes reflect the prevailing trends in the development of the Polish economy (e.g. rising foreign trade), as well as measures taken by the industrial sector (rationalisation of energy consumption in response to growing prices of energy carriers). The most noticeable change was observed in the transport sector, where the increased demand for energy resulted from a high growth in the volumes of both goods transport (as a result of growth in economic activity) and passenger transport (increased prosperity of the population and growing saturation of the passenger car market). The gap between Poland and the European average as regards the key energy performance indicators has decreased to a dozen or so percent, but the most efficient economies remain well ahead. 4.3.1. Primary and final energy consumption The table and figure below summarise the historical and projected primary and final energy consumption in  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  40  Poland. The data obtained show a moderate increase in demand for primary energy in the country from 95.7 Mtoe to 110.0 Mtoe in 2030 (an increase of less than 15%) and then a slight decrease to 108.1 Mtoe in 2040. On the other hand, final energy consumption increases in the period under consideration from 66.4 Mtoe to 83.2 Mtoe in 2030 and 84.9 Mtoe in 2040. The demand projections are based on the number of heating and cooling degree days as given in Tables 13 and 14. Table 31.

Final energy consumption by sector In sectoral terms, an increase in final energy demand is mainly associated with transport. A significant impact fuels, which resulted in the disclosure in national statistics of additional volumes of fuel sales and consumption, the records of which could not be kept before 2016. The rapidly growing trade and services sector is another sector where a significant increase in energy consumption is to be expected. In 2015-2030, energy consumption in this sector is expected to increase by approx. 35%. Consumption in industry and households will grow at a much slower, albeit more constant, rate (an increase of 16.8% and 14%, respectively, between 2015 and 2030). In agriculture, consumption will basically remain stable at 3.3-3.6 Mtoe. Table 32.

Final energy consumption by fuel As far as final energy consumption is concerned, gradual changes can be observed in the fuel mix. Coal consumption is falling significantly (from 18% in 2015 to approx. 13% in 2030), while the consumption of electricity, natural gas and energy from renewable sources is gradually increasing. Based on the adopted assumptions, a relatively small increase is expected in demand for district heating, which would mean the reversal of the long-term downward trend as a result of intensified efforts to promote new connections to the grid as part of anti-smog measures and support for high-efficiency cogeneration. The decrease in hard coal consumption is mainly associated with the slow but steady process of retrofitting production plants (in the industry sector), partly as a result of the operation of the ETS, which involves the switch to fuels and carriers such as gas or electricity. It will also be driven by the replacement of old, inefficient manually fed boilers in households, supported by subsidies. Moreover, the Regulation on the requirements for solid fuel boilers21, which took effect in 2017, introduced the obligation to comply with standards applicable to boilers manufactured and installed in Poland with a capacity below 500 kW. The projection assumes that all new boilers meet the criteria set forth by the Regulation. Table 33.

Non-energy use Non-energy use is the quantity of energy carriers used for the production of certain products (e.g. consumption of gas for the production of mineral fertilisers or of hard coal for the production of electrodes). The forecast assumes a moderate increase in the consumption of all energy carriers used to date for non-energy purposes in line with the observed historical trend. This increase is highly correlated with economic growth. Table 34.

Primary energy intensity The table below presents the rate of primary energy intensity to GDP. This rate is gradually decreasing throughout the considered timespan, which reflects energy efficiency improvements in the Polish economy and is to a large extent a result of the market transformation that has been progressing in the country since the 1990s. As demonstrated by comparisons, energy intensity per unit of GDP has been decreasing in Poland over the past years at a rate more than twice faster than the EU average (it dropped by approx. 30% relative to 2005). twice as high as the EU average (by approx. 89% according to EUROSAT data). This leads to a conclusion that there is still a significant untapped potential for further efficiency improvements, although it is certain that this potential is not excessively big and not easy to tap. Another point is that the energy intensity index calculated by reference to the purchasing power parity (PPP), which was only 17% higher than the EU average in 2014, would be a much better indicator.   2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Country total 292 254 207 190 167 148 130 116 Source: Own study of ARE S.A. 4.3.6.

Fuel input in electricity and heat generation The table below presents projections of the consumption of fuels for the purposes of electricity and heat generation. The 2020-2040 consumption figures are a derivative of the optimal structure of electricity and heat production and capacity in the country, as determined under the dedicated model (MESSAGE-PL) and further described in Sections 4.4.5 and 4.4.6 of this elaboration. The key conclusion that can be drawn from the obtained results is the anticipated phasing-out of coal and lignite use in the power and heating sectors, mainly due to the rising cost of CO2 emission allowances, the need to put out of service units that are usually not able to meet environmental requirements, and the generally adverse regulatory and market environment for high-carbon plants. This is done at the cost of increasing the share of fuels and technologies that are less  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  44  burdensome for the natural environment (RES, gas, nuclear power). Thanks to the introduction of a capacity factored in the model), a major decrease in the consumption of coal by the electric power sector is noticeable only after 2030. The prices of CO2 emission allowances assumed in the forecasting model in accordance with -40 EUR/tCO2, pushing coal-fired plants out of the merit order curve. However, the prices of CO2 emission allowances are a key element of uncertainty in relation to the obtained results. Table 37.

Fuel input in other conversion processes The transformation sector comprises industrial plants that use technological processes where one form of energy (usually primary energy carriers, e.g. coal) is converted into another, derivative form of energy (e.g. electricity, heat, coke, gas from technological processes, etc.). In addition to power plants, combined heat and power plants and heating plants, which are discussed in the previous section, the transformation sector includes refineries, petrochemical plants, gas works, coking plants, patent fuel plants and blast furnaces. The table below illustrates the total fuel consumption in these units. The presented data show a gradual increase in fuel consumption associated with the growing needs of the developing economy. An increase is expected in the consumption of all fuel categories defined in the table, used as fuel input in conversion processes. Table 38.

Share of cogeneration in electricity and heat production An indisputable advantage of cogeneration systems is their high energy efficiency, which significantly reduces the consumption of primary fuels, which in turn reduces emissions of CO2 and other pollutants. In cogeneration plants, most energy savings are derived from a more comprehensive use of energy supplied in the fuel thanks to the utilisation of residual heat that accompanies separate production of useful heat and electricity. Currently,  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  45  approx. 66%22 of useful heat comes from cogeneration, while the remaining portion is produced in water boilers (heating plants and heating boiler units of public power plants). Consequently, Poland has a considerable potential that can be tapped through the conversion of water boilers that do not meet the environmental requirements into cogeneration units. It is also technically possible to utilise waste heat generated by waste incineration plants, industrial installations or other installations generating waste heat. Micro-cogeneration and prosumer energy offer further opportunities. It follows from analyses, inter alia those carried out by ARE S.A., that Poland has the potential to install another 7.5 to 10 GW of cogeneration capacity2324. In the model simulations, the rate of cogeneration development in Poland is determined on the basis of projected useful heat demand, taking into account economic factors, and assuming continued support for high-efficiency cogeneration. The results of model calculations (Table 41) show the possibility of increasing the share of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration from 16.0% in 2015 to 20.5% in 2030 and 26.5% in 2040. Based on the adopted assumptions, large gas-fired CHP plants are the fastest-growing technology (their environmentally-friendly nature, the availability of fuel and competitiveness in the face of the rising prices of CO2 emission allowances are the factors weighting in favour of this solution).

Production of heat in power plants, combined heat and power plants and heating plants Projections concerning the production of heat by CHP plants are the result of cost optimisation under the MESSAGE-PL model. The production of district heating will increase, driven in particular by combined heat and power generation. Table 40.

Potential for high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling Below is an assessment of the potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient heating and cooling systems carried out in 2017 by the research team of the Warsaw University of Technology25. The potential for development of cogeneration in the country is relative to the size of demand for useful heat. The following levels of potential are distinguished in assessments: - total potential, equal to total demand for useful heat, - technical potential = the part of the total potential that can actually be used, taking into account the current technical and technological progress, - economic potential = the part of the technical potential whose actual use is economically justified.                                             22  Gospodarka paliwowo-energetyczna [Fuel and Energy Economy], GUS, Warsaw 2016. 23 Raport o stanie kogeneracji w Polsce w latach 2007-2014 [Report on the state of cogeneration in Poland in 2007-2014], ARE S.A., Warsaw 2015. 24 Kogeneracja -  [Cogeneration  yesterday, today, tomorrow], ARE S.A., Warsaw 2016. 25  Aktualizacja na rok 2017 [Analysis of the national heating and cooling potential. A 2017 update], Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw 2017.  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  46  According to another criterion, the total potential is divided into: - potential already used = the part of the useful heat which is currently generated by cogeneration units, - additional potential = the part of the useful heat which is currently generated by other techniques. Poland's current total annual demand for useful heat (total cogeneration potential) is estimated at 973 PJ (weather fluctuations may cause upward or downward changes in annual demand by 10%), of which: - 256 PJ is the heat obtained by all sectors from district heating networks; - 402 PJ are the needs of the household sector, met from own sources  currently from solid fuels (approx. 70%), natural gas (approx. 25%) and other sources (approx. 5%), including liquid fuels and electric heating; this represents a total additional potential for the application of cogeneration in this sector; - 315 PJs are the needs of economic sectors (industry, services, agriculture), met from own sources  largely industrial plants' own cogeneration units. The additional potential is relatively small; in particular, approx. 60 PJ of heat is recovered from industry and coking plants, which is a very cheap form of waste heat generation. In technical terms, the cogeneration technologies are currently available over a complete power range from several kilowatts (small residential houses) to hundreds of kilowatts (large thermal power plants). For this reason, the technical potential of cogeneration is taken to be the country's total annual useful heat demand, less only heat recovery in industry and coking plants, as it would be pointless to replace recovery with any  60 = 913 PJ. The additional economic potential, i.e. the amount of useful heat which is not currently produced by cogeneration, yet which is considered, after a detailed analysis, to be economically justified, is the relevant category for a realistic planning of future cogeneration developments. In practice, the development of cogeneration will be conditional on tapping the additional technical potential, which is 191 PJ (after adjustments). The technical potential is adjusted by subtracting two categories of heat produced without cogeneration that form part of the additional technical potential: - heat generated in CHP plants outside the cogeneration process (56 PJ), since this heat is usually only generated in periods of very low air temperatures and the time span for use of the heating capacity is very short; - heat generated from biomass (11 PJ). The additional economic potential of cogeneration development was calculated on the basis of an economic analysis of the effects of implementing cogeneration instead of separate electricity and heat generation. The effectiveness of cogeneration investments was assessed using the sum of discounted cash flows (NPV). External costs of electricity and heat generation, i.e. social costs not passed on to prices of energy carriers, were also factored in. The calculations were carried out for the following technologies, which are considered to be representative for the future development of cogeneration: - technologies for large and medium- o 50 MW steam-gas unit, o 100 MW steam unit with a fluidised bed boiler, - te o 5 MW gas turbine, o 5 MW steam power unit, o 5 MW gas engine, - micro-cogeneration technologies (capacity < 1 MW): o 0.5 MW gas engine, o 0.3 MW gas turbine. The results concerning the additional economic potential indicate that cogeneration investments are socially viable (NPV > 0) with relatively short periods of capacity use (even less than 2,700 hours per year). For the purposes of rationalising profitability, the typical periods of use of the installed capacity were adopted: 4,600 hours per year for CHP plants generating heat for heating buildings and hot water and 6,000 hours per year for industrial CHP plants. The total additional economic potential for CHP is estimated at 185 PJ, a negligible difference compared to the adjusted additional technical potential of 191 PJ. To fully exploit this potential, cogeneration units would need to be built with a total electrical capacity of 10,243 MW and a total thermal capacity of 11,112 MW. They would  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  47  produce 185 PJ of heat and 47 TWh of electricity per year, which would save 253 PJ of primary energy and reduce CO2 emissions by 26 million tonnes per year. The total capital expenditure on the construction of cogeneration units meeting these characteristics would amount to PLN 41.5 billion. The conducted analysis also enabled recommending specific cogeneration technologies that are the most cost-effective at current price ratios: - for large district heating systems  gas/steam systems or coal-fired steam blocks, - for smaller systems  internal combustion engines or gas turbines, - for residential micro-cogeneration systems  microturbines, internal combustion engines or Stirling engines. In addition to heat from cogeneration, the production of district cooling is also assessed as a promising prospect from an energy efficiency point of view. Existing air conditioning units are usually local and powered by electricity, whereas the centralised distribution of cooling energy is rare or at the testing stage in Poland. In this respect, the situation of air-conditioned buildings is similar to that of buildings heated by their own thermal energy sources. The total national potential for the production of cooling energy, limited to its primary application, i.e. the services sector, is estimated at 19 PJ, which is twice as low as the heating needs of buildings in this sector. Tables 43-45 show the current state of application of high-efficiency cogeneration in Poland in three aspects: the production volume in organisational terms, the production volume in technical terms as set out in Article 9l of the Energy Law, and the contribution of the production volume to total inland production.

There are three main factors influencing the production volume in each year: (1) a long-term decreasing trend in heat demand associated with thermal modernisation of buildings and rationalisation of heating, (2) weather conditions in heating seasons, causing deviations from the trend (3) operation of the cogeneration support system. Steam condensing extraction turbines are the predominant cogeneration technology in Poland, although back-pressure steam turbines, combined cycle gas turbines and internal combustion engines are also used. There are also gas turbines with heat recovery and organic Rankine cycles, but their market share does not exceed 1%. 4.3.12. Cost-optimal minimum requirements for energy performance As buildings account for nearly 40% of final energy consumption and almost 36% of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union, they are essential for the Union's policy on improving energy efficiency, in particular with regard to meeting the long-term objectives of the European framework for climate and energy policy from 2020 to 2030 and beyond. Directive 2010/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 promotes the improvement of the energy performance of buildings requires Member States to calculate cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements using a comparative methodology and relevant parameters, such as climatic conditions and the practical accessibility of energy infrastructure. Cost-optimal level is defined in Article 2(14) of the Directive and means the energy performance of the building (expressed in kWh/m2 of primary energy) which leads to the lowest cost over the estimated economic lifecycle (30 years for residential buildings and 20 years for non-residential buildings). The lowest cost is determined taking into account energy-related investment costs, maintenance and operating costs (including energy costs and savings, the category of building concerned, earnings from energy produced, where applicable), and disposal costs, where applicable. The estimated economic lifecycle is determined by each Member State and refers to the remaining estimated economic lifecycle of a building. In Poland, cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements are set out in the Regulation of the Minister for Infrastructure of 12 April 2002 regarding the technical conditions to be met by buildings and their location (Journal of Laws 2015, item 1422). The above regulation requires that the building and its installations (heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, hot water and, in the case of public buildings, collective housing, production, commercial and storage buildings, also built-in lighting) should be designed and constructed in such a way as to meet the minimum values of the measures the annual calculated demand for non-renewable primary energy for heating, ventilation, cooling, sanitary hot water preparation, and in the case of public buildings, collective housing, production, commercial and storage buildings, also for built-in lighting public, calculated according to the provisions establishing the methodology for calculating the energy performance of buildings. Partitions and technical equipment of the building should meet at least the thermal insulation requirements specified in Annex 2 to the above-mentioned regulation. Similarly, the surface of windows, balcony doors and external doors should comply with the values of the heat transfer coefficient set out in Annex 2. The graphs below compare the cost-optimal levels reported by countries with the minimum energy performance requirements for major renovations of existing buildings, new buildings and building elements. The minimum energy performance requirements for existing/renovated buildings were set no more than 15% above the cost-optimal level in the case of 9 countries. In Poland, the average gap was significantly above the 15% threshold. In the case of new buildings, the minimum performance requirements were set no more than 15% above the cost-optimal level in 13 cases. In this case, Poland was slightly above the 15% threshold.  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  49  As regards the replacement of building elements (e.g. wall, roof, floor, window), the minimum performance requirements were set no more than 15% above the cost-optimal level in 11 countries (out of 22). In Poland, the average gap in relation to replacement of building elements was above the 15% threshold (nearly 40%).  Figure 21.

Average gap between minimum energy performance requirements and cost-optimal levels: replacement of building elements Some of the provisions of the above-mentioned directive were transposed to the national legislation by the Act of 29 August 2014 on energy performance of buildings (Journal of Laws, item 1200 and of 2015, item 151). Article 39(3) of the Act was the basis for the preparation of the National Plan to increase the number of low energy consuming buildings. The National Plan includes, in particular, a definition of low-energy buildings and their specific characteristics; government measures to promote low-energy buildings, including the design, construction and conversion of buildings in a manner ensuring energy efficiency, and to increase the uptake of renewable energy in new and existing buildings; as well as a timetable for achieving the targets. The establishment of the National Plan is linked to the pursuit of the headline target set out in Article 9(1) of Directive 2010/31/EU, which provides that: - all new buildings are to be nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2020, - new buildings occupied and owned by public authorities are to be nearly zero-energy buildings after 31 December 2018. The most important element of the National Plan is to define low energy consuming buildings in Poland, taking into account the condition of existing buildings and the viable and economically justified measures for energy efficiency improvement. The Ministry of Infrastructure and Construction periodically reviews the legislation specifying the minimum energy performance requirements for buildings. The reviews are carried out on the basis of, amongst others, expert opinions from the Institute of Building Technology and the Krakow University of Technology, as well as inputs from construction market actors
