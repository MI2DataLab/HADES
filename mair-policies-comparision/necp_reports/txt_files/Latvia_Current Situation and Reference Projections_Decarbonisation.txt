2.2.1.2. Current situation in reducing emissions from ETS and non-ETS activities In 2017, GHG emissions from non-ETS activities dominated total GHG emissions, accounting for  81.9 %43. The estimated share of GHG emissions from non-ETS activities total GHG emissions in 2018 was smaller at 77.8 %. The amount of GHG emissions produced by ETS operators in Latvia was already 2049.8 kt of CO2 eq. in 2017 and 2612.6 kt of CO2 eq. in 2018, or 18.1 % and 22.1 % of total GHG emissions respectively.                                                        43 Non-ETS activities subject to Decision 406/2009/EC.  Calculation of GHG emissions was done using the EC formula  total GHG emissions minus amount of CO2 emissions verified by EU ETS operators minus local aviation CO2 emissions.   29  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 Figure 6.

Key to fig 6 is missing and should read: Transport, Other non-ETS energy Agriculture ETS energy Non-ETS activity Households Non-ETS industrial processes and use of chemical substances Waste management Non-ETS industrial processes  The development of GHG emissions from non-ETS activities suggests an 8.4 %  increase in emissions between  2005 and 2017 and a 7.38 % increase between 2005 and 2018. Compared with 2005, ETS operators in Latvia reduced their GHG emissions by 28.19 % in 2017 and by 6.7 % by 2018.

Current situation in ensuring CO2 removals According to 2006 IPCC Guidelines, the LULUFC category is divided into six land use categories: forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, and other land. The                                                       44 GHG emissions were calculated using the EC formula  total GHG emissions of the state minus amount of carbon dioxide emissions verified by EU ETS operators minus local aviation carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with 406/2009/EC. 30  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 LULUFC sector in Latvia includes emissions and CO2 removals from the categories mentioned above divided into smaller sub-categories: lands that have not changed their type of land use in the last 20 years and lands that have changed their type of land use in the last 20 considerable amount of organic carbon, therefore emissions from these types of land are not reported. The LULUFC sector also includes emissions from wood products. According to the 2019 GHG inventory, the LULUFC sector overall was not a source of GHG emissions in 2017 (CO2 removals were bigger than the amount of GHG produced in the entire sector), with total CO2 removals of the LULUFC sector in 2017 amounting to  -1706.8 kt of CO2 eq., compared with -9828.9 kt of CO2 eq. in 1990. The reduction of CO2 removals is related to increased logging, larger amount of deadwood, and smaller increase of living biomass in forest lands, which is determined according to the data of the National Forest 2 removals fell by 82.63 % in the period from 1990 to 2017. The reduction in CO2 removals in the LULUCF sector is related to increased logging (more than twofold) due to forest age structure and the increase in the share of grown and overgrown forest changes. Transformation of forest lands into residential areas and the transformation of naturally afforested lands into croplands and grasslands by returning them into agricultural management also contributes significantly to increased GHG emissions.  Figure 7. Actual GHG emissions and net CO2 removals of the Latvian LULUCF sector 19902017 (kt of CO2 eq.) Change of land use to arable land relates mainly to removing wood biomass from naturally afforested agricultural land where agricultural activity was suspended in 1980s and 1990s. The increase of living biomass in forest land that does not change its type of land use and in afforested land is still bigger than carbon losses due to commercial logging and natural formation of deadwood, so the total stock of living biomass in forest land  continues to grow. Forest management and use of forest products is an important contribution to implementing the climate policy of Latvia and meeting international GHG emission reduction commitments of Latvia, and promotes the use of local energy sources that are more efficient and better for the environment.  31  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 2.2.1.4. Indicative development projections 45 It is estimated in the baseline scenario that the amount of GHG emissions from non-ETS activities will decrease to 75 % of the total amount of GHG emissions by 2030. The total amount of GHG emissions from non-ETS activities is estimated to fall by 7 % between 2005 and 2030. In 2030, most emissions are expected to come from transport (32 %), agriculture (39 %) and non-ETS energy (including industry, services, households, agriculture, forestry, 22 %).  Figure 8. Indicative projections of non-ETS GHG emissions in Latvia until 203046 (kt CO2 eq.) Key should read: Waste management Agriculture Non-ETS industrial processes and product use Transport Non-ETS energy According to the baseline scenario projections, the amount of GHG emissions from non-ETS sectors in 2030 will be 7944 kt of CO2 eq., which is 94 kt of CO2 eq. or 1.1 % less than the indicative GHG target for 2030 (8038 kt of CO2 eq.).                                                        45 development projections are indicative and may change 46 Calculations of GHG emissions made by MoEPRD  32  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00  Missing key should read: Forecase non-ETS emissions    Indicative annual targets Figure 9. Actual GHG emissions from non-ETS activities (until 2018) and indicative projections of GHG emissions47 Total GHG emission projections of the energy sector in the baseline scenario provide for continuation of the initiated measures of the existing policy (RES policy and energy efficiency policy) until 2030.  The reduction of GHG emissions in the sector is mostly affected by replacement of fossil fuel with biomass in district heating, as well as the implementation of energy efficiency measures (mainly renovation of residential and public buildings) in households and the services sector. These energy efficiency measures for GHG emissions in the combined households, commercial and public sectors may fall by 135 kt CO2 eq, by 2030 compared with 2017. Transitioning from fossil fuel to the use of biomass in the energy transformation sector, mainly in district heating, will reduce emissions by about 80 kt CO2 eq. by 2030, compared to 2017. At the same time, no measures for wider use of RES are provided for in electricity generation.  The main source of GHG emissions in the transport sector is road transport with approximately 90 % of the total emissions from the sector. Although it is predicted that mobility rates (passenger turnover and freight turnover) will increase by 2030, fuel consumption will decrease due to the replacement of passenger cars used in Latvia with more efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles. Reduction of GHG emissions in addition to the improvement of average fuel consumption in internal combustion cars is also related to wider use of alternative (natural gas and EV) and RES fuels (biofuel and biogas). In addition, provision is also made for a reduction in GHG emissions in the transport sector under the railway electrification project. The total reduction in GHG emissions in the transport sector estimated for 2030 is approximately 793 kt CO2 eq. compared to 2017. ETS emissions of the Energy sector are estimated to fall by approximately 595 kt CO2 eq. or 22.7 % in 2030 compared to 2005, but non-ETS emissions will fall by approximately 1167 kt CO2 eq. or 21.5 %.                                                       47 MoEPRD 33  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 Total GHG emissions in the agricultural sectors are expected to increase in the period from 2020 to 2030. In 2030, total GHG emissions of the agricultural sector will increase by 30.1 % (718 kt CO2 eq.) and 11.5 % (320 kt CO2 eq.), compared with the emissions of 2005 and 2017, respectively. A considerable increase in emissions in 2030 is expected in the farm animal enteric fermentation processes and agricultural soil sectors. In 2030, emissions from soil-based agriculture will constitute 58.9 % of total emissions of the agricultural sector, and 32.5 % in enteric fermentation. CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation will increase by 16.2 % in 2030, compared to 2017. The population of ruminant livestock is an important parameter affecting enteric fermentation CH4 emissions. The population of cattle generates over 90 % of CH4 emissions in enteric fermentation sectors. The number of dairy cows in 2030 will increase by 0.8 % compared to 2017. Projections also show an increase in the number of cattle by 28.7 % in 2030 compared to 2017, which will also promote an increase in enteric fermentation CH4 emissions. Projections show that manure management CH4 emissions will increase by 36.9 % in 2030 compared to 2017. Most of the working data for calculating CH4 emissions from manure management come from the population of livestock (cattle, pigs and poultry in the main), and the widespread animal manure management system. The concentration of farmed animals in large holdings prioritising urine or liquid manure management systems will increase emissions, because CH4 emission factors in manure management sector are higher in liquid fertilizer systems compared to a solid manure storage or anaerobically processed manure. In 2030, agricultural soils will account for 95.1 % of agricultural N2O emissions. Primary activity data for the calculation of estimated N2O emissions from agricultural soils, include amounts of unused inorganic and organic nitrogen fertilisers, areas of agricultural crops, as well as area of cultivated organic soils. Whilst the calculated amounts of synthetic nitrogen fertiliser relate to the scheduled increase in areas under cereal, organic farming will decrease. In the waste management sector, non-ETS GHG emissions gradually reduce from 565 kt CO2 eq. in 2017 to 326 kt CO2 eq. in 2030.  Disposal of solid waste is the largest source of GHG emission in the waste management sector, accounting for71.4 % of the total GHG emissions in the sector in 2017. However, the share of the sector of solid waste disposal is expected to generate 44.4 % of GHG emissions in the baseline scenario of the waste management sector in 2030. The fall in emissions from waste disposal will ensure a reduction in the amount of waste disposed with a corresponding increase in waste treatment (including composting). The wastewater treatment sector is the source of CH4 and N2O emissions. In accordance with the calculated projections, GHG emissions from the wastewater treatment sector will increase from 113 (in 2017) to 122 kt CO2 eq. (in 2030). The changes in GHG emissions in the wastewater sector are based on macroeconomic forecasts. The contribution of this sector to the waste management sector is expected to increase from 20.0 % in 2017 to 37.3 % in 2030. In 2030, in the sector of solid waste disposal, emissions are expected to fall by 61.9 % and 64.1 % compared with the period 2005-2017. Although a considerable reduction is also expected in the wastewater management sector (some 43.1 % down on) 2005, emissions would increase by 7.7 % in 2030 compared with 2017. 34  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 2.2.2. Renewable energy 2.2.2.1. The existing situation in the use of renewable energy The total consumption of RES in Latvia was approximately 77 PJ in 2018, which is an increase of 25.6 % compared to 2005. The total consumption of wood fuel has increased by 27 % since 2005 and has reached 62.6 PJ in 2018. Wood fuel (firewood, wood residues, woodchips, wood briquettes, wood pellets) is the most widely used RES, and its consumption continues to increase every year reaching 80.4 % of the total RES consumption in 2018. From 2017 to 2018, there was a significant increase in consumption of biofuel  by 198.6 %, as well as solar energy and municipal waste (their RES share). In 2018, Latvia produced 6725 GWh of electricity, 3499 GWh of which was renewable energy, with the share of renewable energy produced decreasing by 35.9 % compared to 2017. Last year, cogeneration plants produced 4170 TWh of electricity, 22.6 % of which were produced from RES (gaseous biomass (biogas) and solid biomass cogeneration plants). Electricity produced at solid biomass power plants and cogeneration plants increased from 319 to 570 GWh and at gaseous biomass (biogas) cogeneration stations  from 350 to 374 GWh over five years. In 2018, generated primary electricity fell by 43.6 % compared to 2017, with HPPs falling by 44.5 % and WPPs by 18.7 %. Last year, HPPs produced 2432 GWh and WPPs produced 122 GWh. The decrease in electricity production last year was most affected by the low output of HPPs, which is explained by the unusually dry and long summer period with low levels of water in water bodies and a low inflow of water into the Daugava.

The use of RES in transport has increased 2.5 times compared with 2005 and consumption peaked in 2018  an increase of 6 % compared with 2010. There is a legal requirement as of 1 October 2009 to add 5 % of biofuel to fossil fuels. 95 RON petrol can be sold only with bioethanol in the amount of 4.55 % vol. of the total volume of petrol, but this requirement does not apply to kerosene for aviation , or to 98 RON petrol.

Fulfilment of the 2020 target of the share of RE of Latvia The share of RE in the total final energy consumption was 39 % in 2017, an increase of 20.9 % over 2005. Considering the reduction of the total final energy consumption, the share of RE remained above the indicative curve for reaching the 2020 target.

Share of RE in the final energy consumption of Latvia in total and by sector and fulfilment of the RE target and the indicative development curve of RE (20052017)52 With regard to the sectoral goals of RE share it can be concluded that in 2017 Latvia has exceeded the indicative development curves of RE share in district heating and cooling and the RE share in electricity defined in REAPRL53, whilst in 2017 Latvia had already exceeded the RE share target for 2020 for district heating and cooling defined in the REAPRL plan for 2020, though Latvia needs to increase this share by another 5.5 percentage points to reach the RE share in electricity for 2020. However, in order to meet the EU target for the share of RE in transport, Latvia has to increase the share by another 7.5 percentage points. Progress in the fulfilment of targets for energy produced from RES for Latvia is assessed every two years pursuant to Article 22(1) of Directive 2009/28/EC54 by preparing a report about the progress in the fulfilment of EC targets55.  2.2.2.3. Indicative development projections  The baseline scenario predicts that, considering the current policy, the existing support for producing electricity from RES is gradually decreasing. Under this condition and assumptions about the prices of fossil energy and costs of technologies (using RES and fossil fuels) up to 2030, the share of RES estimated in the baseline scenario will have fallen well short of 40%, at just 37% in 2030.                                                        52 CSB, EUROSTAT 53 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/dir_2009_0028_action_plan_latvia.zip  54 Directive 2009/28/EC 55 https://www.em.gov.lv/files/nozares_politika/EMZino_AER_030518.pdf.  38  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00  Figure 14. Share of RE in the final energy consumption (right axis  %) and indicative development projections of the share of RE until 2030 (left axis  PJ)56 Taking into account existing policies and implementation measures, and as yet undetermined policy with regard to the promotion of the use of RES, projections in the baseline scenario suggest that the total RES share in the Latvian energy balance in 2020 has been reached.   Figure 15. Indicative development projections of the division of the share of RE until 203057 (%) According to the baseline scenario, after 2020 there will be a minimal increase of contributions of RE in electricity and transport towards the overall RE target, but the contribution of RES in LH will increase considerably, while the contribution of RE in LH and individual heating will decrease. The reason for this trend is that the share of RE in LH and the share of individual heating mainly depends on the consumption of biomass and other                                                       56 IPE 57 IPE 39  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 types of RES by households, services, and industry. Final energy consumption in households and in the services sector reduces according to the baseline scenario, so the contribution of the share in the total consumption of RE also falls.
