3.1 Decarbonisation dimension 3.1.1 Greenhouse gas emissions and removals i. Greenhouse gas emission reduction target, ESR and LULUCF As already mentioned, the greenhouse gas emission target of 49% by 2030 compared with 1990, proposed in the Coalition Agreement, means a reduction of approximately 49 Mton of CO2 equivalents by 2030 compared with an unchanged policy. This includes the effects of the circular economy policy. The Climate Agreement used an indicative allocation of CO2 targets to the five sectors: (i) electricity, (ii) industry, (iii) mobility, (iv) built-up environment, (v) agriculture and land use. The main policy measures are outlined below for each sector. Electricity The policy primarily focuses on replacing generation from fossil fuels with generation from renewable sources. The following instruments contribute to this:  From 2030, the use of coal to generate electricity will be prohibited by law. The bill offers companies the option of switching to alternative fuels.  In addition to the ETS, the Netherlands is introducing a national and gradually increasing minimum price for CO2 emissions in electricity generation. This minimum price contributes to increased sustainability and investment security.  The SDE++ is available up to and including 2025 for grants for renewable energy projects. It is expected that renewable electricity can be achieved without grants after 2025. Energy savings will be encouraged based on the Ecodesign directive, the Environmental Management Act (Wet Milieubeheer) and, for example, the Energy Investment Allowance (EIA). The following policies and measures will be applied: (a) Encouraging offshore wind energy up to 49 TWh in 2030 We see great potential for offshore wind energy in reaching the 2030 and 2050 climate targets. The target for 2030 is circa 49 TWh. To this end, central government will take the plot decisions, carry out preliminary research, issue the licence and tenders and instruct TenneT to construct the offshore network (as long as wind farms are electrically accessible). In order to carefully integrate this into the current use of the Dutch part of the North Sea, agreements will be made in a North Sea agreement. (b) Encouraging renewable energy on land up to 35 TWh in 2030 The basic principle is that in 2025, an SDE++- grant is requested for 35 TWh for solar power and wind energy on land. Together, the provinces, municipalities and water boards will ensure that all requested permits will be issued no later than 1 January 2025, with a view to the timely achievement of the task. (c) Encouraging small-scale renewable generation up to circa10 TWh in 2030 Small-scale renewable generation of electricity, such as solar power generation by private homeowners, represents a third policy. The current net-metering scheme for solar PV will be converted and phased out leading up to 2030, because the price of solar PV is decreasing.  (d) Safeguarding the security of supply Stimulating renewable electricity could have an effect on the level of security of supply. The energy supply is becoming   increasingly dependent on weather conditions. The growth in the share of intermittent sources will result in an increase in the demand for flexibility on the market. Flexibility in the form of demand response, storage or adjustable capacity is interwoven in the electricity market and is traded across the various markets without flexibility being a clearly identifiable factor.80 Although the electricity market is adequately equipped to achieve the required flexibility, it is important to continue to properly monitor the development of flexibility, including adjustable power. The annual monitoring of supply security is being fine-tuned by TenneT for this purpose. Industry Energy-intensive industry is largely covered by the EU emissions trading system (ETS). In addition, the following national instruments will be used: (a) Amendment to the Environmental Management Act (Wet Milieubeheer) The Environmental Management Act (Wet Milieubeheer) will be amended. The Environmental Management Act (Wet Milieubeheer) currently stipulates that companies must take energy-saving measures that can be recouped in five years or less. In updating the Environmental Management Act (Wet Milieubeheer), the government is focusing on an integrated climate approach, in which both energy-saving measures and sustainable energy generation are possible. (b) National CO2 tax A national CO2 tax will be introduced from 2021 to ensure that a 14.3 Mton reduction in emissions compared with the base path is achieved in 2030 and that a reduction of 14.3 Mton is achieved. This is an objective CO2 tax established by the government on the basis of verifiable criteria that is fully in line with the European ETS benchmarks already applied by the NEa. In 2020 and 2025, when the new European ETS benchmarks become available, the government will again ask the PBL to review the required level of the CO2 tax in an objective and verifiable manner, within the established preconditions. The purpose of the tax is not to generate revenue, but to encourage companies to make investments in the Netherlands. If the tax does generate revenue, the latter will be used by channelling it back into greening industry. (c) Grant for CO2-reducing measures The roll-out of CO2-reducing measures will be supported using the SDE++. To ensure that the deployment of CCS does not happen at the expense of techniques required for the long-term transition, the SDE++ grant for CCS is limited to techniques, processes and sectors without a cost-effective alternative and there is a ceiling for subsidising industrial CCS of 7.2 Mton. From 2035 onwards, no new SDE++ rounds will be issued for CCS applications (excluding negative emissions). The share that companies contribute to the Surcharge for Sustainable Energy (ODE) will be increased from 1/2 to 2/3 by 2020. This increase applies to large consumers, including those in industry. The other 1/3 will be funded by households. Mobility The policy aimed at accelerating and supporting the increased sustainability of the mobility system is structured along the following lines: (a) Stimulating the use of sustainable energy carriers Based on European guidelines81, biofuels are blended. In addition, a Hydrogen Agreement will be concluded (as well as various green deals that have already been agreed) and (via the SDE++) efforts are being made to increase the production and use of sustainable advanced biofuels and renewable synthetic fuels to achieve cost-effective CO2 reductions.  (b) The stimulation of electric transport (including passenger transport) aimed at 100% emission-free new sales of passenger cars in 2030 Based on European standards82 there is already an incentive to electrify part of the fleet. To accelerate this at the national level, a package of measures is being implemented to encourage the purchase and use of electric cars. There is a specific focus on the second-hand market for electric vehicles. Since an alternative structure of car taxation will be necessary in the                                                  80 Energy Agenda - Parliamentary document 31 510 no. 64. 81 The Fuel Quality Directive and Renewable Energy Directive (RED and RED II) 82 CO2 standards for passenger cars and light utility vans 2020/2025/2030, CO2 standards for freight transport Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    long term, the government will investigate three variants of payment, outline the necessary preparations and, where possible or necessary, make these preparations for the next government. This includes the aspect of the desired stimulation of EV, in line with the government's aim for 100% new sales by 2030. In addition, the National Agenda for Charging Infrastructure will be implemented, which aims to provide national coverage of charging points and fast charging points for electric passenger cars. To this end, efforts are being made, for example, to accelerate the roll-out of charging infrastructure and with regard to innovations with the aim of making electric charging as easy as charging your phone. (c) Reducing the kilometres travelled for business (including by car) by 8 billion by 2030 As more than half of the total kilometres driven in the Netherlands are work-related, employers play a major role in making mobility more sustainable. In the Climate Agreement (2019) it was agreed that at least 1,000 employers would commit before 2030 to at least a 50% CO2 reduction of business mobility in 2030 compared to 2016. We are also aiming for 200,000 extra bicycle commuters. From the beginning of 2022, there will be standardisation in legislation for employers with more than 100 employees. Furthermore, various measures are aimed at making alternatives (such as bicycles and public transport) more appealing compared to cars, for example by making co-financing available to increase the number of bicycle parking facilities at train stations. In the long term, work is under way on the transformation of the Infrastructure Fund, so that mobility rather than modality is central when considering investments. (d) Making logistics more sustainable Apart from sustainable energy carriers, other approaches are also being pursued to accelerate the transition to emission-free logistics. For example, a tax for freight traffic will be introduced from 2023. With regard to urban logistics, agreements have been made in the Climate Agreement about the establishment of medium-sized zero-emission zones in 30 to 40 larger municipalities in 2025. In addition, the Climate Agreement contains agreements about emission-free construction traffic. The government will pay special attention to climate neutrality and circularity when it comes to tenders for earthworks and waterworks (GWW). To make water-related logistics (inland waterways shipping) more sustainable, agreements have been made with the sector in a green deal. (e) National policy for the shipping and aviation sectors Shipping and aviation are international sectors: this means the solution for emissions in these sectors lies primarily in an international approach. Therefore, the Netherlands strives for measures at least at the European level. However, the Netherlands will take national measures as long as this has not yet been achieved. For example, a flight tax will be introduced on 1 January 2021. Agreements have been made in the Green Deal on Maritime Shipping, Inland Waterways Shipping and Ports and in the sustainable aviation platform about increasing the sustainability of (national) shipping and aviation. Built-up environment Policy for the built-up environment sector follows the broad lines described below: (a) Sliding-scale energy taxation (b) Funding (c) Making homes more sustainable (d) Making non-residential buildings more sustainable (e) Sufficient renewable heat supply. See 3.2i Agriculture and land use National policy aimed at reducing CO2 emissions and CO2 equivalents is structured according to the following four broad lines. When developing policy, European directives, such as the Birds and Habitats Directives, influence the way in which nature (including conservation), landscape and biodiversity are managed in the Netherlands. This can have both positive and negative consequences for climate policy. The future Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the European agricultural policy that focuses on supporting and making the agricultural sector more sustainable, is expected to make climate one of the priorities. The CAP can subsequently be used to promote climate activities in the agriculture and land use sector.     (a) Reducing emissions in livestock farming The main focus in reducing emissions in livestock farming is the source: the emissions produced by the animals and emissions produced by manure, including from cows, calves, chickens and pigs. Manure is responsible for the emission of the powerful greenhouse gas methane. Reducing these emissions also helps limit odour nuisance and the emission of ammonia and particulate matter. Therefore, in the Climate Agreement the sector has made agreements about optimising animal feed and improving manure processing and storage methods. To promote this, via the SDE+, the subsidy scheme for the generation of sustainable energy, mono-manure fermentation may also be eligible for subsidy, whereby the reduction of greenhouse gases will also be included in the assessment. In addition to an integrated approach to methane and ammonia through feed and animal-oriented measures, farmers will also take the necessary measures at the housing level, such as using low-emission housing systems. Central government will facilitate entrepreneurs in this endeavour. In addition, central government supports entrepreneurs who want to stop pig farming, with "thermal remediation". This will lead to a decrease in the number of pigs in the Netherlands. (b) Emission reduction and CO2 storage through smart land use CO2 is released from peat meadow areas as a result of oxidation. Pilots using an area-based approach, including raising the water level in these areas, should demonstrate whether this can reduce these emissions. On the basis of the results of the research, the optimal mix of measures is determined for each area. Afforestation and the prevention of deforestation can help capture CO2 from the air. Therefore, the Climate Agreement also contains agreements on expanding the natural areas and restoring landscape structures in the Netherlands, limiting deforestation and planting new trees. Carbon capture can also be increased through the smart and sustainable use of agricultural soils. Central government is focusing on the sustainable management of all Dutch agricultural soils in 2030. (c) Food consumption and food waste Food consumption and food waste both indirectly contribute to CO2 emissions. This is why companies and organisations have made agreements in the Climate Agreement  about how they will reduce waste in the chain and help consumers throw away less food. In the Climate Agreement it was also agreed that the parties will strive to achieve a good balance between sustainable, healthy, safe and affordable food, and a healthy balance between animal and vegetable proteins in our diet. (d) Making greenhouse horticulture more sustainable See 3.2i ii. Regional cooperation in this field See Chapter 1.3 iii. Applicability of the rules on state aid, funding measures in this field at the national level, including support from the European Union and the use of EU funds The provision of state aid is established by the conditions of the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER; reference: Commission Regulation (EU) No. 651/2014 of 17 June 2014 declaring certain categories of aid compatible with the internal market in application of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty). In cases where this is not possible, for example because a scheme or individual state aid decision crosses a GBER threshold due to the amount of aid or the size of the project, the proposed aid will be assessed by the European Commission in relation to the applicable guidelines, frameworks or decisions, of which - for climate and energy measures - the Guidelines for state aid for environmental protection and energy 2014-2020 (2014/C 200/01) and the framework for state aid for research, development and innovation (OJ C 323, 30.12.2006) , p. 1.) are the most important.  3.1.2 Renewable energy i. Policies and measures to achieve the national contribution to the binding EU target of at least 32% renewable energy by 2030 Expected share of renewable energy The Netherlands is focusing on achieving 27% as a contribution to the European target in the field of renewable energy. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    Policies The following policies will be applied:  Encouraging offshore wind energy up to 49 TWh in 2030  Encouraging renewable energy on land up to 35 TWh in 2030  Encouraging small-scale renewable generation up to circa 10 TWh in 2030 See Chapter 3.1.1 Electricity ii. Specific measures for regional cooperation See Chapter 1.4 iii. Specific measures on financial support for promoting the generation and use of energy from renewable sources in electricity, heating and cooling, and transport Incentive schemes for renewable energy The Netherlands has various mechanisms to stimulate renewable energy. Some key schemes include: The Sustainable Energy Production Incentive Scheme (SDE+):  The SDE+ is currently the most important instrument for stimulating the generation of renewable energy. This subsidy instrument contains a number of characteristics, which mean the scheme works effectively in accordance with international standards. This concerns the characteristics of technology neutrality, mutual competition and multi-annual security for investors.  In line with the coalition agreement, the SDE+ is being extended in the SDE++, so that other CO2 reducing techniques are eligible for a grant, in addition to sustainable energy. This also applies in principle to greenhouse gases other than CO2, such as methane. The positive elements of the current SDE+ will be retained and it will be possible to achieve the climate target in 2030 cost-effectively.  In the SDE++, the 49% CO2 reduction target by 2030 and cost effectiveness to achieve this goal are key. Therefore, the SDE++ focuses on emission reduction on Dutch territory. The SDE++ will encourage the roll-out of market-ready and relatively large-scale CO2 reducing techniques by covering the unprofitable top margin of these technologies by means of an operating grant.  Despite the expansion, it is expected that sufficient grant resources will be available to achieve the renewable energy targets. This will also be monitored. Renewable Energy Scheme (HER): The aim of the HER is to achieve the energy targets for 2030 in a more cost-effective manner through innovative projects. Renewable energy projects should lead to renewable energy generation by 2030 and to savings on future expenditure on grants under the SDE+ scheme. These savings must be greater than the subsidy that is requested for the project. Climate and Energy Innovation Demonstration Scheme (DEI+): The DEI+ is aimed at supporting pilot and demonstration projects that contribute to the cost-effective reduction of CO2 emissions by 2030. The scheme (with budget from the 2019 climate envelope and the Urgenda package of measures) has recently been expanded from DEI to DEI+ to also be able to support climate and circular projects. In addition to national public and private funding, it may be relevant to use aid provided by the European Union and/or EU funds to further encourage the generation of renewable energy. European resources are however considered for individual projects. These include funds such as the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and Horizon 2020. iv. Assessing support for electricity from renewable sources The Netherlands regularly evaluates the relevant support mechanisms aimed at boosting renewable energy generation, including electricity. The largest incentive scheme (SDE+) was evaluated in 2016. This scheme is currently being   expanded to the SDE++. The new scheme, which will take effect from 2020, stimulates renewable energy generation as well as other techniques that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These adjustments to the scheme are being discussed in detail with the European Commission (DG Competition). The expanded scheme will be evaluated again after several years. Each year there is an independent consultation process related to the categories of technologies, levels of stimulation grants and their effectiveness: the extent to which projects have actually been implemented. This independent consultation process also involves an extensive market consultation. In addition parliament is informed twice a year on the outcome of the applications and the projects that were funded, including the cost impacts of those projects. This demonstrates the distributional effects (what the grant is spent on) of the returns provided by the incentive. The distributional effects are regularly mapped out and evaluated. The next evaluation will be carried out in 2020 or 2021. v. Specific measures for introducing one or more contact points, streamlining administrative procedures, providing information and training, and promoting the use of purchase agreements for power Specific measures arising from the revised Renewable Energy Directive. They must be implemented by 30 June 2021 at the latest. The Netherlands does not currently have a specific policy for this, but will review the policy changes the relevant articles require in good time. vi. Summary of the policies and measures to develop renewable self-consumption and promote renewable energy communities The Netherlands currently encourages renewable self-consumption through a fiscal measure for solar panels among small consumers. In addition to a VAT reimbursement on the purchase, owners of solar panels with a small-consumer connection can use the so-called "net-metering scheme". The electricity from renewable energy generation fed back into the grid is deducted from the electricity purchased from the grid. As a result, small consumers are not required to pay supply costs, energy tax, the surcharge for sustainable energy (ODE) or VAT for the electricity purchased from the grid, insofar as this is offset by electricity fed back into the grid. The net-metering scheme will gradually be phased out from 2023 to 2030. The sustainability requirements for homes are also an incentive for homeowners to purchase solar panels, and in the case of landlords, to create opportunities for self-consumption for their tenants. In addition, renewable self-consumption is promoted through subsidies and credit facilities at various levels of government. Furthermore, there is a fiscal incentive scheme for energy cooperatives, the reduced tariff or postcode scheme, which stimulates regional renewable energy communities (energy cooperatives). In the first energy tax bracket members of these cooperatives are no longer required to pay tax on the share of the jointly generated renewable electricity allocated to them. It is currently being examined how this scheme could be structured in the future when the net-metering scheme is phased out. There is an explicit focus on the simplicity of the procedures. The government is also examining whether a development facility could be set up that allows energy cooperatives to fund development costs83.  vii. Assessment of the need to build new infrastructure for district heating and cooling generated from renewable energy sources With regard to making the built-up environment more sustainable, the government is committed to ensuring a substantial percentage of buildings are no longer heated using natural gas. This requires major investments in the energy infrastructure as a whole in the Netherlands. As part of efforts to increase the sustainability of the built-up environment, municipalities will first have to determine how increased sustainability will be achieved per district, and the infrastructure required to do so. viii. Specific measures to promote the use of energy from biomass, especially new biomass sources The use of biomass today and leading up to 2030 and 2050 is necessary to make our economy more sustainable and to                                                  83 Parliamentary document 31 239, no. 287. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    achieve the climate target. Biomass is used as an energy source in all climate sectors. Biomass is important in agriculture for soil fertility, the food supply and carbon stock in the soil. Biomass is also increasingly being used as an organic raw material to replace fossil raw materials in other sectors (chemicals, materials and construction). The optimal and thus most efficient use of the available quantity of biomass is desirable to maximise climate gains and increase the economic value of biomass. The basic principle is that only renewable biomass actually contributes to making the economy more sustainable and that renewable biomass on a global level will be scarce in the long term. Statutory sustainability criteria currently apply to specific biomass flows that are stimulated via the government instruments, in particular for co-fuelling and co-firing biomass in coal-fired power stations.84 Since 2009, the European sustainability framework of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) has applied to biofuel used for transport. The amended directive (RED2) also makes this framework mandatory for other large-scale energy applications of biomass in order to count it as renewable energy. In addition to the statutory applicable sustainability criteria for biomass, many parties make voluntary use of private certification programmes to demonstrate the sustainability of biomass. The government aims to develop a framework for sustainable biomass. The sustainability criteria that still have to be developed are intended to apply to all biomass and all applications (regardless of whether stimulated or not), insofar as existing legal frameworks do not yet provide for this. As a first step in the process of establishing a sustainability framework, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) was asked to draft two opinions: 1) an opinion related to the available amount of biomass per biomass flow, taking into account different interpretations of the fair-share principle and sustainability levels, and 2) an opinion related to the possibilities for the application of sustainable biomass, based on a cascaded use of biomass. Parallel to and in connection with the trajectory of the PBL, an external agency will work on concrete sustainability criteria for the different types of biomass, originating from both national and international sources. The outcome of these processes will serve as input for a SER recommendation about support for and the feasibility of the sustainability framework. The SER recommendation is expected to be available in the first quarter of 2020, after which the government will take a decision and interpret it for the different sectors.85 In relation to uncertainties in the supply and demand forecasts for sustainable biomass, additional assurance is required in the intervening period. During this period, the government commits to caution in issuing new subsidy decisions to stimulate the use and deployment of sustainable biomass, as soon as parties expect bottlenecks in the availability of sustainable biomass for 2030 on the basis of annual monitoring. In addition, a road map will be developed in 2019 and across the various sectors, with the required parties, aimed at increasing the domestic supply of sustainable biomass. Regional developments of the Climate Agreement could possibly play a role in this regard. Knowledge development and innovation for devising new forms of biomass production and the processing thereof as a raw material or fuel form part of this. 3.1.3 Other elements related to the dimension i. National policy initiatives and measures affecting the EU-ETS sector CO2 Minimum price The government will introduce a CO2 minimum price for electricity generation as of 2020. This will be established in the law. The government will introduce the national CO2 minimum price in accordance with the following price path:                                                  84 https://www.rvo.nl/onderwerpen/duurzaam-ondernemen/duurzame-energie-opwekken/bio-energie/duurzaamheid-van-vaste-biomassa 85 For more information see: https://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerstukken/brieven_regering/detail?id=2019Z14515&did=2019D29767    2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Price path* 12.3 13.5 14.9 16.4 18.0 19.8 21.8 24.0 26.4 29.0 31.9 ETS price** 20.5 21.0 21.5 24.6 27.7 30.8 33.4 36.3 39.3 42.7 46.3 * Euros per tonne of CO2 ** PBL Forecast (Source: Corjan Brink, Forecast of ETS price according to principles draft bill minimum CO2 price of electricity generation, PBL 2018)  If agreement is reached on a pentalateral variant, the price path of the pentalateral CO2 minimum price is decisive. Central government and as many parties as possible are making every effort to achieve this by striving for a pentalateral 95 CO2 minimum price. This provides a substantial incentive for increasing sustainability, in addition to the ETS, and moreover, prevents effects on the security of supply. Therefore, in the case of a pentalateral variant, the government is focusing on a more ambitious price path.  Monitoring with regard to security of supply takes place annually. Every year, TenneT examines risks to the security of supply for the following six years, based on objective indicators. This includes new developments in the ETS price.  The price path is adjusted downwards if the monitoring shows that there are risks to the security of supply in one or more years.  Upward adjustments to the price path are announced at least 5 years in advance, whereby based on the aforementioned objective indicators (TenneT) it appears that security of supply will be guaranteed.  The price path for the period after 2030 will be worked out in 2023, in conjunction with the then available insights into the renewable generation forecast after the SDE+ comes to an end. National CO2 industry levy A national CO2 tax will be introduced from 2021 to ensure that the target of a 14.3 Mton emission reduction in relation to the PBL base path will be achieved in 2030. At the same time, this tax optimally prevents production moving abroad or a decreasing willingness to invest in the Netherlands. It concerns an objective CO2 tax set by the government on the basis of verifiable standards as close as possible to the European ETS benchmarks that are already applied by the NEa. In other words, a hefty tax on avoidable tonnes. The PBL analysis shows that the required reduction of 14.3 Mton will be achieved with this tax. This means that the CO2 tax will start in 2021 at 30 euros per tonne and will increase linearly to 125-150 euros per tonne of CO2 emitted in 2030 including the ETS price (with current expectations that would be around 75-100 euros per tonne in 2030, on top of the ETS price). It should be noted that, for the effect of a CO2 tax alone on the expected reduction, the PBL did not include subsidies available from the expanded SDE+. In 2020 and 2025, when the new European ETS benchmarks become available, the government will again ask the PBL to review the required level of the CO2 tax in an objective and verifiable manner, within the established preconditions. This means that the PBL will be asked in 2020 and 2025 to establish the required starting level of the CO2 tax and the level of the CO2 tax in 2030 (and therefore also in the intermediate years) in order to achieve the reduction target. The PBL will subsequently be asked to perform the calculation including the available subsidies from the expanded SDE+. Afterwards, an external party will be asked to elaborate on the effects for Dutch industry on the international playing field and business climate. The government will then proceed to set the price path. The tariffs will be established in or pursuant to the law. The analysis shows that this variant of CO2 tax benefits from the least leakage of companies, production and investments abroad. Nevertheless, even with this tax there are risks related to the leakage of employment and CO2 emissions, as indicated by PwC. Therefore, the government is taking mitigating measures, which have also been included in the PBL's analysis, namely the gradual rise in the tax basis and tax level and creating the possibility of transferring exempt emissions. In drafting the bill it was examined how companies can be enabled to better align their CO2 reduction measures with their investment cycles. The purpose of the tax is not to generate revenue, but to encourage companies to make investments in the Netherlands. If the tax does generate revenue, that revenue will be used by channelling it back into measures for the greening of industry.   Despite the fact that the government is taking various mitigating measures, it cannot be ruled out in advance that some companies will not run into problems as a result of the cumulation of measures (including the ODE sliding scale, CO2 tax, expiry of the ETS indirect cost compensation scheme). This risk particularly applies to companies for which making transition investments takes time and is very expensive and/or where there is a danger that the required infrastructure might not become available in time. The majority of the 300 large industrial companies are active in five clusters: Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    Rijnmond/Moerdijk, North Sea canal area, Noord-Nederland, Chemelot (Geleen region) and Zeeland. The government will actively monitor these risks and will take action if, as a result of the above-mentioned effects, job losses occur in intrinsically healthy companies. To this end, the government will develop guidelines that specify how monitoring will take place, how to objectively assess whether there is a danger of job losses occurring and which instruments it can use to avert this risk. The monitoring will be reported annually in the Climate Policy Progress Monitor. The government will initially make 125 million euros available for this set of instruments in addition to the 75 million euros of compensation for losses, which is already available for switching to low-calorific gas. This could in any case include the allocation of resources for the roll-out of more expensive CO2-reducing potential that individual companies need to avoid the tax, but for which they are unlikely to be able to be competitive in applying to the expanded SDE+, support where there are infrastructure bottlenecks or compensation for the expiry of the indirect cost compensation scheme, ETS.  ii. Policy initiatives and measures to achieve other national objectives: Circular economy As far as the climate issue is concerned, it does not matter whether the emissions and emission reductions take place within or outside the Netherlands. It has been agreed at the international level that greenhouse gas emissions will be monitored at the place where the emissions are produced. This is also called the "smokestack" approach. This approach does not take into account emissions that certain activities elsewhere cause or prevent. If Dutch consumers buy imported goods, their production abroad leads to emissions, while these do not increase in the Netherlands. Conversely, the export of products from the Netherlands causes extra CO2 emissions during their production. The footprint concept is used to map these cross-border chain effects. Therefore, situations may arise where reducing emissions at the smokestack results in higher (or lower) emissions elsewhere in the system. This can also take place within Dutch borders. One example is an electric car to replace a petrol-powered car. The petrol car causes emissions (in addition to the emissions released by transporting and producing the petrol), while the electric car causes no emissions but does use electricity that is generated elsewhere, and if fossil sources are used, does result in (possibly extra) emissions. To take this effect into account, a distinction is made between scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions (WRI and WBCSD, 2018). Scope 1 relates to emissions from the smokestack. Scope 2 takes into account the emissions of purchased electricity, heat, cooling, etc. Scope 3 takes into account the greenhouse gas emissions from both purchased products and the use of manufactured products by customers and during waste processing. One approach that takes into account emissions within all scopes involves closing raw material cycles in the economy. This is also called the circular economy (CE). A circular economy can reduce CO2 in the chain by decreasing consumption of primary raw materials, by reducing the incineration and dumping of waste, by reusing CO2  as a raw material and by providing sufficient raw materials for the energy and climate transition leading up to 2050. Consideration for the CE is also important for climate policy because of the new raw materials and materials (some critical) that will play a role in the non-fossil economy because, for example, they are needed for the production of wind turbines or solar cells.  Recycling plastics is an example of a circular economy/closing cycles that contribute to the climate issue, and the measures in them. Potentially, about 1 Mton CO2 emissions can be reduced by mechanical and chemical recycling, provided the quality of the recycled raw materials is sufficient. The government is focusing on (among other things) the circular design of plastic products and improved collection, sorting and recycling methods for plastic goods to increase recyclability. In order to stimulate the demand side of the transition to a low CO2 and circular economy, central government supports local and regional authorities in using the purchasing power of government (around 73 billion euros annually) for purchasing climate-friendly and circular products and services, including renewable energy. Research conducted by RIVM (Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment) in 2017 reveals that there is a significant effect on CO2 emissions, in particular, when this plays a role in purchasing: 4.9 Mton cumulative reduction over the duration of the contracts, based on purchases from 2015-2016. Governments can use sustainable procurement to increase their role as a launching customer in the transition and set a good example to other (market) parties. For example, the Province of Zeeland implemented a circular asphalt project that simultaneously reduced CO2 emissions. For a new cycle path in Zevenaar, asphalt was used with lignin from elephant grass as a bitumen replacement. This means that CO2 emissions can   already be reduced by 20%, and this approach offers a potential reduction of 50%. The Coalition Agreement states that agreements in the state-wide programme for the circular economy and the transition agendas in the Raw Materials Agreement will be implemented as part of the climate challenge. The aim of these agreements is to have a fully circular economy in the Netherlands by 2050, with the intermediate target of achieving a reduction of 50% of primary raw materials consumption by 2030. This translates into the following policy initiatives:  A circular route for the use of raw materials focuses on reducing CO2 in 2030, for example by means of 100% high-quality reuse of concrete that becomes available, as included in the Concrete Agreement and the reuse of construction and demolition waste.  The government's purchasing power is used more effectively to accelerate the use of circular raw materials, including through tenders and contracts aimed at the reuse and substitution of (non-renewable with renewable) raw materials and innovative production methods. The government's own business operations will also be made more sustainable, and must be climate neutral by 2030.  The government is taking the lead, together with knowledge institutions, to examine how (among other things by means of carbon bookkeeping) the chain effects of circular measures such as recycling and the use of (bio-based) substitution raw materials can be mapped out and how this can be implemented in policy.  As part of the expansion of the SDE+, research is being conducted into the possible stimulation of the production of bio-based and circular economy options for the roll-out of techniques. iii. Policy initiatives and measures to facilitate the transition to low-emission mobility See the section on mobility in Chapter 3.1. iv. National policies, timelines and measures planned to phase out energy subsidies, in particular for fossil fuels There are no direct subsidies for fossil fuels in the Netherlands, in the sense that resources are made available to stimulate the use of fossil fuels. In the Netherlands, fossil fuels are on the contrary heavily taxed by means of, for example, excise duties. However, facilities such as exemptions and differentiated tariffs, for example in energy taxes, lead to missed government revenues that are related to the use of fossil fuels. Such measures could also be viewed as a subsidy if a broad definition of fossil fuel subsidies is applied. A list of such measures will soon be discussed with the IEA and OECD as part of the IEA's periodic In-Depth Review. The results of the review will be used to formulate Dutch policy on this topic.
