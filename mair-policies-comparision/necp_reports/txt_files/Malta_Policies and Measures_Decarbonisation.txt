 61  3 POLICIES AND MEASURES  3.1 DIMENSION DECARBONISATION 3.1.1 GHG emissions and removals The final National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) has been drafted whilst the long-term decarbonisation strategy for Malta is under development. Since the timelines of the two strategic documents were not running in parallel, additional policies and measures to those outlined in this section of the NECP could be included in the decarbonisation strategy. These would ultimately feature in a subsequent revision of the NECP. This is in line with the possibility of updating the NECPs to reflect new policies and measures which Governments decide to embark on, acknowledging the need to further reduce climate emissions, and the socio-economic impact of such policies and measures.   Policies and measures to achieve target set under ESR as referred to in 2.1.1 and policies and measures to comply with LULUCF Regulation  Agriculture The agriculture sector accounts for a very small share of national GHG emissions (3%). CH4 is the main GHG emitted by the agricultural sector from enteric fermentation and manure management. Very small amounts of N2O are also emitted from manure management and fertiliser use.  Various policies and measures are being implemented as agricultural practices, which reduce the GHG emissions profile of the local agriculegislation, particularly the Nitrates Directive (91/676/EC)46, N2O emissions from the use of fertiliser is expected to decrease over time as improved cultivation practices are adopted, principally through the application of the Code of Good Agricultural Practice47 and the Nitrates Action Programme. Furthermore, Malta benefited from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, a financial instrument under the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy with the aim of strengthening the Beyond this, manure management is set to improve through the enactment of the below measure, which requires both an investment in new infrastructure and a change in current operations.   Manure Management  Dewatering of Slurries  The Governance of Agricultural & Bio-resources Agency has identified a way forward for the management of slurries, which cannot be applied to soil, considering the local context and the prevalent agricultural practices, adhering to circular economy principles retaining value resources in the process. The policy direction is to dewater the slurries and separately treat the liquid fraction from the solid parts of the dewatered manure. The main emission reduction, once this measure is implemented will be through the stabilisation of the organic content in the dry part and attained through the different treatment technologies applied to the separate fractions produced. Additionally,                                                            46 Directive 91/676/EC on the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources. 47 The Maltese Code of Good Agricultural Practice for the Maltese Islands. Agricultural Services and Rural Development Division, 2003.  62  this will allow that the current practice of having slurries discharged in the wastewater network to be discontinued, thus relieving wastewater management plants from the additional organic burden, and unnecessary maintenance costs. The emission reductions to be brought about by this measure are modelled in the WPM scenario.  Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry As illustrated in an earlier section, Malta is obliged to comply by the commonly referred to as the no-debit rule in line with the provisions of the Regulation on the inclusion of GHG emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry. Hence, Malta seeks to enhance removals or reduce emissions in the LULUCF sector. In view of this, afforestation projects have been undertaken in recent years, which had an effect on the area covered by permanent vegetation, particularly trees. However, the CO2 removals as a result of such policy actions, have not been estimated, given that the scale of projects and the scale of removals would be very limited.  To date, such afforestation projects were focused on areas which also served as recreational spaces l Park, Xrobb l-closed landfill and various other projects in conjunction with Local Councils, schools and other entities. The Ministry for Gozo also conducts various ecological restoration projects. As from 2010 over 6,103 trees and over 60,714 shrubs/climbers/perennials were planted through the Simbiotic EU Project in places such as Chambray Grove, Three Hills Garden, Il-. Another policy measure to incentivise tree planting was the 34U campaign, maintained by the Park, Afforestation and Countryside Restoration (PARKS) Department within the Ministry for Sustainable Development, the Environment and Climate Change. The objectives of the 34U are the planting of indigenous trees, forestation, increase the surface area with permanent vegetation and recreating tracts of Mediterranean woodland, to encourage biodiversity in Malta. The policy direction in the years to come is to further augment such afforestation projects to enhance the sequestration potential to its maximum potential, whilst in parallel also focus on the better management of Natura 2000 sites to increase areas suitable for such purpose without negatively impinging on the conservation designations of these sites. All this whilst improving the data management of these activities to register progress in the calculation and reporting mechanisms pursuant to this Regulation.  Waste Management  The overall share of GHG emissions from the waste sector is equivalent to <5% of the gross national emissions, with the main gas emitted being methane, mainly from disposal of solid waste to land.  The national Waste Management Plan for the Maltese Islands, covering the period from 2014-2020 has provided the strategic policy direction in this sector to shift waste management practices up the waste hierarchy, hence transitioning further from waste disposal in engineered landfills, which generate GHG emissions, to recovery, recycling, reuse or prevention, which have a lower environmental and carbon footprint. This is being further bolstered with additional policies as illustrated below, which have been modelled under the WPM scenario.   63  Waste Management Plan 2021-2030 Policies and measures charted out in the current Waste Management Plan 2014-2020 shall be further reinforced in the next Waste Management Plan which shall cover the time horizon between 2021-2030. The ultimate objective remains invariably the efficient use of resources to maximise the inherent value of waste in accordance with the circular economy principles. In doing so, we strive to generate less waste by increasing the lifespan of products and/or retaining resources in a closed loop through further reuse, or recycling, before ultimately recovering energy once products reach end-of-life. It will also endeavour to attain the ambitious waste targets agreed to recently, hence increasing recycling of municipal solid waste (MSW) to 60% by 2030 [and 65% by 2035] and reduce landfilling of MSW to 10% by 2035. The new plan shall propose specific policies and measures, to build upon the progress registered in implementing those emanating from the current plan, the impacts of which are partly registered in scenario, depending on the date of implementation. Waste diversion from landfilling to more sustainable management alternatives shall not have an immediate net-saving effect of GHG emissions since emissions from landfills at any point in time are the result of dumping of material in landfills over the previous two or three decades and full closure of a landfill site does not mean immediate ceasing of emissions. However, the reduction of waste going to landfills will bring about savings at a faster rate than would be the case if volumes of landfilled waste remain the same or, even worse, increase.  This shall be notably achieved by consolidating further: (i) the separate collection of organic waste from households, which was rolled out on a national scale in October 2018. This shall in future be extended to include commercial establishments through regulatory and fiscal measures, hence capturing larger amounts of this biodegradable fraction which contributes significantly to GHG emissions when compared to other waste streams. (ii) the design and commissioning of new end-of-pipe infrastructural solutions to treat separately collected organic waste from which biogas is generated as a by-product; and (iii) focusing awareness campaigns on better quality recycling, together with increasing the enforcement capacity, as the success of waste management strategies and the subsequent reduction of GHG emissions generated in this sector, hinge upon the behavioural patterns of society at large, as waste separation at source is key to sustainable management of waste.  Recovering Energy from Waste To further reduce landfilling of non-otherwise treatable or recyclable fractions, a decision to design, build and commission a waste-to-energy (WtE) facility was taken to treat the remaining estimated 40% of MSW. It has been identified that the development of a WtE facility in Malta to complement the existing waste management infrastructure is a necessity to attain targets, established in various EU directives and transposed in both the current and upcoming Waste Management Plans for the Maltese Islands, which will see us through to 2030. Moving grate technology will be resorted to, with a thermal input between 30 and 43MW. The preferred location has been identified as that adjacent to existing engineered landfills and other waste management facility within the Maghtab complex.  64  The project will be based on proven technologies for WtE plant, including proven technology for flue gas cleaning. This means that the plant will be technically similar to many other WtE plants in Europe, with lower emissions generated in comparison to landfill activities. It is estimated that the WtE plant will be in operation in 2024.    Regional cooperation in this area Malta was one of the countries that had acknowledged the need to establish mechanisms to strengthen regional cooperation to address common climate change challenges through the promotion of better knowledge, sharing of information and best practices on adaptation and mitigation.  This was done back in 2014 through the signing of the Declaration on Environment and Climate Change under the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM).   The provisions set under the Effort Sharing Regulation to allow Member States to seek flexible options in their compliance to the respective national targets is in itself an example of regional cooperation in emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. In view of and resultant high mitigation costs coupled with significant socio-economic considerations such flexible options were resorted to, through the engagement of bilateral agreements with other Member States, which achieved emissions reductions in excess of their assigned national target.   Financing measures, including EU support and the use of EU funds in this area at national level Implementation of policies and measures which will lead to emissions reductions invariably require a financing plan, particularly those which involve heavy capital investment. Such financing plans are currently being drawn up and the tapping into EU funding mechanisms for specific infrastructural solutions particularly in the waste management sector are being considered such as structural and investment funds.   3.1.2 Renewable energy  Policies and measures to achieve national contribution to the binding EU-level 2030 and trajectories including sector and technology-specific measures policies and measures and the development of new initiatives tailored to local developments. The Government seeks to fully exploit all technically and economically viable indigenous renewable energy sources and support the private sector in similar endeavours, taking into account all relevant is mainly affected by physical and spatial limitations, technological advancement and resource potential, with the availability and cost of land being the predominant restrictions for further deployment. In this regard, policies and measures will predominantly focus on solar PV, renewable  65  water heating technologies and biofuels. The shift towards a higher share of renewable heating and cooling48) from heat pump technology is not driven by a specific measure but indirectly benefits from advantageous household electricity prices.   Share of RES in Electricity Solar PV Solar PV continues to be the most viable and robust form of indigenous sources of RES and has conducted by the Energy & Water Agency indicates that, post-2020, there will be potential for further deployment of solar PV on rooftops and brownfield sites. Therefore, the Government intends to extend its current policy framework to cover the period from 2021-2030 and adopt new measures where appropriate, with the goal of increasing the capacity of solar PV.   Support for solar PV is regulated through Subsidiary Legislation 545.27 and 545.31 which allocates support to new solar PV installations which are connected to the grid in order to help investors in the residential and non-residential sectors overcome existing cost barriers. Support is currently available in the form of operating aid, and also in the form of a grant on capital investment for households. Schemes have been successful, well-received and accepted by potential investors. In light of further potential for increasing the energy generated by solar PV, the Government intends to extend the present support framework beyond 2020 to continue encouraging investors. Further details on the additional financial support required is included under point 3.1.2.iii.  A system of fast track permitting, taking the form of a notification process, was adopted by the Regulator (REWS) for PVs not larger than 16 Amps per phase to facilitate the installation of such systems and their connection to the grid. In line with Article 16 of the recast of Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, Malta also intends to adopt a simplified procedure for repowered systems.  PV systems larger than 16 Amps per phase require an authorisation and a licence to operate from the REWS prior to construction and connection to the grid. In order to maintain the integrity of the grid, applicants may be requested to commission a grid connection study to be carried out by the DSO to ensure that the system is seamlessly integrated into the network. The grid connection study is performed free of charge for systems below 60A/phase or having a capacity not exceeding 40kW. The DSO has published a manual detailing the process flow for the processing of applications for grid connections of distributed RES to facilitate the process in such cases49.  Non-government entities play an important role in the development of local renewable energy capacities. In parallel, the Government is increasing its efforts to ensure that public rooftop spaces are fully utilised, where possible. For instance, Malta Industrial Parks (MIP), which manages state-owned industrial premises, is promoting the use of roofs in industrial zones for the installation of PV systems. A Strategy focusing on the integration of renewable energy was launched by MIP in December 2018. This -to-                                                           48 Renewable energy from cooling from air-to-2018/2001, the European Commission is required to establish a methodology for calculating renewable energy for cooling by December 2021.  49https://www.enemalta.com.mt/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Enemalta-process-flow-for-processing-applications-for-grid-connection-of-distributed-RES.pdf  66  one discussions and surveys with tenants are also being conducted with the aim of identifying potential barriers and encouraging the installation of RES. Future collaboration between MIP and relevant Government entities is envisaged with a view to also encourage tenants to make improvements in energy efficiency and further integrate renewables. The Government will continue to engage with key stakeholders to encourage their involvement in the increased deployment of renewable energy technologies, particularly solar PV. This also in view of development trends which highlight the prioritisation of multi-apartment dwellings and high-rise buildings, that is, buildings with an increasing height to floor (roof) ratio. Discussions with key stakeholders may identify ways in which to better incorporate renewable technologies, thus increasing local renewable capacity and the energy performance of the building. In order to further encourage the use of renewable sources of energy, the Government launched a scheme for voluntary organisations where eligible applicants will be offered a completely free PV system to be used on their premises. Depending on the size of the premise/building, organisations can choose to either install a 12 module PV system or a 24 module PV system. The scheme will be made available twice, with the first round of applications received in October 2019 and the second call will be open in March 2020. Battery storage As of 2020, a pilot scheme supporting the integration of battery storage with PV systems will be launched. Early adopters of solar PVs whose feed-in-tariff has expired will be eligible to receive a 25% grant (capped at 1,000) against the purchase of a battery system for the storage of renewable energy and therefore increase the share of self-consumption. A preliminary study was conducted in 2019 to assess the feasibility of such a measure; the pilot project will feed into this continuing assessment. It is likely that a large-scale roll-out of battery storage systems for households, PV-integrated or stand-alone, would require a significantly higher level of support or lower cost of storage than at present. In this regards Malta shall be seeking EU funds (including Cohesion funds) to bridge the gap.  Waste-to-energy plants Organic waste is expected to continue being treated through anaerobic digestion plants. Projections of renewable electricity and/or heat generated by waste-to-energy plants from biodegradable waste content are based on projections of waste generation and are projected to remain largely constant throughout the projected period under the WPM scenario, as outlined in Section 2.1.2. In reality, it is expected that the treatment of the bio-organic fraction of waste can slightly increase in the future to reflect an increase in population. The Government is carrying out studies to assess the potential of increasing capacity of treatment of organic waste.  A new waste-to-energy thermal treatment plant is expected to be commissioned in 2024. The share of the bio-origin content of the waste input is yet to be determined but given that the input stream is expected to be mainly refuse-derived fuel and rejects, the bio-fraction is expected to be minimal. Thus, idered.      67  Share of RES in Heating and Cooling The share of RES-H&C is made up of different technologies, which apart from the heat generated by the waste-to-energy plants referred to above, also include solar water heaters, heat pump water heaters, air-to-air heat pumps and biomass imports.  Renewable Water Heating Technologies Given the high solar intensity prevalent in Malta, solar water heaters (SWH) are considered a viable source of RES. The effectiveness of an ongoing grant scheme supporting the purchase of SWH by households, has dwindled in recent years, with consumer preference shifting towards PV systems, especially when technologies compete for limited roof space. In 2018, the Government increased the 00, capped at 50% of the eligible cost. The support scheme for Heat Pump Water Heaters (HPWH), which was launched in 2017, was extended and  Post-2020, the existing financial support and incentives being offered will be revised with the aim of overcoming recently observed barriers. The Government aims to provide support for the installation of 800 renewable water heating technologies, namely solar water heaters and heat pump water heaters, each year from 2021-2030. To overcome the declining uptake of domestic SWH, the Government plans to amend and further simplify the application process such that the beneficiary would not have to await endorsement of his application for support to acquire a SWH/HPWH before the amount of financial assistance which can be claimed will be increased from 50% of eligible costs to a maximum of 80% of eligible costs. The projected Government budget to support the deployment of 800 units each year from 2021-2030 under this scheme will reach annually. As the capital cost of SWHs/HPWHs is assumed to remain high compared to conventional electric water heaters in the short- to medium-term, the support scheme is projected to continue throughout the ten-year period covered by the NECP.  In parallel to the revamping of these schemes, the Government plans to initiate an educational and awareness raising campaign to entice households to invest in such technologies by highlighting the benefits of SWHs/HPWHs. It must be noted, however, that current trends which prioritise the development of high rises and multi-apartment buildings limit the technical potential of SWHs. Air-to-Air Heat Pumps Reversible air-to-air heat pumps are a well-established technology in Malta and considered by many to be essential for thermal comfort. As a result, the number of air-to-air heat-pumps is projected to increase without the need for policy intervention. More details on the methodology and assumptions used in the RES contribution of heat pumps can be found in section 4.2.2.  Share of RES in Transport Biofuels Malta already has in place a substitution obligation on importers of petrol and diesel to blend an increasing share of biofuels in their mix50 with the aim of meeting the target of a 10% share of RES in                                                            50 Subsidiary Legislation 545.17  68  transport in 2020 as per Article 3(4) of Directive 2009/28/EC.  In line with Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, the Government intends to extend the current substitution obligation framework until 2030, by gradually increasing the obligation of biofuel blending on importers of petrol and diesel from 10% in 2020 to 14% in 2030, by energy content, as a share of renewable energy supplied for final consumption in the road transport sector. The obligation will additionally require importers of petrol and diesel to increase the share of advanced biofuels from 0.1% in 2020 to 3.5% in 2030, with the share in 2022 and 2025 being 0.2% and 1% respectively. For the scope of meeting the requirements of Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, Malta intends to consider biofuels from feedstocks listed in Annex IX of the Directive; these may be considered as twice their energy content for calculating the share of biofuels for transport. Local importers and wholesalers of petrol and diesel will likely meet their post-2020 substitution obligation by blending EN 590 diesel with Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME) biodiesel (EN 14214) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) (EN 15940), as is the current practice. In recent years, the latter has been prioritised by local fuel suppliers as it offers several advantages over FAME biodiesel. HVO parameters are within EN 590 specifications (except for lower density), it has a higher energy content and good solvency when blending, without any temperature issues. It can be typically blended with EN 590 up to 30% by volume, whereas FAME biodiesel can be blended with EN 590 diesel up to a maximum of 7% by volume51.  Bioethanol is currently not available for consumption in Malta. This is due to the Maltese hot climate which creates technical difficulties for the blending of bioethanol with petrol. The addition of bioethanol to petrol in low percentages increases the vapour pressure of the fuel blend and therefore increases the possibility of emissions of benzene and volatile organic compounds, particularly in high ambient temperatures. Therefore, unless petrol with a sufficiently low reid vapour pressure (RVP) is readily available in relatively small volumes and competitive prices, the warm climate in Malta would drive the vapour pressure of bioethanol-petrol blends above the limit determined by EN 228.  Malta has introduced an obligation on fuel importers to blend 0.1% share of advanced biofuel in their mix in 2020. This is in spite of the fact that advanced biofuels tend to be available in relatively small volumes globally52,53 and their price projections demonstrate a sustained substantially higher cost over conventional biofuels and mineral fuels54,55. Both conventional and advanced biofuels are more expensive than mineral diesel and petrol per unit of energy. Projections from DG Agriculture and Rural Development in the EU Agricultural Outlook 2017-203056 indicate that the prices of biofuels will remain largely constant in the medium-term. Given that reported prices are similar to local landed costs, it has been assumed for projection purposes that the current price difference between mineral diesel and biodiesel imported locally will remain. This also applies to advanced biofuels, which the same report notes are unlikely to experience significant                                                            51 Neste Corporation (2016).

Furthermore, it must be noted that given the relatively small market, Malta cannot take advantage of economies of scale in procurement and shipping, therefore the CIF costs tend to be higher than for larger markets.    The energy regulator, REWS, will continue to ensure that all biofuels placed on the market fulfil the necessary sustainable criteria. Electric vehicles When projecting the local stock of electric vehicles and plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles under the WPM scenario, the impact of the relevant EU fleet CO2 Regulations for the period post-2020 was taken into account. Although these standards will apply to vehicle manufacturers, the fleet of brand-new vehicles purchased in Malta tends to reflect that available on the EU market and therefore an assumption was made that the CO2 fleet averages would also apply to Malta. It is assumed that vehicle manufacturers will increase the proportion of electric vehicles in their fleet to meet these standards. As a result of these Regulations which are supplemented by a national scrappage scheme, the stock of electric and plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles is expected to increase from just above 1,000 in 2020 to almost 26,000 by 2030 under the WPM scenario. Policies and measures addressing the electrification of transport are outlined in Section 3.1.3.iii focusing on low-emission mobility.   Specific measures for regional cooperation  Development of indigenous renewable capacities will continue to be prioritised. However, given in demand, Malta envisages the need to acquire renewable energy credits to meet the 2020 RES share target of 10%, maintain this minimum target in 2021 and also meet its first reference point on the indicative trajectory in 2022.  This plan foresees the option for Malta to avail itself of cooperation mechanisms to meet its renewable energy contributions as long as any higher commitments are subject to equitable sharing of costs and benefits. In this context, Malta is willing to cooperate with Italy and explore the possibility of entering into joint RES projects as long as these yield benefits for both Member States. The possibility of tapping into EU funds such as the Innovation fund and CEF will also be considered, as well as coordinating with other Mediterranean countries on such projects.  Specific measures on financial support for the promotion of the production and use of energy from RES in electricity, H&C and transport In line with Article 4 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, the Government plans to extend existing support schemes, in the form of EU/national capital grant incentives and operating aid for the promotion of electricity from RES,57  beyond 2020 in order to increase penetration of RES, with a focus on solar PV and renewable water heating technologies.  With regards to solar PV, while costs are decreasing, national projections denote that there will remain a need to address financial barriers in the residential and non-residential sector. The LCOE of residential PV systems is likely to remain higher than the proxy for the market price of electricity until                                                            57 Any schemes post-2020 will be subject to the applicable state aid rules  70  2030, indicating that few consumers would invest without financial support. This is the same for the commercial systems for which, based on current projections, the LCOE will not reach grid parity until the end of the projected period; this is largely on account of the associated high costs for land/rooftop rent and/or grid connections. Furthermore, it is likely that the financial and technical barriers experienced by those consumers who have not yet installed a PV system are likely to be higher than those who have already invested in this technology.  Thus, the Government intends to maintain financial support schemes to encourage the deployment of renewable energy. The grant and operating aid for the promotion of electricity from RES will continue to be revised on a regular basis to ensure a reasonable return on investment and avoid overcompensation as system costs and electricity prices evolve, while taking into account all relevant costs.  It is being estimated that, on average, an additional estimated to finance grants and feed-in tariffs supporting the installation of new PV systems and SWHs/HPWHs post-for continued support of existing PV systems. These estimates are sensitive to the evolution of electricity wholesale prices. For instance, should the proxy for the market price of electricity diverge from projections, the budgetary impact of support schemes would change depending on whether the Government would be required to bridge a larger or smaller cost gap.   [Where applicable] Assessment of the support for electricity from renewable sources pursuant to Article 6 (1b) of RED  Malta currently provides operational aid and support on capital investment to PV systems; these are in line with existing state aid rules. A re-assessment of the support level is performed at least once a year to ensure that changing costs are fully reflected.  Following the transposition of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, Malta will carry out an assessment of the effectiveness of support schemes for the promotion of electricity from renewable sources every five years in line with Article 6 (1b). This will be included in relevant updates of the national integrated energy and climate plan and the periodic progress reports.   Specific measures to introduce one or more contact points, streamline administrative procedures, provide information and training and facilitate the uptake of power purchase agreements On a national level, discussions are ongoing on how best to implement the requirements of Article 16 and 17 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Following its transposition, Malta will implement the necessary regulatory and administrative changes required by the Directive.    71   Summary of policies and measures under the enabling framework pursuant to Article 21(4) and 22(5) of the RED to promote and facilitate the development of renewable self-consumption and renewable energy communities Existing schemes supporting the installation of PV systems cater for the option of self-consumption of renewable electricity in both the residential and non-residential sector. Under existing legislation, the applicant may opt to sell all electricity generated by the PV system to the DSO (full export) or export only the surplus electricity (partial export). Furthermore, in the case where the installation operator does not apply for support, Regulation 4A of SL 545.27 ensures that solar PVs may be installed primarily for self-consumption and that any surplus electricity supplied to the DSO through the grid will be bought at the proxy for the market price. The option for self-consumption is not applicable for PV installations owned by third parties, with full export to the grid being the only option.  In 2017, systems on partial export generated 23% of total electricity from solar PV (Figure 23). Additionally, the proportion of electricity generated by these systems that was effectively consumed on-site in 2017 was 59%.   Figure 23 - Electricity production in 2017 from PV systems on full vs partial export by sector (residential (RSD) vs. non-residential (Non-RSD)), %   Since the introduction of support schemes in the form of feed-supported self-consumption and ensured that there would be no legal or technical barriers to renewable self-consumption. Systems which prioritise self-consumption face no additional charges when selling their excess production of renewable electricity to the grid. Self-consumption is promoted as a way in which consumers can offset their consumption of electricity from the grid (in real time) and thus, reduce their electricity bills, particularly in cases where such offsetting places the consumer in a lower electricity tariff band.  The Government will continue to promote renewable self-consumption of electricity from solar PV systems and ensure that no discriminatory or disproportionate procedures and charges apply. In this regard, and in line with future requirements under Article 21(4) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, Malta 47%7%30%16%2017 PV Generation by Sector and Export SchemeRSD full exportRSD partial exportNon-RSD full exportNon-RSD partial export 72  will be conducting an assessment to explore any potential unidentified barriers to renewable self-consumption.  of 266 MW by 2030, thus fulfilling its currently estimated technical potential.  As explained in sections above, the Government intends to reach this capacity by extending its current framework of RES support schemes post-2020 for both residential and non-residential systems, including in the form of feed-in-tariffs (FITs)/ feed-in premiums. As the support period for several PV systems come to an end, -opting for this option are expected to increase, reaching circa 50% of installed PV systems by 2030 (Figure 24). This shift is also expected to drive demand management (to minimize electricity exported to the grid), which may be beneficial to the grid operator if well managed to reduce demand peaks.  Figure 24 - Production from PV systems on full or partial export under WPM scenario, 2018-2030, %  In view of the structure of the Maltese electricity system with one electricity supply market (Enemalta is designated as an exclusive supplier in Malta), it is not foreseen that renewable energy communities Directive (EU) 2019/944 on common rules for the internal market for electricity in which Malta is granted derogations on third-party access, choice of supplier, and provisions related to unbundling.

Information regarding the outcome of the assessment is elaborated in Section 4.3.ii on the current potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling.   [If applicable] Specific measures on the promotion of the use of energy from biomass, especially for new biomass mobilisation  As explained in previous sections, biomass is imported to Malta in rather small volumes and used for heating purposes by the residential and to a small extent the industrial and services sectors. It is foreseen that biomass imports in the future will remain stable and no specific measures are foreseen to promote the use of energy from biomass.     3.1.3 Other elements of the dimension   [If applicable] National policies and measures affecting the EU ETS sector and assessment of the complementarity and impacts on the EU ETS The competent authority responsible for the overall implementation and administration of the EU ETS in Malta is the Malta Resources Authority. In Malta, EU ETS covers the power generation and the aviation sectors. Legal Notice 434/2013 transposes Directive 2003/87/EC into local legislation in relation to stationary installations, while Legal Notice 403/2012 transposes the Directive insofar as it relates to aviation activities.  Operators of an installation performing an activity falling under Annex I of the Directive are required to apply for a GHG emissions permit. The allocation of allowances to stationary installations in the power generation sector is carried out in accordance with harmonized EU-wide rules, which involves both auctioning and free allocation on the basis of agreed benchmarks. Electricity generation plants in Malta falling within the scope of the EU ETS Directive are not eligible to any free allowances and are required to acquire allowances through auctioning and/or purchases on the emissions trading market. As regards the allocation for Phase IV (2021-2025), electricity generation plants were not eligible for any free allowances. Operators of installations in Malta are also obliged by law to submit to the competent authority monitoring plans describing how emissions will be monitored and reported.  Directive 2003/87/EC as amended by Directive 2008/101/EC included aviation activities in the scheme for GHG emission allowance trading. The Directive provides for an EU Member State to be responsible for administering each aircraft operator in the EU ETS. Allocation of allowances to aircraft operators is partly free on the basis of benchmarking and partly through auctioning. Three aircraft operators administered by Malta were granted free allocations for the years 2017  2023. Aircraft operators are also obliged to have an approved monitoring plan for annual emissions as well as for tonne-kilometer data.  Policies and measures to achieve other national targets, if applicable No other policies and measures are foreseen at the time of submission of the final NECP.   74   Policies and measures to achieve low-emission mobility (including electrification of transport) Transport Master Plan with a horizon up to 2025. A number of measures indicated in the Master Plan have been implemented since 2017 and will continue to be realised throughout 2018, 2019 and 2020. Other measures are expected to be implemented and completed in the post-2020 period leading up to 2025.  Free school transport for all primary and secondary school students and free use of public transport for youths and students between 16-20 years old was introduced in October 2018. Although the effect of these measures on emissions has yet to be assessed, it is estimated that this measure has led to a reduction of circa 6,300 car trips. Free public transport fares for youths and students is expected to be extended to students of ages between 14  20 as well as full-time students of all ages by the end of 2020.  When compared to the WEM scenario, emissions under the WPM scenario are expected to decrease as a result of a number of infrastructure projects on the TEN-T network that will alleviate congestion and lead to an overall increase in the average speed of vehicles (and thus, lower fuel consumption compared to the WEM), such as:   TEN-T Kappara (completed in 2017): expected CO2 emission reduction of 1,700 tonnes per year;  TEN-T Marsa-Hamrun By Pass Phase I (completed in 2018): expected CO2 emission reduction of 3,000 tonnes per year;  TEN-T Marsa (to be completed in 2020): expected CO2 emission reduction of 5,243 tonnes per year from 2020.  Ongoing implementation of the 2025 Master Plan relates to a number of measures falling under the Sustainable Multimodal Intelligent Transport Hubs Project known as SMITHs Project. The concept revolves around the identification and the setting up of local transport hubs to provide multi-modal transport services for transport users in lieu of the use of the private personal car. In this respect, the work so far has been preparatory in nature in terms of project design, engagement of third party consultancy services and preparation/publication of procurement processes. The main objective of the SMITHs is to provide different inter-modal services in conjunction with Public Transport to essentially complete the last mile of ones journey. Thus, in effect, apart from Public Bus Transport stops in a given local transport hub, one will also find electric car sharing services, pedelec sharing, bicycle sharing, electric motor cycle sharing and scooter sharing. In some localities, especially in maritime towns and villages, maritime public transport is being provided and the service will be extended to other localities due to increased popularity. In 2018, the Government has rolled out a car-sharing scheme consisting of 150 cars at 450 different locations spread around Malta, which allows citizens to book an electric vehicle (EV) through an online app.59 The vehicles used are all electric.  In addition, the Government will also carry out a pilot project in Gozo to demonstrate and test Transport on Demand using electric buses and electric mini cabs which will be operated by the                                                            59 https://www.goto.com.mt  75  Ministry of Gozo. This project, which is expected to be implemented by 2020, will introduce 8 electric buses in Gozo.  Through the investment of bicycle and pedelec sharing operating companies, Malta registered a steady increase in the use of these modes for commuting purposes, and this encouraged the Government to invest more in related infrastructure, including Safe Cycling Routes. Two pilot projects are being prepared for implementation which involve 26km of Safe Cycle Routes under the concept of sharing the road. The idea behind the concept is to make these road sections safer for cyclists without the need to implement dedicated cycle lanes where road width does not permit this. objective is to have a national safe cycling route network which will be intersecting local transport hubs. It is expected that in 2020 a National Bicycle Strategy, which shall include the provision of additional cycle lanes and increase connectivity to these routes, will be developed.   Low Emission Zone Study Transport Malta has started a project to study the feasibility of the introduction of Low Emission Zones (LEZ). Transport Malta is working with the Controlled Vehicular Access (CVA) operator who manages the Valletta Congestion Charge to use its existing infrastructure and additional CCTV to carry out a study in real conditions of an LEZ. Transport Malta has purchased additional CCTVs and at the moment are allocating different charges to all vehicles of the fleet based on the emission levels of each type of vehicle and according to the Euro levels of the respective engines. EVs will not be assigned any charges and Transport Malta will run various scenarios with the collected data including pricing scenarios and ghost-billing to each vehicle.   National Traffic Control Centre A new National Traffic Control Centre (NTCC) to manage traffic and enforce bus corridors is being set up. Infrastructural work is currently underway. The new NTCC will be completed in the course of 2020. This will also include an Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) Platform to enable all of ITS sub-systems to communicate. Transport Malta is currently in the tendering process of this measure. An example of innovation in the area of transport, specifically the utilisation of technology, involves a Real Time Journey Planner including the back-end of the system (that has been launched). The Real Time Journey planner will be operated from the National Traffic Control Centre. The app will give real time information on all modes of transport and scheduling services for all modes of transport including bus public transport, inter-harbour maritime services, inter-island ferry services, Malta-Sicily maritime transport, and air transport in conjunction with the Malta International Airport. In order to further enhance ferry transportation, Malta is planning an upgrade of Existing Landing Ferry Sites and introducing three new facilities and Maritime Routes. Following a number of studies carried out in 2017 and a number of other studies undertaken in 2018, procurement is currently underway for the upgrading of the quays. Structural works on two of the sites is expected to commence. Tenders for the superstructures to serve as the passenger waiting facilities are being prepared. The facilities will be equipped with the provision of real time information between various modes of transport. The improvement of Ferry Landing Places is expected to impact Bormla, Sliema  76  -2020. Additionally, a fast-ferry from Gozo to Valletta is being planned.  Electrification of Transport  With reference to the electrification of transport systems, procurement is currently underway for the installation of 118 medium-fast EV chargers and 22 Rapid EV chargers. This EV charging infrastructure will be placed and installed in the SMITHS to promote the electrification of transport. This project is also being carried out in part for the fulfilment of the Directive for the Deployment of Alternative Fuel Infrastructure for Transport (Directive 2014/94) and the respective national targets. All the measures indicated above fall under the SMITHs Project which is being funded through ERDF and National Funds. A number of measures have been taken to promote and implement the electrification of transport in Malta. The Government has launched a number of grant packages and these have been improved year in connection with a scrappage scheme pping scheme. In addition, as from 2018, full EVs (including plug-in hybrids and electric range extender electric vehicles) are exempt from registration fees which will benefit EV owners with ion, Malta has exempted EVs from registration tax and the annual road license for 5 years from the date of registration. Hybrid vehicles and motorcycles with a capacity of less than 250cc also benefit from incentives such as a lower registration tax and annual circulation tax.  The registration tax and annual circulation tax in Malta is founded on a on the length of the vehicle, CO2 and particulate matter which favours cleaner, smaller, newer and low emission vehicles. Private companies can also benefit from change their car fleets in line with state aid rules.  The year 2018 saw the highest number of EVs registered in Malta. On the national automotive market there is an availability of 90% of all EV models available on the European automotive market.  is currently undergoing review and being updated to reflect the National Transport Strategy and National Operational Transport Master Plan, including a new action plan up to 2025 and a strategy leading to 2050. The measures to be included in the revised action plan will be tested and simulated through an Interreg Med funded Project. Earlier this year, the Ministry for Transport, Infrastructure and Capital Projects commissioned a study in order to evaluate the feasibility of CNG and LNG in road transport, in line with Directive 2014/94 on the Deployment of Alternative Fuels, and the results are now being analysed. Meanwhile, Transport Malta (TM) is working on a pilot project to demonstrate hydrogen propulsion. TM has invited current fuel station owners through an advert in newspapers to gauge the interest of the private sector to join TM in such a pilot project. Five fuel station companies, mostly on the TEN-T and arterial roads, have shown interest in participating in such a pilot.    77  Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP)60 TM is currently in the process of compiling an extension to the first ever SUMP in Malta. This will be carried out for Valletta and the Valletta Region which hosts the main commercial districts, popular tourist destinations, the international airport and cruise port terminal. The SUMP is expected to explore innovative solutions in order to improve mobility patterns, meet demands in the transport sector and contribute to making transport more sustainable. The SUMP process includes the engagement of consultants and consultation processes with stakeholders. Transport Malta is in the process of engaging with the respective local councils. The project is being part financed under the Civitas Destinations Project and is expected to be concluded by 2020.
