3.5  i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.5 3.5.1.1 The National Research, Development and Innovation Policy of the Czech Republic 20162020 and its update for 20192020109 The National Research, Development and Innovation Policy of the Czech Republic 20162020 is the key strategic document at national level, which sets out guidelines for research, development and innovation and forms the basis for other related strategic documents of the Czech Republic. The document puts more emphasis on supporting applied research for the needs of the economy and the State administration, and identifies the key areas and research topics on which applied research should focus. The National Policy also proposes changes in the management and funding of science so that more top-level scientific results are produced and companies become more engaged in R&D. In 2018, the Report on the Evaluation of Fulfilment of Measures of National Priorities of Oriented Research, Experimental Development and Innovation 20162020 was prepared, which was approved by the Czech Government in February 2019. This report includes an update of the National Priorities of Oriented Research, Experimental Development and Innovation of the Czech Republic 20162020 for the period 20192020, prepared in the context of the proposed modifications to the measures described in that report. 3.5.1.2 National priorities for oriented research, experimental development and innovation110 National Priorities of Oriented Research, Experimental Development and Innovation were approved by the Government of the Czech Republic on 19 July 2012. National priorities for oriented research, experimental development and innovation are valid for the period up to 2030 with gradual fulfilment. Within the defined 6 priority areas, there are 24 sub-areas with a total of 170 specific targets. The document contains a description of each of the priority areas and sub-areas, indicating links between the areas and defining several system measures. The document also contains a statement regarding the expected division of expenditures on research, development and innovation from the state budget into individual areas.                                                            109  The document is available at: https://www.vyzkum.cz/FrontClanek.aspx?idsekce=682145 110  The document is available at: https://www.vyzkum.cz/FrontClanek.aspx?idsekce=653383  -151-  Table 56: Energy-related priority areas within the NPOR Source: National priorities for oriented research, experimental development and innovation Area Sub-area Renewable energy sources Developing economically efficient solar energy Developing economically efficient use of geothermal energy Developing economically efficient use of biomass Nuclear sources Efficient long-term use of existing nuclear power plants Supporting the safety of nuclear installations Research to support the construction and operation of new economically efficient and secure units Research and development of the fuel cycle Storage of radioactive waste and spent fuel Research and development of 4th generation reactors, especially efficient and safe fast reactors Fossil energy sources Economically efficient and environmentally-friendly fossil power and heating Electric networks including energy storage Capacity, reliability and safety of backbone transmission networks -side  Electricity storage, including the use of hydropower Security and resilience of distribution networks Production and distribution of heat/cold, including cogeneration and trigeneration Heat off-take from power plants in base load High-efficiency cogeneration (trigeneration) in district heating systems in partial load operations (system services) Distributed combined production of electricity, heat and cold from all types of sources Transmission and storage of heat Efficient management of treating indoor environment Alternative sources  waste recovery Energy in transport Increase the share of liquid and gas biofuels to replace fossil sources Increase the share of electricity use for drives to replace fossil sources In the future, introduce hydrogen as a source of energy in transport Systemic development of the Czech energy sector in the context of EU energy sector development System analyses to support a balanced State Energy Policies (SEP), other related strategy documents of the State and regional development policies with regard to the EU framework Integral strategy of municipal and regional development with verification by demonstration projects (link to SET Plan  Smart Cities and Smart Regions)  -152-  3.5.1.3 National Research and Innovation Strategy for Smart Specialisation of the Czech Republic EU Member States were obliged to prepare their National Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (National RIS3 Strategies) in order to identify appropriate prospective economic areas, which should be subsequently supported by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). To this end, the Czech Republic has prepared its National RIS3 Strategy, which reflects the priorities of our economy, which should be targeted by ESIF programmes and selected research and development support programmes. The approval of the National RIS3 Strategy by the Czech government and the European Commission was a necessary condition to receive funds from the relevant ESIF. The and Innovation Strategy for the Smart Specialisation of the Czech Republic 20142020  Table 57 lists the priority areas of energy research based on the National Research and Innovation Strategy for Smart Specialisation in the Czech Republic. The approval of the National RIS3 Strategy by the Czech government and the European Commission was a necessary condition to receive funds from    -153-  Table 57: Priority areas of research based on the National Research and Innovation Strategy Regions Description Technologies for electricity and heat production in nuclear power plants In the field of technologies for electricity and heat production in nuclear power plants, the main challenge of the research and development will be to ensure a high level of security, including the acquisition of knowledge and necessary tools and data in all areas needed to continuously ensure quality legislation, State Office for Nuclear Safety supervisory activities (including expert support of the regulator), and the needs of operators, all in a synergistic way to maintain and improve the quality of the necessary experts. It includes models for enhancing deterministic and probabilistic security analyses (including the role of the human factor), new technologies and approaches to preventing and managing severe accidents. The use of project reserves is an important area of research, be it in relation to performance (including optimisation of fuel cycles) or longevity (associated with the derivation of behaviour and aging of materials, components and equipment). There is potential in the preparation of improved methods of processing and treatment of radioactive waste, decontamination and dismantling of nuclear power plants after termination of operation (including the use of robots). The fourth-generation systems, nuclear fusion, particle sources and small modular reactors (SMR) are also an important research topic. Fossil fuel based energy production In the field of fossil fuel based power production, research and development must provide the necessary tools to enable greater flexibility of operation, including increasing the regulatory range of the resource (recognising the effects on the life of materials and equipment and their maintenance), technologies to continuously meet the decreasing limits for emissions from operated sources (mainly coal) and to increase their efficiency (technical solutions, advanced management models). The research should also include the use of energy by-products from the combustion processes of coal sources (ash, flue ashes, energy gypsum, etc.), especially for the production of building and construction materials, including the derivation of conditions for the use of new materials (evaluation of the impact of harmful substances, testing methods design, ecotoxicology, etc.). There is also the possibility of developing the utilisation of black and brown coal in a different way than by combustion. Heat production and distribution (or cold) In the area of heat production and distribution (or cold), the future challenge lies in making the systems more efficient by measures targeting specific conditions either at the source (boiler output ranges, optimum solution for deSOx / deNox / dust, reduction of the minimum enforcement of condensing production, solutions for multi-fuel use, etc.) or in the heating network (technical possibilities of loss reduction, modern system control systems). The main development themes are also the accumulation of energy (heat or surplus electricity in the electricity system) and the  effective partial decentralisation of systems (synergy of central and decentralised facilities). Attention must be paid to the development of innovative small cogeneration and micro-generation technologies (improved engines, fuel cells, ORC cycles, etc.), trigeneration, production and distribution of cold and their testing in real-life use. Use of renewables Cost-effective use of renewables requires development and testing of technologies that are suitable to the conditions in the Czech Republic. Biomass systems have considerable potential  future solutions are primarily in the provision of heat on a local (regional) scale. Research and development must focus on the sustainable extraction of biomass (residues and waste from forestry and agriculture), purposefully grown biomass and its transformation into a form that is suitable for transport and end use. The boilers must be available in all the necessary performance series that meet the future requirements (for small boilers, these are requirements arising from the ecodesign legislation). The subject of R&D must be a  -154-  suitable transformation processes of biomass showing the most effective solutions in the future. Topics for biogas plants are the expansion of the fuel base and the efficient use of heat. The use of higher output hydropower will be tied to more efficient operation of the equipment (innovative machines and their control) and reduction of environmental impacts during construction and operation of the equipment. Complex systems management models that take energy, water and other functions into account are also important111. Some potential is represented by small hydropower plants for small gradients and flows requiring innovative technologies (low-component systems, new types of turbines, simple regulation, etc.). Development in the use of wind energy should be aimed at solutions to reduce losses (gearing, etc.) and trouble-free integration into the electricity grid. The use of solar energy should focus on the expansion of roof photovoltaic installations combined with appropriate storage to maximise domestic consumption (residential sector, services); innovative solutions for solar thermal systems (cost reduction, combination with unconventional heat storage solutions, etc.). Development must also focus on the use of heat pumps  increasing SOC, gas pumps, combination with other technologies at house or small-site level. Decentralised sources must be perceived not only as isolated technologies, but their synergic functioning must be explored at the same time  e.g. interconnecting them into virtual power plants (aggregators) and heat sources. Power-to-gas technology, i.e. converting energy into hydrogen or methane for energy storage, will also be a development focus. Electricity networks In the area of electricity networks, research and development will focus on ensuring reliable and safe (including security) operation of the electricity system in changing conditions on the source and consumer side. Management issues, new technical elements enhancing the robustness, efficiency and reliability of the system, developing the vision of network integration and managing the electricity balance in the European context are important topics for the area of transmission. Research and development and demonstration topics for reliable and secure operation are important in the area of distribution networks  new automation elements (remote control elements), advanced approaches in diagnostics and monitoring (predictive diagnostics, etc.), smart metering and integration of renewables, distributed generation and electromobility. The key theme is the optimisation of production and consumption  advanced load management (developing centralised control) and power management based on price and other motivational signals (demand-side management / demand response). Energy storage. Energy storage will be a key element between production and consumption in the future. Therefore, it is important to develop and test energy storage systems with different characteristics and with different carriers potentially suitable for the functionality (energy and performance; networking or island operation solutions, etc.), taking into account the potential for discounting. Energy savings In the field of energy savings, it is crucial to develop and demonstrate practically applicable solutions in the final consumption sectors  households, industry, services and agriculture. The preparation and demonstration of integral solutions for cities and agglomerations (smart cities and regions)                                                            111  Complex model management of power systems, in particular in the case of hydraulic structures not intended primarily for the production of electricity, will be based primarily on the purposes and priorities of the hydraulic structures for which they have been authorised. In practice, this control can only be applied in the free-handling zones in the storage volume of the tanks within the defined control lines.  -155-  in relation to European initiatives, but taking into account the specificities of the Czech Republic is also a complex area. The essence lies in synergistically integrating the generation and transmission of energy, the use of energy in buildings and the energy intensity of transport, all while applying ICT technologies. In the residential sector, the concept of smart homes and housing is to be developed, which is the intersection between construction, local energy production, smart appliances, but also other elements for a safe and happy life. Energy savings must focus not only on technical solutions, but also on business and financing models. It is also important to improve the energy performance of buildings, for example by insulation. Passive houses lead to an increase in the quality of indoor and outdoor environments due to lower levels of harmful substances inside the building and lower emissions of local pollution into the surroundings. Energy for transport The energy for transport are should focus on the preparation and demonstration of solutions for wider use of electromobility (integration of charging stations into the network, control systems, integration with energy storage, hybrid solutions, inductive charging etc.), hybrid vehicles and the development of concepts and verification of key elements for fuel cell propulsion and transport. An important role is played by the development of new types of biofuels or the use of energy by-products to build road network and infrastructure. Perspective energy technology In the field of perspective energy technologies, which will be applied in the longer term, research and development will focus for example on small modular reactors working in the high temperature area with high safety, fourth-generation reactors, hydrogen technologies mainly for energy storage, nuclear fusion, advanced energy storage and transformation technologies and thermodynamic cycles. Analytical supporting documents Decision-making in the energy sector requires high-quality analytical supporting documents that can relate to the above areas individually or be common to several of them. Conventional and larger renewable sources and energy distribution share the development of risk-oriented decision-making models (operation, maintenance models) based on advanced mathematical solutions and data handling. Another topic is the analysis of possibilities and limits of energy sector development in the Czech Republic for various time horizons or models of ensuring energy security and increasing the energy and raw material efficiency of the economy. Horizontal issues Horizontal issues of research and development such as the application of ICT (digitisation, big data), new materials and production technologies (rapid prototyping, customised manufacturing, etc.) must also be taken into account. Nanotechnology In the field of nanotechnologies it is necessary to focus the research on the possibilities of application of graphene (graphene supercapacitor) and the use of nanomaterials in the construction of batteries (3D batteries).

The programme was created on the basis of measures from the State Energy Policy. The focus of THÉTA is based on the updated State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic, approved by the Czech Government in May 2015. The programme is aimed at supporting projects whose results have a high potential for application in a number of areas of the public life of the Czech Republic. The programme period is 20182025 (i.e. 8 years in total). The first tender was announced in 2017, the second in 2018, and the third in October 2019. The maximum duration of projects is set at 8 years, but varies from one sub-programme to another. In the medium and long term, the programme aims to contribute, through the outputs, results and impacts of the supported projects, to achieving the vision of transformation and modernisation of the energy sector in accordance with approved strategic documents. This will be achieved through the support for energy research, development and innovation with a focus on: (i) promoting public interest projects; (ii) new technologies and system elements with high potential for rapid deployment in practice; (iii) support for long-term technological perspectives; the division to individual sub-programmes is reflective of this. The State budget expenditures for THÉTA for 20182025 total CZK 4 000 million. Non-public funds should then amount to CZK 1 715 million. Thus, total expenditure amounts to CZK 5 715 million. The programme allocation is divided into sub-programmes as follows: sub-programme 1  15 %, sub-programme 2  50 % and sub-programme 3  35 %. Table 58 shows the approved THÉTA budget for 20182025.

The support for the programme is provided by the Technological Agency of the Czech Republic and the Ministry of the Environment is responsible for its content. The focus of the Programme Environment for Life is set by the updated State Environmental Policy of the Czech Republic 2012November 2016. In order to improve the environmental protection in the Czech Republic and to fulfil the applied research, experimental development and innovation will focus on the priority thematic areas of SEP, i.e. sustainable use of natural resources, climate protection and air quality improvement, waste management and recovery, nature and landscape protection and a safe and resilient environment, including preventing and reducing the consequences of natural and anthropogenic hazards.  -157-  The Programme aims to bring new environmental solutions, stabilise and expand the knowledge base, which will make a significant contribution to ensuring a healthy and quality environment in the Czech Republic and sustainable use of its resources, minimising negative environmental impacts of human activities, including transnational impacts; it will thus contribute to improving the quality of life in Europe and in the global context. These solutions will contribute to reducing the impacts of climate change on nature and society, in particular to mitigating the effects of drought and preventing drought, reducing the impact of other meteorological extremes (wind, floods, extreme temperatures), improving air and water quality, improving to the development of circular waste management and the efficient use of raw materials, improving the conservation of natural resources, water, soil and the rock environment, preserving biodiversity and improving the quality of nature and landscape protection, developing environmentally friendly and climate change resilient and safe society. The specific objectives of the programme are as follows: 1. Contribute to adaptation to climate change and to the introduction of economically effective mitigation measures; 2. Contribute to the improvement of environmental components and support the implementation of the circular economy principles; 3. Promote resilient and safe society and nature. The priority areas of the programme are as follows:  climate  measures to protect the climate, adapt to and mitigate the increasingly extreme nature of precipitation and temperature, both in settlements and in the open countryside;  air protection;  waste and circulation management;  protection of water, soil, rock environment and other natural resources;  biodiversity, nature and landscape protection;  environmentally friendly society, safe and resilient environment, specific instruments of environmental protection and sustainable development. The first public tender for the Programme Environment for Life was announced on 12 June 2019. 3.5.1.6 Research infrastructure of the Czech Republic In 2009, Act No 130/2002, on the promotion of research, experimental development and innovation from public funds and amending certain related acts (Promotion of Research, Experimental Development and Innovation Act), as amended, laid down a new specific legislative instrument to support research infrastructure of the Czech Republic. The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports became the central State administration authority of the Czech Republic responsible for financing the so-called  from the public funds of the Czech Republic, wunique research facilities, including their purchase, related investment and activities, which is necessary for a comprehensive research and development activity with high financial costs and technological complexity and which is approved by the government and established by one research organisation for use also by other research organisations. In 2010, the Roadmap of Large Infrastructures for Research, Experimental Development and Innovation of the Czech Republic was prepared for the first time, whose structure corresponds to the ESFRI  -158-  Roadmap and which was updated in 2011 and 2015, when a completely new Roadmap of Large Infrastructures for Research, Experimental Development and Innovation of the Czech Republic 20162022 was prepared112. Since 2010, the Roadmap of Large Infrastructures for Research, Experimental Development and Innovation of the Czech Republic thus represents a strategic document of the Czech Republic which establishes the policy of support and further investment development of large research approach to research infrastructures on national and macro-regional EU level. In the energy sector, the following are considered large infrastructure: (i) catalytic processes for the efficient use of carbonaceous energy raw materials; (ii) COMPASS  tokamak for thermonuclear fusion research; (iii) CVVOZE PowerLab; (iv) Jules Horowitz Reactor  participation of the Czech Republic; (v) experimental nuclear reactors LVR-15 and LR-0; (vi) research infrastructure for geothermal energy; (vii) SUSEN  sustainable energy; (viii) VR-1  a school reactor for research activities. 3.5.1.7 Competence Centres / National Competence Centres Competence Centres The Competence Centres programme was approved by Government Resolution No 55 of 19 January 2011. The draft changes to the Competence Centre programme were approved by Government Resolution No 146 of 27 February 2013. The programme was aimed at supporting the establishment and activities of research, development and innovation centres in progressive fields with high application and innovative potential and perspective for a significant contribution to improving the  following centres focusing on energy were established: Competence Centre for Energy Recovery of Waste, Centre for Advanced Nuclear Technology (CANUT), Advanced Technologies for Heat and Power Generation, Centre for Research and Experimental Development of Reliable Energy, and Centre for the Development of Technologies for Nuclear and Radiation Safety: RANUS  TD. National competence centres A programme for the support of applied research, experimental development and innovation, the National Competence Centres (NCC), was approved by the Resolution of the Government of the Czech Republic No 291 of 29 April 2019. The aim of the programme is to synergistically interconnect the already existing successful centres, which were established with the support of TA CR (Competence Centres), GA CR (Excellence Centres) and operational programmes (especially the R&DI Centres) with other research centres and units into one integrated system. The programme will help to significantly strengthen the segment of research organisations focused on applied research and it will motivate relevant existing research institutes with the aim of concentrating their research and technological capacities in the NCCs, where quality applied research will be carried out according to the needs of the application sphere. As part of the National Competence Centre programme, the National Energy Centre is established.                                                            112  The document is available at: http://www.msmt.cz/vyzkum-a-vyvoj-2/cestovni-mapa-cr-velkych-infrastruktur-pro-vyzkum  -159-  It will be possible to use the programme for synergies and complementary effects with the Union programme Horizon 2020 and its successor Horizon Europe and other international programmes that are in line with the  ii. Where applicable, cooperation with other Member States in this area, including, where appropriate, information on how the SET Plan objectives and policies are being translated to a national context In the area of science and research, the Czech Republic is relatively significantly involved in cooperation with other Member States, both at the level of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) and its other pillars (for example the European Energy Research Alliance113). The Czech Republic is also relatively significantly involved in the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (Horizon 2020). The Czech Republic is also involved in European but also international research within important scientific centres (see, for example, the research infrastructures in the energy sector referred to in Chapter 3.5.1.6). The Czech Republic is also involved in research cooperation programmes of the International Energy Agency. Specifically, it is a Technology Collaborative Platform on Energy Saving in Buildings114; fluidised bed combustion115 and clean energy and education116. In June 2019, the Czech Republic and Hungary also initiated the creation of a V4 platform for energy priorities are yet to be defined, but it should focus on researching smart grids, energy storage, energy efficiency, etc. Emphasis will also be placed on nuclear research. At the same time, a special CzechHungarian Innovation Platform (CIP) should be established. The aim is coordination and possible joint action in the field of energy innovation and technological development with regard to the future, sustainable development and social responsibility. The priorities of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (see Table 59) are already largely taken into account in the State Energy Strategy in areas defining the main R&D priorities. The priorities of the SET Plan have also been taken into account in detail in the preparation of the THÉTA programme, which is specifically focused on the energy sector. The specific reflection / use of the SET Plan priorities and their modifications for the Czech Republic are specifically referred to in the text of the approved THETA programme or in the underlying analyses of this programme.                                                            113  European Energy Research Alliance (EERA) 114  Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems Programme 115  Fluidised Bed Conversion (FBC TCP) 116  Clean Energy Education and Empowerment (C3E TCP)  -160-  Table 59: Priorities under the Integrated Roadmap, Energy Union priorities, 10 SET Plan projects  Source: Information systems SETIS iii.
