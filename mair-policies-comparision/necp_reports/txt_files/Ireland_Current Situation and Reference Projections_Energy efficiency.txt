  182 4.3. Dimension Energy Efficiency i. Current primary and final energy consumption in the economy and per sector (including industry, residential, service and transport) Primary Energy Requirement Figure 11 to 2018. The data presented in Table 24 shows that although there has been a decline in primary energy requirement since 2005, primary energy demand grew in 2018 in all sectors.   Figure 11: Total primary energy requirement by sector Changes in sectoral primary energy consumption presented in the Table 24 below are as follows:  In 2018, primary energy use in households grew by 2.9%, to 3,488 ktoe. The residential share of primary energy was 24% in 2018.  Transport's primary energy use increased in 2018 by 2.6%, to 5,274 ktoe. Transport's primary energy use fell by 28% between 2007 and 2012 but has increased by 25% since then. Transport remains the largest energy-consuming sector, with a 36% share of primary energy in 2018.  Use of primary energy in the commercial and public services sector increased by 1.6% in 2018, to 2,113 ktoe.   share of primary energy was 24% in 2018.   183  Primary energy use in the residential sector and services sector can be considered collectively as energy in buildings as most of the energy use is associated with heating/cooling and lighting buildings. In 2018, primary energy in buildings accounted for 38% of primary energy supply. Overall, primary energy use in buildings has fallen by 15% since 2005 (1.2% per annum) and in 2018 it increased by 2.4%, to 5,601 ktoe.  and accounted for 2% of primary energy use.

Where thermal or transport energy is provided by electricity (e.g. electric heaters and electric vehicles) this energy is considered under electricity, and not under thermal or transport, so that double counting is avoided. In primary energy terms, all three modes have a broadly similar share. In 2005, thermal uses for energy (5,683 ktoe) accounted for the highest share of primary energy at 36% while transport and electricity were equal at 32%. Since 2014, transport has had the largest share, accounting for 35.4% of primary energy in 2018 (5,197 ktoe), followed by heat at 33.5% (4,940 ktoe) and electricity at 31.2% (4,562 ktoe). The modal shares change when moving the discussion from primary energy to final energy. In particular, electricity makes up a far higher share of primary energy than it does of final energy. This is because primary energy includes the large amount of energy that is lost as waste heat in the electricity generation process.    184  Figure 12: Gross final energy demand by mode Final Energy Demand Figure 13. The effect of the economic downturn is evident from 2008 to 2012. It is also evident from this figure that transport continues to dominate as the largest energy consuming sector (on a final energy basis) with a share of 42% in 2018. The shares of the industry and residential sectors have decreased since 1990. In 2018 industry accounted for 21% of final energy use and the residential sector for 23%.  Figure 13: Total final energy demand by sector   185 The changes in growth rates, quantities and shares in final energy demand are shown in Table 25 and summarised as follows:  Overall final energy consumption grew by 4.5% in 2018  an increase of 533 ktoe to 12,324 ktoe  with all sectors showing growth  Final energy use in the residential sector increased by 178 ktoe, or 6.8%, in 2018 to 2,786 ktoe. Correcting for weather, residential energy use increased by 5.5%.  There was a 6.4% increase (90 ktoe) in final energy use in the services sector in 2018 to 1,484 ktoe. Correcting for weather, the increase was 5.2%  In 2018, final energy use in industry grew by 4.7%  117 ktoe in absolute terms  to 2,601 (or a 1.2% decrease in absolute terms) and its share of total final consumption remained steady at 21%  Energy use in transport grew in 2018 by 2.6%, to 5,202 ktoe, and an increase in absolute terms of 134 ktoe.  The agricultural and fisheries sector's relative share fell from 3.0% in 2005 to 2.0% in 2018. Agriculture's energy consumption increased in 2018 by 6.3% (15 ktoe) to 251 ktoe Table 25: Growth in total final energy consumption by sector  Overall Growth % Average Annual Growth % Quantity (ktoe) Shares % 2005-2018 - - - - 2018 2005 2018 2005 2018 Industry -1.2 -0.1 -3.1 1.0 3.2 4.7 2,633 2,601 20.9 21.1 Transport 2.3 0.2 -2.0 0.8 2.8 2.6 5,084 5,202 40.3 42.2 Residential -5.1 -0.4 2.1 -4.0 1.6 6.8 2,937 2,786 23.3 22.6 Services -5.4 -0.4 -1.3 -2.7 5.0 6.4 1,569 1,484 12.4 12.0 Agriculture & Fisheries -34.5 -3.2 -5.1 -5.6 4.4 6.3 383 251 3.0 2.0 Total -2.2 -0.2 -1.2 -1.0 2.9 4.5 12,606 12,324 - -   2027 outlines that the demand forecast in Ireland is heavily influenced by the expected growth of large energy users, primarily Data Centres which can require the same amount of energy as a large town. of all demand by 2027 (in a median demand scenario). In June 2018, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation published a statement   186 that, as large consumers of electricity, data centres pose particular challenges to the future planning and operation of a sustainable power system.  The increased renewable electricity requirement linked to energy intensive investments will be mainly delivered by the development of the new Renewable Energy Support Scheme (RESS) which will also reflect falling costs across a range of renewable technologies and an ambition to increase community and citizen participation in renewable energy projects. ii. Current potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling The heat demand in Ireland is generally low density in nature with around 90% of the heat demand at densities too low to make district heating a viable proposition largely around urban centres. The Climate Action Plan sets out the need to have a suitable policy framework in place to support district heating by the end of 2020.  iii. Projections considering existing energy efficiency policies, measures and programmes as described in point 1.2.(ii) for primary and final energy consumption for each sector at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) The results for energy savings from energy-efficiency policies and measures in the With Existing Measures (WEM) low oil price scenario are included in Table 26. Primary energy savings include the primary energy equivalent (PEE) of electricity savings in the end-use sectors. Autonomous savings are not accounted for in these tables. In the WEM scenario, most national energy-efficiency programmes assumed to continue delivering their 2018 achieved level of savings until the end of 2022. No further activity under these schemes assumed from 2023 onwards. Achieved 2018 savings under the Energy Efficiency Obligations Scheme (EEOS) are assumed to be maintained until 2030. With the exception of the impact of the 2019 domestic building regulations and 2017 non-domestic building regulations, which included over entire forecast horizon, no further savings are included after 2030 in the WEM scenario. The energy-efficiency savings by policy and measure are (currently) modelled based on government expenditure on energy-efficiency support programmes and the anticipated effect of regulations and tax incentives driving energy efficient investments. As energy demand is higher in a low oil price scenario, different scenario input assumptions would lead to different energy-efficiency savings estimates. For example, the energy price input assumption directly influences the savings quantified for the following policy measures:   187  Carbon tax: in a low energy price scenario there are increased savings impact from carbon tax modelled, as there is higher energy demand starting point relative to a high oil price scenario  Smart meters: lower energy prices lead to higher electricity demand and thus higher savings are achieved because the savings are based on a percentage reduction of demand instigated by smart meter plus in-home display  based on price signals and other barriers to uptake. Hence, savings from heat pump uptake are lower in low price scenarios given the reduced impact of fossil fuel price signals on (particularly business) consumers  Table 26: Energy efficiency savings in primary energy equivalent and demand (WEM) Primary Energy Savings (GWhJ) 2018 2020 2030 2040 Household 6,981 8,437 19,218 25,124  Services 6,259 8,224 17,461 20,523  Industry 3,083 3,551 4,020 4,020  Transport 1,596 1,621 4,597 18,108  Cross-Sectoral 1,501 1,630 1,512 1,597  Total 19,420 23,463 46,809 69,372 Total Primary Energy Consumption (GWhJ) 2018 2020 2030 2040 Household 40,799 42,584  43,039  54,550  Services 22,772 26,157  27,292  34,974  Industry 40,216 47,586  53,738 68,557  Transport 62,882 65,698  63,955 62,714  Other 4,253 4,075  4,881 6,641  Total 170,922 186,100 192,905 227,436 Final Energy Savings (GWh) 2018 2020 2030 2040 Household 6,386 7,604 17,221 22,305  Services 4,970 6,476 14,398 16,943  Industry 2,563 2,948 3,450 3,450  Transport 1,596 1,621 4,597 18,108  Cross-Sectoral 1,501 1,630 1,512 1,597  Total 17,016 20,279 41,178 62,402 Total Final Energy Demand (GWh) 2018 2020 2030 2040 Household 33,394  33,720  34,770 43,646 Services 16,250  18,439  20,605  26,736  Industry 29,446  35,709  42,074  53,474  Transport 60,223  62,962  59,826  54,968    188 Other 3,748  3,430  4,235  5,798  Total 143,061 154,259 161,510 184,623 iv.
