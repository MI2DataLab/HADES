7  1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 1.1  Summary i. Political, economic, environmental and social context of the plan The Republic of Croatia is a member state of the European Union (EU) since the 1st of July 2013 and its energy and climate legislation is aligned with the relevant acquis communautaire. Also, the Republic of Croatia is a party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement and regularly submits greenhouse gas inventory reports as well as national reports to the Secretariat of the Convention.  The 7th National Report of the Republic of Croatia under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was published in 2018. In addition to information on greenhouse gas emissions, it also contains conclusions on the current situation and trends of environmental, economic and social developments, as well as recommendations for improving the implementation of environmental protection and sustainable development policies [1]. Emissions of major pollutants into the air (SO2, NH3, NOX, NMHOS) compared to the baseline year 1990 show a general downward trend. Emissions of greenhouse gases are decreasing. According to the number and quantity of pollutants being released into water and/or sea, the largest load is borne by the water catchment area of the Sava River. There are still minefields ("mine-suspected areas") on the territory of Croatia. With regard to the social context of the plan, the development of the regions of Croatia and population of the areas are uneven, with growing pressure on larger cities [1]. The trend of departure from rural areas continues. Due to the emigration of a share of the working age population and the recovery of the economy, the dynamics of decrease in the unemployment rate is considerably faster than the dynamics foreseen in European estimates. The number of inhabitants of the Republic of Croatia is continuously decreasing, whereby the share of the population in the age group above 65 is increasing, at the detriment of decrease in highly-active age groups [1]. Croatia currently has considerably lower rates of economic activity of the population than most EU countries [2]. In the overall energy balance of Croatia, there is a significant dependence on oil, gas and electricity import. Considerable electricity imports are a consequence of market uncompetitiveness and the low level of operation of thermal power plants using old technology, as well as the binding environmental requirements for individual production facilities. Industrial production is continuously decreasing, and the highest revenue is realized by the processing industry.   8  ii. Strategy relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union The five dimensions of the Energy Union are decarbonisation, energy efficiency, energy security, the internal energy market and research, innovation and competitiveness.  There are four key strategies that address the dimension of decarbonisation. The Energy Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia until 2030 with an outlook to 2050 (hereinafter referred to as the Energy Development Strategy) [3] is an obligation under the Energy Act (OG Nos. 120/12, 14/14, 95/15, 102/15, 68/18). For the purposes of developing the Energy Development Strategy, analytical backgrounds have been prepared (the so-called Green Paper [2] and White Paper [4]) presented to the professional and interested public at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019. The analytical backgrounds contain elaborated targets for the use of renewable energy sources (RES), energy efficiency, the internal energy market and energy security. The Energy Development Strategy defines the optimal energy mix and development projects with the aim of ensuring the energy independence of the Republic of Croatia, with particular emphasis on strengthening the production of energy from renewable sources. Also, special attention is paid to the security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness of the energy system. All of the above is in line with the objectives of the EU Directives in terms of reducing consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, sustainability of energy development, competitiveness of the energy system and a positive investment environment. The Long-Term Strategy to Encourage Investment in the Renovation of the National Building Stock of the Republic of Croatia by 2050 is crucial for the use of renewable energy sources in building construction, which, through the nZEB request for new buildings and the renovation of existing buildings, includes the obligation to cover a substantial portion of primary energy for the building by using renewable energy sources at the location of the building or in its immediate vicinity.  The third strategic document for the dimension of decarbonisation is the Draft of the Low-Carbon Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia until 2030 with an outlook to 2050 [5] (hereinafter referred to as the Low-Carbon Development Strategy). The preparation of the Low-Carbon Development Strategy and the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Low-Carbon Development Strategy for a period of five years is an obligation under the Air Protection Act (OG Nos. 130/11, 47/14, 61/17 and 118/18). The Draft of the Low-Carbon Development Strategy was prepared during 2017, when it was submitted for public debate, and refers to the sectors of energy, industry, transport, general consumption, agriculture, waste and land use. The final adoption of the Draft of the Low-Carbon Development Strategy has been postponed in order to align it with the Energy Development Strategy. One of the objectives within the decarbonisation dimension is also adaptation to climate change, which is elaborated in the Draft of the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy in the Republic of Croatia until 2040 with an outlook to 2070 with the action plan (hereinafter referred to as the Adaptation Strategy [6]. The Draft of the Strategy has been subject to consultation with competent bodies and institutions and with the interested public, and the adoption of the document is expected upon the adoption of the Low-Carbon Development Strategy. 9  It should be noted that at the time of adoption of this document, the Low Carbon Development Strategy and the Adaptation Strategy have not been formally adopted. If the final text of these documents will differ from the drafts considered when preparing this document, this will be taken into account within the framework of reporting on the implementation of the Integrated Plan, as well as in the framework of the update to the plan expected in 2024. The key document for the energy efficiency dimension is the Long-Term Strategy to Encourage Investment in the Renovation of the National Building Stock of the Republic of Croatia by 2050, which promotes the need to invest in the building stock. The revised strategy aligns the renovation objectives with the NECP in light of demographic trends and activities in the construction sector, with trends of accelerated abandonment of the existing building stock of poorer properties and gradual growth in new construction. The current energy renovation rate of 0.7% per year will gradually rise to 3% over the 2021-2030 period, with a 10-year average rate of 1.6%. An important element is the introduction of additional measurable indicators of energy renovation of buildings, which will strengthen the process of conversion of the stock into nearly zero-energy buildings, i.e. climate neutral. The dimensions of energy security and the internal energy market have been elaborated within the framework of the Energy Development Strategy. The national strategies relevant to the dimension of research, innovation and competitiveness are the Strategy of Education, Science and Technology [7], the Smart Specialization Strategy of the Republic of Croatia 2016 - 2020 [8] and the Innovation Promotion Strategy of the Republic of Croatia 2014- - 2020 [9]. With regard to these strategies, this document also outlines systematized measures expected to contribute to research, innovation and competitiveness of the Croatian economy in sectors relevant to the energy transition.  iii. Overview tables with key objectives, policies and measures of the plan The key objectives outlined in the Integrated Energy and Climate Plan are the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for the Republic of Croatia for the year 2030, the share of RES in the gross final energy consumption and energy efficiency, expressed as consumption of primary energy and direct consumption of energy. The objective of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for the Republic of Croatia for 2030 is set by Directive (EU) 2018/410 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14th March 2018 amending Directive 2003/87/EC to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments, and Decision (EU) 2015/1814 and Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30th May 2018 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation (EU) No. 525/2013, 10  separately for participants in the emissions trading system (ETS sector) and for non-trading sectors (non-ETS sectors). These are shown in Table 1-1 Table 1-1.: Achieved emission reductions in 2017 and targets by 2030 Scope GHG emissions in 2005 (kt CO2e) Achieved emission reduction in 2017 compared to 2005 Target for the period 2013-2020 compared to 2005 Target for the period 2021-2030 compared to 2005 ETS sector 10,649 -21.4 %  -21 % (EU-wide target) -43 % (EU-wide target) Non-ETS sectors 17,404 -4.2 % -10 % (EU-wide target)  +11 % (target for Croatia) -30 % (EU-wide target)  -7 % (target for Croatia) Targets in 2030 are shown in Table 1-2. Table 1-2: Estimated values of key indicators, Green Paper  Target for 2030 Share of RES in the gross final consumption of energy 36.4% Energy efficiency  Primary energy consumption2 344.38 PJ Final energy consumption 286.91 PJ Measures relevant to individual dimensions of the Energy Union are shown in Table 1-3. Most of the measures are also relevant to reporting on policies and measures to reduce emissions and on greenhouse gas estimates to the European Commission under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) within the framework of preparing national reports and biennial reports of the Republic of Croatia to the UNFCCC, so the table specifies both the abbreviation indicating the dimension of the Energy Union to which the measure primarily refers and the abbreviation used within the framework of the said reporting. Impacts on other dimensions of the Energy Union, adaptation to climate change and the circular economy are listed along with the description of each measure.   2 Primary energy consumption, according to EUROSTAT guidelines, is defined as total energy consumption minus non-energy consumption. 11  Table 1-3 Overview of measures Abbreviation 13  Abbreviation 24 Name Impact on other dimensions

Union energy system and policy context of the national plan The basic indicators of the development of energy consumption and economic indicators such as:   GDP - Gross Domestic Product   TPES - Total Primary Energy Supply   TFC - Total Final Energy Consumption   GEC - Gross Electricity Consumption   NEC - Net Electricity Consumption   TPES/GDP - energy intensity of total primary energy consumed;   GEC/GDP - energy intensity of gross electricity consumption;   NEC/GDP - energy intensity of net electricity consumption; for the Republic of Croatia from 2013 to 2017 are shown in Figure 1-1 [10].  16   Figure 1-1. Basic indicators of energy consumption development and economic indicators for the Republic of Croatia in the period 2013-2017 Between 2012 and 2017, the GDP grew at an average annual rate of 1.6 percent. There was also an increase in electricity consumption, so total electricity consumption grew at an average annual rate of 0.8 percent and net electricity consumption at an average annual rate of 1 percent. Losses of transmission and distribution of electricity also decreased at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent. The trends in the production of primary energy are shown in Figure 1-2. Primary energy production [10]. During the six-year period from 2012 to 2017, primary energy production in Croatia increased at an average annual rate of 0.9 percent. A downward trend was observed in the production of natural gas, while an upward trend was achieved in the production of other primary forms of energy. Natural gas production declined at an average annual rates of 5.6 percent. The fastest growth was achieved in renewable energy production with an annual growth rate of 23.3 percent, while the production of crude oil increased at an average annual rate of 4.4 percent. The energy of utilized water resources increased at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent. In the production of heat produced by heat pumps and in the production of firewood and other solid biomass, production increased at an average annual rate of 1.7 percent and 1.4 percent respectively. 17   Figure 1-2. Primary energy production Trends in energy imports until 2017 are shown in Figure 1-3. Import of energy to Croatia [10].   Figure 1-3. Import of energy to Croatia During the period from 2012 to 2017, there was a trend of increase in import of energy to Croatia at an average annual rate of 4.2 percent. Only coal and coke imports saw a downward trend at an average annual rate of 3 percent, while imports of all other forms of energy increased. Imports of wood and biomass increased at an average annual rate of 43.7 percent, 18  import of natural gas 6.4 percent, import of petroleum products 6.7 percent and import of crude oil 3.9 percent. The average annual rate of increase in electricity imports was 0.6 percent. Energy legislation and climate legislation are aligned with the acquis communautaire. At the implementation level, energy and climate fall within the competence of two ministries - the Ministry of the Environment and Energy and the Ministry of Construction and Physical Planning. The development of the new Energy Development Strategy has begun in 2018. In view of the increasingly stringent restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and the need for long-term energy planning, the Energy Development Strategy covers the period up to 2030, with an outlook to 2050. At the time of adoption of this document, the draft Energy Development Strategy was submitted to the Croatian Parliament. At the same time, the parameters of the Energy Development Strategy are included in the Draft of the Low Carbon Development Strategy, which will integrate energy and climate policies at the strategic level. As part of the preparation of the National Development Strategy by 2030, the Ministry of the Environment and Energy together with the Ministry of Construction and Physical Planning set up the Thematic Working Group on Energy and Sustainable Environment and creates key areas of intervention and strategic projects to contribute to national and EU targets of reduction in CO2 emissions by 40% and increase in energy efficiency by 32.5% until 2030. In order to coordinate policies and measures for mitigation of and adaptation to climate change, in 2018 the Government of the Republic of Croatia adopted a decision on the establishment of the Committee for intersectoral coordination for policy and measures of mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. The Committee acts through the work of the Coordination Group and the Technical Working Group.  ii Current energy and climate policies and measures relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union Dimension "Decarbonization" The decarbonization dimension has two key elements  emissions and elimination of emissions;  renewable energy sources (RES). The issue of climate change on a global scale is addressed by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Republic of Croatia became a party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1996, by passing the Act on its ratification in the Croatian Parliament (International Treaties, OG No. 2/96). The Republic of Croatia is a party to the Kyoto Protocol pursuant to the Act on the Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol along with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 19  (International Treaties, OG No. 5/07) and the Act on the Ratification of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol (International Treaties, OG No. 6/15) and the Paris Agreement, pursuant to the Act on the Ratification of the Paris Agreement (International Treaties OG No. 3/17). The most important regulation of the Republic of Croatia governing climate change is the Air Protection Act (OG Nos. 130/11, 47/14, 61/17, 118/18). During 2018, a number of new EU regulations were adopted, which regulate or restructure the field of climate change. This is the reason why a special Act on Climate Change and Ozone Layer Protection will be enacted, which passed its first reading in the Croatian Parliament's enactment procedure. The Republic of Croatia as a Party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) prepares and submits every four years a national report on climate change reporting on the implementation of the Convention's obligations. The most recent report is the Seventh National Report and the third biennial report of the Republic of Croatia under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) [1]. As a party to the Kyoto Protocol, the Republic of Croatia has set up a national system for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions in the country, and on an annual basis prepares the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Report and submits it to the UNFCCC Secretariat (by 15th April of the current year) and to the European Commission (by 15th January of the current year). The most recent Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report on the territory of the Republic of Croatia for the period 1990-2017 was published in 2019 [11]. In addition to these conventions, the key laws relevant to the dimension of Decarbonisation are:  Environmental Protection Act (OG Nos. 80/13, 153/13, 78/15, 12/18, 118/18),  Air Protection Act (OG Nos. 130/11, 47/14, 61/17, 118/18),  Act on the Deployment of Alternative Fuel Infrastructure (OG No. 120/16),  Energy Act (OG Nos. 120/12, 14/14, 95/15, 102/15, 68/18),  Electricity Market Act (OG Nos. 22/13, 102/15, 68/18),  Act on the Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund (OG Nos. 107/03, 144/12),  Act on Renewable Energy Sources and Highly Efficient Cogeneration (OG Nos. 100/15, 111/18),  Act on Biofuels for Transport (OG Nos. 65/09, 145/10, 26/11, 144/12, 14/14, 94/18),  by-laws for implementation of those laws. In the sector of building construction, the Republic of Croatia is strongly committed to achieving an energy-efficient and decarbonised building stock by 2050. For the purposes of mobilizing all stakeholders in the process of building and renovating buildings to achieve the long-term target of reducing CO 2 emissions by 80% in the building construction sector by the end of 2050, the Ministry of Construction and Physical Planning has initiated a Charter of Cooperation for the Decarbonisation of Buildings by 2050. The contents of the Charter include the achievement of energy and climate targets at the national and EU level through the 20  decarbonisation of the building stock, renovation of buildings and construction of nearly zero energy buildings, which stresses the importance of further reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the share of renewable energy sources, improving energy security and introducing innovation and smart technologies that allow buildings to support the overall decarbonisation of the economy. The signing of the Charter encourages continuous cooperation on the development of the Long-Term Strategy for the Renovation of the National Building Stock and the transition to a nearly zero energy building standard (nZEB).  The signatories to the Charter support and promote the decarbonisation of buildings in their future activities, wherever possible. By the end of October 2019, the Charter was signed by around 50 stakeholders from the business and public sectors5.  In the transport sector, the share of alternative fuel vehicles is still relatively small (less than 3 percent). In December 2016, the Republic of Croatia passed the Act on the Deployment of Alternative Fuels Infrastructure (OG No. 120/2016) transposing into national law the provisions of Directive 2014/94/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22nd October 2014 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure in the part referring to a Member State. Pursuant to the Act, a joint framework of measures for market development regarding alternative fuels in the transport sector and for deployment of adequate infrastructure is defined in the National Policy Framework for Deployment of Alternative Fuel Infrastructure of the Republic of Croatia, which was adopted in Croatia in 2017 (OG No. 34/17). It sets minimum targets for building alternative fuels infrastructure, including filling stations, joint technical specifications for filling and supply stations, user notification requirements, as well as measures needed to achieve national targets. All other issues relating to the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure not regulated by this Act or the NPF shall be governed by the regulations governing the areas of transport infrastructure, physical planning, spatial data infrastructure, construction, energy, energy efficiency, environmental protection, and laws establishing and defining the scope of activity of the Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund. Within the decarbonisation dimension, the agricultural sector plays an important role - both in the context of its own emissions and in the context of its contribution to the use of renewable sources. The Rural Development Programme of the Republic of Croatia 2014-2020 [12] defines priorities and areas of intervention, selection of relevant measures and allocation of funds based on expected outcomes. One of the objectives of the Programme is the efficient use of resources and strengthening resilience to climate change in agriculture, food-processing industry and forestry, emphasizing that the generation of renewable energy in these sectors is a priority for the development of bioeconomy and reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020. Furthermore, the importance of using wood biomass, biomass from agriculture and solar energy in agriculture and the food processing industry is emphasized.

Along with the name of each measure, a document adopting the measure is specified. Table 1-4: Current measures within the dimension of "decarbonisation" Name of the measure Documents Short description Intersectoral policies and measures Committee for intersectoral coordination for policy and measures for mitigation of and adaptation to climate change Air Protection Act (OG Nos. 130/11, 47/14, 61/17, 118/18), Decision of the Government of the Republic of Croatia (OG No. 9/18) The Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the implementation and planning of policy and measures for mitigation of and adaptation to climate change in the Republic of Croatia. Officials from competent state administration bodies were appointed to the Committee. The composition of the Committee, tasks and the manner of the work of the Committee is determined by the Government of the Republic of Croatia at the suggestion of the ministry responsible for environment.  Promoting the use of innovative information and communication technologies (ICTs) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions Plan for Air Protection, Ozone Layer Protection and Climate Change Mitigation in the Republic of Croatia for the period 2013-2017 (OG No. 139/13) Innovative information and communication technologies play an increasingly important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy efficiency. By intensifying their use in public administration, services and manufacturing processes, work productivity and efficiency will increase, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. It is expected that the measure will increase the use of innovative ICTs and monitoring of real energy savings as well as reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. European Union Emissions Trading System Air Protection Act (OG Nos. 130/11, 47/14, 61/17, 118/18), Regulation on the manner of greenhouse gas emissions trading (OG No. 69/12, 154/14) Through an even allocation of emission allowances, participants in the system from all Member States took on an obligation of reducing emissions for the purposes of contributing to a reduction in emissions at the EU level by at least 43% by 2030 compared to 2005. CO2 emission tax for the non-ETS stationary sources  Regulation on unit charges, corrective coefficients and detailed criteria and benchmarks for determining the charge for emissions of carbon The Regulation on unit charges, corrective coefficients and detailed criteria and benchmarks for determining the charge for emissions of carbon 22  dioxide into the environment (OG Nos. 73/07, 48/09, 2/18) dioxide into the environment (OG Nos. 73/07, 48/09, 2/18) stipulates the obligation to pay the CO2 emission tax for all stationary sources emitting more than 450 tons of CO2 per year.

Systematic energy management in the public sector (P.3 [14]; MEN-6 [1])  Informative  The programme is implemented by the Agency for Transactions and Brokerage in Real Property and is based on the public sector's obligation of systematic energy management; the savings in this programme are the result of organizational and informative measures Programme "Energy Efficient Public Lighting" (P.4 [14]; MEN-13 [1]) Financial - Affordable loans Available ERDF funds within the OPCC amount to HRK 152 million (EUR 20 million) for energy renovation of public lighting systems; the programme is implemented through loans secured by the CBRD; the projects within this programme are expected to be completed by the end of 2023 "Green" Public Procurement (P.5 [14]; MEN-14 [1]) Voluntary agreements and cooperative instruments Preparation and implementation of national action plans for green public procurement - the objective is that by 2020 the criteria of green public procurement are applied in at least 50% of public procurement procedures Commercial service sector Increasing energy efficiency and use of RES in the commercial service sector (tourism and trade) (B.4 [14]; MEN-3 [1]) Financial - Grants Affordable loans  Available ERDF funds within the OPCC amount to HRK 300 million (EUR 40 million); around HRK 190 million have been allocated for energy renovation of 77 buildings; utilization of these funds is expected by the end of 2023 Industry Increasing energy efficiency and use of RES in manufacturing industries (I.2 [14]; MEN-17 [1]) Financial - Grants Affordable loans  Available ERDF funds within the OPCC amount to HRK 450 million (EUR 60 million) - the utilization of these funds is expected by the end of 2023; the implementation of the measure started with a public call of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy on the basis of which around HRK 303 million was allocated for 90 projects  CO2 emission tax for the non-ETS stationary sources (MEN-22 [1]) Tax The Regulation on unit charges, corrective coefficients and detailed criteria and benchmarks for determining the charge for emissions of carbon dioxide into the environment (OG 73/07, 48/09, 2/18) stipulates the obligation to pay the CO2 emission tax for all stationary sources emitting more than 450 tons of CO2 per year. The obligated parties investing in energy efficiency, renewable energy and other measures to reduce CO 2 emissions and other greenhouse gas emissions pay a lower tax. 36  In addition to the above measures, the existing documents define a number of measures aimed at providing information and education, which are shown in Table 17.  Table 17. Overview of existing intersectoral measures for energy efficiency  Name of the measure Category of measure  Short description Programme for promotion of construction of new and renovation of existing buildings according to the nearly zero energy standard (B.2 [14]; MEN-1 [9]) Informative  This measure supports the legal obligation and implies education and informing of participants in construction projects and the general public about the standard of construction and renovation of nearly-zero energy buildings Informative calculations (H.1 [14]; MEN-7 [9]) Regulatory  Informative  Obligations of the supplier regarding measurement and calculation of consumption and informing customers about past consumption, which includes a comparison with the average normal or reference end customer from the same category of end customers of the supplier Awareness campaigns and promotion of energy services (H.2 [14]; MEN-10 [9]) Informative  Implementation of targeted promotional campaigns related mainly to programmes for co-financing energy renovation of buildings and promotion of energy services through the national energy efficiency portal Energy efficiency education (H.4 [14]; MEN-12 [9]) Educational  Establishment of a certification system and lifelong learning of construction workers on the subject of energy efficiency  Integrated information system for monitoring energy efficiency (H.6 [14]; MCC-2 [9]) Informative - Monitoring the implementation and achieved energy savings A comprehensive system for monitoring the implementation of energy efficiency measures and verification of achieved savings In addition to the above measures all directed at the sectors of final energy consumption, the existing documents also define measures aimed at the energy infrastructure (generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and heat), as shown in Table 18. It should be noted that the Croatian Energy Regulatory Agency (CERA), on the basis of the Energy Efficiency Act, is obliged to take into account energy efficiency in relation to its decisions on the operation of gas and electricity infrastructure when carrying out regulatory tasks in accordance with the laws regulating the electricity market and the gas market, namely:  - to ensure the implementation of an assessment of the potential for increasing energy efficiency of the gas and electricity infrastructure, in particular regarding transmission, i.e. transport, distribution, load management, interoperability and connection of energy generation facilities, including possibilities of access for energy microgenerators and - to identify specific measures and investments to introduce cost-effective energy efficiency improvements into grid infrastructure, including deadlines for their introduction. In order to carry out the stipulated tasks, the CERA has ensured the preparation of the study "Assessment of Potential for Increasing Energy Efficiency of the Electricity Infrastructure" [17]. The study has analysed measures that affect technical losses (decrease and increase), which 37  are covered in the ten-year development plans for the transmission and distribution system for the period from 2019 to 2028. These measures arise from the need to increase the safety of operations and to meet technical regulations, and related investments are too high to be justified exclusively by the savings that will be achieved by reducing losses. When prerequisites for introducing advanced technologies such as load management are created, the CERA will revise its assessment of potential for increasing energy efficiency of the electricity infrastructure and determine deadlines for the introduction of advanced measures. Table 18. Overview of existing energy efficiency measures for energy infrastructure Name of the measure Category of measure  Short description Revitalization and energy efficiency in existing thermal and hydro power plants (E.1-E.4 [14]; MEN-23 [1]) Electricity generation The activities within this measure are related to HEP, and are further elaborated in the 4th National Energy Efficiency Action Plan. Activities include: reconstruction of water management systems, new steam boilers, optimization and automation of hydro power plants, revitalization of hydro power plants, reductions in own use of heat, new measurement systems, replacement of older primary equipment in power plants with higher efficiency equipment,  construction of energy reservoirs (increase of reservoirs of HPPs, heat accumulators for TPPs-HPs),  application of new technologies in energy transformations (electric boilers, heat pumps, solar collectors), reduction of own consumption, construction of solar plants at the locations of existing HPPs, TPPs and TPPs-HPs, etc. Reconstruction and renovation of hot water pipelines and steam pipelines (E.7 [14]; MEN-24 [9]) Distribution of thermal energy Aging and damaged hot water and steam pipelines result in high losses of energy. Investments in the forthcoming period are secured by utility companies and through ESI Funds within the OPCC in the amount of EUR 80 million. electricity system management and development of the transmission grid (E.8 [14]; MEN-25 [9]) Power grids The measure implies the optimization of the transmission grid topology and loss reduction, as well as grid capacity development by the Croatian Transmission System Operator.  Reduction of losses in the distribution power grid (E.9 [14]; MEN-25 [9]) Power grids The measure involves the reduction of losses in the distribution grid and introduction of advanced meters for end customers by HEP-DSO. For the pilot project "Introduction of smart grids in pilot areas", EUR 20 million has been provided to HEP-DSO from ESI Funds within the OPCC.   38  Dimension "Energy security" Key legislation relevant for the dimension of energy security:  Energy Act (OG Nos. 120/12, 14/14, 102/15, 68/18),  Electricity Market Act (OG Nos. 22/13, 102/15, 68/18),   Gas Market Act (OG No. 18/18),  Oil and Petroleum Products Market Act (OG Nos. 19/14, 73/17),  Act on the Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal (OG No. 57/18),  Act on the Regulation of Energy Activities (OG No. 120/12, 68/18),  Act on Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons (OG Nos. 52/18, 52/19). The most important measures currently being implemented for the purpose of ensuring energy security are shown in Table 19. Table 19. Existing measures to ensure energy security Name of the measure Documents Short description Preparing and publishing the report on security of electricity supply Electricity Market Act (OG 22/13, 102/15, 68/18) The Transmission System Operator and the Distribution System Operator shall no later than 30th April of the current year publish, with prior consent of the Agency, an annual report on the security of supply in the transmission or distribution system for the previous year. Based on these reports, the Ministry prepares its own annual report on the security of electricity supply and expected electricity demand in the Republic of Croatia. On the basis of these reports, the Agency may in cooperation with the Ministry ask the transmission system operator, distribution system operator and other power operators to implement certain measures in order to improve the security of electricity supply. Preparing and publishing the report of the transmission system operator  Gas Market Act (OG No. 18/18), PLINACRO shall by 1st March of the current year prepare and submit to the CERA a report for the previous year, which must include a report on reliability, security and efficiency of the transmission system, gas quality, quality of service, reliability of gas delivery, technical characteristics of the system, use of transmission system capacity, maintenance of system equipment and fulfilment 39  of other duties and realization of the rights under this Act Plan of protection of the power system from large disturbances Electricity Market Act (OG 22/13, 102/15, 68/18) The Croatian Transmission System Operator (hereinafter referred to as: HOPS) is responsible for the reliability and availability of the electricity supply system and proper coordination of the generation, transmission and distribution system with the responsibility for managing the power system in a way that ensures the security of electricity supply. HOPS prepares the Annual report on the security of supply of the Croatian power system, which is subject to approval by the Croatian Energy Regulatory Agency. The measures from the Plan of protection are implemented by all users of the transmission system and are obligatory for them. Intervention plan of measures for the protection of gas supply security of the Republic of Croatia Regulation (EU) No. 994/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20th October 2010 concerning measures to safeguard security of gas supply The intervention plan regulates measures to ensure reliable and efficient natural gas supply, criteria and the method of determining sufficient quantities of natural gas to ensure reliable supply of natural gas to protected customers, schedule of reduction in or suspension of natural gas supply to individual categories of customers in the event of a crisis situation and the contents of the gas supplier's report on the security of natural gas supply. Building and holding compulsory stocks of oil and petroleum products Oil and Petroleum Products Market Act (OG Nos. 19/14, 73/17) The Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency as the Central Authority of the Republic of Croatia for compulsory stocks of oil and petroleum products is obliged to hold stocks in the quantity of at least 90 days of average daily net import or 61 days of average daily domestic consumption of petroleum products in the previous calendar year, whichever is higher. Compulsory stocks of oil and petroleum products are built in order to secure supply of oil and petroleum products in the event of a threat to national energy security, due to extraordinary supply disruptions in the oil and petroleum products market. 40  Dimension of "the Internal Energy Market" Legislation relevant to the internal energy market includes laws regulating energy markets:  Energy Act (OG Nos. 120/12, 14/14, 102/15, 68/18),  Electricity Market Act (OG Nos. 22/13, 95/15, 102/15, 68/18),   Gas Market Act (OG No. 18/18),  Oil and Petroleum Products Market Act (OG Nos. 19/14, 73/17),  Act on the Regulation of Energy Activities (OG No. 120/12, 68/18),  Act on Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons (OG Nos. 52/18, 52/19). With regard to electricity interconnection, first of all, it is necessary to consider the EU target according to which the desired level of electricity interconnection is at least 15% compared to the installed power of power plants in the observed state by 2030. The transmission system in the territory of the Republic of Croatia already meets and exceeds that target many times over. The same applies if the existing electricity interconnection capacity is compared with the peak load of the system or the installed power of RES in the territory of the Republic of Croatia. The most important measures regarding the energy transmission infrastructure are shown in Table 110. Table 110. Existing measures for energy transmission infrastructure Name of the measure Documents Short description Preparation and implementation of electricity transmission grid development plans Electricity Market Act (OG Nos. 22/13, 102/15, 68/18) The Croatian Transmission System Operator (HOPS) is the energy operator responsible for the management, operation, maintenance, development and construction of the electricity transmission grid. Pursuant to the Electricity Market Act, HOPS is the owner of the transmission grid 110 kV to 400 kV, and is obliged to prepare and adopt, with the prior CERA consent, ten-year, three-year and one-year investment plans for the development of the transmission grid Preparation and implementation of power distribution grid development plans Electricity Market Act (OG Nos. 22/13, 102/15, 68/18) Pursuant to the Electricity Market Act and the Distribution System Grid Code, the methodology and criteria for planning the distribution grid development are stipulated. Preparation and implementation of gas transport system development plans Gas Market Act (OG No. 18/18) The transport system operator is obliged to prepare a ten-year transport system development plan and to manage, maintain and develop a safe, reliable and efficient transport system, in accordance with the ten-year development plan. The level of capacity reserve in the production part of the electric power system, in Croatia and in the neighbouring systems with which the Croatian power system is interconnected, enables 41  safe and reliable system operation. The current power system capacity is at a satisfactory level, with potential threats due to the lack of available domestic production capacity, which are currently compensated by high levels of cross-border exchanges, which makes the capacity and security of electricity supply dependent on the availability of cross-border transmission capacity and possibility of power generation in broader regional markets.  Flexibility can be defined as a change in the production pattern or power consumption due to a response to stimulus (price signal or activation) in order to provide ancillary services to the power system, most commonly to the system operator. A market research pilot project is currently underway with regard to ensuring active capacity reserve of tertiary control through manageable consumption for the needs of HOPS. Within the framework of this project, by entering into a contractual relationship with HOPS for the provision of ancillary services of ensuring active capacity reserve of tertiary control, the end customer participates directly in the system balancing mechanism and receives a compensation defined by the contract. Manageable consumption units may be any devices whose consumption can be reduced at the request of the transmission system operator and which are part of the end customer's facility, such as electric ovens, cold stores, pumps, compressors, and the like. Ancillary services and services of flexibility that distribution grid users provide to the distribution system operator are not currently used in the Republic of Croatia. The Distribution System Grid Code that came into effect in 2018 (OG No. 74/18) regulates new services that could be of use to the distribution system operator. The establishment of the ECO balance group is regulated by the Act on Renewable Energy Sources and Highly Efficient Cogeneration (OG Nos. 100/15, 123/16, 131/17, 111/18). It consists of electricity producers and other entities performing the activity of electricity generation, which are entitled to incentive pricing in accordance with the agreements on the purchase of electricity with the Croatian Energy Market Operator (CEMO). Pursuant to the Renewable Energy Sources and High Efficiency Cogeneration Act, CEMO is designated as the head of the ECO balance group with the obligation to manage the ECO balance group, plan the production of electricity for the ECO balance group and sell the electricity produced by members of the ECO balance group in the electricity market in a transparent and impartial manner. With regard to consumer protection, competitiveness and development of the retail electricity market, one of the key indicators is the rate of supplier switching by end customers. The rate of supplier switching by end customers in the entrepreneurship category is higher than in the household category. The main reason is the regulatory framework for public procurement, whereby specific end customers from the entrepreneurship category are obliged to regularly issue tenders for selection of the most favourable electricity supplier. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) for measuring points from the household and entrepreneurship category in the Republic of Croatia is currently higher than 2,000, which means that the concentration on the retail electricity market (from the shares of individual suppliers) is satisfactory according to the assessment of the European Commission. 42  The basic prerequisite for enabling and developing energy management is the introduction of an advanced measurement system. Measures in the area of consumer protection are shown in Table 111. Table 111. Existing consumer protection measures Name of the measure Documents Short description Informative calculations Energy Efficiency Act (OG Nos. 127/14, 116/18) Obligations of the supplier regarding measurement and calculation of consumption and informing customers about past consumption, which includes a comparison with the average normal or reference end customer from the same category of end customers of the supplier Obligations of the energy distributor to enter the data on energy measurement and consumption in the public sector into the national Information System for Energy Management (ISEM) on a monthly basis and provide individual meters to end customers  Energy Efficiency Act (OG Nos. 127/14, 116/18) Energy distributors ensure that, to the extent technically feasible, financially justified and proportional to potential energy savings, individual meters are provided to energy and hot water end customers in households at competitive prices that accurately reflect the actual energy consumption of end customers.  Existing measures to alleviate energy poverty are shown in Table 1-12. Table 1-12 Existing measures to alleviate energy poverty Name of the measure Documents Short description Compensation of energy costs of vulnerable customers Regulation on criteria for acquiring the status of vulnerable energy customers from networked systems (OG No. 95/15) Electricity customers from the household category pay an additional charge on the electricity price. The supplier charges it to the customers in accordance with the end-customer supply agreement and pays the collected funds to the state budget. These funds are used for financing vouchers in the amount of HRK 200.00 for vulnerable customers. Capacity building for eliminating energy poverty (H.3 [14]) 4th National Energy Efficiency Action Plan In 15 cities with more than 30,000 residents, consulting mechanisms for vulnerable customers will be established and energy efficiency measures in households at risk of energy poverty will be implemented. Programme for elimination of energy poverty (H.5 [14]) 4th National Energy Efficiency Action Plan Planning and launching a systematic programme to combat energy poverty through implementation of energy efficiency measures. The Program will define a list of available measures and co-financing rates for individual measures. 43  Dimension "Research, Innovation and Competitiveness" The most important national documents pertaining to the dimension "Research, Innovation and Competitiveness" are: - Education, Science and Technology Strategy of the Republic of Croatia (2014), - Smart Specialization Strategy of the Republic of Croatia for the period from 2016 to 2020, - Innovation Promotion Strategy of the Republic of Croatia 2014-2020 and - Research Infrastructure Development Plan in the Republic of Croatia (2016). In order to define the scope of work, work methods, funding sources and the institutional framework in the field of research and innovation, clear and comprehensive legal regulations are required. National legislation transposes all relevant regulations, directives and other EU legal acts to ensure that the legal framework of the Republic of Croatia complies with the basic operational principles of other EU Member States. The legal framework encompasses legal acts related to research and innovation in general and specific legal regulations governing the area of energy and climate. The legal framework defining private and public investments in research, development and innovation includes the following acts:   Act on Investment Promotion and Improvement of Investment Climate (OG Nos. 111/12, 28/13),   Act on State Aid for Research and Development Projects (OG No. 64/18)   Public Procurement Act (OG No. 120/16) and  Small Business Development Promotion Act (OG Nos. 29/02, 63/07, 53/12, 56/13,121/16). The Act on Investment Promotion and Improvement of Investment Climate regulates the promotion of investments and improvement of the investment climate in the Republic of Croatia, as well as other related issues. The objective of the Act is to stimulate economic growth and implement the economic policy of the Republic of Croatia, to include it in international trade and to strengthen the investment and competitive capacity of Croatian entrepreneurship. The Act on State Aid for Research and Development Projects regulates requirements for granting state aid for research and development projects in the horizontal aid category for research and development, the competences of the bodies of the Republic of Croatia with regard to granting state aid for research and development projects, the procedure for determining the fulfilment of conditions for exercising rights, record keeping and reporting as well as other issues related to the exercise of the right to aid for research and development projects. The purpose of the Act is to increase private sector investments in research and development, increase the number of entrepreneurs investing in research and development and foster cooperation between entrepreneurs and organizations for research and dissemination of knowledge in research and development projects, whereby research and development includes creative and systematic work undertaken for the purpose of increasing 44  knowledge - including knowledge of humanity, culture and society - and developing new applications of existing knowledge. Research and development activities must include five basic criteria: new knowledge (as the objective of activity), creative (new concepts, ideas and methods that enhance existing knowledge), uncertain in terms of outcome, systematic (planned with secured funds and by recording outcomes) and transferable (outcomes are transferable as new knowledge) and/or reproducible (outcomes can be reproduced). The Public Procurement Act defines one of the public procurement procedures as a "partnership for innovation". The public contracting authority may use partnership for innovation if it needs innovative goods, services or works that cannot be realized through the supply of goods, services or works already available on the market. Partnership for innovation seeks to develop innovative goods, services or works and subsequently procure them, provided that they are consistent with performance levels and maximum costs agreed between the public contracting authority and participants. This instrument stimulates innovations that affect demand for innovation, while grants to enterprises affect the supply of innovation. The Small Business Development Promotion Act regulates the basis for the implementation of small business incentives, including grants for research, development and application of innovations and introduction of modern technologies.  In addition to the said acts, the area of research, development and innovation is regulated in more detail by various ordinances and guidelines.  Efficient infrastructure is required to conduct research and development. It encompasses primarily public and private institutions that facilitate the implementation of these activities, followed by R&D segments in the private sector and additionally individual communication channels. These channels mutually connect individual institutions and research and development institutions with the real sector which enables commercialization and actual use of innovations and patents.  The institutional framework that supports the implementation of research, development and innovation, and enables aid and incentives in this area includes the Ministry of Science and Education and the Ministry of Economy, Entrepreneurship and Crafts, which propose specific legal measures and incentives and are responsible for the implementation of stipulated measures. In addition, the Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds provides support in the use of EU funds for research, development and innovation through various structural and investment funds and programmes. The Ministry of the Environment and Energy, through funds from auctions within the system of emissions trading, supports research and development in the area of mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. The institution that supports scientific, higher education and technology programmes is the Croatian Science Foundation, for the purposes of development of science, higher education and technological development in the Republic of Croatia, with the ultimate goal of ensuring social and economic development and promoting employment. The most significant business entity in charge of providing support for research, development and innovation projects is the Croatian Agency for Small Business, Innovation and Investment 45  (HAMAG-BICRO) which provides support to entrepreneurs during all developmental phases of business ventures - from idea research and development to commercialization and placement on the market. Additional support to research, development and innovation is provided by the Croatian Chamber of Economy, which established the Innovation Council for Industry, the Croatian Chamber of Trades and Crafts and the Croatian Employers' Association. It is also important to mention the Agency for Mobility and EU Programmes (AMPEU), which has been implementing EU lifelong learning programmes since 2009 and is currently the national contact point for Horizon 2020. In order to stimulate the development and growth of the Croatian economy, the Government of the Republic of Croatia has decided to group all public, private and science and research representatives in innovative sectors, with the aim of strengthening the competitiveness of Croatian companies, and consequently the Croatian economy and society. Competitiveness clusters in the Republic of Croatia are designed as non-profit organizations that bring together the best businesspeople in a particular sector - small, medium and large entrepreneurs, representatives of regional and local self-government and science and research institutions, in order to create synergy and establish cooperation with the aim of strengthening the competitiveness of economic sectors at the national level. So far 13 competitiveness clusters have been established.  iii. Key issues of cross-border relevance Key issues of cross-border significance are the integration of energy markets, major infrastructure projects near the national border and cross-border infrastructure projects, international scientific and research cooperation related to the dimensions of the Energy Union, and other activities that may affect other EU Member States. iv. Administrative structure of implementing national energy and climate policies The umbrella institution for the implementation of national energy and climate policies is the Ministry of the Environment and Energy, its Energy Directorate and Directorate for climate, sustainable development and air, soil and light pollution protection, and the Institute for the Protection of the Environment and Nature.  The preparation and management of the GHG inventory in Croatia is the responsibility of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy (MEE), the national contact point under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Institute for the Protection of the Environment and Nature within the MEE is responsible for organizing the preparation of the greenhouse gas inventory,  collecting activity data, developing a quality assurance and quality control plan (QA/QC plan), implementing inventory quality assurance procedures, archiving data, keeping records and reporting on authorized legal entities participating in the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol, selecting the authorized persons to prepare the inventory of greenhouse gases and ensuring access to data and documents for the purpose of technical inspections of the inventory. In addition, the Institute for the Protection of the 46  Environment and Nature plays an important role in the administration of user accounts of Croatian participants in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).  The National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency also operates within the MEE as a special organizational unit. It coordinates a large number of stakeholders involved in defining, and more importantly, implementing the energy efficiency policy in Croatia, systematically monitors the implementation through the system of monitoring, measurement and verification of energy savings, and prepares reports and informs the general public about plans, implemented measures and their effects. In addition to the Ministry of the Environment and Energy, the Ministry of Construction and Physical Planning also has an important role in the implementation of national energy and climate policies and is responsible for creating policies and measures to achieve the set energy savings targets in buildings. The Ministry of Construction and Physical Planning prepares laws and regulations, strategies and programmes in connection to long-term integral renovation of buildings: family houses, apartment buildings, commercial non-residential buildings and public sector buildings. The Ministry also performs activities as a Level 1 Intermediate Body for the use of ESI funds within the OPCC. The Ministry of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure is responsible for national policy, action plans and strategies related to the development of infrastructure to encourage the use of alternative fuels in transport and other measures to improve energy efficiency in transport. At the implementation level, the Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund (EPEEF) plays an important role. The EPEEF is responsible for co-financing of measures defined in the national energy and climate plans, and acts as an intermediate body level 2 for the use of ESI funds under the Operational Programme Competitiveness and Cohesion 2014 - 2020, in parts relevant to energy and climate. The EPEEF also allocates the funds collected from emissions through auctions in the EU market according to the Plan for the use of funds acquired from the sale of emission allowances through auctions in the Republic of Croatia for the period from 2017 to 2020 (OG No. 19/18). The EPEEF also manages the funds paid by energy suppliers in the event of failure to fulfil their obligations under Article 13 of the Energy Efficiency Act and is obliged to invest them in alternative measures. In the area of energy efficiency, the Agency for Transactions and Brokerage in Real Property has an important role in the implementation of the energy renovation programme for public sector building on the energy service model and systematic energy management in the public sector, all in accordance with the powers defined by the Energy Efficiency Act (OG Nos. 127/14, 116/18). The Croatian Energy Regulatory Agency (CERA) regulates energy activities and is responsible for the improvement and implementation of by-laws, issuing licenses, setting tariffs, certifying the eligible producer status, etc.  The Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency provides operational support to competent bodies in activities of hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, geothermal waters for energy purposes, 47  underground storage of natural gas, as well as in permanent disposal of gases in geological structures and activities for ensuring compulsory stocks of oil and petroleum products. The Croatian Energy Market Operator (HROTE) performs the public service of organizing the electricity and gas market and analysing and proposing measures for its improvement. It also performs tasks related to the system of incentives for electricity production from renewable energy sources and cogeneration, which involves collecting compensation from suppliers and calculating and allocating funds on the basis of concluded contracts with eligible producers entitled to an incentive price.  The transmission/distribution system operators (HOPS/HEP-ODS) are responsible for transmission and distribution of electricity within the grid, the gas transmission network operator is PLINACRO d.o.o., whereas the oil storage system operator (JANAF) has the role of transport and storage of oil and petroleum products. It should also be noted that energy suppliers are the stakeholders that will play a key role in achieving the targets of energy efficiency policy in the future. As from 2019 suppliers will be required to achieve energy savings by investing in and stimulating energy efficiency improvements by end customers or by payments to the EPEEF.  1.3 Consultations and involvement of national and Union entities and their outcome i. Involvement of the national parliament  In October 2019, a workshop organized by the Committee on European Affairs and the European Forum for Renewable Energy Sources (EUFORES) was held in the Croatian Parliament under the title: "The Clean Energy Package and the National Energy and Climate Plans - Outlook for Renewable Energies in Croatia" during which the Draft of the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan was presented and discussed.  ii. Involvement of local and regional authorities Local and regional bodies participated in the preparation of the Draft of the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan, but also in the preparation of all key strategic documents that served as the basis for the plan. The local and regional bodies participated in consultative workshops organized within the framework of preparation of the Draft of the Low-Carbon Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia until 2030 with an outlook to 2050, and via e-consultations at events organized within the public presentation of the Green Paper and the White Paper, and via e-consultations in the process of preparation of the Energy Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia until 2030 with an outlook to 2050.  48  Local and regional bodies also participated in a preliminary e-consultation in the process of preparation of the Draft of the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan held in November and December 2018. The second round of workshops was organized upon the completion of all sections of the Draft in July 2019, as part of thematic cross-sectoral workshops open to all stakeholders. In October 2019, a meeting was organized with representatives of regional energy agencies, at which the Draft was presented and finalized, and then submitted for e-consultation.  The e-consultation process is open to all stakeholders, including representatives of local and regional bodies. iii. Consultations of stakeholders, including the social partners, and engagement of civil society and the general public During 2018 and 2019, the stakeholders, including social partners, civil society and the general public, actively participated in a series of consultative workshops organized within the framework of preparation of the Draft of the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan, preparation of the Draft of the Low-Carbon Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia until 2030 with an outlook to 2050, at events organized within the public presentation of the Green Paper and the White Paper, which will serve as a basis for the preparation of the Energy Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia until 2030 with an outlook to 2050, and via e-consultations in the procedure of preparation of the draft and final version of the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan and the Energy Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia until 2030 with an outlook to 2050. In particular, the stakeholders were actively involved in the workshops related to the preparation of the draft and completion of the final version of the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan. The first round of workshops related to the preparation of the draft was organized in November 2018. The second round of workshops related to the preparation of the final version of the plan was organized in July 2019 (within thematic cross-sectoral workshops). The first draft of the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan was submitted for e-consultation during December 2018, when 90 comments were received. The revised draft of the plan was submitted for e-consultation in October 2019. iv. Consultations of other Member States  Consultation with other Member States took place at two levels:  indirect presentation of the draft and final version of the plan;  direct presentation of the draft and final version of the integrated energy and climate plan. 49  The text of the Draft of the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan was translated into English, submitted to the European Commission and published on the website of the MEE at the same time as the Croatian version of the Draft was submitted and was thus made available to all Member States, allowing indirect consultation with Member States. There were also activities related to the direct presentation of the draft and the final version of the plan. The process of preparing the Draft of the Integrated Energy and Climate Plan was presented to representatives of the Energy Union member states at the meeting of the Technical Working Group on Energy and Climate held on 9th October 2018. The Republic of Croatia is one of the EU Member States that has expressed interest in participating in the work of the Energy Union bodies and is available to transfer its experiences in developing the Plan to the Member States of the Energy Union. Also, Croatian representatives participated in a regional workshop held in Ljubljana in July 2019. This workshop was organized by the Ministry of Infrastructure of the Republic of Slovenia, and was attended by representatives from Slovenia, Austria, Italy, Hungary and Croatia. The aim of the workshop was to identify possible areas for cross-border and regional cooperation. Results of regional cooperation are presented in chapter 1.4 Regional cooperation in the preparation of the plan. v. Iterative process with the Commission  Representatives of the MEE participated in the work and meetings of the Technical Working Group on National Energy and Climate Plans of the European Commission. The first draft of the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan was submitted to the European Commission at the end of December 2018. After the draft was submitted to the European Commission, the text was further edited and amended in parts related to the evaluation of impact of measures and for the dimension of research, innovation and competitiveness, which were underrepresented in the Draft. During 2019, several bilateral meetings were held with the European Commission, which submitted its comments and recommendations on the draft of the national integrated energy and climate plan at the end of June 20196. Recommendations and comments were largely adopted in the final text of the plan, and the Ministry of the Environment and Energy submitted to the European Commission replies to all the comments received.   6 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/hr_rec_en.pdf 50  1.4 Regional cooperation in preparing of the plan i. Elements subject to joint or coordinated planning with other Member States Elements of cross-border significance are:  integration of energy markets,  major infrastructure projects near the national border and cross-border infrastructure projects,   international scientific and research cooperation related to the dimensions of the Energy Union, and  other activities that may affect other EU Member States. Key activities requiring coordinated planning with the neighbouring Member States were identified at a regional workshop held in Ljubljana in July 2019, organized by the Ministry of Infrastructure of the Republic of Slovenia. At that workshop, the Member States identified the need and opportunity for further regional cooperation on topics covered by the Integrated Energy and Climate Plan and the Energy Union. Representatives of the competent ministries of Slovenia, Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia participated in the workshop. Some of the topics subject to joint or coordinated planning with other Member States are already being addressed at EU level. This primarily includes the integration of the energy market and the implementation of major infrastructure projects of common interest (PCI) funded by the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). On the other hand, scientific and research cooperation is a much broader topic, and further cooperation is needed here, mainly at the user level. The Horizon 2020 Framework Programme is of particular importance in this context and will continue as the Horizon Europe Framework Programme during the period covered by the plan. Apart from the above, cooperation is also important in the implementation of projects and exchange of experiences, which needs special attention. Joint projects are of particular importance and, given the relatively low potential for individual Member States, will have a better implementation potential if the needs of several countries are combined (e.g. energy renovation of public or cultural property, etc.). However, all of these topics must serve to strengthen joint activities in the future, which should be primarily promoted through regional workshops that would present examples of good practice and serve as meeting points for particular professionals, institutions and companies that could conclude and implement future joint projects on topics covered by the integrated energy and climate plan and areas of the Energy Union. 51  ii. Explanation of how regional cooperation is being considered in the plan  In order to establish regional cooperation on finalization and subsequent implementation of the plan, the first regional workshop organized by the Ministry of Infrastructure of the Republic of Slovenia was held in Ljubljana in July 2019. The workshop served as a basis for developing cooperation between Member States on the topics covered by the integrated energy and climate plan. Regional cooperation is considered in the plan in two key segments:  past cooperation;  potential future cooperation. The past cooperation was presented at the workshop in Ljubljana, where it was emphasized that the Republic of Croatia has a particularly good cooperation with the Republic of Slovenia and Hungary, in terms of establishment of the energy infrastructure, security of supply and integration of energy markets. Potential future cooperation was also discussed at the regional workshop. It is primarily aimed at continuing the integration of energy markets and further strengthening of the cooperation between transmission system operators. It is particularly important to emphasize the need to collaborate in new and still underexplored areas and to encourage joint scientific and research work. In this context, the Republic of Croatia singled out issues such as hydrogen, battery development, and CO 2 capture and storage as particularly important, with the willingness to extend cooperation to other areas in the future. The establishment of regional cooperation within the framework of the initiative "Clean Energy for the EU Islands", primarily with the Republic of Italy and other Mediterranean EU Member States, is also expected. Also, upon completion of the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan, the Republic of Croatia will make available to all EU Member States the text of the plan in Croatian and English and will be available for consultations on the contents of the document. This will further foster regional cooperation with already identified Member States and other interested Member States.
