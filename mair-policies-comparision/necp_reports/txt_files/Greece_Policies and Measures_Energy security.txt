177 3.5 Energy security The definition of policy measures for security of supply over the period 2021-2030 aims to cover five different policy priorities (PP4.1-PP4.5), which are presented in Figure 7. PP4.1: Increasing diversification of energy sources and import routes regional energy hub PP4.3: Reducing energy dependency and developing domestic energy sources adequacy PP4.5: Readiness of Greece to cope with constrained or interrupted energy supply Figure 7: Policy Priorities for Security of Supply in the period 2021-2030. The main priority of the country is to increase diversification of sources and import routes in order to enhance security of energy supply. At the same time, reducing energy dependence while developing domestic energy sources, compatible with the objectives of enhancing RES penetration, is obviously a constant priority, especially in the context of long-term energy planning. However, as long as this energy dependence remains high and to avoid events such as the energy crisis that the country faced in 2008-2009 and more recently, at the end of 2016 and early 2017, diversification of energy sources and suppliers from third countries is needed, so as not to depend on a single fuel or a single geographical area or a single pipeline, to promote RES penetration and, most importantly, to promote energy efficiency improvement actions, which should be a top priority in all aspects of energy planning in the country. Msystems to allow high penetration of RES plants, and reducing energy dependence, it is adjacent countries, to promote the deployment of new high energy-efficiency power plants with high response rates, to install electricity storage systems and to promote demand response systems. Meanwhile, the promotion of major electricity and gas transmission projects, the exploitation of potential domestic hydrocarbon resources and the development of storage systems aim to 178 transform Greece into a regional hub that will help increase cross-border energy flows and the security of energy supply of the European Union, in general. measures must be taken to ensure the readiness of the country and stakeholders to respond to the reduction and/or interruption of energy resources and, in this context, to provide for concrete initiatives and implementation of regulatory mechanisms. The policy measures that have been specified in the above policy priorities are analysed separately in the following sections. 3.5.1 Policies and measures to achieve the relevant objectives 3.5.1.1 Policies and measures to increase diversification of energy sources and suppliers from third countries  Each country has as its main policy priority to increase diversification of energy sources and to increase the number of third countries that supply our country with oil, gas and electricity, in order to safeguard its energy supply and prevent energy shortages that will lead to significant economic damage to many sectors of its economy. A measure to meet this priority is to provide incentives to increase domestic energy production, either through the development of new RES plants, coupled with electricity storage systems, or through the exploitation of domestic hydrocarbon resources. In addition, important policy measures to meet this priority are promoting gas transportation and storage projects that will enable the supply of fuel from more countries, developing gasification infrastructures in areas currently based on oil use to enhance the use of dual fuel, markets to help ensure uninterrupted energy flow. A more specific policy measure to this end is to develop or modify the existing power plants so that they can use more than one type of fuel, e.g. gas and oil, but also to promote local electricity generation systems, which will either participate in or become part of the market in times of energy crisis.   179 3.5.1.2 Policies and Measures to Reduce Energy Dependence and Develop Domestic Energy Sources  domestic energy sources. industry and heating, as well as in electricity generation, with particular emphasis on the Non-Interconnected Islands (NII), where over 80% of electricity demand is covered by conventional oil power plants. Replacing imported fuel from RES in both electricity generation, the transport and the heating and cooling sector will reduce energy dependence, since RES, with the exception of biofuels, are a domestic source, to the extent that they are not of EU origin. In general, the projected growth of domestic energy sources in all sectors will reduce energy dependence to some extent. However, the projected improvement in energy efficiency, and consequently the significant reduction in projected energy demand, are also crucial. Achieving energy efficiency improvement targets will make a crucial contribution to improving energy dependence indicators and is a key horizontal priority and prerequisite for achieving both the objective of the security of energy supply and the penetration of RES and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. A number of policy measures are also being promoted, especially for the NIIs, which will help - 2030, it is expected that most of the NIIs will be interconnected with the continental electricity system, which will result in a further reduction in the need for oil imports for electricity generation purposes. electrical systems, based mainly on oil power plants, with the mainland system are being promoted. With the recent completion of the first phases of the Cyclades Interconnection by ADMIE, the electrical systems of Paros (including Naxos, Antiparos, Ios, Sikinos, Folegandros, etc.), Syros and Mykonos were interconnected. The majority of the Aegean islands (Crete, rest of the Cyclades islands, Dodecanese islands, NE Aegean) will also be interconnected with the Hellenic Electricity Transmission System (HETS) in the period 2020-2030, starting with the interconnection of Crete, which will have been completed at the beginning of the following 180 decade. The aim is that, by the end of the following, decade almost all of these autonomous systems will have been connected to the interconnected system. The interconnections already launched by ADMIE and/or its affiliates (Table 22) include:  the completion of the interconnection of the Cyclades islands  the interconnection of Crete (Phases I and II)  the interconnection of the Dodecanese islands  the interconnection of the North Aegean islands. Table 22: Interconnection Implementation Plan. Internal Interconnections Interconnection of Cyclades Phase A: Lavrion - Syros - Tinos - Mykonos 2018 Phase : Paros - Naxos, Naxos - Mykonos 2019 Phase C: Second Lavrion - Syros interconnection (2nd cable) 2020 Phase D: Western and Southern Cyclades 2023-2024: Interconnection 2025: Year of full operation Interconnection of Crete Phase I: 150kV, 2x200 MVA 2020: Interconnection  2021: Year of full operation Phase II (Ariadne): The HETS undertakes all the load of Crete 2022: Interconnection  2023: Year of full operation Interconnection of the Dodecanese islands*  2027: Interconnection  2028: Year of full operation Interconnection of the Northern Aegean islands**  2028: Interconnection 2029: Year of full operation International Interconnections 2nd Interconnection with Bulgaria, 600 MW  2023: Year of full operation * The interconnection of the Dodecanese islands includes the High Voltage interconnection of the islands of Kos, Rhodes and Karpathos and, through them, the Medium Voltage interconnection of the islands of Kasos, Halki, Kalymnos, Pserimos, Telendos, Nisyros, Tilos, Leros, Lipsi, Gyali, Patmos, Arkoi, Marathi and Symi. ** The interconnection of the Northern Aegean islands includes the High Voltage interconnection of the islands of Lemnos, Lesvos, Skyros, Chios and Samos and, through them, the Medium Voltage interconnection of the islands of Ikaria and Agathonisi.   181 For some smaller islands, which are expected to remain autonomous for the coming years, it is also expected, as mentioned above, to significantly reduce the use of oil for electricity generation, while increasing the utilisation of local RES and the installation of storage units. Particularly regarding islands for which no interconnection is planned, at least not for a long time, to reduce the energy dependence of these islands, a significant reduction in oil use for power generation is being promoted, with the installation of modern RES units combined with storage technologies. In particular, a policy measure to make this possible is the adoption of an appropriate institutional framework for the promotion of electricity storage systems, either within hybrid plants or within an independent central warehouse that will address grid saturation and allow the installation of new uncontrolled RES stations, or in the context of installing low capacity storage systems in conjunction with any new RES station. In this direction, it is noted that the installation of hybrid RES plants is promoted, either through (with battery) and on the island of Ikaria (with pumped storage). Moreover, Greece participates  The dynamic penetration of RES, which are called to make a significant contribution to the energy mix of the post-lignite era in Greece and which have been extensively discussed in a previous section, in the period of the European energy transition, should be combined with natural gas that will be the main transitional fuel until the European economy becomes climate neutral. Greece continues to be a growing market in the exploration and production of natural gas in the Eastern Mediterranean. Both the hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation programme in Greece and the programme of TAP (Inter-Adriatic) pipelines, Interconnection of Greece-Bulgaria (IGB) and East-Med pipelines, are important projects that enhance the diversification of EU energy supply and ensure the security of supply to reduce energy dependence on third countries. Although hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation in Greece has been an official policy since 1960, it has not been translated into a project to the extent one would expect. Significant steps to design and implement this policy have been taken at a technocratic level only in the last decade. Examples include the completion of the legislative framework, the elaboration of procedures and practices, the establishment of the Hellenic Hydrocarbon Resources Management Company (HHRM) as a State management body for this activity, and the conduct of studies to develop programmes in areas of Greece.  182  Figure 1: Concessions for hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation. The Hellenic Republic has today assigned 13 maritime and inland areas, including Prinos where the production of crude oil has been going on for four decades, through concession contracts to joint ventures. It is the first time the country has received a large number of concessions, with contractors being mainly European international companies operating on a global scale. The the aim of gradually moving from north to south, starting in western Greece and then in the west-southwest areas of Crete. accompanying projects should include a large port to support exploration and production activities in remote offshore segments. A significant factor will be the depth of water for boat access, storage of equipment and waste treatment. If exploitable stocks are discovered, companies will move into the development of facilities that will cost billions of euros, which will require local involvement and lead to business opportunities in the country, always adopting the best practices of countries with a long tradition in the field, such as Norway. Given these long-term investments, organised training plans will be developed that will allow Greece to build competitive human resources, which is one of the most important components of sustainable development.  183 The State, through the HHRM, also pays particular attention to safety issues related to the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons and thus to environmental protection. Environmental risks are dealt with by the relevant departments of the Ministry of Environment and Energy, which determines the terms and conditions, and approves the implementation steps. As a competent authority, the HHRM monitors, inter alia, the implementation of these contractual obligations by the agents and their associates and intervenes if there are any derogations by any of them. For these reasons, the National Emergency Response Plan for Offshore Hydrocarbon Facilities is being prepared by the Ministry of the Environment and Energy, with the coordination of all relevant State agencies. The Southern Ionian concessions, and especially west and south of Crete, are marked by high water depths where there are no earlier drillings, but the geological environment and geometrical structures of the subsoil have significant similarities to those of Egypt and Cyprus or even Israel, where large deposits of natural gas have been discovered in recent years. The first phase of seismic exploration for vast sea areas began in October 2019 and will last 3 years. The second 3-year phase will follow, during which three-dimensional geophysical studies and site selection for drilling will be carried out over the next 2 years (third contractual phase of maritime concessions). It is expected that the drillings as part of the major maritime concessions will begin no earlier than 2025. If major gas targets are identified in the South-Eastern Mediterranean, the eastern Mediterranean gas limit will shift to the west. By extension, Greece will increase its potential reserves, creating a new balance in its economic and energy balance. Meanwhile, this gas will be a new source of energy for the EU during its transition to a climate-neutral economy. Onshore and offshore drilling for the next five to seven years will allow the rate of exploitation of these deposits to be assessed. The direct economic benefits of production for the Greek state on a twenty-five year period from the commencement of production will derive from income taxation and from production dividends and other consideration. At the same time, promoting a system of redistribution of hydrocarbon resources to support local economies affected by the lignite phase-out of electricity generation is expected to mitigate the direct and indirect impacts at the local level by making this feedback loop a public interest priority.  184 Therefore, in line with the rapid development of RES and the planning needed to upgrade and digitise power grids and energy efficiency improvement measures, Greece in the post-lignite era should make every effort within the next few years to produce natural gas from its own deposits so that it can gradually either cover most of its consumption (5-8 BCM/year) or export to neighbouring countries, which are also strongly energy-dependent on third countries.

The main projects of national and international interest in electrical interconnections and electricity storage units involve:  the completion of the new interconnection line between Greece and Bulgaria (Maritsa - Nea Santa),  the completion of the interconnection with Crete, supporting the prospect of the interconnection of Crete with Cyprus and, through Cyprus, with Israel,  the investigation of new projects to strengthen existing interconnections between Greece and the Republic of North Macedonia and between Greece and Turkey,  the interconnection of the majority of the non-interconnected islands to the Hellenic Electricity Transmission System (HETS), and  the development of electricity storage systems, such as the Amphilochia pumped storage project. Similarly, in the case of natural gas, it is expected that new interconnections be developed and the existing interconnections with neighbouring systems be reinforced, and that new natural gas pipelines be developed, which will have regional interest and strong transmission capacity towards third countriesdevelopment projects have been designed and launched within the framework of the approved Ten-Year Development Plans of the Hellenic Gas Transmission System Operator (DESFA). Furthermore, according to the Natural Gas Market Roadmap, the most important projects of national and international interest concerning pipelines and gas storage units are:  completion and operation of the TAP pipeline;  operation of Revithoussa after the construction of the 3rd tank (increase of LNG storage), drainage capacity;  implementation of the gas interconnector Greece-Bulgaria (IGB);  implementation of the Alexandroupolis Independent Natural Gas System Project (ASFA);  design of the interconnector Turkey-Greece-Italy (ITGI);  preparation works for the design and implementation of the East Med pipeline;  implementation of the underground gas storage facility project in South Kavala; and  implementation of the Greece - Republic of North Macedonia interconnection.   186 3.5.1.4 Policies and measures to promote flexibility, storage and response systems and ensuring  the construction or maintenance of a sufficient electricity generation and interconnection capacity to meet a minimum degree of reliability for  As regards the installation of sufficient power generation capacity, the policy measure that may accompany the operation of the electricity market is the implementation of appropriate power adequacy mechanisms. Respectively, the projected increase in capacity between the National Electricity Transmission System and neighbouring systems, in addition to increasing the diversification of energy sources and supplier countries, will contribute to enhancing the capacity of the System. Moreover, the new international interconnection projects, as well as the upgrade of existing interconnections, sufficiency and transform it into a regional energy hub. Promoting demand response systems will also play an important role in ensuring power sufficiency, in addition to the installation of new power stations and the strengthening of interconnections. In the years to come, as part of the measures to reform the domestic electricity market and strengthen competition, measures will be promoted to increase participation of demand and, in general, of consumers in the electricity market. It is noted that the existing institutional framework has incorporated provisions for promoting demand response systems. In particular, a transitional demand-side policy measure could also be the continuation of the application of the interruptible load mechanism, a measure which at this stage primarily concerns large electricity consumers who are able to reduce their consumption for the sake of system safety and price reduction of the wholesale electricity market. With regard to electricity storage, particular benefits are expected, including the development and operation of uncontrolled/distributed RES sources, in particular due to the absorption of redundant energy, as the penetration of variable RES (mainly wind and solar photovoltaics) is increased and because of its contribution to ensuring the necessary power adequacy for the System, converting energy from uncontrolled sources into distributed energy. More specifically, provision is made for the utilisation and development of various forms of storage, also depending on the costs and the development of the relevant technologies (pumped storage, 187 batteries, conversion into gas, etc.), as well as storage through the promotion of electromobility. A key objective of centrally distributed storage systems is the development of storage units, including existing ones (Sfikia-Thisavros ~ 700 MW) and including projects of common interest (PCIs). The precise additional required power of storage systems, capacity, and technology of storage units will result from relevant studies that will be based on both the economic benefits they provide to the operation of the system and their contribution to power adequacy and flexibility of the System. Policy measures to promote the installation of electricity storage systems may vary depending on the technology and type (centralised, dispersed) of the storage system (such as pumped storage projects in the area of Amfilochia and Amari, Crete). In particular, the promotion of centralised electricity storage systems is possible through the implementation of an appropriate purchasing mechanism, which will motivate the construction of storage systems over other electricity generation plants. The promotion of dispersed low capacity electricity storage systems, which are installed with RES stations in the residential and business consumption areas of the country, is possible through the appropriate modification of the institutional framework which will allow or even oblige the installation of electricity storage systems for every new RES station or new residence that is built. More specifically, small and medium-sized dispersed storage units can also be operated through virtual units, thus enabling the technical optimisation of the total power of these units in the most cost-effective way and in the form of different products to the network providing power balancing at local level. It is worth noting that a policy measure to promote electricity storage systems, in order to enhance the power efficiency of the system, may also be the promotion of electricity. Vehicle batteries through a cumulative representation or even virtual units may constitute an important tool -  Respectively, according to the Natural Gas Market Roadmap, provision is made for the construction of the 3rd tank (increase of LNG storage), upgrade of berthing facilities (projects completed in 2018), and completion of works to further increase the rate of gasification of the s drainage capacity and the implementation of the project of the underground gas storage facility in South Kavala.   188 3.5.1.5 Policies and measures for the preparedness of Greece and of stakeholders to cope with contained or interrupted supply of an energy source  Regarding the preparedness of Greece and of stakeholders to respond to the limitation or interruption of energy supply, provision is generally made to maintain and/or enhance current gas related measures through the new, updated versions of the Preventive Action Plan and the Emergency Action Plan based on the recent results of the National and Joint Risk Assessment Study, and through the solidarity mechanism between neighbouring Member States that the country is required to adopt in accordance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938. Provision is also made to maintain and strengthen the measures contained in the regulation on keeping emergency oil stocks, and to elaborate the Electricity Risk Plan as a result of varying conditions (e.g. extreme weather, malicious attacks, lack of fuel) based on the corresponding EU Regulation. In addition, following its adoption by the European Commission, a new mechanism to ensure sufficient capacity for electricity production (Long-Term Power Adequacy Compensation), is planned to be established in the coming period. Finally, the development of a holistic risk and crisis protection and crisis management plan for critical energy infrastructure will be explored, incorporating all of the aforementioned plans and studies for all energy products and taking into account the specificities and other dimensions of the NECP. 3.5.2 Regional cooperation in this area Concerning the security of energy supply with gas, it is noted that Greece participates in the following groups as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2017/1938: 1. East gas supply risk group: - Ukraine: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Croatia, Italy, Luxembourg, Hungary, Austria, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia; - Trans-Balkan gas supply group: Bulgaria, Greece and Romania.  2.

Similarly, for electrical interconnections, Greece cooperates with neighbouring countries and ENTSOe regional groups. Within the framework of international links, regional cooperations have already been launched with the following countries: Albania Bulgaria Israel Italy Cyprus Republic of North Macedonia Turkey 3.5.3 Financing of measures in this area at national level, inter alia with EU support and the use of EU funds The key financial instruments include:  Domestic resources  Operational programmes under the new programming period  Projects of Common Interest (PCIs)  A specific financial instrument under the 4th EU-ETS period.   3.5.4 Summary of policy measures Table 23 summarises the policy measures planned to achieve the individual energy security objectives.  190 Table 23: Planned policy measures on energy security.
