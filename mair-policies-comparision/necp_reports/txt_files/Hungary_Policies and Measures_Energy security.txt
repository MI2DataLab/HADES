3.3. Dimension of energy security65 i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.366. Electricity market: The main task is to implement the vision of the electricity market. Main elements of the above task in terms of the security of supply:                                                       65 Policies and measures shall reflect the energy efficiency first principle. 66 Consistency must be ensured with the preventive action and emergency plans under Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2017 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and repealing Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 (OJ L 280, 28.10.2017, p. 1), and with the risk preparedness plans under Regulation (EU) 2018/... [as proposed by COM(2016)0862 on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector and repealing Directive 2005/89/EC].  (i) Measures serving objectives relating to capacity compliance and the reduction of import dependency:  Ensuring reliable, flexible and diversified national capacities As regards the future of Hungarian installed capacities, we are focussing on maintaining nuclear capacities and increasing renewable (mainly PV panel) capacities in parallel with efforts to establish a business environment that ensures the availability of gas-fired capacities in a sufficient quantity for ensuring Hungary's security of supply and system flexibility. - Maintaining the level of nuclear production capacities: The construction and entry into service of Paks 2 play a key role in the planned electricity generation portfolio and the decarbonisation of the electricity sector. The independent energy organisation of the OECD, the International Energy Agency (IEA), also notes that to meet the decarbonisation targets, the use of nuclear energy is also necessary in parallel with significantly increased efficiency and investment in renewable energy.67 - Increase of power generation from renewable sources: Solar power station investments are thriving as a result of declining investment costs and aid; future investments can be supported by introducing a cost-effective aid scheme and providing network access. Although conditions in Hungary are most favourable for increasing PV capacities, a moderate presence of alternative renewable technologies on the market can have additional benefits (e.g. they are dispatchable, such as biomass). The above would reduce fossil fuel use, demand for imports, and system regulation risks and costs. - Availability of sufficient gas capacities within the system: Gas-fired power plants significantly contribute to the reliable operation (dispatchability) of the electricity system. The risk inherent to the reliable operation of the Hungarian electricity system is that the service life of a number of gas-fired power plants will expire in the 2020s, and substantial investments are needed to extend their service life. Heat market revenues and rising wholesale market revenues support positive investment decisions. Since these capacities are important mainly for ensuring system flexibility enabling the system integration of renewables with variable rates of availability, the market of system level services should essentially provide possibly lacking investment incentives. If these prove to be insufficient, other possibilities should be explored as well. Thus, it is necessary to regularly monitor the availability of sufficient flexible capacities and  if necessary  to take regulatory measures to prevent situations deemed to carry risk for the security of supply. - Lignite based capacities: With tightening pollutant emissions requirements and rising GHG emission                                                       67 IEA (2019): Nuclear Power in a Clean Energy System. 2019. May (https://webstore.iea.org/download/direct/2779?fileName=Nuclear_Power_in_a_Clean_Energy_System.pdf)  allowances, until CO2 capture and storage become economical it will probably not be profitable to build conventional coal-fired power plants in Europe. The more modern lignite units of the Mátra Power Plant will serve strategic reserves, while the older units will be gradually shut down.   Figure 1  Expected composition of power generation capacities under the WEM and WAM scenarios  Actual data: Eurostat HU EN Beépített kapacitás (MW) Installed capacity (MW) Geotermikus és egyéb megújuló energia Geothermal and other renewable energy Nap Solar Szél Wind  Hydroelectric Biomassza-hulladék Biomass waste Gáz Gas  Oil Szilárd Solid Atomenergia Nuclear energy   flexible capacities  Weather-dependent capacities are playing a growing role in renewable production, therefore the availability and use of dispatchable capacities necessary for reliable power supply in the system operation of the transmission and distribution networks is a key strategic task. Short-term fluctuations in weather-dependent production can currently be balanced mainly by gas-fired power plants, but the spread of innovative solutions (e.g. energy storage and DSR) should also be enabled. In addition, the maximised exploitation of opportunities for increasing non-weather-dependent renewable energy production for enhancing flexibility is also justified. It is essential to promote new types of flexibility services on the market by encouraging energy storage investments within the REAS scheme (detailed in Chapter 3.1.2) and mobilising regulation options on the demand side. It is necessary to encourage energy storage investments and micro-grid solutions (facilitation of operating renewables and energy storage facilities at a single site with regulatory instruments). It is necessary to simplify the licensing process and the accreditation of balancing markets, develop balancing products more effectively using the technical potential of storage facilities (e.g. introduction of artificial inertia-type products), support innovative solutions in seasonal storage and to promote the heat storage of cogenerators. Hungary is also planning a pilot project to enable the support of necessary innovative solutions in the storage of seasonal energy:  Development of power-to-gas technology based on the already operating domestic prototype;  Conversion of surplus electricity into heat and its storage in district heating systems also using electric boilers;  Development of optimal storage and consumption of hydrogen produced with electricity;  Small-scale testing of the commercial application of cold energy and heat storage solutions under operating conditions. Several types of technology may be competitive in relation to shorter term storage. Battery storage facilities may also play an important role in efficiently operating transmission and distribution networks. The Clean Energy Package, however, does not support direct ownership of balancing energy storage facilities by the TSO and DSO, as this could distort competition between storage facilities maintained with balancing revenues and operated on a market basis. Therefore, in addition to the transmission and distribution pilot projects supporting the gaining of necessary operating experience, the long-term model should be based on encouraging market-based storage investments. Beyond the increase of storage investment, it is also essential to mobilise regulation options on the demand side. System-level regulation should cover consumption-side control possibilities already implemented  to a major degree, AFLC (audio frequency load control) and RFLC (radio frequency load control) systems connecting to the controlled connection points. The main regulatory task is to establish incentives that could be the most obvious means of establishing a flexible tariff structure. To ensure a further increase of the DSR potential, it may be also justified to introduce separate products for flexible consumption on the market of system level services. In terms of exploiting the DSR potential it is essential to also create a legal environment supporting the establishment of independent aggregators. (Further details provided in point i. of Chapter 3.4.3.) To encourage the spread of smart metering Hungary plans to prescribe the replacement of conventional meters  upon their expiry  exclusively with smart metering equipment upon fulfilment of certain conditions. (Further details are provided in point vi. of Chapter 3.2.) As regards innovative system balance (flexibility energy storage and demand management), the following pilot projects are planned:  The launch of pilot projects is recommended for DSOs and TSOs within energy storage systems;  The establishment of a complex, pilot-scaled research and development centre is desirable to coordinate and complete currently fragmented research, not covering this entire field, to test the systemic interconnection of various renewable sources of energy and energy storage technologies;  Testing of complex DSR solutions within the framework of a pilot programme, on the level of individual prosumers. Within the framework of the pilot project the testing of solutions is recommended, which offer the DSO a direct option for intervention to optimise the network load of individual consumers. Since the new types of flexibility services will mainly be used by system operators and distributors, they are expected to develop incentive schemes ensuring a growing offer of such capacities. For preventing limited capacities and ensuring price signals encouraging investment, it is necessary to introduce marginal cost-based and scarcity pricing, and to eliminate price caps on balancing markets. It is also necessary to improve the profitability of capacities providing flexible services by reducing operating costs and fiscal burdens. It is necessary to assess means by which cogenerators integrated in the supply of district heating (CHPs) can be integrated in the group of regulators, as their production upturn during the winter period could optimally supplement PV power plants producing at higher levels during the summer period. To ensure the development and evaluation of adequate regulatory incentives it is appropriate to test certain procedures and technologies with a regulatory sandbox. To ensure the cost-effective satisfaction of flexibility demand it is necessary to conduct regular exchanges of  experience with countries facing similar challenges and with those possessing operational experience, and to collect experience relating to law, regulation, incentives and technological best practices in this process. Based on the foregoing it is justified to draft a precisely scheduled action plan to improve the flexibility of the electricity system. It is necessary to regularly monitor the availability of sufficient flexible capacities and  if necessary  to take regulatory measures to prevent situations deemed carry risk for the security of supply. (Point iii. of this chapter provides information relating to the distribution flexibility market.)  Guarantee of the security of supply with reserve capacities To guarantee the security of supply in Hungary it is necessary to maintain surplus capacities contributing to domestic power generation under critical circumstances, e.g. on winter days with peak demand or in case of limited access to imports for technical reasons. Such capacities should mainly be secured from sources no longer able to survive on the market, but their technical condition allows their operation to the extent necessary. There are various means of maintaining emergency reserves, e.g. in the form of strategic reserves, functioning as a component of the capacity mechanism, or  as part of system level services  with regulatory (tariff) sources through the network (load redistribution)/disruption reserve system to ensure that such capacities earn sufficient revenue for maintaining an adequate technical condition. When selecting the means, it is necessary to consider that strategic reserve is deemed to be a capacity mechanism, hence it is subject to strict preliminary licensing requirements prescribed by Regulation (EU) 2019/943 on the internal market for electricity. Although several system operators have maintained network reserves in the past, implementation of the Clean Energy Package prescribes their purchase within a competitive framework. The relevant Union regulation is less stringent than in relation to strategic reserves, and the system operator is able to use such capacities in a more flexible manner. Under the technology-neutral scheme jointly developed by the distributors, also allowing room for solutions building on storage and demand side responses, it could be possible to guarantee a capacity fee in the longer term for capacities with such capabilities.  Cross-border capacities (import capacities) Cross-border capacities are further increased with new interconnections to Slovakia (and subsequently planned to Slovenia). Upon the increase in Slovakian-Hungarian cross-border capacities, the import capacity of Hungary is expected to rise by a total of 1 450 MW in the early 2020s. In addition to improving access to lower priced wholesale markets, the expansion toward Slovakia also contributes to strengthening the security of supply in regions of Eastern Hungary. Implementation of the Slovenian line may further increase cross-border capacities by around 1 000 MW. Pursuant to requirements of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 on the internal market for electricity, a larger volume  of capacity should be announced on the market for existing cross-border lines as well, thus trade flows will also become more efficient. (See Chapter 2.4.2 for PCI projects with Hungarian involvement.) (ii) Measures planned for determining the level of the security of supply Determination of the level of the security of supply in Hungary based on LOLE, LOLP, LOLH indicators, identification of security of supply risks and monitoring of potentially negative economic effects (VOLL), regular review of such risks, determination of target values; coordination of the targeted incentive mechanisms of the Hungarian electricity system based on targets, actual and expected values. (iii) The establishment of an infrastructure, regulatory and market environment supporting the integration of renewables prevent the network connection of renewable producers, transparency and economic efficiency should be improved in distributing network connection capacities. To this end, non-discriminatory capacity auctions could be held, for example, on a regular basis. If current regulations and technical standards remain in effect, the total national public and private investment requirement for conventional network development necessary for satisfying demand arising on behalf of large consumers and attributable to electrification trends expected between 2019 and 2030 in the supply areas of Hungarian distributors will exceed HUF 200 billion. Assuming current network connection and network usage practices applicable to PV power plants, the amount of public and private investment necessary for new PV connections expected up to 2030 exceeds HUF 300 billion. The goal is to develop complex price control encouraging use of innovative, smart solutions and the purchase of flexibility services (e.g. energy storage, demand side response) on the market. In the course of reviewing the distribution price control scheme, the study of British regulatory practice is an option. While Hungarian price cap regulation determines ex ante revenue requirements based on costs incurred by licensed distribution network operators earlier, under the British model the regulatory authority determines the opening business plans of the licence holders. As an advantage of TOTEX regulation, while regulation separately encourages asset-intensive investments, in the case of TOTEX regulation the network companies may have an interest in managing problems arising from network congestion with cheaper IT technologies or purchased services (e.g. energy storage facilities). impedes the spread of energy storage technologies, the types of measures that may eliminate such impediment, and the extent to which a favourable NAF regulation structure can encourage the spread of  storage technologies. Distributors should be aware that the operation of the network will not be sustainable without active system operation. It is necessary to establish the market mechanisms necessary for active operation of the distribution network, distributors should develop voltage regulating and congestion managing distribution flexibility markets, established in consideration of local, regional characteristics, providing price indicators. necessary to finance the cocosts of developing the regulatory system and related market. Distribution flexibility should be kept within the competence of distributors, as it affects localisation and local network operation. The market of system level services and distribution flexibility capabilities should also be kept separate in the long term, with high-level data exchanges. At the same time, distributors should develop a framework of cooperation with the system operator, amounting to the close coordination of the distribution flexibility market and the market of system level services. On the level of the system operator, the strengthening of international cooperation aimed at the sharing of balancing capacities can significantly contribute to ensuring flexibility necessary for the integration of renewables. (iv) Ensuring the cost-effectiveness of integrating renewable investments It is very important that the amount of aid is adjusted to the decrease in investment costs. Hungary plans to partially offset new investor burdens arising from introduction of free market sales and dispatching obligations by the following means:  Reliable meteorological forecasting  with large area coverage  is necessary for efficient scheduling required under Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 on the internal market for electricity. Since the cost of implementing such a system exceeds the resources of renewables producers, but its implementation also results in substantial external benefits, the Government shall assume financial support of the advanced development of a forecasting system developed by the OMSZ;  Drawing up of a compensation, i.e. balancing aid scheme, to enhance the regulatory capacity of FIS producers and REAS-FIS producers with a capacity of less than 0.5 MW. If the rise in the cost of producer balancing energy is caused by poor scheduling, it reduces the amount of compensation, hence the burdens of cost bearers as well;  Encouragement of diversified renewable portfolios: exploitation of national bioenergy potential and small-scale waterpower production capacities, in addition to solar energy;  Instead of the mandatory participation of renewable electricity generation in the FIS balance group managed by the system operator as balance responsible party, encouragement of joining a market balance group, with maintained aid conditions, to promote market  integration. (v) Preparation of the electricity grid for the spread of decentralised energy production In contrast with earlier practice, renewable energy production is carried out on a decentralised basis, often by connection to low and medium voltage distribution networks. For this reason a prerequisite for rapid growth in the penetration of renewables is the preparation of the transmission and distribution network for managing challenges attributable to the decentralised and to a significant extent weather-dependent production structure. This effort necessitates appropriate regulatory incentives. The increase of the share of and distribution networks, and the development of distribution network operation, as a decentralised intervention capability, and its transparent market mechanisms (distribution flexibility market). Close cooperation is necessary between the TSO responsible for balancing energy and distributors to ensure that the two markets support each other, use at various voltage levels does not cause cross-effects and thereby rising costs. The availability and use of dispatchable capacities necessary for reliable supply in the system operation of the transmission and distribution networks is a key strategic task requiring close cooperation between all market participants, licence holders and regulators. Through its balancing role, the existing natural gas infrastructure can cost-effectively and significantly contribute to this process. Specific measures serving the cost-effective acceptance of decentralised capacities: - Increase of the capacities of existing network elements. - More accurate specification of the still available capacities of network elements by use of innovative technologies (e.g. dynamic line rating (DLR)), under prevailing conditions. -  Establishment of the active system operator role of DSOs: assessment of the establishment of a distribution network system operation and voltage regulation centre, the introduction of distribution flexibility products, and establishment of a platform ensuring the joint operational optimisation of TSOs and DSOs. - Modification of relevant network connection conditions, obligations for consumers with household-scale power plants (HSPP) in a forward system. In relation to equipment installed with the final -inverter) it is justified to define technical requirements in advance and to prescribe conformity with these by the customer. - The mandatory participation of producers with a connection capacity of more than 0.4 MW should be prescribed in voltage regulation. - In relation to all consumers connecting to a low voltage (LV), medium voltage (MV) and high-voltage (HV) network, development of a final customer electricity price scheme (multiple zone times,  capacity and energy based tariff, yearly basic network access fee) consistent with the physical properties and cost structure of the electricity distribution network and encouraging consumers to use more balanced network capacities. - Modification of the regulation (mainly price and tariff control, network connection regulation) of electricity grid companies. - Identification of distribution network congestion and their elimination with market mechanisms (capacity auctions, distribution flexibility market products) to ensure integration of decentralised production. Establishment of opportunities for distribution network system operation. (vi) Establishment of regulatory framework supporting use of innovative solutions on the market Main related topics: system balance, iinnovation, seasonal electricity and heat storage solutions. Further information relating to the above is provided in Chapter 3.5. (vii)  Point i. of Chapter 3.4.3 provides information on strengthening regional electricity market integration and coordinating the operation of gas and electricity markets. Gas market (i) Reduction of import dependency: decrease in consumption and a higher rate of using own resources also contributes to reducing import dependency.  Consumption reduction measures: - We plan to reduce gas consumption for heating by encouraging the improvement of building energy efficiency based on the obligation scheme, programmes that also support heating/cooling solutions based on renewable resources, and by implementation of the Green District Heating Programme that encourages use of renewable resources in district heat generation as well. (More information on this topic is provided in the relevant parts of Chapters 3.1.2 and 3.2.) - Industrial gas consumption will mainly depend on the rate of economic growth; we estimate that it may increase by 0.5 billion m3 (over 2 billion m3) over the year 2016. We support the decarbonisation of industrial production by implementing pilot projects (produced with electricity originating from carbon-free sources).  Use of own gas resources: Hungary's import dependency can also be reduced with the greater use of national resources (natural gas, alternative gas sources, such as biogas/biomethane). - We will encourage use of our own natural gas resources. By guaranteeing the predictability of the concession scheme and enhancing the flexibility of the system we can offset the exhaustion of production inventories with the encouragement of new extraction projects. This requires the fine- tuning of the successful hydrocarbon and geothermal concession scheme. - It is also justified to encourage unconventional hydrocarbon exploration and extraction. Although mining companies are showing interest in unconventional exploration and production, the geological risks remain extremely high. Therefore, to encourage unconventional exploration and production, the State would support the market supply of gas by offering a guaranteed minimum priced feed-in option within the retail supply portfolio. - Encouraging use of alternative gas sources (biogas, biomethane and hydrogen) to reduce natural gas consumption: The increased use of biogas produced from agricultural waste, landfills and waste water treatment plants may also contribute to reducing natural gas imports and CO2 emissions of natural gas consumption. We consider the production, purification of biogas and its feeding into the gas network to have major potential, with an average funding requirement, which may also contribute to meeting targets for increasing the use of renewable energy and decarbonisation. Hungary plans to encourage biogas/biomethane production with the establishment of a feed-in system. Since biogas may also supply cost-effective energy based on local resources to municipalities lacking a natural gas network or using the existing network at a very low rate, and economic activities enhancing the rural population retention ability can be built on biogas production, we plan to also directly support such innovative investments. Energy from biogas may also be a viable option for municipalities lacking a natural gas network. It may be practical to establish a biogas power plant at these municipalities that would supply electricity to the given municipality either as member of an energy community or as a market participant. In addition to biogas/biomethane, Hungary also considers hydrogen produced alternative; the blending of hydrogen produced with electricity generated from carbon-free resources with natural gas offers an innovative option in the experimental phase, with major potential, but with a high funding requirement, which is also relevant for meeting the renewable energy and decarbonisation targets. We are planning to launch a pilot project to test this option on the level of natural gas transmission, storage and distribution. (ii) Import diversification and related infrastructure development Hungary plans to meet the remaining annual import requirement of approximately 6.2 billion m3 with sources as diverse as possible in 2030. To this end it is necessary to implement an infrastructure ensuring access to four independent gas import sources (gas traded on the Russian, LNG, Romanian and Western European markets). This infrastructure provides an adequate basis for further strengthening wholesale competition resulting in the lowest possible prices for consumers by promoting regional market integration (point i. of Chapter 3.3) and market development in Hungary. It is legitimate to ask why it is necessary to continue upgrading the natural gas infrastructure if we are  forecasting a substantial, long-term decline in consumption in both the energy industry and retail sectors. Generally speaking, dependence on purchases from a single supplier and from one direction can be reduced by developing reverse flow cross-border capacities, resulting in a more favourable bargaining position for negotiating purchase conditions. Furthermore, the transmission route of Russian natural gas imports is expected to be supplemented with the alternative southern supply route after 2021, and from 2021 a portion of Russian natural gas is to be imported from the south. Owing to the expected change of the direction of supply, it will be necessary to upgrade the south-west and south-north transit routes and cross-border capacities, and to also enhance the internal network to ensure uninterrupted supply to the region of Eastern Hungary. Reconsideration of the import portfolio, enhancement of gas market diversification: As a strategic objective we will retain the Ukrainian-Hungarian connection point to maintain reverse flow deliveries, but we should also prepare for the possibility of the main direction of gas imports shifting to the currently implemented southern gas transmission route. To this end it is necessary to continue the gas market diversification policy for accessing Black Sea and liquified natural gas resources. We also plan to improve use of natural gas storage capacities. The following infrastructure development projects can further enhance diversification and thereby the security of supply:  Support of the implementation of planned PCI projects (details provided in Chapter 2.4.2)  All barriers had been already eliminated on the Hungarian side at the beginning of the decade before implementing a reverse flow in the Croatian-Hungarian interconnection; based on the necessary upgrades in Croatia from 2021 we can expect to be able to also import natural gas from our southern neighbour through the planned LNG terminal.  Implementation of the reverse flow of the Romanian-Hungarian pipeline from the direction of Romania requires additional upgrades; based on the schedule, the interconnecting capacity of 1.75 billion m3 annually, allowing the transmission of non-interruptible reverse flows, is expected to be ready by the end of 2020. The option of Romanian imports is crucial for accessing Black Sea reserves, because upon the launch of production there Hungary could simultaneously diversify its natural gas purchase sources and routes. The extraction of an annual quantity of 6-8 billion m3 in natural gas is expected from the Neptun field, the most advanced and most promising off-shore production project. The project is currently awaiting a final investment decision; if such decision is made, we plan to increase the capacity of the Romanian-Hungarian interconnector to 4.4 billion m3 annually.  After 2021 most of the supply of Russian gas to Hungary is expected to shift to the southern gas transmission route from the direction of Serbia, the extended second branch of the TurkStream pipeline on the European mainland. With continuing competition on the gas  market, it is essential for Hungary to have access to Russian gas from Serbia (not only from the west and east) in case supply is terminated from Ukraine. With the launch of supply from Serbia, demand for natural gas transits to Serbia and Bosnia would cease, although substantial transit flows may be necessary to Austria. Upon the market-based implementation of the key infrastructure development projects, it will be possible to increase Hungary's cross-border capacities  enabling commercial imports independent from the Russian supplier  from the current annual amount of 9.7 billion m3 (including Austrian and Slovakian interconnections)68  to 11.45 billion m3 by 2030, with the implementation of the first phase of Romanian development,  to 14.1 billion m3 with the implementation of the second phase of Romanian development (after the final investment decision on Black Sea natural gas production),  to 12.3 billion m3 with the Hungarian-Slovenian cross-border pipeline implemented after successful market testing,  to 12.6 billion m3 with the reverse flow of the Croatian-Hungarian cross-border point and construction of the LNG terminal,  to 10.5 billion m3 with the upgrade of the Hungarian-Slovakian pipeline, and up to 20.4 billion m3 if all of the above development projects are implemented.  The table below shows possible scenarios aimed at satisfying future Hungarian gas demand, comparing the expected security of supply parameters of alternative contract portfolios prepared from them.   billion m3 Market, without diversification LNG, but without Romanian supply Romanian supply distributed in the region Romanian supply to the Hungarian market Maximum diversification Russian 3 3 3 3 3 LNG 0 1 0 0 1 Romanian 0.5 0.5 1.5 3 1.5 market from 4.5 3.5 3.5 2  2.5                                                       68 The list quantifies the impact of the implementation of individual projects.

In the above case Hungary would secure the quantity of base-load consumption necessary for supplying universal services from Russian sources (3 billion m3/year / 29.31 TWh) in the form of a multi-year contract, and would also assume implementation of the planned Croatian and Romanian projects.  (iii) Enhancing flexibility As regards the management of restrictions or interruptions in energy supply, it is important to improve the adaptability of the national energy system, in relation to which the enhancement of the flexibility factor plays an important role. To this end, ensuring access to LNG sources enabling more flexible purchases is important. Access to the LNG terminal planned on the island of Krk renders the establishment of potential gas imports significantly contribute to improving the competitiveness of Croatian LNG (see details in point i. of Chapter 3.4.3). Own resources also enhance the flexibility of supply. (iv) Market integration The security of supply can be further improved by integration of regional gas markets, the establishment of smooth operating conditions of the internal gas market referred to in Regulation (EU) 2017/193869, and by coordinating the operation of gas and electricity markets (sector coupling). Point i. of Chapter 3.4.3 presents the related measures.  (v) Maintaining the maximum possible transit quantity within the Hungarian natural gas transmission system, and related storage strategy: The joint goal of reducing natural gas consumption and increasing the use of infrastructure can be met with                                                       69 Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2017 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and repealing Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/hu/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32017R1938)  the use of the high-pressure natural gas transmission system for transit purposes, which can be effectively supported with Hungarian natural gas storage capacities that are substantial on a regional scale. It is therefore necessary to strengthen competition on the gas storage market and the regional role of Hungarian facilities. Maintaining natural gas transit flows is also key to the use of natural gas storage facilities. Strategic concepts relating to Hungarian natural gas storage facilities should be divided into short and long-term ones:  Short-term concepts: Taking into account the Russian-Ukrainian geopolitical situation, changes to transmission routes and trends in short-term supply contracts, Hungary prepared for the 2019/2020 gas year with very high storage reserves to ensure the continuous security of supply.  Long-term concepts: The storage strategy should be aligned to the shift of current east-west transmission routes to south-north-west routes. Hungarian storage capacity could become an important pillar of Croatian-Hungarian market coupling. Upon implementation of the Slovenian-Hungarian pipeline, Western European traders could also access storage options along a direct route. To meet decarbonisation goals, we will also assess options for converting some of the natural gas storage capacities for hydrogen storage. (vi) Upon a sharp decline in natural gas consumption or in the volume of natural gas distributed within the network it will be necessary to also rationalise the infrastructure (point ii. of Chapter 2.4.2). Point i. of Chapter 3.4.2 presents the related action plans. Oil market: Hungary is planning the following measures to ensure that the use of petroleum products increases by no more than 10 % by 2030 in transport:  Encouraging use of public transportation and rail. - Use of motor vehicles with clean (mainly electric) propulsion in public transportation and local services;  Fuel switching: - increased biofuel blending ratio, - encouraging electric mobility, - encouraging CNG/LNG propulsion for heavy goods vehicles, - encouraging advanced (second generation) biofuel innovation (detailed in Chapter 3.1.2).  Maintaining the Hungarian hydrocarbon concession scheme, encouraging the exploration and extraction of unconventional crude oil.   Maintaining the standard of the security of supply based on strategic stockpiling.  Coal market Lignite accounts for 54 % of Hungarian coal reserves; brown coal accounts for 30 % and black coal for only 16 % of geological reserves. Coal production in Hungary consists almost entirely of lignite mining (99.97 %). Based on data of the Hungarian Energy and Public Utility Regulatory Authority, 93.5 % of coal in Hungary is utilised by power plants and 4 % is burned by households. Coal used for household heating is 88 % lignite, 9 % imported hard coal and 3 % brown coal briquettes. The share of coal in Hungarian power generation has significantly declined. The downturn in coal mining was initially caused by a diminishing heavy industry. The effects of tightening pollutant emissions requirements became more pronounced later on. Today there is only one coal-fired large power plant  Mátra Power Plant  operating in Hungary. The Mátra Power Plant plays an important role in terms of both the security of supply and the labour market. As the second largest power plant of Hungary, it accounts for 15 % of total Hungarian power generation. It is the only large power plant in the eastern half of Hungary allowing regulation and is also a major employer, considering that most of the inhabitants of the districts concerned (Gyöngyös and  100 jobs are directly, 10 000 jobs indirectly related to the power plant, with around 27 000 affected family members). However, the power plant is also the largest CO2 emitter of Hungary, accounting for approximately 50 % of CO2 emissions in the energy production sector and 14 % of total national CO2 emissions. The power plant and the roughly 100 000 households in the region heating with lignite also significantly contribute to concentrations of other air pollutants in Hungary: 36.2 % of SO2, 13.71 % of Hg and 4.48 % of NO 2.70  it is necessary to prepare for changes in the operation of the electricity system, the replacement of some capacities with other technologies, the retraining of workers in the affected region and for maintaining various industrial activities relying on the In addition, taking into account the substantial Hungarian lignite reserves, we plan to ensure the availability of lignite production as a strategic reserve. Achievement of these goals can be guaranteed by drawing up a regional decarbonisation strategy and action plan involving stakeholders. EU funds are also available for implementing the decarbonisation programme.                                                        70 Emissions data for 2017.  Nuclear safety Pursuant to Act CXVI of 1996 on nuclear energy, nuclear energy may only be used in possession of licenses defined in legislation, under continuous administrative supervision. In international conventions Hungary committed itself to using nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes, under safe and protected conditions. To ensure non-proliferation, i.e. prevention of the proliferation of nuclear and radiological weapons, nuclear and other radioactive materials are used under strict licensing procedures, control and registration. Safe operation is ensured by comprehensive regulation and multi-tiered, complex supporting systems and operating mechanisms substituting each other to ensure that the use of nuclear energy does not produce adverse effects on the population. Security is guaranteed by safety solutions, technologies and regulations serving the physical protection of the nuclear facility, radioactive waste disposal sites, and nuclear and other radioactive materials. Construction of the new nuclear units is also bound to strict conditions. More than one authority licenses and supervises a complex facility such as a nuclear power plant, involving many fields of expertise. The authorities issue the necessary licenses in their respective licensing procedures and, as regulatory bodies, enforce their own specialised criteria in the procedures of other authorities. The Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority (HAEA) is responsible for authorisation of the establishment and operation of the nuclear power plant in terms of safety, security and safeguards. Installation-level procedures follow the life-cycle of the nuclear facility. Accordingly, it is necessary to assess the suitability of the site before launching the substantial phase of the investment, to fully draw up the technical designs of the nuclear power plant and carry out its safety analyses to be reviewed by the authority, which grants the implementation permit in case of conformity. It is necessary to commission the built facility, which consists of operability testing of installed systems, followed by a series of measurements, including the loading of fuel assemblies containing nuclear fuel. If everything functions in accordance with safety analyses and the plans, in conformity with requirements, the reactor unit may be granted a long-term operating licence. The HAEA verifies operation in conformity with issued permits within the framework of inspections. The security of nuclear energy is also guaranteed by Hungary's signing of a number of bilateral and multilateral international agreements relating to the safe use of nuclear energy. Details are provided on the website of the HAEA71. It is also important to note the strategy ensuring the long-term supply of nuclear materials and fuels, with particular regard to increasing nuclear capacities. Section 1(1) of Decree No 44/2002 of 28 December 2002 of the Minister for Economy and Transport72 on the minimum quantity of the energy reserves of power plants with a capacity of 50 MW or more, and on the rules                                                       71 https://www.haea.gov.hu/web/v3/OAHPortal.nsf/web?openagent&menu=04&submenu=4_8 72 Former Minister for Economy and Transport.  of stockpiling stipulates that the production operation licence holder of a power plant with a nominal capacity of 50 MW or more is required to maintain normative and emergency energy reserves for each power plant.  - Pursuant to paragraph (2)(c), the normative quantity of energy reserve corresponds to the quantity of fuel necessary for at least one year of average electricity and cogenerated heat generation by the nuclear power plant on 1 February of the calendar year. - Pursuant to paragraph (3)(c), the quantity of safety energy reserve corresponds to the quantity of fuel  jointly with fuel contained in the normative reserve  ensuring at least two years of average electricity and cogenerated heat generation by the nuclear power plant on 1 February of the calendar year. Act II of 2014 promulgated the convention entered into between the Government of Hungary and the Government of the Russian Federation on cooperation in the field of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, which sets out obligations relating to the operation of facilities of the Paks Nuclear Power Plant and the increase of capacity, i.e. the establishment of the new units. Several agreements on implementation are related to the act, including the agreement on fuel, which has been also signed by the Euratom Supply Agency.  Improving cybersecurity Cybersecurity has become a key element of national security, therefore raising cybersecurity to the highest possible level has become a condition for protecting Hungary's sovereignty. The EU NIS Directive73 also emphasises the energy sector in relation to guaranteeing the uniform high level of security of network and information systems. The Hungarian energy sector should also be prepared to manage challenges, threats and risks arising in cyberspace, guarantee an adequate level of cybersecurity, carry out cybersecurity tasks, develop cyber-resistant capabilities and to ensure the uninterrupted operation of the national vital information infrastructure. We need to strengthen the protection of electronic IT systems, the national vital information infrastructure, classified information and national data assets.  Proposed measures: Set of sectoral cybersecurity requirements At the present time the key organisations involved in the Hungarian electricity system do not fall within the                                                       73 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union.  scope of Act CLXVI of 2012 on the identification, designation and protection of vital systems and facilities74, i.e. they have not been designated as vital system components. Since actors providing essential services are designated in the procedure for designating national vital system components from among operators of designated national vital system components, requirements set out in the NIS Directive75 on the security of network and information systems are not applicable to the key organisations, either. Taking into account the above, the legal framework relating to the protection of vital systems and facilities in the Hungarian energy sector should ensure that based on the thresholds, key organisations can be designated as vital system components. It is also justified to ensure that actors providing essential services are designated in a procedure separately from the procedure for designating national vital system components. With the involvement of the professional organisations concerned it is necessary to draw up a sectoral set of cybersecurity requirements  in the form of a policy strategy76  applicable specifically to organisations operating in the electrical industry in accordance with requirements set out in Act L of 2013 and Decree No 41/2015 of the Minister of the Interior (also taking into account that certain provisions of Decree No 41/2015 are not applicable in relation to ICS and SCADA systems used in the electricity industry or due to the operating/usage specifications of such systems). As a strategic objective, the preventive, detection and response capabilities should be continuously improved with the definition of the set of requirements, organisation of targeted exercises and the establishment of funding instruments.  Sharing of sectoral cybersecurity information The sharing of information between major organisations of the energy sector should be made more effective at both national and international levels. We plan to launch regular sharing of information between major actors of the Hungarian energy sector (energy producers, suppliers, system operators) through government coordination to ensure the secure and uninterrupted operation of energy systems. Within the above framework it is necessary to establish options for the automated sharing of cybersecurity information relevant for the electricity sector.  Set-up of rapid response unit for incident management In case of cybersecurity incidents the unit will provide on-the-spot assistance to operators (tracing, threat                                                       74 Act CLXVI of 2012 on the identification, designation and protection of vital systems and facilities (https://net.jogtar.hu/jogszabaly?docid=A1200166.TV). 75 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/HU/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN). 76 Pursuant to Section 8(1)(c) and Section 35 of Government Decree No 38/2012 of 12 March 2012 on Government strategic management.  analysis, network security monitoring, incident management, analysis of various attack tools and methods).  Human resources The application of settings in conformity with minimum security requirements prescribed by legal requirements is a priority. To improve cybersecurity (or to at least prevent the further degradation of cybersecurity risk levels) the most important measure is to ensure the continuous availability of qualified and experienced specialists for operative cybersecurity activities.  Improvement of the labour market in the energy sector To improve the labour market in the energy sector it is necessary to raise the standard of specialised education and to better exploit opportunities offered by the dual education system. Following the survey of educational needs and identification of skills shortages, the number of students pursuing studies in the field of energy should be increased with support from career guidance programmes. Outward migration and the drain effect of other industries (mainly the automotive industry) can mainly be mitigated with corporate wage increases and the offering of a secure vision. Mobility within the country can be encouraged by reducing taxes on (e.g. sublet) aids facilitating mobility. Economic structural changes resulting in lower carbon intensive energy production and consumption may also bring about significant changes in employment needs and opportunities outside of the energy sector. To ensure a just transition, the strategy aims to:  enable the monitoring of labour market trends affected by the energy transition and to reverse possibly negative trends;  facilitate improvement of employment prospects in the green economy sectors, thereby enhancing competitiveness in this field;  provide support opportunities for the continuing training and retraining of vulnerable workers;  extend certain development policy based support opportunities to vulnerable social groups and regions;  facilitate enforcement of equal opportunity for women, and vulnerable social groups and regions, either   ii.
