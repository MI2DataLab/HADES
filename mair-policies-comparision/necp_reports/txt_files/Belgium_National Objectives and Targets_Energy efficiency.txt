74 2.2. Dimension energy efficiency i. The elements set out in point (b) of Article 4  Article efficiency targets of at least 32.5% in 2030, as referred to in Article 1(1) and Article 3(4) of Directive 2012/27/EU [as amended by proposal COM(2016)761], based on either primary or final energy consumption, primary or final energy savings, or energy intensity.   contribution to the indicative European target will be obtained by combining the contributions of the various entities and will be expressed as primary energy consumption. In 2030, primary energy consumption will be 42.7 Mtoe and final energy consumption will be 35.2 Mtoe. Compared with the PRIMES 2007 baseline, which estimates primary energy consumption at 50.1 Mtoe in 2030 and final energy consumption at 39.9 Mtoe in 2030, this implies an energy saving of 7.4 Mtoe, i.e. 15% for primary energy consumption compared with PRIMES 2007 in 2030 and, converted into final energy consumption, an energy saving of 4.7 Mtoe, i.e. 12% for final energy consumption compared with PRIMES 2007 in 2030. In this respect, the entities will make the following efforts: the Federal State, measures.

In the transport sector, Wallonia is aiming to make ambitious efforts by implementing its FAST programme. The new vehicle fleet structure (roll-out of electric and CNG vehicles, phasing out of traditional combustion engines) will also impact on the distribution of final consumption.  76 Final consumption by sector (GWh)  Consommation finale énergétique totale par secteur Total final energy consumption by sector Résidentiel Residential Tertiaire Tertiary Industrie Industry Agriculture Agriculture Transport Transport  Final consumption by carrier (GWh)  Consommation finale énergétique totale par vecteur Total final energy consumption by carrier Solids Solid fuels Oil Oil Gaz Gas Électricité Electricity Vapeur cogen Steam cogeneration SER RES Autres Other 77  Walloon Region: Primary consumption Primary consumption depends on the estimated electricity generating capacity. The effort shown here assumes the phasing out of nuclear power according to the current timetable and limited imports into Wallonia. Primary energy consumption in Wallonia (GWh)  Consommation énergétique primaire Primary energy consumption   Primary energy consumption will fall by 36% compared with 2005 and by 15% compared with 2015. Primary consumption of oil products will fall sharply. This reduction will be offset by an increase in primary consumption of gas and renewables. The import of electricity in the WAM scenario is assumed to be relatively limited (1,600 GWh).  Brussels Capital Region The following graph shows that the measures applied will reduce final energy consumption (as final energy) by 28.51% compared with 2005. 78  Consommation finale (GWh) Final consumption (GWh) Consommations réelles (GWh) Actual consumption (GWh) Scénario WEM (GWh) WEM scenario (GWh) Scénario WAM (GWh) WAM scenario (GWh)   Article 4(b)(2): the cumulative amount of energy savings to be achieved over the period 2021-2030 under Article 7(1)(b) on energy savings obligations of Directive 2012/27/EU [as amended by proposal COM(2016)761].  Based on an initial assessment to be subsequently confirmed, Article 7(1)(b) on energy savings obligations of Directive 2012/27/EU imposes the obligation to make additional annual end-use energy savings of around 3.3 TWh, i.e. cumulative savings of approximately 185 TWh over the period 2021-2030. As the final energy consumption for 2018 has not yet been finalised, the calculation is based on an estimate. The target will therefore need to be adjusted once the 2018 data are available. All the federated entities will contribute through policies and measures, and the Federal   Federal State Within the framework of its own powers, measures.  Flemish Region With regard to achieving the target in Article 7 for 2021-2030, the Flemish Region has for now decided not to implement an obligation scheme for distribution system operators or suppliers, but to initially continue along the path of alternative measures. As a result, the measures already notified to the European Commission during the period 2014-2020 will be continued in the WEM scenario (scenario with existing measures), with all existing  The following table indicates the measures under Article 7 and an initial estimate of the cumulative energy savings for the period 2021-2030:  79 Description Cumulative savings  (21-30) [TWh] Rational energy use/public service obligations incentive for:    roof insulation 7.925  glazing 1.891  wall 1.921  insulation of floors and basements 0.5810  solar water heater 0.029  heat pump 1.350  boiler with heat pump 0.422 Energy performance contract (including EPC extension with increase + reduction in the threshold in accordance with the energy plan declared at 0.1 PJ) 50.941 Environmental incentive + mini-EPC 3.685 Connection of SMEs to district heating systems 2.910 Optimisation of the settings of existing natural gas and heating oil boilers  3.641 E-Level < E30 (reduction on property tax) 0.358 Nudging via info on bills 0.532 Tax per kilometre for lorries (35) 7.876 Total 84.062   TWh. contribution to the total energy savings made through all the alternative measures under Article 7 of the EED for the period 2021-2030 is 60%.  Walloon Region Walloon Region: European obligation Between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2030, Wallonia must achieve a cumulative end-use energy savings target that is at least equivalent each year to 0.8% of its annual final consumption (calculated using the average for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018). In principle, this obligation will then be renewed every 10 years. Although the Member States still have some flexibility in implementing this obligation scheme (choice between a white certificate scheme, alternative measures applied by the government or a mix of both), the rules for setting the target and for calculating the savings in order to achieve the target have been reinforced. As a result, 0.8% of the total final energy consumption requires an annual effort of more than 1.5% of sales, excluding transport, over the previous period (2014-2020).                                                            35 The effect of the tax per kilometre for lorries has been calculated on an indicative basis.

Between 2017 and 2018, it has been assumed that macroeconomic conditions did not fundamentally change, that the climate effect was limited and that, in theory, consumption reduced. A cautious estimate therefore results in a 2018 consumption similar to that in 2017. 81  Nouvelles économies annuelles (GWh) New annual savings (GWh) 9 700 GWh en impact rémanent sur la consommation 2030 Resulting impact of 9,700 GWh on 2030 consumption Impact rémanent sur la consommation annuelle intermédiaire (GWh) Resulting impact on interim annual consumption (GWh) Soit au total un objectif cumulé de 53 350 GWh cumulés i.e. a cumulative target of 53,350 GWh   This means that the following effort is required in order for Wallonia to meet its Article 7 obligation:  additional energy savings of 970 GWh per year between 2021 and 2030;  an estimated impact in 2030 amounting to a reduction of 9,700 GWh compared with a scenario without this obligation;  a cumulative target for Wallonia of 53,350 GWh over the period 2021-2030.  Brussels Capital Region Cumulative volume of end-use energy savings (Article 7) From 2021 to 2030, under Article 7(1) of Directive 2012/27/EU, the Brussels Capital Region must make annual energy savings of 0.8% of its final energy consumption compared with the 2016-2018 average. An initial estimate of the volume of energy to be saved over the period 2021-2030 has been made using the average final energy consumption for 2016-2018, based on the 2018 energy balance. The effort required in the Brussels Capital Region in order to meet the Article 7 obligation has been estimated as:  additional annual energy savings of 159 GWh;  cumulative energy savings from 2021 to 2030 of 8,747 GWh.  Article 4(b)(4): the total floor area to be renovated or equivalent annual energy savings to be achieved from 2021 to 2030 under Article 5 of Directive 2012/27/EU on the exemplary role of buildings.  Exemplary role of public authorities under Article 5 of the Energy Efficiency Directive  European obligation: floor area to be renovated or equivalent energy savings for 2020-2030 The Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU aims to reduce energy needs by acting on various levers. Consumption in the buildings sector has been clearly identified as a major source of potential energy savings. The exemplary role of public authorities in this respect, by applying in practice their commitment under the Paris Agreement, is a powerful tool due to its knock-on effects. 82 Article 5 of Directive 2012/27/EU therefore imposes, as from 2014, an obligation to renovate each year 3% of all central government buildings in order to set an example. This obligation has been extended to the period 2021-2030. Furthermore, Article 5 encourages local authorities to follow this exemplary role, on a voluntary basis, by renovating their buildings. Public building managers subject to this obligation are therefore required to:  establish an inventory of their buildings;  monitor the annual consumption of those buildings;  benchmark performance to the cost-optimal level;  establish a targeted action plan ensuring that, each year, at least an additional 3% of their buildings achieve the baseline performance.  Flemish Region The Flemish Government has opted for an alternative approach in order to comply with Article 5 of the Energy Efficiency Directive. Buildings that meet all the following criteria fall within the scope of the Directive: - buildings owned by the Flemish Government; - buildings used by the Flemish Government; - heated/cooled buildings; - buildings with a floor area over 250 m² - buildings that do not meet the current minimum energy performance requirements; - buildings that are not covered by one of the exceptions set out in Article 5(2) of the Energy Efficiency Directive.  In order to monitor this renovation target, all entities within the Flemish Government are expected to annually Vlaams Energieagentschap  VEA) via the Property Database (Banque de Données des biens immobiliers/Vastgoeddatabank): - an inventory of their property indicating the floor area; - the annual energy consumption of these buildings; - the energy saving measures implemented and their compliance with the energy performance requirements; - the energy saving measures planned and their compliance with the energy performance requirements. Progress is being made in simplifying monitoring of the renovation target via the Terra database of the Flemish secteur public/Vlaams EnergieBedrijf  VEB).

In 2019, the total useful floor area of all such buildings was approximately 157,660 m². The savings made are estimated at 595 MWh of end-use energy. These savings should be made by a combination of the PLAGE (local action plan for energy management) and NRCLick (renovation work) programmes, as well as a potential reduction in owned or occupied floor area that does not meet the requirements.   ii. The indicative milestones for 2030, 2040 and 2050, the domestically established measurable progress indicators, an evidence-based estimate of expected energy savings and wider cluded in the roadmaps set out in the long-term renovation strategies for the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU   Flemish Region The long-term building renovation strategy 2050 is currently being developed and will be submitted to the European Commission by the set deadline of March 2020.  Walloon Region The objectives set out here stem from the Walloon renovation strategy 2017 (https://energie.wallonie.be/servlet/Repository/strategie-wallonne-a-long-terme-pour-la-renovation-energetique-des-batiment.pdf?ID=47301). The update resulting in the next renovation strategy (expected in March 2020) is currently being discussed, particularly with regard to the key moments in the life of a building. The phasing and depth of renovation are factors that will influence the results. The 2030 milestone may be revised following this work.  Walloon Region: Long-term objectives of the renovation strategy The objectives of the energy renovation strategy for the Walloon building stock are as follows:  In the residential sector: aim for the EPB A label (specification  85 kWh/m²/year) on average for the entire housing stock by 2050.  In the tertiary sector: aim for an energy-neutral (zero-energy) tertiary building stock by 2050 in terms of heating, domestic hot water, cooling and lighting. By analysing the results of the COZEB-Extension study, the action priorities for achieving these aims have been identified. The study assessed all cost-effective measures for the various types of building. The proposed priorities correspond to the most cost-effective measures, namely deep renovation of the least energy efficient housing (insulation of the building envelope, with the priority being the roof, but without neglecting systems reaching the end of their life). In this respect, however, it should be ensured that all renovation projects are generally carried out in a manner consistent with the robjectives. Achieving these aims will result in a 70% reduction in energy consumption in 2050 compared with 2005. 84  Walloon Region: Medium-term objectives of the renovation strategy The strategy proposes that the rate of renovation to achieve the 2050 objective needs to be phased in five-year periods. This will indicate whether Wallonia is on the right track to achieve its objectives. Not all buildings covered by the strategy will be able to achieve the objective set on average for the entire building stock. Demolition and rebuilding must therefore be considered as an option. Furthermore, increasing the number of new energy efficient buildings is one of the keys to improving the building stock and achieving the overall objective. In this respect, mention must be made of the development of New Districts, which ising local also contribute to the overall objectives. Around 15,000 new homes are expected to be built every year, on top of the current stock of approximately 1.5 million dwellings. The relative change in energy consumption that will result from this phased implementation by the 2020, 2030 and 2050 milestones is illustrated in the following table:  Residential Tertiary Strategy BE Target Reduction by 2020 vs 2005 -10.4% -12.9% -11.1% -11.5% Reduction by 2030 vs 2005 -27.9% -32.0% -29.1% -24.0% Reduction by 2050 vs 2005 -70.3% -70.3% -70.3%   Table: Reduction in energy consumption by the 2020, 2030 and 2050 milestones compared with 2005  This change means that the 2030 target for reducing average energy consumption in the tertiary and residential sectors is 29.1%.  Walloon Region: Phasing of the objectives Phasing of the renovation takes account of the need to spread the investments and prioritise those investments with the greatest potential impact (37). Although the phasing of renovation measures will be determined on a case-by-case basis (in a specific renovation roadmap for each building), it is expected that, for the entire stock, the phased deep energy renovation will generally prioritise the renovation of roofs, then the rest of the building envelope, and finally the renovation of systems and installation of renewable energy generation sources.                                                            37 The working assumptions can be found in Annex 8 to the Walloon renovation strategy (Annex B). 85  Walloon Region: Expected energy savings Figure 1: Annual energy need of buildings in terms of heating, domestic hot water and cooling (and lighting in the tertiary sector) in the short, medium and long term as a result of meeting the renovation strategy objectives  usages inclus dans la PEB (key milestones) [TWh] Change over time of the energy need for uses included in the EPB (key milestones) [TWh] Résidentiel Residential Tertiaire Tertiary  The above graph summarises the expected energy savings. As a result, between 2017 and 2020, energy needs will reduce by 1%/year on average, then by 1.6%/year between 2020 and 2030, and finally by 2.2%/year between 2030 and 2050. If the 2020 energy needs are compared with those in 2017 (heating, domestic hot water and cooling in the residential and tertiary sectors, and also lighting in the tertiary sector), a saving of 1 TWh is expected for 2020. This will rise to 5.8 TWh by 2030, and should reach 17 TWh in 2050.  Walloon Region: Energy savings in new buildings New buildings are covered in accordance with the regulations, given that the requirement level will very shortly be Q-ZEN, i.e. in 2021 (and in 2019 for public buildings). This requirement will be reviewed as the cost-optimal study is updated and as climate and energy objectives change, with the latest review (June 2018) indicating that the cost-optimal level is beyond Q-ZEN. The 2023 update will determine if the ZEN level can become the new norm from 2025. In any event, Wallonia is aiming for carbon neutrality in new buildings from 2027.  Brussels Capital Region Objectives of the strategy to reduce the environmental impact of buildings The objective of the strategy to reduce the environmental impact of existing buildings in Brussels is to ensure that the building stock achieves a high level of energy performance by 2050. 86  Residential sector In the residential sector, the objective of the renovation strategy is to achieve an average primary energy consumption of 100 kWh/m²/year. In order to improve the housing stock, the idea is to make all homes more energy efficient by phasing their renovation. The work will be carried out in five stages up to 2050 (38). The improvement of their performance will be recorded in the EPB certificate, which will become mandatory for all homes. The certificate will also change as it will list the priority measures suited to the certified property. By each deadline set by the legislation, owners must prove that the work has been correctly carried out. Objective Work 2030   2035   2040   2045  Deadline for the fourth of the five mandatory measures, at the individual 2050  Deadline for the fifth of the five mandatory measures.   The minimum level of performance to be achieved by 2050 will be set by type of building. With regard to multi-family buildings, the obligations will apply at apartment and building level. The roof, façades and other common parts will be tackled through a mandatory report specifically produced for this purpose, which will be based on all the recommendations made in the EPB certificates for the common parts. The joint owners will be responsible for implementing the recommendations applicable to the common parts.  Tertiary sector In the tertiary sector, the strategy to reduce the environmental impact of existing buildings in Brussels provides for the introduction of a mandatory system of work to be carried out by certain deadlines, similar to the system established for the residential sector. The aim is to ensure that the tertiary sector has energy-neutral buildings by 2050.  iii. Where applicable, other national objectives, including long-term targets or strategies and sectoral targets, and national objectives in areas such as energy efficiency in the transport sector and with regard to heating and cooling  Flemish Region (a) Transport sector targets We would refer in this respect to the Transport section of the dimension decarbonisation.  (b) Heating sector targets A decision has been taken to make maximum use of green and waste heat capacity for the different heating technologies. It is nearly always more cost-effective to obtain a given contribution to generation from green and waste heat than from green electricity or green transport. For heat pumps, the system cost (impact on network load, higher investment and support costs than for other sources of green heat) is higher than for other options (renewables). However, not everyone will opt for a heat pump when investing in a replacement system or as part of a renovation. To encourage a wider uptake of heat                                                            38 Owners will of course be able to carry out all the work in one go in order to achieve the set energy performance level. 87 pumps, their cost-effectiveness in dwellings must be improved by reducing heating demand and integrating heat pumps into the electricity market and power grid. One way of achieving this could be by adopting a more flexible approach to heat pumps, which would enable owners to react to cheaper electricity prices through a smart meter.  District heating systems contribute to more efficient heat production and provide the infrastructure required to facilitate conversion to renewable energy sources and waste heat. The focus will continue to be on district heating systems that facilitate the use of renewable or waste heat. This concept has come under the spotlight in recent years through regular calls for green heat (including district heating systems), waste heat (networks), biomethane injection and geothermal energy. A Heat Plan 2025 with projections to 2030 will be developed in order to increase the production of green heat.  Walloon Region Walloon Region: Other sectoral targets  non-ETS industry A reduction in GHG emissions from non-ETS industry by 2030 (compared with 2005) could be achieved by working towards the following two targets.  The first type of possible measure is to continue improving energy efficiency in the sector. A target of increasing energy efficiency by 10% (by means of various technical measures) has been set.  More radical decarbonisation measures in non-ETS industries would appear to be needed in order to move beyond this value. Wallonia has decided to pursue a fuel switching policy in the sector alongside more traditional energy efficiency measures. Users can be encouraged to switch to other energy carriers by promoting, firstly, the use of renewable heat (solar thermal and heat pumps, whether or not combined with geothermal energy or biomass combustion) and, secondly, the use of decarbonised electricity generation. A total of 213 GWh of renewable heat could be produced and consumed in this way, accounting for 8% of the overall figure.  CO2 capture and sequestration or reuse solutions could also be included in pilot projects with a temporarily limited impact. As a result of these measures, emissions from the non-ETS industry sector should fall by 32% compared with 2015. This represents a total reduction of 79% compared with 2005 levels, given that significant reductions were made between 2005 and 2015, particularly as some businesses in the non-ETS sector in 2005 were included in the ETS from 2013.
