4.6. Research, innovation and competitiveness dimension 4.6.i. Current situation of the low-carbon-technologies sector and (where possible) its position on the global market (analysis to be carried out at Union or global level)  The energy transition forms part of a macroeconomic modernisation strategy that will trigger extensive investments in the German economy. Innovative business models offer major opportunities in this respect. The energy transition is beneficial in that it opens up new opportunities for innovation and fresh market potential. Digitisation of the energy transition also has a concomitant impact. Many German companies reap benefits from trade in new and innovative energy technologies.  A recent research project looked more closely into the position of German companies on the international market for energy technologies (Lehr et al. 2019)9. Measurement of the global trade volume as the sum of imports by country of origin shows that global trade in energy technology goods in the period 2000-2017 has almost quadrupled. Trade in Europe during the same period has tripled.  Energy technology goods represent a major category of German exports. Low-emission technologies are manufactured in the economic sectors that are already responsible for significant proportions of German exports, some of which already occupy a dominant position in world markets. These include industries for producing motor vehicles and vehicle parts, mechanical engineering, production of electronics and electrical equipment, and the chemical industry. The share of energy technology goods (as defined here) in the volume of German exports has risen since 2000 from approx. 6.2% to around 8.9% in 2017. In 2017, this corresponded to exports valued at approx. 128 billion USD. Of this, exports to Europe amounted to 67 billion USD.  Looking at the trade shares of the respective countries, it can be seen that German manufacturers of energy technology goods hold a more or less constant share in a growing world market. On average, this share is around 13.8%. German industry thus maintains a significant market share in measurement, control and regulation instruments, for example, or for goods for rational energy supply.  4.6.ii. Current level of public and, where available, private research and innovation spending on low-carbon-technologies, current number of patents, and current number of researchers  Public spending on energy research has more than doubled over the past 10 years. In 2019, EUR 1.15 billion project funding and institutional funding for the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres. According to data reported by the federal states, the latter spent a total of around EUR 282 million of their -term financial plan provides for energy research funding of EUR 1.301 billion under the Seventh Energy Research Programme for 2020. The Federal Government is striving to ramp up energy research in the period between 2020 and 2030.  Figure B1: Overview of non-                                                           9 The research is based on official trade statistics. In this, individual product items cannot be clearly assigned to the energy technology goods or low-emission technologies; they can also be used for other purposes (problem of multiple-use). The results could therefore be estimated in detail at their absolute values 145  Research Programme (adjusted for inflation, baseline year 2010)   in Mio. Euro in million euro Sonstige Others Energieefizienz Energy efficiency Erneuerbare Energien Renewable energies Kraftwerke Power plants Systemintegration System integration  Research and development spending by private businesses can only be estimated. In 2018, companies invested around EUR 223 million in the development of innovative energy technologies within the framework of publicly funded energy research projects alone. Third-party funding is also granted to universities and research institutions engaged in collaborative projects. According to Stifterverband Wissenschaftsstatistik, private businesses spent a total of around EUR 69 billion on internal R&D in 2017. Of this figure, around EUR ed on this figure, Stifterverband estimates that on a pro rata basis around 16 000 people were employed as research and development personnel in the field of energy research in 2017 (FTEs).

Breakdown of current price elements that make up the three main price components (energy, network, taxes/levies) Industry electricity prices  Electricity prices for industrial enterprises vary greatly. According to the latest research by the Federal Network Agency, the majority of electricity prices for industrial enterprises (annual demand: 24 GWh) not covered by the statutory exemptions fell within a bandwidth of 14.11-17.65 cents/kWh (without VAT) on the reference date of 1 April 2019. Average prices were around 15.98 cents/kWh Table B22 shows the individual price components. At 4.34 cents/kWh, the costs of energy procurement and sales represent only a small 146  proportion of the total price.  Table B22: Electricity price components for industrial customers  Electricity price components for industrial customers on the reference date of 1 April 2019 cents/kWh (arithmetic mean) Energy procurement and sales (including margin) 4.34 Network charges 2.32 Surcharge under the Renewable Energy Sources Act 6.41 Surcharge under the Cogeneration Act 0.28 Concession fee 0.11 Surcharge pursuant to ยง19 of the Regulation on Electricity Grid Access Charges 0.061 Offshore levy 0.416 Interruptible loads surcharge 0.005 Electricity tax 2.05 Total value 15.98 * Industrial customers with presumed consumption of 24 GWh per year without discounts Source: Federal Network Agency / Federal Cartel Office (2020)  However, if electricity consumers fulfil the conditions of the rules in the corresponding regulations and laws, there will be reductions in the various levies and fees (see Table 22b). If all reduction possibilities are fulfilled, the price component that the supplier cannot influence could fall from over 11 cents/kWh to less than 1 cent/kWh.  Table B23: Possible discounts for industrial customers* in cents/kWh  Price survey of 1 April 2019 Assumed value Possible reduction Remaining amount Renewable Energy Sources Act levy 6.41 -6.09 0.32 Electricity tax 2.05 -2.05 0.00 Net network charge 2.32 -1.86 0.46 Other surcharges 0.76 -0.64 0.12 Concession fee 0.11 -0.11 0.00 Total of cost items that cannot be influenced (by the electricity supplier) 11.65 -10.74 0.90 * Industrial customers with presumed consumption of 24 GWh per year Source: Federal Network Agency / Federal Cartel Office (2020)  Electricity prices can differ substantially between individual companies. Factors which play a role in determining prices include individual purchase quantities and profiles. Regional differences also exist, for example in relation to network charges. Differentiated relief rules (including the surcharge under the 147  Renewable Energy Sources Act and the electricity tax) mean that  under certain circumstances  companies which incur particularly high electricity costs in connection with their production activities and have a strong presence on the international market are asked to pay less. These relief rules play a significant role in Guaranteeing the international competitiveness of German industry represents a priority for the Federal Government. The ongoing goal is to avoid companies moving to countries with lower environmental standards or energy levies (carbon leakage) and to safeguard closed value creation chains and industrial jobs in Germany on a long-term basis.  4.6.iv. Description of energy subsidies, including for fossil fuels  The following subsidies currently exist in Germany, which also  directly or indirectly  subsidise fossil fuels.  Table B24: Overview of indirect and direct subsidies according to the Federal Government report on subsidies  No Name of subsidy Amount of tax loss in 2018 in EUR Objective of the measure Period / time limit 1 Subsidies for the sale of German hard coal for electricity generation, for sale to the steel industry and to compensate for costs resulting from capacity adjustments 967 300 000 Ensuring the socially and regionally acceptable phasing out of German hard-coal mining at the end of 2018. Due to the tendency toward negative impacts of hard-coal mining on climate protection and conservation of resources, support for sales from hard-coal mining in Germany was reduced and completely removed at the end of 2018. In recent years more money has been spent in particular on decommissioning and the clean-up of legacy pollution sites, making it possible to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts of hard-coal mining. Ended on 31.12.2018 2 Granting of transition monies to workers employed in the hard-coal mining sector 90 400 000 Ensuring the socially and regionally acceptable phasing out of German hard-coal mining at the end of 2018.
