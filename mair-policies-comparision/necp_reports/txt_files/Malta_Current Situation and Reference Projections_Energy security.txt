4.4 DIMENSION ENERGY SECURITY  Current energy mix, domestic energy resources, import dependency, including relevant risks   The diversification of energy sources and suppliers achieved over the last years constitutes an important milestone for Malta, a country which lacks indigenous energy sources aside from renewable energy (which itself faces certain technical limitations). In 2015, the Maltese national grid was connected to the European energy network through a 200MW Malta-Italy HVAC cable; this was an important milestone electricity network, and provided increased security of supply and flexibility of electricity services.  The energy mix of primary products as a share in gross inland consumption in 2017, as shown in          Figure 72, portrays high dependency on oil and petroleum products decreased from 79% in 2016 to 55% in 2017, whereby the share of natural gas now amounts to 31% of the energy mix. The share of renewable energy is also increasing on an annual basis. The share of electricity imported over the interconnector in the energy mix in 2017 was 9%. In 2017, net import dependency90 in Malta reached 95.8% as all energy sources, apart from renewables are imported. Electricity is dispatched from local generation plants and the                                                            90 This indicator (as defined in Eurostat) measures the level of total net energy imports as a proportion of total gross inland consumption and the fuel supplied to international maritime bunkers. Net import dependency, as defined in Eurostat, may reach values of above 100% in cases of increasing stock levels. Negative dependency rates indicate that a country is a net exporter of energy.   154  interconnector with Sicily based on their order of economic merit, technical capacity and existing contractual arrangements.           Figure 72 - Estimated energy mix as share in gross inland consumption, including electricity imported over the interconnector in 2017, %.   Energy mix for Electricity Generation Over the past five years, Malta has transformed its energy mix used for electricity generation from one based on heavy fuel oil and gasoil, to a more sustainable energy mix based on gas, gasoil (for backup), renewables, and electricity imports through the interconnector (Figure 73). Following significant investments in a new generation plant and the conversion of an existing plant, natural gas replaced heavy fuel oil as the main fuel for electricity generation. In 2017, LNG constituted almost 65% of local energy mix for electricity generation, with electricity imported over the interconnector and gasoil/fuel oil covering the remaining portion at 19% and 13% respectively. The increased efficiency of the new generation plant also significantly reduced primary energy demand in Malta.

LNG is currently imported via marine carriers and held in a floating storage unit which supplies gas to two power plants. There are no onshore LNG or gas storage facilities.  The establishment of the LNG facility further diversified the sources of supply, as it provides access to an unlimited number of sources of LNG on the international market. Gas deliveries to Malta in 2017 and 2018 in bcm, and converted to energy, are provided below:   Table 25 - Gas deliveries to Malta, 2017-2018 Gas deliveries  bcm91  TJ92  GWh  2017            0.27         10,776     2,993.24  2018            0.35         13,614     3,781.70                                                              91 Standard Temperature and Pressure (15°C, 760mm Hg)  92 Based on average higher heating value  156   Alternative third countries tapped for LNG imports since 2017 included the USA, Equatorial Guinea, Egypt,Trinidad and Tobago, Peru, Norway and Nigeria.

Figure 74 - LNG Deliveries by origin, 2017 and 2018      Projections of development with existing PAMs at least until 2040 In the coming years, the energy mix for electricity generation shall be maintained and consolidated. The Malta-Sicily gas pipeline project would provide access to natural gas over the European gas grid and would be able to replace the present LNG supply.  The pipeline would also allow for the possibility of scaling up the gas-fired power generation facilities at Delimara so as to meet the growing electricity demand, should this be identified as the preferred option.  The existing LNG facility is sized to provide gas for the present configuration and would not be able to handle additional power generation units. For the short to medium term gasoil shall continue to be a secondary source of energy, used during instances of emergency by a backup power plant and four dual-fuel diesel engines. At present, there are no plans for a second interconnector93, thus the WEM scenario maintains present levels of interconnection capacity. Figure 75 outlines the projected electricity generation by source until 2030, with a view to 2040, distinguishing between local generation from conventional fuels and renewable sources, and that imported through the interconnector. Conventional fuels refer to natural gas, as well as gasoil in 2017. Renewable sources contributing to electricity generation include solar photovoltaics and biogas used in the existing waste-to-energy plants, which are expected to generate approximately 13-14 GWh in the projected period. Based on projected gas prices, the introduction of the gas pipeline in 2025 would increase the competitiveness of local generation vis-à-vis electricity imported over the interconnector.                                                              93 This is subject to the outcomes of the in-depth study on power generation commissioned by the Government   - 50,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 300,000 350,000South AmericaAfricaEuropeUSAm3LNG deliveries by origin20182017 157  Figure 75 - Electricity generation by source under the WEM scenario, 2018-2040  Net import dependency is expected to remain at a level between 99.5  99.3% under the WEM scenario. The electricity generation of domestic energy sources, therefore renewables, is expected to peak in 2021, since under the WEM scenario no government support will be provided post-2020. Solar PVs would generate 273 GWh in 2021, which would decrease slightly to 261 GWh in 2030 as some PV systems reach their end of life.  Under this scenario, natural gas, used as fuel in the power generation sector, will be imported in the form of LNG until the commissioning of the MTGP pipeline in 2025.
