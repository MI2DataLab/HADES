        56  2.3 Dimension Energy security (i) National objectives with regard to: - increasing the diversification of energy sources and supply from third countries, the purpose of which may be to reduce energy import dependency, - increasing the flexibility of the national energy system, and - addressing constrained or interrupted supply of an energy source, for the purpose of improving the resilience of regional and national energy systems, including a timeframe for when the objectives should be met On December 6, 2019 the Government reached an agreement on a new Climate Act with 8 out of the 10 parties in the Danish Parliament. The act will include a legally binding target to reduce greenhouse gases by 70% by 2030 (relative to 1990 level), to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, and to set milestone targets based on a five-year cycle.The Government will moreover adapt climate action plans, which will contribute to ensuring that national reduction targets are met.   In the 2018 Energy Agreement, the parties in the Danish Parliament have agreed to work for net zero carbon dioxide emission in accordance with the Paris Agreement and net zero carbon dioxide emission in the EU and Denmark by 2050 at the latest. With the initiatives outlined in the Energy Agreement of 2018, Denmark has allocated funding that sets the course towards a renewables share of approximately 55 % by 2030. Furthermore, the 2018 Energy Agreement states that Denmark must have the most integrated, market-based and flexible energy system in Europe, with efficient energy utilisation across the electricity, heating and gas sectors, and with a continued strong security of supply. There is also a need to further develop the electricity market and determine the potential role of the gas system in the green transition of the energy system. Denmark does not have a legally based definition of overall energy security, but a definition of security of electricity supply is stated in the Electricity Supply Act, (LBK 840 of 15 August 2019, article 5,) requires available when demanded by  Stable and reliable energy supply is considered a prerequisite for the Danish society. The effectiveness and functioning of the economy, public organizations and private households depend on a reliable energy supply. The transition of the energy sectors towards increasing integration of renewable energy sources demands integration of energy systems, increased international connections and precise overview of energy production and consumption. The development of interconnection between subsectors and across borders is an objective targeting an efficient use of fluctuating energy sources.  Therefore both legislative and governance measures are being implemented in order to promote further integration internationally and intra-sectorially. The international dimension is vital to a small country like Denmark, linking Scandinavia to the continent, and the North Sea to the Baltic Sea. The geographic situation gives Denmark extraordinary conditions for import and export of energy, whether it is fossil or renewable fuels or electricity. Denmark supports further international cooperation in regard to energy supply         57  and further development of an open market for electricity and natural gas, as well as renewable based gasses.  Within both the natural gas sector and the electricity sector Denmark is working to further develop the international cooperation on security of supply by increasing physical interconnections and ensuring common understanding of risks to supply.  The Danish electricity system is undergoing a development comprising an increasing amount of renewable energy production from mainly intermittent wind and solar power sources, together with a decreasing central and decentral power plant production capacity. This leads to an increasing dependency on interconnectors to the neighbouring countries and a need to introduce more flexibility into the electricity system. The potential security issues are being mitigated through regional cooperation in the Nordic region among authorities and at TSO level. This cooperation aims at enhancing the operational cooperation in case of crises by common exercising and knowledge sharing. Conventional power plants are being decommissioned or transformed into biofueled plants, and diversification in both production and consumption is being improved with an impact on both the natural gas and electricity systems. This development demands further integration between subsectors in order to balance the integrated systems.  Cybersecurity The energy sectors are crucial for maintaining our society as we know it. Consequently there is a need for the sectors to be protected from and resilient towards different risks and vulnerabilities. More and more of our energy security networks are digital and in some cases linked to the internet. Therefore, one of the growing threats is cyber, which is why cyber and information security in the energy sectors is highly important. In January 2019, the former Minister for Energy, Utilities and Climate published a cyber and information strategy specifically aimed at securing the energy sectors and thereby the high security of supply we have in Denmark. The strategy was developed in close collaboration with the businesses in the energy sector in recognition of the need for cooperation between businesses and authorities. The strategy entails ten initiatives which ensure that the energy sectors in the future will be resilient towards the challenges which enhanced technology creates and will continue to generate. The strategy is in the process of being implemented and towards 2021 the initiatives and thereby the strategy will improve the cyber and information security in the energy sectors and thereby the energy security.   Electricity supply security With the Energy Agreement of 2018, the Parliament has allocated funding that sets a path towards a renewable energy share of total energy consumption of approximately 55 % in 2030. The agreement will also give Denmark an RE share in electricity above 100% of consumption. This ambitious development path, set for Denmark in the 2018 Energy Agreement, has two important implications for the security of electricity supply in Denmark. Firstly, Denmark aims for an increased level of electrification in our energy system. This puts pressure on the electricity supply and challenges the security of supply, as more         58  appliances, especially cars and heating systems will run on electricity. The increased electricity demand from such units implies that generation and grid adequacy issues need to be addressed where constraints may arise. This issue is amplified by the plans to construct large datacentres, which will consume large amounts of electricity and will challenge the generation and grid adequacy further.  Secondly, the security of electricity supply will be affected as the renewable energy sources providing the electricity are primarily wind and solar power, which are highly fluctuating sources of energy. That will lead to periods of low electricity generation, which would previously have been covered by running the thermal power plants, but which in the future will have to be covered by other means.  Solutions and objectives for tackling the issues that arise with the increasing share of renewables in the electricity generation are presented in the following. One of the most important solutions to the problem of fluctuating energy sources is to ensure sufficient interconnections with our neighbouring countries.  Denmark is among the countries in Europe with the strongest interconnectors to neighbouring countries compared to the national electricity demand. Capacity in interconnectors is expected to increase in the coming years (Kriegers Flak, Cobra Cable, Viking Link etc.). That is, by becoming more interconnected, Denmark can sell electricity at times when there is a lot of wind and buy electricity at times when there is less, from countries that may have hydro power or different wind profiles, i.e. the security of supply is becoming a more shared objective in the future. The specific objectives regarding enhancements of interconnectivity can be found in section 2.4. Secondly, it is important to connect an increasing amount of new electricity generators to the system. For this to have the best effect it is necessary to consider the location of the new electricity generators in order to match it with where the electricity consumption is situated. The specific objectives regarding the expansion of electricity generation from renewable energy sources are described in section 2.1.2.  Another objective for the future Danish energy system is to make sure that the demand for electricity does not rise to levels that cannot be met by the supply and to make the most efficient energy investments in line with the energy efficiency first principle. Energy efficiency objectives in terms of energy savings in buildings and households and for appliances are described in section 2.2. Reducing demand cenergy efficiency target of 32.5 % in 2030. It is also  important to make use of the existing energy sources to its full potential by integrating the different energy resources and by using data and digitalisation of the system to optimize the system. This strategy is termed smart energy and as prescribed by the Energy Agreement of 2018 a smart energy action plan is underway. An additional way of ensuring sufficient electricity supply is by decreasing or shifting demand. The most important demand to limit is that which takes place in peak load, as peak load is what determines the capacity dimensioning. Thus, there is a need to shift         59  demand away from specific points in time and to use the possibilities of flexible consumption and demand response. For that to happen, favourable conditions for flexible electricity consumption must be promoted, which is a goal for Denmark. Furthermore, energy storage could be a useful tool to ensure sufficient supplies of energy, by levelling out demand peaks and by making use of surplus wind energy from times of high wind power generation to store for later times of shortage. Today, the technologies available for storing electricity are rather limited and expensive. Yet, the technologies will possibly continue to be developed and become profitable with time, as current trends in prices of storage technologies are indicating. This means that in the future it is not unlikely that for instance power-to-gas and the hydrogen sector could play a larger role in ensuring supply security and that batteries will become more prominent in the energy markets.  Climate change risks affecting the power network and biomass resources With the increased level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, more often and more severe weather phenomena are anticipated to occur. This raises a question of whether storms will create an issue of maintaining a functioning power network, for instance with the increased risk of torn down lines and falling pylons. But in Denmark this issue has been mitigated already during the past decades, since a large part of the power network is cable-laid with the aim of avoiding such risks. To a large extend, this happened in reaction to the hurricane in December 1999, where many power lines were broken and in Denmark 440.000 households experienced a loss of electricity supply. The operation of running cables instead of overhead lines led to significantly less power disconnections when the hurricane of October 2013 came, cf. Figure 13 showing minutes of outage in the distribution grid. The objective is to continuously run cables rather than overhead lines, when possible, to minimize the risk.  On the other hand, the hurricane in 2013 was subject to a controlled shutdown of many wind turbines, necessitated by the fact that wind turbines are more likely to break under the heavy rotation that extreme weather entails. This illustrates how the shutdown of wind turbines in similar cases makes out another risk to the power supply. Yet, the wind has a tendency to travel across the country over a span of hours creating a time lag which lessens this risk. In combination with the electricity imports via the many interconnectors that Denmark has, it meant that there were no power outages due to the hurricane in 2013. Furthermore, there has been a focus on enhancing the robustness of the wind turbine technology lately in order to overcome this problem.               60  Figure 13. Average number of minutes of outage over the year at a point of delivery or a household, 1999-2018  Source: Energinet The climate change risks with respect to biomass resources seem less applicable in a Danish context. If heavy winds overthrow trees, it will have a decreasing effect on the price of biomass, which will not cause a problem for the energy security. Furthermore, desertification of the lands that provide the biomass Denmark uses is not considered a risk.   Responsibilities  The Minister of Climate, Energy and Utilities has the overall responsibility for the security of supply for electricity and natural gas in Denmark. The Minister also determines a planning goal for the level of security of electricity supply according to a law that entered into force in 2018. The operational and technical monitoring and maintenance of the security of supply is ensured by the national TSO (Energinet). The TSO is responsible for ensuring the presence of sufficient generation capacity or imports, grid adequacy at transmission level and balancing the system and maintaining security of supply together with the efficient utilization of the coherent electricity supply system and natural gas system. The TSO is responsible for the sector risk preparedness plans within both the electricity and natural gas sectors. The sector risk preparedness plan for electricity covers the entire connected electricity grid in west and eastern Denmark. The sector risk preparedness for electricity is developed with consideration to the cross-border effects to the neighbouring countries and the interconnectors. The sector risk preparedness plan for electricity describes how the TSO plans to handle an emergency situation in the entire Danish power grid in a coordinated fashion, which at the same time ensures a common perception of the situation at a DSO and production level. The sector risk preparedness plan for electricity also describes how the TSO plans to handle a cyber security emergency situation in the Danish electricity grid with focus on the responsibilities of the TSO, DSOs and power producers, ways of communication, requirements for situational reports, encryptions and segmentation instructions etc. The same considerations go for the sector risk preparedness plan for the natural gas sector, and are consequently not described in further detail. The sector risk preparedness plan for electricity is coordinated with the sector risk preparedness plan for 020406080100120140160Yearly outage minutes >100 kV25-99 kV0-24 kVBy household By point of delivery         61  natural gas and vice versa. The risk preparedness plans for the natural gas sector are coherent with the respective EU-Regulation 2017/1938 concerning measures to safeguard security of gas supply and sector specific EU regulation.  Security of heat supply While even short disruptions of electricity supply may have adverse effects on industry, service and healthcare providers etc., disruption of heat supply might last for hours before buildings cool down. Often, this allows for the deployment of auxiliary heating systems such as electric heaters. Thus, heating is considered less critical than the supply of electricity and published in 2016 by the Ministry for Energy, Utilities and Climate. Thus, no regulation or targets are in place concerning short-term supply security.  The Danish heating demand is covered primarily by district heating, supplying approximately 65 % of households, while the remaining are supplied by natural gas distribution systems or individual heat generation such as biomass boilers, electric heat pumps and oil burners, the latter of which are being phased out. The large-scale deployment of the district hoil burners supplied more than 60 % of the heating demand in Danish households. Combined heat and power plants and district heating were seen as an energy efficiency measure necessary for diminishing the dependency on imported oil, and for decreasing the amount of imported coal. As part of the green transition, the roles in the energy system of the heating and district heating sectors are expected to change. Electrification and a higher degree of distributed generation will support the incorporation of fluctuating RE-sources in the electricity system, as an example. Moreover, the use of geothermal energy in the heating sector is expected to increase and the use of surplus heat as well. Several analyses being conducted in preparation of this transition are underway and include a strong focus on the continuance of supply in the heating sector. Ending fossil fuel subsidies and  Until January 2019, electricity generation on combined heat and power plants based on natural gas or waste incineration were subsidized. From 2019, the support scheme is rapidly being phased out, leaving substantial losses for some district heating companies. Due to the non-profit nature of the district heating system, these deficits are expected to translate into increased heating tariffs. Consequently, parts of the consumer base in a few areas are expected to lower consumption, partly replacing district heating with individual solutions, or leave the district heating systems entirely and deploy individual heating solutions instead. As heat sales weaken, tariffs may increase to unsustainable levels for the remaining consumers, resulting in the termination of district heating operation. The most vulnerable district heating systems are expected to be found in rural towns. In these district without the economic means to successfully establish alternative heating solutions. These         62  risks are being analysed, and the Energy policy agreement of 2018 contains measures handling the security and cost of heat supply for these costumers.  Oil Oil and gas will continue to play a role in the energy mix in years to come.  In March 2017 the former government signed a new North Sea agreement with the Danish Underground Consortium (DUC) designed to ensure a future for oil production in the North Sea. The agreement supports investment in oil and gas extraction in the North Sea by, among other things, completely re-building the ageing Tyra fields. The renovation will allow the extraction of an expected 129 million barrels of oil.  The 2018 Energy Agreement confirms that, alongside the expansion of green energy, there will be a continued utilisation of oil and gas resources in the North Sea.  (ii) National objectives with regard to increasing: the diversification of energy sources and supply from third countries for the purpose of increasing the resilience of regional and national energy systems Denmark currently does not have objectives specifically focussed on diversifying energy supply from third countries. Since we are in a transition to a fossil fuel independent society to 1990, there will be less need for import of fossil energy from third countries in general.   (iii) Where applicable, national objectives with regard to reducing energy import dependency from third countries, for the purpose of increasing the resilience of regional and national energy systems Denmark does not have national objectives for reducing the energy import dependency of third countries, since these dependencies are limited due to the diversification of energy sources and the production of oil and gas within Denmark. The dependency on import of coal is decreasing as a result of integration of more renewable energy and closure of coal fired power plants. The objective to phase out coal in electricity generation by 2030, as stated in the Energy Agreement from June 2018, is a contributing factor to this end. However, the transition towards integration of renewables leads to an increasing dependency on a well-functioning market for electricity across the Nordic region.   In regard to natural gas, Denmark has been a net exporter of natural gas since the introduction of natural gas in 1984. The importance of natural gas in the Danish energy supply has been decreasing in the last decade. This development is expected to continue in the following years as natural gas is expected to cover respectively about 12 % in 2020, 11 % in 2023 and 10 % in 2030 of the total Danish energy mix. The dependency on natural gas is decreasing as a result of a lower gas consumption altogether and the fact that there will be an increasing amount of biogas injected into the gas system. The main gas production facility in the Danish North Sea  Tyra  will be shut down from November 2019 to July 2022 due to reconstruction of the facility. Denmark will in this period be net importer of gas. When the Tyra-facility comes on stream Denmark will return         63  to be a net exporter of natural gas to at least 2029. Furthermore, the Baltic Pipe-project is planned to come on stream in 2022 and will establish a new transport route for Norwegian gas to Europe which will increase the diversification of gas supplies to Denmark.  With regard to the implementation of Regulation 2017/1938 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply, Denmark has participated in the regional risk groups Norway, Baltic Sea and Denmark. Denmark was lead in the risk group Denmark. The single largest infrastructure is identified as Inter Connection Point (IP) Ellund  the single source of supply in the most critical period when the Tyra-facility is shut down. The N  1 calculation shows that Denmark complies with the infrastructure standard in the period of reconstruction of the Tyra complex when the investment in expansion of the Lille Torup storage facility is completed in 2019 before the shut-down of the Tyra complex: N  1 = 100 %, compared to 88 % if the Lille Torup storage facility is not expanded. According to the Regulation the National Risk Assessment, Preventive Action Plan and Emergency Plan have been notified to the Commission in due time. In order to comply with the Regulation Member States have to lay down rules on penalties to natural gas undertakings for failing to comply with the notification obligations the Parliament has passed an amendment to the Act on Natural Gas Supply. The Act now includes sanctions for violation of rules in Regulation 2017/1938/EU.  Furthermore, Denmark will have to make agreements with Germany and Sweden in technical, legal and financial arrangements in order to ensure that gas can be supplied to solidarity protected customers in one of the Member States in case of a request. A dialog with Germany and Sweden on these arrangements is ongoing.  Historically, Denmark has imported coal from a lot of different countries. This diversification has led to a stable and secure coal supply. In recent years, the political decision to move towards an energy system with an increasing share of renewable energy and the phase out of electricity generation from coal before 2030 has made the energy system less dependent on coal. In the heating sector, coal and natural gas are being replaced primarily by imported biomass for combined heat and power production and  to a lesser extent  electric heat pumps. While no targets exists, several measures over the past five years including the Energy Agreement of 2018 have been put in place furthering the deployment of large scale solar thermal plants and electric heat pumps including geothermal plants and utilization of surplus heat. These measures serve as a way of counteracting the dependency on biomass of the next step of the decarbonisation of the heating sector as well as enabling integration of the heating sector with the electricity sector on the demand side. (iv) National objectives with regard to increasing the flexibility of the national energy system, in particular by means of deploying domestic energy sources, demand response and energy storage The flexibility of the energy system is expected to be facilitated largely by market-based solutions. Therefore, it is an objective to support structures that favour demand response         64  and energy storage markets. Additionally, it is a goal to ensure a significant increase in the number of electric vehicles on the roads and the required transport sector transition. Moreover, a gas strategy, a roadmap for smart energy, as well as significant increase of heat pumps in the heating sector for both district heating and individual heat production should contribute to a more flexible energy system. Especially the integration with the district heating sector and its vast energy storage capacity is expected to provide a basis for increasing flexibility through increased demand response and energy storages.
