3.3 Dimension Energy security74  Measures to ensure security of electricity supply On 1 January 2019, the total installed capacity of the Lithuanian power system was 3,684 megawatts (MW), of which:  the installed capacity of thermal power plants is 1,915 MW ;  the installed capacity of waste-to-energy power plants is 22 MW ;  the installed capacity of the hydroelectric power plants is 1,028 MW ;  the installed capacity of wind power plants is 533 MW ;  the installed capacity of other RES power plants is 186 MW .  The following changes in power generation are expected in 2019-2028:  the 60 MW  units at the Kaunas Cogeneration Power Plant will be decommissioned in 2020;  a power plant of 101 MW  total power (21.7 MW  waste and 79.2 MW  biomass) will be launched in Vilnius in 2020;  the cogeneration power plant of UAB Kaunas Cogeneration Plant with an installed capacity of                                                            73Indicative funding requirement. 74 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 148   26 MW  burning non-hazardous waste and biomass in  MW ) will be decommissioned in 2022;  the 6 MW  TG-2 unit of AB Lifosa will be decommissioned in 2026, and the possibility of replacing it with a new 20 MW  turbo generator in 2025 is being considered;  The installed capacity of power plants using RES in 2028: 252 MW  for biofuel power plants, 180 MW  for solar power plants, 1,000 MW  for onshore wind power plants and 128 MW  for hydropower plants.  Given that a detailed study on the possibilities of wind energy development in the Baltic Sea will be prepared and the conditions for the implementation of the projects will be examined in 2021-2022 at the initiative of the Ministry of Energy, the development of wind farms ( with a 700 MW -1,400 MW  capacity) is envisaged in the maritime territory after 2025. Assuming that only terrestrial wind farms will be developed until 2025 and that maritime wind farms parks will be developed alongside after 2025, the total wind farm capacity will increase to 1,700 MW  in 2028.  In order to adequately prepare for changes in the electricity system as the country's energy sector's dependence on fossil fuels is being reduced, the markets are integrating and energy production from RES is growing, the electricity transmission system operator is organising a study on energy development in Lithuania, which will formulate scenarios for the development of the Lithuanian electricity sector up to 2050, conduct an assessment of the adequacy of the electricity system and present technical, economic and legal measures for the efficient functioning of the electricity system in the development scenarios envisaged. The study will assess global trends, anticipate possible long-term development scenarios and plan in advance the measures and resources needed to implement the objectives and achieve greater synergies between different energy sources. Potential synergies between electricity, natural gas and heat through the integration of renewable energy sources will also be identified.  Kruonis Pumped Storage Plant. When the load on the energy system is low and there is a lot of cheap in pump mode, lift water from the Kaunas Reservoir to the artificial upper 303 ha basin located 100 m above the Kaunas Reservoir water level. During the day, when energy demand increases, the Kruonis PSP can operate as a conventional hydroelectric power plant. For the prevention of and response to systemic accidents, it is important that the Kruonis PSP units can provide rapid backup power  they are capable of connecting to the network at full capacity in less than 2 minutes. Kruonis PSP units are ready to automatically descend from the emergency control scheme and compensate for power shortages. Other equally important functions of the Kruonis PSP are system load balancing, voltage and frequency regulation, and black start capability.  Currently, there are four hydraulic units installed in Kruonis PSP but the original design of the power plant provides the possibility of constructing another four units. In order to maintain reliable local generation, expansion is envisaged by building a fifth 225 MW  asynchronous hydraulic unit. According to the technical characteristics, the hydraulic unit would be able to operate at a 110-225 MW capacity in pump mode and at a 55-225 MW capacity in generator mode. The project is being implemented in the context of the development of renewable energy sources (RES) in the region. A new unit of the Kruonis PSP would address one of the main challenges posed by the development of RES worldwide, namely the need for flexible, real-time management of imbalances in wind power production. As countries in the region increase the share of RES in electricity generation, the demand for this service will increase ever more. With the emergence of new production capacity, a higher base production and a need for reserves are anticipated. The major share 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 149   of the secondary reserve of true power will ensured by the flexible units of the Kruonis PSP. Although the existing capacity of 900 MW is sufficient for the operation of the power plant under current market conditions, its further development is important for ensuring the country's energy independence and competitiveness by maintaining sufficient and reliable domestic generation capacity. A new, more efficient unit would allow much more flexibility in real time to make up for electricity shortages or surpluses in the market. The project is included in the List of projects of common interest and receives support from the CEF for socio-economic and technical studies.  The market for reserve power services. Article 23(1) of the Law on Electricity provides that the electricity transmission system operator is responsible for the stability and reliability of the operation of the electricity system, the performance of the national balancing function in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania, the provision of system services, including the power reserve, the operation, maintenance, management and development of interconnections with the electricity systems of other countries, by reducing the capacity constraints in the transmission networks and taking into account the needs of electricity system and electricity grid users. According to Article 2(39) of the Law on Electricity, the reserve capacity service is the generation potential (capacity) of electricity, which must be ensured continuously by the service providers throughout the year. In order to meet this requirement, a market for reserve power services has been created in Lithuania.  Isolated operation of the electricity system. In accordance with the provisions of the Law on the Integration of the Electricity System of the Republic of Lithuania into the European electricity systems, the Lithuanian electricity transmission system operator has to establish, for each calendar year, the emergency, prevention and response system services, which include preparedness to ensure isolated operation of the electricity system and are necessary for the implementation of synchronisation of the electricity system, in order to ensure preparedness for isolated operation of the electricity system in emergencies prior to connection to the continental European electricity grid for synchronous operation.  European regulation on crisis prevention and management. Regulation (EU) 2019/941 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector and repealing Directive 2005/89/EC ('Regulation (EU) 2019/941') was adopted on 5 June 2019. Regulation (EU) 2019/941 establishes a common framework of rules on how to prevent, prepare for and manage electricity crises, bringing more transparency in the preparation phase and during an electricity crisis and ensuring that measures are taken in a coordinated and effective manner. Member States are obliged to draw up risk preparedness plans, and Regulation (EU) 2019/941 sets out common principles for crisis management in the electricity sector. The adoption of this Regulation and the equivalence of this system with that of the natural gas sector will have a positive impact on the security of the Lithuanian electricity system and on crisis prevention. In accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2019/941, risk preparedness plans should be approved and published by 5 January 2022. Measures to ensure security of natural gas supply In accordance with EU and national legislation, Lithuania accumulates fuel reserves and, therefore, in the event of a natural gas supply disruption, it is possible to supply household customers with natural gas through the connection between the Lithuanian and Latvian gas pipeline systems, using the gas reserves in the pipelines and having disconnected all other customers. Gas suppliers have accumulated sufficient quantities of natural gas for gas supply to vulnerable customers. Most of the reserve gas supplies are stored  3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 150    A risk assessment is being carried out in Lithuania in accordance with the Regulation concerning measures to safeguard security of gas supply and, on the basis of the results of this assessment, preventive action and emergency plans are being established and approved by order of an the Minister for Energy of the Republic of Lithuania. The summary of the risk assessment and the preventive action and emergency management plans are published on the website of the Ministry of Energy75 and in the Register of Legislation76. These plans also establish a regional dimension whereby Member States assist each other in the event of a natural gas emergency by diverting gas flows to customers protected by a neighbouring country affected by the emergency.  The Regulation concerning measures to safeguard security of gas supply lays down an infrastructure standard (N-1), describing the technical capacity of the gas infrastructure to meet total gas demand in a defined area of application of the (N-1) formula in the event of a disruption of the operation of one of the largest gas infrastructures on a day of exceptionally high gas demand, which occurs once every 20 years based on statistical probability. Based on the calculation of the N-1 criterion, the risk assessment has shown that this target of gas supply reliability in Lithuania has been met and equals 117%. The construction of the gas pipeline to Poland will raise the value of the N-1 criterion to 214% and the increase in the capacity of the Lithuanian-Latvian gas interconnector will raise the value of the N-1 criterion to 272%. It should be noted that Lithuania did not meet this standard prior to the start of operations of the LNG terminal (37.1%).77  It should be noted that the National Preventive Action Plan for Security of Natural Gas Supply78 includes obligations for natural gas transmission system operators and distribution system operators to draw up emergency energy preparedness plans. All natural gas undertakings have such plans.  The Procedure for supplying consumers with energy and/or energy resources in the event of an emergency79 regulates the supply of energy and energy resources to consumers in the event of an emergency, as well as emergency preparedness and management. The Procedure states that emergency preparedness plans include the following measures:  ensuring the operation of enterprises in the event of an emergency;  ensuring the best possible supply of energy resources and energy to consumers;  use of alternative energy sources;  reduction of the consumption of energy resources and energy in the enterprise;  limitation of the supply of energy resources and energy to consumers.  Natural gas stocks are maintained at a level sufficient for the following cases: a 30-day period of exceptionally high gas demand (coldest period); or extreme temperatures in a peak period of seven days, which occurs once every 20 years based on statistical probability; or a period of at least 30 days in average winter conditions in the event of disruption of one of the largest gas infrastructures.

POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 151   tiekimas has entered into an agreement with the Latvian gas storage system operator, AB Conexus, for the   It should also be noted that energy security in the field of natural gas will be enhanced by the Gas Interconnection Poland-Lithuania (GIPL) and Enhancement of Latvia-Lithuania interconnection (ELLI) projects, discussed in more detail in section 2.4.2 .   Oil stocks The accumulation, storage and renewal of reserve energy resources is provided for in Article 29 of the Law on Energy. It requires energy undertakings with heat and/or power generation installations with a capacity exceeding 5 MW and producing heat or electricity for sale to have reserve energy resources. They are accumulated, stored and renewed by energy companies and other funds. Their quantities must be sufficient for at least 10 days. The most common stocks are biofuels, heavy fuel oil, shale oil and diesel. Natural gas is not considered as a backup fuel in any of the enterprises storing fuel stocks. Backup fuel stocks must be maintained during the cold season of the year. During the warm period of the year (1 April to 31 October), the energy backup requirements and quantities are determined by the energy undertakings themselves.  Council Directive 2009/119/EC of 14 September 2009 obliging Member States to maintain stocks of crude oil and/or petroleum products requires that the total oil stocks maintained at all times within the EU Member States correspond, at the very least, to 90 days of average daily net imports or 61 days of average daily inland consumption, whichever of the two quantities is greater. In Lithuania, special stocks of petroleum products are stored and managed at the expense of the State. These stocks must be sufficient for at least 30 days, on the basis of average daily domestic consumption during the previous calendar year. The remainder of the stocks is accumulated by the obliged undertakings.  The accumulation of these stocks is ensured by the public institution Lithuanian Energy Agency, which also ensures that the quality of petroleum product stocks complies with the mandatory requirements for the was built in 1964. After Lithuania regained its independence, the terminal has been constantly upgraded, and since 2012 it has been operated by AB   Regional cooperation The Regulation concerning measures to safeguard security of gas supply groups Member States according to the main sources of natural gas supply. Lithuania belongs to 2 groups: Belarus and North-Eastern Europe. Countries in the same group are obliged to perform joint risk assessment and joint regional chapters of preventive action and emergency management plans. These chapters cover the main aspects of emergency cooperation between Member States connected by natural gas pipelines.  Other forms of cooperation are described section 1.4.   Financing instruments at national level It should be noted that projects benefiting from CEF investments are described in more detail in section 2.4.2, and the funding plans for them are described below.  3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 152   It is also noteworthy that, according to the 20132020 Operational Programme for investment from the European Union Funds envisages investments to increase the security and reliability of networks:  For electricity transmission networks, support is provided to the construction of new advanced electricity transmission lines that will ensure reciprocal transmission of electricity through inter-system connections Lithuania-Poland (LitPol Link) and Lithuania-Sweden (NordBalt), upgrading (restoration) of existing lines, ensuring security of electricity supply to customers, as well as construction of new advanced transformer substations and switch yards and the reconstruction (upgrading) of existing ones, replacement of overhead  power  lines with underground ones to ensure security of electricity supply to both existing and new customers and contributing to the integration of RES into the Lithuanian electricity system.  Following the implementation of the project listed above, the electricity transmission networks will comply with the standards of Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure (a network that can integrate in a cost efficient manner the behaviour and actions of all users connected to it, including generators, consumers and those that both generate and consume, in order to ensure an economically efficient and sustainable power system with low losses and high levels of quality, security of supply and safety).  For electricity distribution networks, investments are made in the modernisation and development of electricity distribution networks and in the deployment of advanced technologies. Under this measure, investments are made in upgrading the substations, distribution points and lines of the medium and low voltage distribution network through the installation of new equipment and/or network elements with additional technical and functional characteristics of equipment and/or network elements for the management of the smart grid. Support is also provided for smart grid management systems, including, but not limited to, the installation of data transmission and remote control facilities in switch yards and transformer substations, installation of their control systems and the installation of smart metering and their control systems.  Following the implementation of these projects, the electricity transmission networks will comply with the standards of Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure (an network that can integrate in a cost efficient manner the behaviour and actions of all users connected to it, including generators, consumers and those that both generate and consume, in order to ensure an economically efficient and sustainable power system with low losses and high levels of quality, security of supply and safety).  For gas transmission networks, investments in advanced gas transmission network systems. Investments are made in the internal gas transmission networks necessary to ensure security of gas supply and integration of the Lithuanian gas systems into the internal market of the European Community. Investments are also intended for measures to improve security of gas supply and energy efficiency: installation of software and hardware for the efficient operation of the transmission system, installation of metering and gas quality assessment tools and telemetry, and installation and upgrading of gas distribution and compressor stations.  For gas transmission networks, investments in an advanced gas transmission network system a made. Projects for gas distribution network looping and the installation of controlled valves are funded. This creates smart grid technologies to ensure the reliability of natural gas distribution and to expand 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 153   management options. It is planned to support projects for the introduction of smart metering of natural gas by improving the ability of customers to control their gas consumption and enhancing system management capabilities.  Ongoing projects to connect markets are inseparable from the projects listed in both section 2.4.2 and the section above. While the implementation of the main strategic projects (electricity connections between Lithuania and Poland and between Sweden and Lithuania) were financed from above mentioned sources, reinforcement of internal electricity transmission grids is being financed from 2014-2020 EU structural funds. In this respect, around EUR 69 million will be allocated for upgrading and expanding internal electricity transmission networks. EUR 53 million euros have been allocated for the gas transmission networks.  It is noteworthy that, pursuant to the 20132020 Operational programme for investment from the European Union, electricity and natural gas transmission system projects are defined in the National Plan for electricity and natural gas transmission infrastructure projects80.  Funding under CEF The strategic projects in which Lithuania participates are described in greater detail in section 2.3 and are included in the list of projects of common interest and are eligible for funding from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).
