4.6. Dimension: Research, innovation and competitiveness i. Current situation of the low-carbon-technologies sector and, to the extent possible, its position on the global market (that analysis is to be carried out at Union or global level) Since 2007, the SR has been a member of the International Energy Agency, which is also engaged in research into low-carbon energy technologies with a view to achieving long-term goals in globally reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In 2016, the SR became the first country in Central and Eastern Europe to become a member of the IEA Solar Heating & Cooling Programme (SHC) technology cooperation programme. The participation of the SR in this programme will enable the development of scientific knowledge in the SR and improved involvement of Slovak scientists in the international research community. ii. Current level of public and, where available, private research and innovation spending on low-carbon-technologies, current number of patents, and current number of researchers Only data from the RDD IEA questionnaire are available; this looks at structured research and development funding for energy, which also provides information on R&D funding for low-carbon technologies for 2015-2017. iii. Breakdown of current price elements that make up the main three price components (energy, network, taxes/levies) Transparency of energy prices is guaranteed in the EU through the obligation of EU Member States to send EUROSTAT information on prices for different categories of consumers in industry as well as  data on market shares, sales conditions and pricing systems. Provision of prices for household consumers is voluntary. Gas and electricity tariffs vary by supplier. They can result from agreed contracts, especially for large industrial consumers. In the case of smaller consumers, they are usually determined by the amount of gas consumed using other characteristics, most of which include some form of fixed charge. Therefore, there is no single price for natural gas or electricity. The information that is published in EUROSTAT statistics on natural gas prices is surveyed together for three different types of households, and information on electricity prices is surveyed for five different types according to individual annual consumption bands. In the case of industrial consumers, price information is surveyed for six different types of users in the case of gas prices, and for industrial consumers, information on electricity prices is collected for seven different types of users. The legal basis for the statistical surveying of gas prices charged to consumers in industry is European Commission Decision (2007/394/EC) of 7 June 2007 amending Council Directive (90/377/EEC) with regard to the methodology to be applied for the collection of gas and electricity prices charged to industrial end-users. Directive 2008/92/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 concerning a Community procedure to improve the transparency of gas and electricity prices charged to industrial end-users. The natural gas price, or the electricity price for end-users within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/1952 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2016 on European statistics on natural gas and electricity prices and repealing Directive 2008/92/EC is the sum of three main components: Energy and supply, network (transport and distribution) and a component including taxes, levies and fees. The following items are included in the individual components: Gas Energy and supply include the commodity price of natural gas paid by the supplier or the price of natural gas at the point of entry into the transmission network and, where appropriate, storage costs and costs associated with the sale of natural gas to final customers. Network charges include the following costs: gas transmission and distribution tariffs, transmission and distribution losses, network charges, after-sales service costs, system operating costs, and rental costs and consumption measurement. Taxes, fees and charges are the sum of all taxes, fees and levies.  Electricity Energy and supply include the following costs: electricity generation, storage, balancing energy, delivered energy costs, customer service, post-warranty service and other delivery costs. Network charges include the following costs: electricity transmission and distribution tariffs, transmission and distribution losses, network charges, post-warranty costs, system operating costs, and costs of renting a meter and measuring consumption. Taxes, fees and charges are the sum of all taxes, fees and levies.  iv. Description of energy subsidies, including for fossil fuels Environment Fund The Environment Fund was primarily established to provide State support for environmental care and environment creation on sustainable development principles. The main mission of the Fund is to provide funding to applicants in the form of subsidies or loans to support projects under actions  aimed at achieving the objectives of the State Environmental Policy at national, regional or local level. In addition, the Fund also provides funds for other activities and activities referred to in Section 4(1) of the Environment Fund Act (http://www.Environment Fund.sk/sk/o-nas).

According to a valid resolution of the Government of the Slovak Republic, this State aid is to end no later than the end of 2023. Slovenské elektrárne, a.s. owns and operates the Nováky thermal power plant located in Zemianske ensuring the  The Nováky power plant produces and supplies a minimum of 870 GWh and a maximum of 1 100 GWh of electricity generated using domestic coal to the electricity system per year. Slovenské elektrárne, a.s. receives compensation for this public service obligation representing the difference between their revenues from the sale of the electricity and other services and the generation costs. These costs are compensated to Slovenské elektrárne, a.s. based on a mechanism established by the Regulatory Office for Network Industries pursuant to a decree setting price regulation in the electricity sector. Slovenské elektrárne, a.s. is entitled to a fixed price for each MWh of electricity supplied to the system and demonstrably generated from domestic coal. The total volume of electricity produced and delivered (870 to 1 100 GWh) represents approximately 0.5% to 0.6% of the total estimated demand for primary energy in Slovakia. The amount is estimated to be up to approximately EUR 100 million a year, depending on the real and transparently published costs and taking into account the polluter pays principle.
