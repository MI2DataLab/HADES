190 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   4.4 Energy Security Dimension i. The current mix of energy sources, domestic energy sources, dependency on imports, including related risks The current mix of energy sources Energy supply in 2017 is dominated by liquid fuels representing a share of 34%, with RES and waste at 15%, nuclear energy at 13%, gas fuels at 10%, electricity and solid fuels with a 9% share, hydro-electric power with a 8% share, while other fuels have a less than 1% share. Figure 57: Energy supply structure in 2017  Key to Figure 57:   Solid fuels  Liquid fuels  Gaseous fuels  Hydro-electric power  Nuclear energy  RES and waste  Hydrogen  Electricity  Heat The table below shows the energy supply structure by energy product for 2017 and the projections for both the existing measures (EM) scenario and the scenario with additional measures (NEPN) for 2030 and 2040. Liquid fuels dominate throughout the whole period, but consumption of these is already discernibly reduced by 2030, in particular in the NEPN scenario with additional measures thanks to the intensive electrification of transport. In the existing measures scenario, final energy consumption will increase by 2030, in particular on account of transport. In addition to transport, energy consumption increases in industry as well as in other uses on account of economic growth in these sectors. The only sector where energy consumption is reduced is households. The NEPN projections envisage the intensive implementation of EEU measures. 191 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Table 56: Structure of energy supply by energy sources for 2017 and projection according to the EM and NEPN scenarios for 2030 and 2040   EM   NEPN     2017 2030 2040 2030 2040 2040       SintP nuclear Energy supply excluding non-energy use [ktoe] 6 788 6 917 6 901 6 117 5 601 6 940 Solid fuels [ktoe] 1 133 780 552 568 560 555 Liquid fuels [ktoe] 2 199 2 241 2 073 1 717 612 612 of which synthetic fuels [ktoe] 0 0 0 0 53 53 Gaseous fuels [ktoe] 733 1 228 1 599 897 1 273 1 006 of which synthetic fuels [ktoe] 0 0 0 90 318 252 Hydro-electric power [ktoe] 333 392 393 394 458 458 Nuclear energy [ktoe] 1 638 1 450 1 451 1 466 1 467 3 628 RES and waste [ktoe] 796 856 830 1 099 1 358 1 348 Hydrogen [ktoe] 0 2 17 10 70 70 Net electricity imports [ktoe] -44 -49 -33 -34 -203 -744 Final energy consumption [ktoe] 4 859 5 132 5 110 4 565 3 832 3 832 Solid fuels [ktoe] 38 5 0 3 0 0 Liquid fuels [ktoe] 2 191 2 238 2 070 1 715 610 610 of which synthetic fuels [ktoe] 0 0 0 0 53 53 Gaseous fuels [ktoe] 610 691 740 632 756 756 of which synthetic fuels [ktoe] 0 0 0 63 189 189 RES and waste [ktoe] 676 725 651 772 669 669 Hydrogen [ktoe] 0 2 17 10 63 63 Electricity [ktoe] 1 163 1 305 1 476 1 279 1 586 1 585 Heat [ktoe] 181 166 155 155 148 148 Domestic energy sources (three pillars of energy security) The production of electricity in Slovenia for the most part uses domestic sources, which are the foundation of security of the energy or electricity supply. This involves use of the following:  renewable energy sources, the share being ensured by large hydro-electric installations,  domestic coal and lignite and  nuclear energy. Thus, in 2017, the three pillars of electricity security provided 14 984 GWh of electricity, which represents 104% of final customers' electricity consumption. nuclear power plant is taken into account, domestic production covered 83% of electricity consumption in 201782. Using domestic sources ensures a reliable high-quality electricity supply.                                                            82  Source: AGEN RS, Report on the Energy Situation in Slovenia in 2017 and 2018. 192 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Electricity balance In the past, Slovenia has almost always had a positive electricity balance, although it has fluctuated significantly over the years, mainly due to high dependence on hydrological conditions and, not least, the cost competitiveness of domestic production sources in conditions in which electricity prices on the market fall to levels that mean that production is not economically viable. Electricity is imported or exported in response to differences between domestic consumption and electricity production. When there is a deficit from domestic production sources, electricity is imported. Taking account of physical conditions alone, Slovenia is a net exporter. It should be noted that half of the production When consumption on the grid is higher, Slovenia covers a large part of its needs through imports, while in times of lower consumption it is still able to produce surplus electricity for export to foreign markets83. In 2017 the transmission and distribution system in Slovenia took 14 984 GWh of electricity, 249 GWh less than in 2016. The take up of electricity from renewable production facilities was 4 479 GWh, or 616 GWh less than the previous year, while power plants using fossil fuels contributed 4 539 GWh, or 176 GWh less than in 2016. 5 966 GWh of electricity, 543 GWh more than the previous year. The quantities of energy are taken from the accounts of electricity system operators on the basis of physical flows.84 In 2017, 1 032 GWh of electricity from generation facilities connected to the distribution system was taken into the distribution system (which also includes closed distribution systems). In addition, customers' internal networks consumed a further 353 GWh of electricity, or 25% of all electricity produced in generation facilities connected to the distribution system (and closed distribution systems), which is 2% more than in 2016. Taking into account the half-energy sources contributed 12 001 GWh of electricity to the Slovenian electricity system, while final customers consumed 14 468 GWh of electricity, not counting 90 GWh  the quantity of electricity exported to Italy via we covered 82.9% of electricity consumption in Slovenia with domestic sources of production, and dependency on imports, taking the exportation of  into consideration, amounted to 17.1%. New generation capacity amounting to 18 MW was incorporated into the Slovenian electricity system (in 2017), with power plants connected to the distribution system contributing 17 MW and power plants connected to closed distribution systems contributing 1 MW. New and renovated hydro-electric power plants contributed most to the increase with a total capacity of 11.1 MW. New solar power plants also played a significant role in increasing production capacity, contributing 4.7 MW, while combined heat and power (CHP) units added 1 MW. In 2017, there were no major shutdowns of existing production facilities. The share of electricity produced in hydro-electric and other renewable power plants varies annually depending on hydrological and other conditions and also on the volume of investments in the construction of renewable production units. In 2017, this share amounted to approximately 30% of all electricity produced in Slovenia, which is 3% less than the year before. Fossil-fuel power plants contributed about 30% to total production, down one percentage point from the previous year, and the nuclear power plant to 40% of all electricity produced.                                                            83  Development plan of the transmission system of the Republic of Slovenia 2017 to 2026, available at: https://www.eles.si/Portals/0/Publikacije/Razvojni%20nacrt%202017-2026.pdf.  84  Report on the energy situation in Slovenia in 2017, available at: https://www.agen--o-stanju-na--energetike-v-Sloveniji-v-letu-2017/f9f4df2c-810f-4e12-acdd-943104dd3b66. 193 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 58: Shares of primary sources for electricity production in 2013-2017  Source: Report on the Energy Sector in Slovenia in 2017, p. 17 Key to Figure 58:   Renewables,  Nuclear fuel,  Fossil fuels In 2018 nine companies operated electricity generation plants with an installed capacity of more than 10 MW, representing a total installed capacity of 3 320 MW. All large power plants are connected to the transmission network in Slovenia. On the other hand, there is an even greater number of smaller dispersed power producers using different technologies, representing a total 612 MW of installed capacity. Most of these power plants are connected to the distribution network (575 MW) and only a handful (37 MW) to the transmission network. The group of power plants smaller than 10 MW is dominated by solar power plants, followed by small hydro-electric power plants. Large generating plants with installed capacity exceeding 10 MW produced a total 13 959 GWh of electricity, while small sources added 1 364 GWh. was exported to neighbouring Croatia. In 2018, the largest electricity generation company in the country provided 46.5% of all electricity produced in Slovenia. Total electricity consumption in Slovenia in 2018 amounted to 14 616 GWh and was 0.4% more than in the previous year. Business customers consumed 10 116 GWh, while household consumption was 3 368 GWh. The remaining consumption came from losses in the transmission and distribution network (880 GWh) and the operation of pumped hydro-electric systems (252 GWh). Peak load on the transmission network in 2018 was recorded at the beginning of March, which is exceptional as this normally occurs in winter; it amounted to 2 228 MW, or 4.5% more than in 2017. Most consumption was covered by power plants located on Slovenian territory. The remainder was provided by imports. In future, based on projections in the existing measures scenario, due to the standstill in investments in renewable energy sources, the production of electricity from fossil-fuel products (gas) is expected to increase, while the NEPN scenario with additional measures envisages an increased volume of investment in production facilities that use all renewable energy sources (solar, water and wind power), resulting in a significant increase in the share of electricity produced from RES and a decrease in the share of fossil fuels. 194 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 59: Shares of primary sources for electricity production for 2020 and 2030 according to scenarios  Key to Figure 57:  Structure of fuels in the production of electrical energy [%]  Renewable resources  Nuclear energy  Synthetic fuels and hydrogen  Fossil fuels  Until 2018, natural gas in Slovenia was used to a lesser extent for the production of electricity in thermal power plants - ) and Brestanica (TEB). It is expected to be used continuously and more extensively for the first time in the coming years (up to 2022) for the production of heat and electricity at Energetika Ljubljana. Most investments in large installations in the past have been aimed at replacing old coal plants with the most up-to-date best available technology (BAT) options, significantly improving efficiency gains and reducing environmental burden. The replacement of old plants will continue in future, with a continued increase in renewable production. 195 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 60: Production of electricity in hydro-electric, thermal and nuclear power plants in 2020 and 2030 according to scenarios  Key to Figure 57:  Electricity generation [GWh]  Renewable resources  Nuclear energy  Synthetic fuels and hydrogen  Fossil fuels  Slovenia natural gas supply and access to resources Due to the lack of own resources, the supply of the Slovenian natural gas market is entirely dependent on imports. The supply of natural gas to Slovenia comes from Russia and individual nodes of the European gas market. The Slovenian transmission pipeline system is embedded in the European and global international environment and enables users to make choices. The selection system is connected through interconnection points to transmission pipelines managed by different transmission system operators (TSO). The border interconnection points where Slovenian TSOs interface with neighbouring transmission systems are:  the connection with the Austrian TSO, Gas Connect Austria, interconnection point,  the connection with the Italian TSO, Snam Rete Gas, at the  interconnection point and  the connection with the Croatian TSO, Plinacro, at the Rogatec interconnection point. Import dependency In 2017, the total amount of domestic energy sources in Slovenia was 3.7 million toe (=153 PJ), which is 2% more than in 2016. The increase was mainly in the amount of nuclear energy (by 10%) and geothermal and solar energy (by 2%). In 2017, Slovenia met 52% of its energy needs from domestic energy sources. The remaining quantity needed was provided from imports, with the petroleum product supply being secured in its entirety from imports (SORS, 2019). 196 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 61: Energy dependency, Slovenia, source: SORS, 2019  Source: SORS, 2019 Key to Figure 61:  Energy dependence Figure 62: Production, use and coverage of electricity supply 2010-2017  Source: Report on the Energy Sector in Slovenia in 2017, p. 23 Key to Figure 62:  Electricity generation/consumption [GWh]  Production from domestic sources  Electricity consumption  Import dependency Import dependency  The figure above shows the coverage of domestic electricity consumption by domestic production sources. The production of electricity from domestic sources is assured by large hydro-electric power plants, thermal power plants and one nuclear power plant85, which in Slovenia are connected to the electricity transmission system. A small part of the production from domestic sources is connected to the electricity distribution system. Due to the significant share of electricity production from hydro-electric power plants, the total production from domestic sources is highly dependent on hydrological conditions in each period. For the calculation of import dependency, the total electricity consumption takes account - in addition to the consumption of final customers on the transmission and distribution system - of losses on the whole electricity system, deducting the electricity exported to Italy via the distribution system from a substations. In the electricity balance chapter, these quantities are treated as direct consumption on the transmission system.                                                            85   plant is taken into account. 197 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   The coverage of consumption with electricity produced in Slovenia is determined on the basis of the relationship between electricity production in Slovenia and total electricity consumption. In the observed period 2010-2017, import dependency varied considerably and, in addition to the change in production from domestic sources, it was directly influenced by the change in electricity consumption. In the observed period, coverage of the electricity supply was highest in 2014, when, due to extremely favourable hydrological conditions, electricity production from hydro-electric power plants was at its highest while total consumption was less than the previous year. In 2017, there was less coverage of the electricity supply on account of reduced production from domestic sources (especially hydro-electric power plants) at the same time as increased electricity consumption. Figure 63: Electricity production and consumption in Slovenia for 2020 and 2030 according to scenario (including nuclear power plant)  Key to Figure 63:  Electricity [GWh]  Generation of electricity on generator  Gross electricity consumption The scenarios envisage that electricity demand in Slovenia will in future be covered by domestic production to the same extent as previously, as shown in the figure above. Risks and services to maintain stable and safe operation of the Slovenian electricity system (EES) An electricity supply crisis can arise for a number of reasons, such as extreme weather conditions, malicious attacks or fuel shortages. Crisis conditions often have a cross-border effect. Major events, such as periods of severe cold, heat waves or cyberattacks, can affect several EU countries at the same time. Regulation (EU) 2019/941 on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector provides for the preparation of a methodology for defining regional scenarios for electricity supply crises with regard to system adequacy, system security and fuel security and for evaluating the seasonal and short-term adequacy (monthly, week-ahead and day-ahead adequacy) of the power system in the event of extreme weather conditions. The methodology is prepared by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E); a draft was drawn up in January 2020. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/941 on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector, the methodology for identifying regional electricity supply crisis scenarios should take account of at least the following risks: rare and extreme natural hazards, accidental hazards, consequential hazards, including the consequences of malicious attacks and fuel shortages. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/941, the methodology should include at least the following: consideration of all national and regional circumstances, interaction and correlation of risks across borders, simulations of simultaneous electricity supply crisis scenarios, ranking of risks according to 198 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   their impact and probability, principles on how to handle sensitive information while ensuring transparency. System services System operators use system services, especially services related to voltage and frequency regulation, to maintain stable and safe operation of the Slovenian electricity system [EES]. The system services cover all the technical support processes that ensure support for electricity transmission between producers and customers in the EES. The undisrupted transmission of electricity is closely linked to the safe operation of the EES at local, national and European interconnection levels. The most important part of system services are the frequency services - frequency and load control services that compensate for lack of balance between generation and consumption and maintain interconnection stability in the event of disruptions and major outages. The frequency containment reserve (FCR) is a reserve designed to respond quickly to a change in frequency at an interconnection. To this end, when a frequency deviation of 200 mHz occurs in Europe, power of approximately 3 000 MW is automatically activated or deactivated so as to stabilise the frequency. In 2020, the Slovenian system operator is obliged to provide ±15 MW of FCR. Until 2019, this service has been compulsory in the Slovenian electricity system for all aggregates connected to the transmission network, and from 2020 onwards the service will become payable in accordance with amendments to the Energy Act (EZ-1), while at the same time in 2020 Slovenia is expect to join the FCR cooperation in which several European countries take part. The automatic frequency restoration reserve (aFRR) ensures consistency between actual exchanges within the control area and the schedules. In 2020, the TSO will purchase ±60 MW of regulatory reserves of this kind. Such services are assured mainly by conventional generators, and it is expected that in the coming years a considerable share will be taken over by the provision of reserves from storage units, especially batteries. The increased share of renewables is expected to boost the need for the aFRR. The manual frequency restoration reserve (mFRR), together with the aFRR, makes up the energy shortfall in the event of a production or consumer unit failure. Under the Agreement on the operation of the block comprising Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), ELES is required to provide 250 MW positive and 71 MW negative mFRR. The level of this in the Slovenian electricity system [EES] is conditional upon the size of the largest unit in operation. The share of the reserve in relation to the total threshold power of production facilities in the EES in Slovenia is almost 16%, which is one of the largest shares in the countries of the EU. The reasons are the large size of the facilities and the small size of the EES. Because of this and because of the more expensive sources - gas turbines - that for the most part ensure this service, particular attention should be paid to this area in future. The transmission system operator has ensured part (37%) of the required reserve volume through agreements with the neighbouring countries participating in the regulatory block and the remainder through various products within the EES. The system balancing service products are designed on the basis of the rules for system balancing providers to enable the involvement of aggregators with sources and loads (including demand-side management (DSM))86. All subsystems contribute to the overall security of electricity supply. This is achieved by investing in the operational reliability of individual parts and further automation and digitisation of processes. In order to relieve the activation of system services, as early as 2013 the transmission system operator started implementing a mechanism to net imbalances between system operators, first jointly with the                                                            86  In accordance with Article 2 of the Decree on measures and procedures for the introduction and connectivity of advanced electricity metering systems (UL RS No 79/15), DSM is a system that acts on electricity consumption or production by grid users in such a way as to reduce the need to reinforce the grid on account of consumption or production by network users. 199 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Austrian TSO and then more widely (International Grid Control Cooperation, IGCC), thereby reducing the need for energy balancing to be activated in the system by more than 30%. When monitoring existing measures, there are no significant changes in the provision of system services. Flexibility and storage of electricity Recent decades were characterised by the construction of the first pumped hydro-electric power plant, which significantly increased the Slovenian electricity system. The large storage unit, which operated on the electricity market and was established on market principles, contributed to improving the speed and scope of system services and generally increasing the flexibility of operation of large coal-based plants. In terms of the overall costs (positive and negative) of operating within the EES, the facility operated in a neutral manner and was thus exempt from paying the network charge in consumer mode. Taking existing measures into account, we anticipate an increase in the share of large storage units in the Slovenian electricity system (EES) by 2030. The use of DSM has an increasingly important role to play. It is successfully used to provide system services, especially for the manual frequency restoration reserve product. If existing measures are pursued, DSM will be conserved up to 2030 as a successful provider. ii. Projected developments with existing policies and measures until at least 2040 (including 2030) and with additional NEPN policies and measures In the ambitious scenario, the electricity and heat production sector must become carbon-free by 2050. Achieving carbon-free electricity generation by 2050 will require major changes before 2030, with particular emphasis on speeding up development of the electricity distribution network. Some technologies that will enable transition to a climate-neutral society are still under development and some are already commercially available. The scenarios are designed separately with regard to: large electricity generation structures, dispersed electricity generation, and district heating and cooling systems. Large electricity generation structures are key to ensuring a secure electricity supply, as they cover the difference between production from dispersed sources and the production level necessary to ensure security of supply. The existing measures scenario is comparative in nature and provides for minimal additional investment in large installations. It envisages the completion of the hydro-electric power plant chain on the lower Sava River but does not envisage any other investments in renewables. It is also nuclear power plant will operate up to the end of its extended lifespan (in 2043) upon obtaining the appropriate environmental permit. At the  thermal power plant , unit B5 will cease to operate in 2035, while unit B6 will continue to operate until 2054. Energetika Ljubljana plans to set up a gas-steam unit [PPE] by 2022 to replace units B1 and B2 and, after 2035, will replace B3 with a biomass-fuelled fluidised bed combustion (FBC) unit. At the Brestanica thermal power plant [TEB], the older existing units are being upgraded and replaced. On account of additional increased electricity demand, there are plans to build one additional larger gas-steam unit [PPE] by 2030 and one more after 2040. It is assumed that consumption will be covered by production at the present - 2017 - level. The NEPN scenario, which is development-oriented, envisages increased production of electricity from hydro-electric power, as well as wind and solar power  classed as dispersed sources, in combination with energy storage unitsnuclear power plant will remain operational until 2043, subject to obtaining the appropriate environmental permit. 200 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   will operate up to 2030 at the latest, while B6 may be upgraded with CCS/CCU by 2035. It is envisaged that the use of domestic and imported coal for energy purposes will be phased out or reduced by at least 30% by 2030 and a decision on discontinuing the use of coal in Slovenia in accordance with the just transition principle is expected by 2021. The exact timetable for abandoning coal use in Slovenia will be determined by a strategy for abandoning coal use and restructuring of coal regions in accordance with the just transition principle which will be adopted by 2021 at the latest. At Energetika Ljubljana, gas-steam units [PPE] replace the older units B1 and B2 in 2022, while new biomass-fuelled fluidised bed combustion (FBC) unit replaces unit B3 by 2030. At the Brestanica thermal power plant [TEB], the existing older units are being replaced by new, more flexible units, which all serve as reserve power sources for the Slovenian electricity system [EES]. After 2030, the development of large electricity generation facilities can proceed in two alternative directions - one is the continued use of nuclear energy with the construction of a new unit, the other is the construction of larger gas-steam units [PPE] in combination with the use of natural or synthetic gas. It is expected that synthetic gas will also gradually be introduced in other power plants that use natural gas as their primary source. It is assumed that production will continue to cover consumption at the existing  2017 - level. Production is expected to increase in future from all dispersed sources. The increase envisaged is up to the capacity available in Slovenia, considering that, in the case of solar power plants, development is restricted to locations on buildings or degraded areas.

Consequently, the scenarios with additional measures envisage the expansion of district heating and cooling networks, connection to the electricity system and the significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from heat production, and the more demanding scenario anticipates complete decarbonisation.
