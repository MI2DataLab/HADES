The transport sector contributes to more than half of total consumption, followed by the services and residential sectors as the other predominant consumers of energy.

Malta has no public district heating and cooling network. This cooling demand is currently being addressed through efficient air-to-air heat pumps, which are widely used in both households and commercial buildings. These heat pumps are also being used in reverse mode for spatial heating purposes. In recent years, with the increase of high-end high-rise buildings, centralized solutions have become more widespread leading to more cost-effective heating and cooling. However, the main consumer of fuel-based spatial heating technologies is the hotel sector.  As an effort to incentivise the uptake of high efficient CHP units, in 2016 the government released a scheme whereby enterprises are eligible for aid through tax credits. To date, the uptake was nil, mainly due to spatial requirements for on-site fuel storage (mainly LPG) and applicable international standards.  The Comprehensive Assessment of the Maltese heating and cooling demand commissioned in 2015, titled An Energy Roadmap- Towards Achieving Decarbonization for the Maltese Islands  Analysis for a Cost-89 carried out in accordance with the provisions of Article 14(1) of the Energy Efficiency Directive  2012/27/EU, sought to identify the potential of technically and economically feasible applications of high efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling.  In view of the current installed stock of heating and cooling technologies, which is already very efficient, and the low share of heating demand, it is envisaged that the role of heating and cooling networks and CHP technology in the next decade is only marginal. This is further accentuated by the fact that Malta has practically no available indigenous resources of biomass or biogas, and currently there is no natural gas distribution network to render the fuel supply cheaper than the present options.  This is reflected in the conclusions of the study which shows that the final energy consumption for heating and cooling purposes is relatively low compared to what is needed to create favourable conditions for enhancing CHP and district heating. Despite the increase in final energy consumption for heating and cooling foreseen for 2020 and 2030 in the services and industry sectors, the final heating demand is likely to remain too low to make such technologies feasible. This is even more evident for micro-cogeneration that rely on a stronger demand.   Projections considering existing energy efficiency policies, measures and programmes for primary and final energy consumption for each sector at least until 2040 Figure 71 includes a projection for primary and final energy consumption under the WEM scenario, including heat pumps. continue to grow in the projected period under the WEM scenario.

The document is divided into two parts.  The first part of the document specifies the minimum energy performance requirements for buildings in Malta and the Overall Energy Performance Requirements for new Dwellings (Table 23) and the Overall Energy Performance Requirement for new non-Dwellings (Table 24), specifically for offices.  Part 2 of Technical Document F focuses on the minimum requirements for building services in Malta.  Table 23  Overall energy performance requirement for new dwellings, kWh/m² per annum.
