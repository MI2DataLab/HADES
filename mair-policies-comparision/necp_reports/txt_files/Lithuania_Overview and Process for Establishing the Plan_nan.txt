1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING THE PLAN SECTION A 7    1.1 Summary  Political context Lithuania has drawn up a National Energy and Climate Action Plan for the period 20212030 (hereinafter referred to as the National Plan) in accordance with the requirements set out in the Governance of the Energy Union Regulation1. The national plan has been prepared on the basis of and integrates the provisions, objectives, targets and measures implemented and planned in Lithuanian national legislation, international commitments, strategies and other planning documents. The main strategic documents integrated into the National Plan are the National Energy Independence Strategy (NEIS) adopted in June 20182 and the National Strategy for the Climate Change Management Policy3 adopted in 2012 and updated in 2019 as well as the National Air Pollution Reduction Plan adopted in April 20194. Some of the strategies are still being developed and some are in the early stages of development, therefore their intended content has been mirrored, where possible, with planned (unapproved) policies and measures (see Figure 1.1.1). The 2021-2030 National Progress Plan (NPP) (hereinafter 'NAP) has been developed in parallel to the preparation of the National Plan. The aim of the NPP is to identify the main developments in the country over the next decade that will ensure social, economic, environmental and security progress. Changes are planned taking into account the concept of the General Plan of the Republic of Lithuania and the fundamental values enshrined therein as well as the trends in the country's spatial development, the , the National Security Strategy, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other ) legislation, including an assessment of the current situation, recommendations from international organisations (the EU, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the International Monetary Fund), also emerging challenges and opportunities for national progress. National development programmes will be prepared to implement the changes foreseen in the NPP. In order to ensure coherence between the two strategic planning documents, the target values of the NPP assessment indicators are directly correlated with the objectives set out in the National Plan. The objectives and/or targets set out in the NAP relevant to the national plan are as follows:  To ensure good environmental quality and the sustainability of the use of natural resources, mitigate Lithuania's impact on climate change and increase its climate resilience;  To improve the competitiveness of the energy sector;  To integrate the Lithuanian natural gas market into the single EU gas market;  To connect the Lithuanian power system with the continental European power system for synchronous operation;  To ensure the adequacy of the Lithuanian electricity market and power system and increase the share of local electricity generation;                                                            1  Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of Energy Union and Climate Action. 2 https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/TAIS.429490/asr 3 https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/TAIS.437284 4 https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/410fbe3067f511e9917e8e4938a80ccb 1.

OVERVIEW AND PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING THE PLAN SECTION A 10   Energy context The NEIS has identified four priority areas: reducing the impact on climate change and ambient air pollution, progress. Those four areas correlate directly with the main dimensions of the National Plan identified in the Governance of the Energy Union Regulation: decarbonisation, energy efficiency, energy security, internal energy market and research, innovation and competitiveness. In line with the NEIS, Lithuania has set ambitious targets to make a significant contribution to the Energy Union and the implementation of the policy objectives of the EU energy and climate framework. Lithuania, together with Latvia and Estonia, will synchronise through Poland with a reliable and unified power system of continental Europe by 2025. By 2030, a 45% share of renewable energy in final energy consumption is expected to be achieved (one of the biggest ambitions for the development of RES in the EU), of which 45% in electricity and 90% in district heating will come from RES. Also, at least 30% of consumers will generate electricity for their own use. The share of domestic electricity production in Lithuania will increase from 35% to 70%, while the share of RES in transport will increase to 15% and Lithuania will become the leader in energy innovation in the region. The NEIS vision for 2050 is advanced energy, generating added-value for the State and the consumer, using low-GHG technologies and clean energy sources, resistant to cyber threats and climate change, and providing energy reliably at competitive prices. In pursuit of the goals set by the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement, the EU's 2030 climate and energy framework, Lithuania's energy sector by 2050 will produce 80% of its energy from clean sources (low GHG and ambient air emissions), supply consumers with energy safely and competitively and contribute to the development of the country's modern economy, its competitiveness and efforts to attract investment. The sources of energy production will consist of renewable energy sources and technologies that ensure the production of energy without polluting the environment. Consumers will be enabled to produce their own energy to meet their needs.   Environmental context In the last few decades, Lithuania has achieved remarkable progress in the area of environmental protection. Compared with 1990 figures, Lithuania has cut its GHG emissions more than by half, or 57%, which is the largest reduction in the EU-28, while6 in terms of per capita GHG emissions in 2017 Lithuania had the ninth lowest result in the European Union7. It should be noted that these results have been achieved despite the country's economic growth and that the positive downward trends are expected to continue. This creates good conditions for achieving a zero-GHG emission economy in the future. Lithuania is also among the leading European countries in terms of its share of GHG removals in its forests, behind only Sweden and Denmark in the Union8. In 2017, removals in forests accounted for 7.8 million tonnes of CO2 eq, which is 1/3 of the country's total GHG emissions.  Despite these strengths, Lithuania lags behind the EU countries in the area of tax policy. According to the EC, Lithuania's environmental taxes as a percentage of GDP are considerably lower (1.9% of GDP) than the EU average (2.4% of GDP in 2017). The largest part of the Lithuanian transport fleet consists of almost                                                            6 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Greenhouse_gas_emission_statistics#Trends_in_greenhouse_gas_emissions 7 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/t2020_rd300/default/bar?lang=en 8 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/EDN-20180321-1 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING THE PLAN SECTION A 11   1.5 million passenger cars, 69% of which are diesel cars, with an average age of 15 years and average CO2 emissions of 160-170 g/km. Transport charges are the lowest in the EU and do not take into account the environmental performance of vehicles. Motor vehicles are not taxed in Lithuania on the basis of CO2 emissions. Incentives for choosing lower CO2 emission cars are very limited and only started in 2019 in the form of compensations for the purchase of low-emission cars. Lithuanian excise duties on petrol, diesel and other motor fuels are among the lowest in the EU. As the common indirect energy tax rate is amongst the lowest in the EU, 9 the EC recommends introducing new environmentally oriented taxes and increasing existing ones.10   Social context The social context of the National Plan can be described as an indicator of energy poverty. In Lithuania, it reached 28% in 2018, which means that 28% of Lithuanian people believe that their homes are underheated, and despite this figure being highly subjective, Lithuania is one of the EU countries most affected by energy poverty. Accordingly, existing and planned measures relating to energy efficiency, financial support for vulnerable consumers, adequate energy pricing and consumer education and information will be used to address this problem. The social context of the national plan has been further assessed in terms of the impact on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP and jobs, which is described in detail in Section 5.2. The macro-economic assessment showed that the planned package of policies and measures presented in the National Plan would have a positive impact on the country's GDP, contribute to job growth and raise household incomes in all income groups.  Main targets set in the national plan The National Plan sets national and EU-level targets for Lithuania in order to contribute to the agreed general EU energy and climate change targets for 2030.

Obligations related to the development of local and renewable energy sources and energy efficiency improvement after 2020 will be based on the burden sharing principle, which ensures the respective contribution of each EU Member State in the pursuance of the objectives relating to renewable energy sources and energy efficiency improvement on the EU level by 2030.   Completion of the EU internal energy market. internal market, while taking advantage of the benefits it offers in respect to increased energy security, competitiveness, and sustainable development. A fully integrated and effectively functioning internal energy market of the EU is a priority objective of Lithuania.   Assurance of energy security in the Baltic region. The aim is to implement, as quickly and fully as possible, the provisions of the European Energy Security Strategy and to ensure that the results of the implementation of the measures of this Strategy are regularly reviewed at the EU level.   Adequate EU long-term financing programming policy. The aim will be to ensure the continuity of the financial instruments of the EU for energy infrastructure and decommissioning of the Ignalina NPP and adequate funding in order to alleviate the financial burden on Lithuanian consumers  1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING THE PLAN SECTION A 13    Strengthening the EU's external energy policy, coordinated action by EU Member States and solidarity in the event of crises also contribute to Lithuania's security and, therefore, efforts will be continued to intensify the EU dialogue with key energy suppliers, notably the US, Canada, Norway and Australia. Over the last ten years, the Lithuanian energy sector has undergone radical restructuring in order to reduce and ultimately fully eliminate its energy dependence on Russia, which has resulted in unreasonably high resource prices and the use of energy as a political lever. The implementation of the National Energy Independence Strategy (NEIS), structural reforms and strategic projects in the energy sector have increased the diversity of energy supply routes and sources and reduced the cost of energy resources to consumers. Taking into account these results and the new 2030 EU energy and climate targets as well as new trends in the energy sector, in June 2018 the Seimas approved an updated NEIS, which includes the main national energy policy objectives, directions and their implementation targets for 2030 and a vision for 2050. Under the renewed NEIS, the continuity of existing policies and orientations in the field of RES and energy efficiency will be maintained, Lithuania's attractiveness for investment will be improved, new technologies that are non-GHG and climate resilient to zero emissions will be implemented, innovation in the energy sector will be promoted and progress in the field of energy will be ensured. From a country importing energy technologies, Lithuania needs to become a country creating and exporting energy technologies.   RES The development of RES is carried out in accordance with EU and national strategy instruments and legislation. The main orientations and measures for the development of RES are laid down in the updated NEIS and the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on Energy from Renewable Sources, separately for each sector. In 2018, the share of RES in total final energy consumption was 24.21%, taking into account the statistical transfer of energy to Luxembourg. These results were mainly due to the share of RES in the heat sector, which amounted to 46.50%. The share of RES in electricity production was 18.41% and in transport 4.33%. Lithuania reached and exceeded the 2020 EU target of 23% as early as 2014, when RES accounted for 23.66% of gross final consumption of energy. Therefore, in October 2017 Lithuania transferred part of the generated surplus to Luxembourg and became the first EU Member State to sign a cooperation agreement on the transfer of statistical quotas for renewable energy sources. Lithuania plans to attain the target of 45% RES in final energy consumption by 2030. This will be achieved through the organisation of neutral auctions for the allocation of promotion quotas and the widespread deployment of small-scale renewable energy installations owned by private energy consumers and communities. Investment in smart energy systems, including transmission, distribution and storage infrastructure, and in increasing the required balancing capacity are envisaged to successfully integrate larger volumes of renewable energy and a large number of electricity generating customers.  Energy efficiency One of Lithuania's most important energy priorities is to increase energy efficiency throughout the energy chain, from energy production to energy consumption by final consumers. Energy efficiency improves the financial situation of the country's residents, increases the competitiveness of business, reduces emissions of GHG and ambient air pollutants, and improves ambient air quality. Efforts will be made to make energy efficiency an integral part of everyday activities for businesses and final consumers alike. The target is that 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING THE PLAN SECTION A 14   by 2030 Lithuania's energy intensity indicators reach the European Union average and are reduced 1.5 times compared to 2017. In order to achieve this target, it is planned to continue the renovation of inefficient residential and public buildings, to increase consumer education and to improve the energy performance of businesses. On the other hand, it is important to note the improvement in Lithuania's energy productivity indicator (overall energy efficiency indicator), which shows the country's energy efficiency and allows decoupling of energy consumption and the coamong the Baltic States, reaching EUR 4.8/kgoe (EU average energy productivity stood at EUR 8.3/kgoe).   Transport In the transport sector, fuel and energy consumption increased by 42.4% between 2010 and 2018, while diesel consumption increased by 11% between 2010 and 2018, accounting for 74% of fuel consumption in the transport sector. Road transport accounts for 90% of total fuel consumption in the transport sector. Diesel vehicles dominate public transport fleets and freight transport. The share of renewable energy sources (RES) in transport fell from 4.6% in 2015 to 3.7% in 2017 due to an increase in energy consumption in transport. The main part of the RES consists of biofuels and only a small part is electricity consumption in railways and trolleybuses. In order to increase the share of RES and alternative fuels in transport and the efficiency of the transport sector, incentives and obligations will be introduced, which will be laid down in the Law on Alternative Fuels and subordinate legislation. The plan is to reorient public transport fleets and encourage public entities to choose clean vehicles. The aim will be to develop the market for advanced biofuel, to electrify the railways and to prepare infrastructure for the electrification of light vehicles. The concept of biomethane gas use in the transport sector and its implementing measures are being developed. Additional efforts will be made to reduce the consumption of polluting fossil fuels through fiscal measures.   Competitiveness of the energy sector One of the most important challenges facing the energy sector is to increase the competitiveness of the country's economy and ensure the supply of energy and energy resources at competitive market prices, which would be one of the lowest in the region. In Lithuania, energy and energy resources account for a significant share of industrial costs and household budgets, while in industry the cost of energy in terms of product costs remains high and is 20% higher than the EU average11. Lower costs of energy resources and a positive import-export balance of energy resources and technologies would increase the competitiveness of the country's economy. Lithuania needs to reduce energy costs and increase the competitiveness of Lithuanian business, implement more efficient and modern technologies for energy production, supply and consumption, ensure optimal pricing of energy resources, promote liquidity in the energy trade market, improve conditions for energy supply and consumption as well as its reliability and availability. The functioning and long-term development of the energy sector must be based on the principles of sustainable development, while the objectives of the climate change policy must be achieved through the most effective means selected on the basis of cost-benefit analysis.   Climate change management policy area                                                            11 https://www.ena.lt/energijos-vartojimo-efektyvumas/ 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING THE PLAN SECTION A 15   The Lithuanian climate change management policy is formulated and implemented in accordance with international agreements: the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ("UNFCCC"), adopted in New York in 1992, which is implemented through country-specific commitments and GHG emission reduction mechanisms; the 1997 Kyoto Protocol establishing two commitment periods: the first commitment period of 2008-2012 and the second period of 2013-2020; the 2015 Paris Agreement12; the European Union legislation for the implementation of its climate change and energy targets for 2020 and 2030 ;and the EU's long-term climate change strategy papers defining the EU's vision for a climate-neutral economy by 205013. In order to ensure the implementation of the international agreements on climate change14 and the targets set in EU legislation for Lithuania, the Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania approved the National Strategy for the Climate Change Management Policy in 2012, which sets short-term objectives and targets for climate change mitigation and adaptation until 2020 and long-term indicative targets and objectives until 2050. Taking into account the results of the implementation of the National Strategy for the Climate Change Management Policy and Lithuania's new EU energy and climate change targets for 2030, and in implementing the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement and the EU vision of climate neutrality for 2050, the Strategy is being renewed and will enter into force from 2021.

OVERVIEW AND PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING THE PLAN SECTION A 16   implementation of the targets and objectives for 2013-2020 of the National Strategy for the Climate Change Management Policy, which defines measures for the reduction of GHG emissions and adaptation to climate change in all the sectors of the Lithuanian economy, including: industry, energy, agriculture, residential development, transport, health, waste management, etc. The measures for the implementation of the objectives and targets of the National Strategy for the Climate Change Management Policy 2021-2030 are included in the Integrated National Action Plan for Energy and Climate Action. For the implementation of the objectives and targets of the above Strategy, based on the interinstitutional operational plan and other cross-sectoral and sectoral development programs, EUR 2 billion will be invested from the EU structural and investment funds for 2014-2020 and the State budget, under the Climate Change Programme, in the implementation of measures related to climate change mitigation and around EUR 0.9 billion will be invested in the adaptation to climate change in all sectors of the Lithuanian economy in the period of 2014-2020. Sustainable growth of the Lithuanian economy has been ensured due to the growth of national GDP and reduction of GHG emissions (total GHG emissions from all sectors of economy decreased by 9.8% and the country's GDP increased by 36% between 2005 and 2017), as well as the fulfilment of Lithuania's GHG reduction targets established by international agreements and EU legislation. Since 1990, the structure of GHG emissions has changed as a result of the transformation of the country's economic activity (contraction of the industrial sector and development of the services sector, changes in the energy resources used, etc.) and the measures taken to reduce GHG emissions. 1.

Lithuanian GHG emissions by sector, %   Administrative structure of implementing national energy and climate policies Lithuania's energy policy is formulated and its implementation is coordinated by the Ministry of Energy. tigation and adaptation policy is coordinated by the Ministry of the Environment. In formulating the energy and climate policy, both ministries cooperate actively with the Ministries of Finance, Transport, Economy and Innovation, Education, Science and Sport, Agriculture, Health and the Interior, as well as with the relevant committees of the national parliament, municipalities, the Research Council of Lithuania, state research institutions and universities, companies, organisations and other persons. In addition, the National Climate Change Committee has been established for consultations on the development of the Lithuanian climate change policy and coordination of its implementation. The Committee includes 21 representatives of ministries, local authorities, research, industrial and non-governmental organizations, in addition to 20 observers. The Lithuanian Parliament (Seimas) approves framework national energy and climate strategies and the Government approves strategy implementation action plans as well as development programmes for all economy sectors. New plans are drawn up every five years or more often if there is a need at national level. Each year, ministries and institutions in their system draw up strategic plans containing measures with 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING THE PLAN SECTION A 18   appropriations for a period of three years. Funds for the projects and measure implementation are allocated yearly from national and local budgets. EU funds, such as the EU Structural and Investment Funds and other targeted funding instruments (such as the Connecting Europe Facility), as well as funds from the National Climate Change Programme account for a significant share of energy and climate investment. It should be noted that revenues from the statistical transfer of RES to Luxembourg will also be invested in renewable energy-related research and renewable energy development in Lithuania. Investment from the Modernisation and Innovation Funds is also expected to make a significant contribution to the achievement of future energy and climate objectives.    1.3  Consultations, involvement of national and Union entities, and the outcome of consultations  The national plan has been drawn up with the involvement of the national parliament, in close consultation with the socio-economic partners, associations and the public. During the preparation of the plan, its draft was presented at various energy conferences in Lithuania and abroad, in regional councils, and discussed with EU Member States in regional and bilateral formats.

It should be noted that on 21 June 2018 The Seimas approved the renewed National Energy Independence Strategy, which was the basis for the preparation of the National Plan. In addition, a renewed National Strategy for the Climate Change Management Policy is planned for early 2020. In preparing the draft National Plan, the Seimas also carried out regular parliamentary control:   on 28 November 2018, the draft National Plan was presented to the Seimas European Affairs Committee;   on 22 May 2019, the status of the preparation of the National Plan and the current situation as well as subsequent updating plans were introduced to the Seimas Energy and Sustainable Development Commission;   on 10 July 2019, the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee discussed the European  recommendations on the draft National Plan submitted to the European Commission in December 2018;   on 20 November 2019, information on the draft National Plan and progress in drafting it was presented to the Seimas Environment Protection Committee, the Energy and Sustainable Development Commission and the European Affairs Committee.  Involvement of local and regional authorities (municipalities) Involvement of local and regional authorities is essential for the preparation and implementation of the National Plan. Municipalities make an important contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the establishment of sustainable urban mobility plans, their participation in the implementation of the Covenant of Mayors, and their contribution to achieving the RES targets set out in the specific plans for district heating. Therefore, a representative of the Association of Lithuanian Municipalities, 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING THE PLAN SECTION A 20   representing 60 Lithuanian municipalities and districts, was included in the interinstitutional working group for the preparation of the National Plan. On 22 January 2019, members of the Lithuanian Association of Municipalities, i.e. mayors of cities and districts, were presented with the strategic national orientations in the development of the energy sectors, and municipalities were invited to actively contribute to their implementation. Between September and October 2019, the draft National Plan was presented to 7 of the 10 Lithuanian Regional Development Councils (Alytus, Kaduring the public consultation.   Consultation with stakeholders and the public Two public consultations with stakeholders and the public were organised in the course of the preparation of the Lithuanian Integrated National Action Plan on Energy and Climate. The first public consultation was conducted in Lithuanian and English from December 2018 to May 2019 over the dedicated national consultation platform E.citizen15. The updated draft plan was presented to the National Climate Change Committee on 16 June 2019. The second phase of consultation took place in November 2019 through an online public consultation platform16 and a series of Climate Change Week events (2229 November). At these events, social partners and social organisations in each sector were able to discuss issues regarding the National Plan. Over 30 organisations and individuals responded to the public consultation. Following extensive and intensive discussions with the public and stakeholders, the National Plan was complemented by alternative policy measures, which are presented in Chapter 3 for each sector as a separate set of measures. Alternative policy measures have not been taken into account in the calculations in Part B, but will be considered as an alternative to the elements of the PPM scenario prior to their adoption in legislation in order to achieve the national energy and climate policy objectives with the most efficient set of measures.  Consultation with other Member States Other EU Member States were closely consulted in the preparation of parts of the National Plan dealing with transboundary impacts or requiring regional solutions. This was done in particular through existing regional and bilateral cooperation formats: regular meetings of representatives of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in the Committee of Senior Energy Officials of the Baltic Council of Ministers, plenary meetings of the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan Group, described in more detail in section 1.4. The draft National Plan was also presented at the Nordic-Baltic Energy Conference in Tallinn on 27-28 September 201817 and 24-25 October 2019 18 and the presentation of the German National Plan in Berlin on 9-10 April 2019 was attended. Progress in the preparation of national plans was discussed at several meetings of the Committee of Senior Energy Officials of the Baltic Council of Ministers held on 31 January 2018, 9 April 2018, 30 October 2018, 18 April 2019, 29 August 2019 and 6 November 2019, also at the meetings of the Baltic Council of Ministers' Environment Ministers held on 23-24 May 2018 and 30-31 October 2019.                                                            15 https://epilietis.lrv.lt/lt/konsultacijos/viesoji-konsultacija-del-integruoto-nacionalinio-energetikos-ir-klimato-plano 16 http://epilietis.lrv.lt/lt/consultations/view_item/id.163 17 Nordic- 27-28 September 2018, Tallinn. 18 Good governance, policy design and solutions towards 2030, 2425 October 2019, Tallinn 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING THE PLAN SECTION A 21    Recommendation from the European Commission On 18 June 2019, the European Commission published recommendations on19 the draft Lithuanian National Plan submitted to the Commission in December 2018. These recommendations were further discussed with representatives of the European Commission at a meeting on 22 June 2019. The European Commission has recommended that Lithuania should:  draw attention to the lack of measures to ensure a 9% reduction in GHG emission from sectors not covered by the EU ETS;  specify the measures needed to achieve the ambitious 2030 RES target and the measures to achieve the 15% RES target in the transport sector;  increase reductions in final and primary energy consumption in 2030;  submit plans for the phasing out of fossil fuels;  provide in the National Plan an analysis of the interaction with air quality and air pollution policies, showing the impact of different scenarios on air pollution;  reduce the level of energy poverty. Other recommendations relate to the increased completeness of parts of the National Plan (detailed measures to contribute to energy security, liberalisation of electricity prices), the need for investment, future forecasts, and performance of macroeconomic and social impact assessments. In the European Semester cycle, the European Commission also assessed Lithuania's energy and climate trends. The 27 February 2019 European Commission's report on Lithuania20 notes that Lithuania has made substantial progress in improving the security of energy supply, as well as achieving the overall RES and GHG emission targets for the current year. However, reiterating the recommendations for the National Plan, it noted that more effort were needed to meet the energy efficiency target and to increase the share of RES in the transport sector. The European Commission has therefore recommended (among other things) that Lithuania focus on innovation, energy and resource efficiency, sustainable transport and energy interconnections in 2019 and 2020.21 The recommendations made by the European Commission were considered in detail by the Lithuanian authorities and taken into account in the final draft of the National Plan. The National Plan has been updated by adding measures to ensure GHG reductions in non-ETS sectors; energy consumption projections for 2030 have been reduced; measures to achieve the ambitious RES target in 2030 have been specified, including the RES target in the transport sector; plans for phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, reducing energy poverty have been identified, etc. Additionally, the 2021-2027 Operational Programme for investment from European Union Funds, currently being drafted, is directly linked to the implementation of the Commission's recommendations by lementation of the following tasks, for example:  promotion of energy efficiency measures;  promotion of renewable energy;  developing smart energy systems and grids, as well as local energy storage solutions;                                                            19 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/governance-energy-union/national-energy-climate- plans 20 https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/2019-european-semester-country-reports_en 21 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1560258494533&uri=CELEX%3A52019DC0515 1.

The main forms of regional cooperation within which the content of the National Plan has been regularly coordinated are two: the Working Party of the Baltic Energy Market    BEMIP Lithuania is actively participating in the implementation of the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan. Its main objective is to create a properly functioning and integrated energy market and the necessary energy infrastructure, as well as to achieve a competitive, sustainable and secure energy market in the Baltic Sea region. Currently, a priority project at EU level  the connection of the Baltic States' electricity system to the continental European network for synchronous operation (synchronisation project) - is being addressed in substance. The issues relating to the development of the regional gas market in the Baltic States and Finland are being coordinated within the Regional Gas Market Coordination Group set up under the BEMIP initiative in 2015, composed of representatives of the Finnish, Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian ministries, national regulatory authorities, transmission system operators, LNG terminal operators and distribution system operators. Specific plenary meetings (expert level) of the BEMIP High Level Group took place on 15 April and 16 September 2019 to discuss regional cooperation aspects identified in the National Energy and Climate Change Plans of EU Member States.   Baltic Council of Ministers The synchronisation project, the project for gas pipeline interconnection between Poland and Lithuania (GIPL), electricity imports from third countries and other relevant issues are regularly discussed and coordinated with regional partners (Latvia, Estonia and Poland) in the Committee of Senior Energy Officials of the Baltic Council of Ministers and bilateral consultations between representatives of Lithuanian and Polish energy ministries, as well as in close cooperation with the European Commission. Progress in the preparation of national plans was discussed at several meetings of the Committee of Senior Energy Officials of the Baltic Council of Ministers on 31 January 2018, 9 April 2018, 30 October 2018, 18 April 2019, 29 August 2019 and 6 November 2019, also at the 23-24 May 2018 and 30-31 October 2019 meetings of Environment Ministers of the Baltic Council of Ministers. At these meetings, the Baltic States agreed that 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING THE PLAN SECTION A 23   the sharing of information on the National Plans is an important part of the successful preparation and implementation of the plans and therefore close cooperation in the preparation and implementation of the National Plans will continue. All these elements of regional cooperation are included in the National Plan and are mentioned in more detail in the relevant Chapters 2 and 3.
