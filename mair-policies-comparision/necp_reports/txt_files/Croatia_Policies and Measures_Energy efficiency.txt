3.2 Dimension energy efficiency  The expected impact of a group of measures to promote energy efficiency and transport is equivalent to a reduction in immediate energy consumption in projections for the scenario with additional measures compared to the scenario with existing measures, which amounts to 10.76 PJ in 2030. Planned policies, measures and programmes for the achievement of the national target of increase in energy efficiency by 2030, as well as the other targets set out in Section 2.2, including planned measures and instruments (as well as that of financial nature) for the promotion of energy performance of buildings, are listed below, according to specific areas.  i. The energy efficiency obligation and alternative measures system referred to in Articles 7a and 7b of Directive 2018/2002 on the amendments to Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency ENU-1: Energy efficiency obligation scheme for suppliers Regulatory measure; implementation: 2019  2030  Objective and description of the measure: The Energy Efficiency Obligation System was established by the Energy Efficiency Act (OG 127/14, 116/18), and its functioning is further defined by the Ordinance on the Energy Efficiency Obligation System (OG 41/19). Obligated entities of the energy efficiency obligation system are supplied by energy suppliers. The system has been operational since 2019, when it was entered by suppliers that have delivered more than 300 GWh of energy to the market during 2017. In 2020, the suppliers who delivered more than 100 GWh of energy to the market in 2018 enter the system of obligations, and from 2021 onwards all those suppliers who supplied more than 50 GWh of energy to the market during the previous year. The objective is to achieve 50% savings under Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive through the energy efficiency obligation scheme. It was assumed that savings would be achieved in each year in the amount of 0.5 PJ (11.7 ktoe) per annum. Activities: The following activities will be implemented within the measure:   The MCPP determines the exact annual amount of energy savings obligation in kWh for the following year for each obligated party until 30th of June of the current year, allocating to all obligated parties a part of the national framework energy savings goals for the next year realized through the obligation system as well as the cumulative energy savings goal until the end of the current cumulation period;  Suppliers can fulfil their obligation in one of the following three key ways: investing in and stimulating energy efficiency improvements in immediate consumption; by buying savings from another obligated party or by paying contributions to the 134  Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund.  Suppliers are not prescribed neither eligible investment sectors nor eligible investment measures, while the savings from such investments can be demonstrated by methods from the Ordinance on the system for monitoring, measurement and verification of energy savings. Investments should not relate to activities previously covered by alternative measures.;   It is necessary to amend and regularly improve the Ordinance on the system for monitoring, measurement and verification of energy savings, in order to extend its scope to most measures implemented by suppliers;   In the light of past experience and the provisions of Directive 2018/2002 on energy efficiency, legislative changes should also be considered in order to improve the functioning of the system, especially in the area of savings trading;   Revenues from fees collected on the basis of the obligation system shall be used by the Fund purposefully. That is why it is necessary to create a Schedule for the use of funds collected from the obligation system fees, the application of which must start from 2021. Creating such a Schedule is absolutely necessary to ensure the optimal allocation of funds from all available sources and to ensure that the Fund has clear guidelines on how to invest these resources. In view of the alternative measures provided in this Plan, it is necessary to direct these funds to the building sector, in particular to public buildings of the central government and the family home.   Funds needed for implementation: Not estimated  Funding Sources: Energy Efficiency Obligation Scheme payer funds  Executive body: Obligated entities of the Energy Efficiency Obligation System (Suppliers)  Monitoring Bodies: Ministry of Environment and Energy - National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency  Effect: Reduction of final energy consumption and consequent reduction of CO2 emissions: estimated savings in 2030. 5.00 PJ (117.0 ktoe); estimated CO2 emission reductions in 2030. 137.62 ktCO2e; cumulative energy savings in 2021-2030 27.0 PJ (644.9 ktoe); cumulative CO2 emission reductions in the period 2021-2030 769.16 ktCO2e  Monitoring method: The realized savings are monitored and proven by using bottom-up methods according to the Ordinance on the system for monitoring, measurement and verification of energy savings  Connection to other dimensions: given that the obligation is placed on the market energy activity of energy supply, there is a direct link to the dimension of the internal energy market  Connection to climate change adaptation: /  Research and development: /   The Republic of Croatia also envisages the implementation of alternative measures, including measures described as follows: ENU-3, ENU-4, ENU-5, ENU-7 i ENU-8. In addition, alternative measures include the following measures in transport: TR-6: Financial incentives for energy efficient vehicles, TR-10: Promoting integrated and intelligent transport and development of alternative fuel infrastructure at the local and regional level and TR-11: Training for drivers of road vehicles for eco-driving, as well as the implementation of the Programme for the Elimination of Energy Poverty (UET-4).  ii. Long-term strategy for the renovation of the national stock of residential 135  and non-residential buildings, both public and private  Key to this area is the Long-Term Strategy for Mobilising Investment in the Renovation of the National Building Stock of the Republic of Croatia by 2050. To achieve the strategic goals of reducing energy consumption in construction of buildings, three key energy renovation programmes for the period between 2021 and 2030 are expected to be adopted for apartment buildings, family houses and public buildings, and the guidelines for the preparation of these programmes are provided below. A new programme for commercial buildings that would be based on co-financing will not be adopted, but it is expected that this segment of the building stock will be covered by the activities of the supplier within the energy efficiency obligation system as well as the energy services market. In addition to these programmes based on financial incentives, the implementation of a comprehensive programme for the promotion of nZEB standards for construction and renovation is planned, which is also outlined below.  ENU-2: Promoting nearly-zero energy standard in buildings construction and refurbishment Information measure; implementation 2019 -2030 Objective and description of the measure: After 31st December 2018, all public buildings in the Republic of Croatia used or owned by public authorities shall be constructed according to the nZEB standard, and the obligation for all other newly built buildings shall enter into force after 31st December 2020. These statutory provisions ensure that all newly built buildings from 2021 onwards comply with the nZEB standard. However, in order to ensure the correct implementation of these provisions, and also to encourage energy renovation of buildings in line with the nZEB standard, a number of informational and educational activities for the promotion of construction and renovation according to the nZEB standard are planned in the next period.  Activities: The following activities will be implemented within the measure:   Open partner dialogue - workshops that will bring together stakeholders from state administration bodies, local authorities, the construction sector, the energy sector and educational and other public institutions, to develop through joint dialogue an adequate national definition of a building with nearly zero energy consumption and a roadmap for the transformation of the existing building stock into an energy-efficient and decarbonized building stock by 2050;  Creating guidelines for nZEB buildings for investors and design engineers - the guidelines will provide expert, coherent and clear information on nZEB buildings, with two target groups: general public and experts in the field;  Media campaigns for energy certification and promotion of nZEB standards - campaigns will provide information to the general public to raise awareness of the significance of energy certificates and their relevance for energy renovation and demonstration of nZEB standards, availability of information in the Information system of energy certificates (IEC), and also a targeted campaign for informing and raising awareness of the nZEB standard for new construction and energy renovation of buildings will be carried out.  136  Funds needed for implementation: The MCPP plans to finance the implementation of these activities within its annual budgets as an integral part of its regular activities.  Funding Sources: State Budget (MCPP)  Executive body: MCPP - implementation of all Programme activities  Monitoring Bodies: Ministry of Environment and Energy - National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency  Effect: The measure has no direct effect on reducing energy consumption, but rather supports the regulatory measure for the construction of new buildings according to the nZEB standard, as well as a promotion measure for energy renovation up to the nZEB standard, which will result in measurable reduction of energy consumption, greater use of RES and avoided CO2 emissions.  Tracking method: Reports on information and educational activities carried out  Connection to other dimensions: Direct connection to decarbonisation, as the nZEB standard implies with reduced energy consumption and increased use of RES in buildings  Climate change adaptation: energy renovation makes buildings more resilient to some of the effects of climate change, such as extreme temperature conditions  Research and development: NZEB standard creates the need to develop new building materials, improve technical systems in buildings, and control and automation systems based on information and communication technologies   ENU-3: Energy renovation programme for multi-apartment buildings Financial measure; implementation 2021 - -2030 Objective and description of the measure: The programme should be conceptualized as a continuation of the implementation of the Energy renovation programme for apartment buildings for the period from 2014 to 2020. For this purpose, funds from ESI funds should be planned for the next programming period 2021-2027 (with implementation until 2030), and implementing procedures need to be significantly facilitated, especially in the area of implementation of public procurement. Deep renovation of buildings should be encouraged. The renovation up to the nZEB standard should be further encouraged. In addition, it is necessary to consider the establishment of a special fund from which the costs will be reimbursed to energy poor households or households at risk of energy poverty, in order to remove the obstacle to securing a sufficient number of co-owners' consents for energy renovation. The implementation of the Programme must be accompanied by strong promotional activities, assured technical assistance to applicants, and it is necessary to ensure that energy consumption is monitored before and after energy renovation, which requires the creation of prerequisites under ISEM. It is expected to be renewed at about 520,000 m2 apartment buildings annually. Savings were calculated assuming the energy renovation of buildings to the level of meeting the requirements of the Technical regulation on rational use of energy and thermal protection in buildings, according to the periods of construction of buildings. Annual savings amount to 0.148 PJ. The estimated cost of energy renewal is 1,500 HRK / m2  Note: the objectives, conditions and activities and the stated numerical values are indicative and will be specified in detail in the Energy Renovation programme for apartment buildings for the period 2021 to 2030. 137   Activities: The following activities will be implemented within the measure:   In 2020, the MCPP will develop an energy renovation programme for multifamily buildings for the period 2021 to 2030, adopted by the Government, which is the basis for the use of ESI funds in the 2021 to 2027 programming period.  Implementation in the manner established by the Programme   Funds needed for implementation: Estimated investment cost in the period 2021-2030 is HRK 7.80 billion. Funding Sources: Grants from the ESI Funds should be provided up to 60% of eligible costs, with maximum co-financing of energy audits, energy certificates, project documentation and technical assistance in project preparation and implementation. Consideration should be given to using national funds and other sources of funding. Executive body: MCPP- Level 1 Intermediate Body (PT1) in the ESI Fund Management and Control System; MCPP - operational monitoring of programme implementation; EPEEF - Level 2 Intermediate Body (PT2) in the Management and Control System for the use of ESI Funds  Monitoring Bodies: Ministry of Environment and Energy - National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency  Effect: Reducing heat demand and energy consumption in apartment buildings and increasing RES usage and consequently reducing CO2 emissions; estimated savings in 2030 1.48 PJ (35.40 ktoe); estimated CO2 emission reductions in 2030 40.74 ktCO2e; cumulative energy savings in 2021-2030 8.15 PJ (194.70 ktoe); cumulative CO2 emission reductions in the period 2021-2030. 232.17 ktCO2e  Tracking method: Energy Saving Monitoring, Measurement and Verification System using the bottom-up method for integral building renovation  Connection to other dimensions: direct connection to the decarbonisation dimension, as energy renovation use encourages the use of RES in buildings  Climate change adaptation: energy renovation makes buildings more resilient to some of the effects of climate change, such as extreme temperature conditions  Research and development: energy renovation, especially its focus on the nZEB standard, is an incentive for research and development in the field of new building materials, advanced technical systems in buildings, and information and communication based management and automation systems   ENU-4: Energy renovation programme for single family houses Financial measure; implementation 2021 - -2030 Objective and description of the measure: The programme needs to be conceptualized as a continuation of the implementation of the Energy Efficiency Programme for single-family homes from 2014 to 2020, with co-financing from the Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund. It is necessary to ensure the continued implementation of the renovation of family homes by renewing public calls for grants every year for the period 2021-2030. The primary sources of co-financing should be revenues from the auctioning of greenhouse gas emission units and revenues from the fees paid by suppliers in the energy efficiency obligation system in the event of default of obligations. The Programme should allow for the possibility of implementing individual measures, but taking into account the order of measures (e.g. replacing the heating system by a more efficient systems that uses RES should only be 138  possible for those houses that have good thermal characteristics and do not require any interventions on the building envelope). The renovation up to the nZEB standard should be further encouraged. The implementation of the Programme must be accompanied by strong promotional activities. It is expected to be renewed around 350,000 m2 family homes annually. Savings were calculated assuming the energy renovation of buildings to the level of meeting the requirements of the Technical regulation on rational use of energy and thermal protection in buildings, according to the periods of construction of buildings. Annual savings amount to 0.191 PJ. The estimated cost of energy renewal is 1,500 HRK / m2 Note: the objectives, conditions and activities and the stated numerical values are indicative and will be specified in detail in the Energy Renovation programme for family homes for the period 2021 to 2030.  Activities: The following activities will be implemented within the measure:   In 2020, the MCPP will develop an Energy renovation programme for family homes for the period 2021 to 2030, approved by the Government;  In 2020, the Government shall adopt a new Plan for the use of funds obtained from the sale of emission units through auctions in the Republic of Croatia for the period from 2021, which shall provide sufficient funds for the implementation of this measure, as well as the Plan for the use of funds from the fee paid by suppliers in the system of energy efficiency obligation;  The EPEEF is responsible for the full implementation of this measure by announcing annual public calls, the criteria of which it develops in cooperation with the MCPP.   Funds needed for implementation: Estimated investment cost in the period 2021-2030 is HRK 5.25 billion. Funding Sources: A grant from the EPEEF of up to 60% of the eligible costs of equipment and energy renovation work must be provided. EPEEF provides funds from the proceeds from the sale of emission units through auctions and revenues from the energy efficiency obligation system as well as from other sources of income from the EPEEF. Executive body: MCPP - development of the Programme, defining criteria, operational monitoring of the implementation of the Programme; EPEEF - overall implementation of the Programme through annual public calls  Monitoring Bodies: Ministry of Environment and Energy - National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency  Effect: Reducing heat demand and energy consumption in apartment buildings and increasing RES usage and consequently reducing CO2 emissions; estimated savings in 2030 1.91 PJ (45.60 ktoe); estimated CO2 emission reductions in 2030 52.57 ktCO2e; cumulative energy savings in 2021-2030 10.50 PJ (250.80 ktoe); cumulative CO2 emission reductions in the period 2021-2030 299.12 ktCO2e  Tracking method: Energy Saving Monitoring, Measurement and Verification (SMiV) system using the bottom-up method for integral building renovation or other appropriate method, if individual measures are implemented  Connection to other dimensions: direct connection to the decarbonisation dimension, as energy renovation use encourages the use of RES in buildings  Connection to climate change adaptation: energy renovation makes buildings more resilient to some of the effects of climate change, such as extreme temperature conditions  Research and development: energy renovation, especially its focus on the nZEB standard, is an incentive for research and development in the field of new building materials, advanced 139  technical systems in buildings, and information and communication based management and automation systems  ENU-5: Energy renovation programme for public sector buildings  Financial measure; implementation 2021 - -2030 Objective and description of the measure: The measure is a continuation of the implementation of the Public Sector Buildings Renovation Programme 2016-2020. For this purpose, funds from ESI funds should be planned for the next programming period 2021- 2027 (with implementation until 2030). Funding needs to be planned to ensure the activation of private capital and ESCO markets, especially for buildings that are suitable for such financing models (continuous operation buildings such as hospitals, penitentiary homes, senior citizens' homes, etc.) and belong to the category of central government buildings, for which the Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU stipulates the renovation obligation. Market models need to be combined with grants with the aim of meeting the nZEB standard. In addition to ESI funds, the EPEEF is also required to plan funds for this Programme in the part related to the co-financing of energy renovation of central government buildings under the ESCO model. For buildings that are not suitable for market models, it is necessary to provide grants under the same conditions as in the current programme. The renovation of the public sector building must be directed to the nZEB standard wherever technically feasible. It is expected to be renovate around 350,000 m2 of public buildings annually. Savings were calculated assuming the energy renovation of buildings to the level of meeting the requirements of the Technical regulation on rational use of energy and thermal protection in buildings, according to the periods of construction of buildings. Annual savings amount to 0.169 PJ. The estimated cost of energy renewal is 2,500 HRK / m2 Note: the objectives, conditions and activities and the stated numerical values are indicative and will be specified in detail in the Energy Renovation programme for public sector buildings for the period 2021 to 2030. Activities: The following activities will be implemented within the measure:   During 2020, the MCPP will develop a Public Sector Buildings Energy Renovation Programme for the period 2021 to 2030, adopted by the Government, which is the basis for the use of ESI funds in the 2021-2027 programming period, as well as the basis for planning for the funds of the EPEEF;  Implementation in the manner established by the Programme   For energy renovation of central government buildings and other public sector buildings, the Energy Service Model (ESCO), implemented by ATMIP, will be applied where feasible, with co-financing provided by EPEEF and other sources including ESI funds - this segment of the Programme is necessary in order to mobilize private capital, develop the energy services market and achieve the objectives without additional public sector borrowing.  Funds needed for implementation: Estimated investment cost in the period 2021-2030 is HRK 8.75 billion. 140  Funding Sources: Grants from ESI Funds as in the previous Climate zone dependence programme (Coastal or Continental) and the Development Index should be provided, with maximum co-financing of energy audits, energy certificates, project documentation and technical assistance in project preparation and implementation. EPEEF provides funds for the ESCO model from the proceeds from the sale of emission units through auctions and revenues from the energy efficiency obligation system as well as from other sources of income from the EPEEF. Executive body: MCPP - Level 1 Intermediate Body (PT1) in the ESI Fund Management and Control System; MCPP - operational monitoring of programme implementation; EPEEF - Level 2 Intermediate Body (PT2) in the management and control system for the use of ESI funds / co-financing projects from own resources; ATMIP - implementation according to the energy service contracting model  Monitoring Bodies: Ministry of Environment and Energy - National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency  Effect: Reducing heat demand and energy consumption in public sector buildings and increasing RES usage and consequently reducing CO2 emissions; estimated savings in 2030 1.69 PJ (40.40 ktoe); estimated CO2 emission reductions in 2030 46.52 ktCO2e; cumulative energy savings in 2021-2030 9.30 PJ (222.20 ktoe); cumulative CO2 emission reductions in the period 2021-2030 264.93 ktCO2e  Tracking method: Energy Saving Monitoring, Measurement and Verification System using the bottom-up method for integral building renovation  Connection to other dimensions: direct connection to the decarbonisation dimension, as energy renovation use encourages the use of RES in buildings  Climate change adaptation: energy renovation makes buildings more resilient to some of the effects of climate change, such as extreme temperature conditions  Research and development: energy renovation, especially its focus on the nZEB standard, is an incentive for research and development in the field of new building materials, advanced technical systems in buildings, and information and communication based management and automation systems   ENU-6: Energy renovation program for heritage buildings Financial measure; implementation 2021 - -2030 Objective and description of the measure: Protected buildings within the meaning of this Programme are those which can be classified into two categories: Individually protected cultural property (individual buildings and building complexes) and Buildings within a protected cultural and historical entity. The programme does not cover buildings protected as a preventively-protected cultural property, nor buildings protected as a registered cultural property. The Programme has developed two basic approaches to the energy renovation of buildings that are the subject of this Programme: a holistic (integral) approach and an approach with the application of individual energy renovation measures. In accordance with the draft programme, the following needs were given:  Total investment (HRK): 13.674 billion  Maintenance cost (HRK): 5.066 billion  Average annual renewal rate (%): 3.5 141   Total renovated area (m2): 8,975,943  Energy Savings (GWh): 5,073,234.38  Financial Savings (HRK): 1.393 billion  CO2 emission reduction (kt): 709.02 The total needs for the implementation of energy renovation programmes for buildings that have the status of cultural property and for the purpose of achieving national goals amount to HRK 18.74 billion in the period from 2021 to 2030. This amount includes required investments of HRK 13.67 billion and maintenance costs of HRK 5.07 billion. Given the very high investment return periods, it will be necessary to make the most of the programme's co-financing with grants to reduce simple investment return periods and to encourage the energy renovation of such buildings. EU Funds and funds raised through monument annuities are recognized as sources of funding for grants. Considering the total investment needs, the total required investments amount to approximately HRK 1.37 billion annually over the period 2021 to 2030, of which the required co-financing would amount to HRK 1.02 billion. Given that around HRK 100 million is collected annually from the monumental annuity, the remaining amount of about HRK 920 million annually needs to be secured from EU Funds. In order to encourage the energy renovation of buildings that have the status of cultural property, it is necessary to co-finance the same with grants, with a considerable share of the same in the total investment.  iii. Description of policies and measures to encourage energy services in the public sector and measures to remove regulatory and non-regulatory barriers that prevent the introduction of energy efficiency contracts and other models of energy efficiency services  According to Article 25 of the Energy Efficiency Act (OG 127/14) defines the energy service as a framework for the implementation of energy efficiency projects and other related activities, based on an energy performance contract with a guarantee that under benchmark conditions it leads to a verifiable and measurable or assessable improvement of energy efficiency and/or energy and/or water savings. According to the Act on Amendments to the Energy Efficiency Act (OG 116/18) the definition is being extended to include cases where an energy service provider provides energy management expertise without direct investment and the possibility of reducing energy-related costs without reducing energy consumption is included. The content of the energy performance contract is, according to the Act on Amendments to the Energy Efficiency Act, defined only for public buildings, and in the private sector access to this issue is being liberalized, so a positive impact on the market can be expected. The Ordinance on the system for monitoring, measurement and verification of energy savings (OG 71/15) needs to be fully revised, as the final proposal of the Act on Amendments to the Energy Efficiency Act stipulates a detailed elaboration of the method of verification of savings defined in the said Ordinance. Key objections are outdated reference data used to calculate savings (especially for technologies that achieved a significant technological progress over the past period), limited number of processed measures and, most importantly, lack of methods or reference to methods of verification of savings according to actual measurements. 142  The Act on Amendments to the Energy Efficiency Act corrects most of the observed shortcomings, such as value added tax, inclusion of professional services without investment or reducing only energy-related costs. Legislation and the implementation policy so far provide incentives for implementing energy efficiency measures through financial instruments, especially through energy services. It is also necessary to secure the inclusion of financial resources from the European structural and investment funds with a combination of energy service or public-private partnership. It is also necessary to further align secondary legislation (ordinances) and prepare publicly available documentation that will explain in more detail the complex issue of energy performance contracts such as the energy service contracting model, details of contracting and securing supply of energy products and energy performance, budget and legal issues, workflows of projects, identification of projects and various technical specifications related to the intensity of consumption of specific public buildings, examples from practice and a sample contract with all elements.  iv. Other planned policies, measures and programmes for achieving the indicative national target of increase in energy efficiency for 2030, as well as other objectives under section 2.2. (for example, measures aimed at promoting public buildings and energy-efficient public procurement as desirable models, measures to promote energy audits and energy management systems, providing information to consumers and training measures, and other measures to promote energy efficiency) Measures in the public sector The public sector is expected to continue implementing the existing measures and expanding their scope.  ENU-7: Energy management system in the public sector Information measure; implementation 2014 -2030  Objective and description of the measure: The public sector in Croatia is obliged to systematically manage energy, which is specifically stipulated by the Energy Efficiency Act, and the Ordinance on Systematic Energy Management (Official Gazette 18/15, 06/16). The measure is based on the information system for energy management (ISEM). The goal is to cover and regularly monitor all public sector buildings and public lighting systems by the end of 2030 using the ISEM. Savings based on systematic energy management activities and the introduction of telemetry in the previous period have been set at around 335 TJ per year (according to 4th NEEAP. Given that this measure has been systematically worked upon since 2014, the assumed potential for savings has been reduced to 100 TJ per year due to conservative estimates. Activities: The following activities will be implemented within the measure:   Automation of energy generating product and water consumption data collection (remote reading), integration of ISEM with energy generating products and water 143  supplier systems, education of energy experts and advisers responsible for energy management in their buildings, and further development and improvement of ISEM will be implemented by 2021. Emphasis will be placed on developing modules for monitoring and verifying the energy savings achieved as a result of renovation, as well as fulfilling the default regime of use of the building for the purpose of achieving and maintaining the level of comfort. The goals are: to remotely read all locations in the public sector whose energy and water consumption exceeds HRK 400,000.00/year by 2020, to connect supplier databases with the ISEM database for automatic data collection and to connect ISEM with all relevant energy databases. In addition, by 2021, plans are being implemented for measures that include: potential analysis and optimization of peak electricity contracting, reduction of excess reactive energy, and potential analysis and optimization of thermal power contracting.   In the period from 2021 to 2030, it is planned to introduce the energy management system and apply ISEM in all public sector buildings, and to improve and expand the whole system through the following activities: 1. Bring together all installed remote reading systems in the ISEM; 2. Integrate ISEM with other bases: DGU (Geoportal of the State Geodetic Administration), Cadastre, Register of protected facilities, IEC, SMIV, etc.); 3. Prescribe ISEM as a system for verifying actual savings after building renovation (define what data the sensors on the premises send to the system, ISEM is already ready to receive data) and develop a methodology for calculating and verifying actual savings after building renovation, taking into account the default building usage regime; 4. Extend the use of ISEM to all sectors (private, industrial...) on a voluntary basis and/or as an obligation related to receiving financial assistance for renovation or implementation of energy efficiency measures; 5. Upgrading the ISEM so that it can carry out a financial analysis of cost-effectiveness of renovation on the basis of actual data; 6. The development of ISEM in the direction of so-called artificial intelligence, whereby the system would propose measures to increase energy efficiency according to input parameters. 7. Introduction of measuring devices / sensors to measure indoor temperature and air quality in public buildings and connect to ISEM.  Apart from upgrading the ISEM, this measure envisages continuing and broadening the scope of education for institutions of the public and other sectors, creating a base of users familiar with energy efficiency and competent to act within their institutions and elaborating the proposal that the position of energy manager is introduced in public institutions.  Funds needed for implementation: The funds needed to carry out all the activities envisaged are planned by the ATMIP as part of its regular activities and budget  Funding Sources: State Budget (ATMIP)  Executive body: ATMIP  Monitoring Bodies: Ministry of Environment and Energy - National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency  Effect: Reducing energy consumption in public buildings; changes in the habits and behaviour of users of public sector buildings, estimated savings in 2030 0.20 PJ (4.78 ktoe); estimated CO2 emission reductions in 2030 5.50 ktCO2e; cumulative energy savings in 2021-2030 1.90 PJ (45.41 ktoe); cumulative CO2 emission reductions in the period 2021-2030 54.13 ktCO2e  Tracking method: Up to now, monitoring of energy savings has been made possible through the ISEM system with basic and advanced database analyses. The savings achieved are based on measured data on the consumption of all forms of energy. Database synchronization provides verified data and, by connecting to metering systems, provides real-time data that 144  enables strategic planning and implementation of measures. Based on direct hourly monitoring of energy and water consumption through the ISEM system, quality indicators of energy needs are obtained and they can be better planned and managed. Connection to other dimensions: through systematic monitoring and understanding of energy consumption, the public sector will be able to become an informed player in the energy market  Connection to climate change adaptation: /  Research and development: the obligation of systematic energy management in the public sector is stimulating for research and development in the field of monitoring and managing energy consumption in buildings based on information and communication technologies  ENU-8: Energy renovation programme for public lighting Financial measure, energy services; implementation 2021 -2030  Objective and description of the measure: Energy renovation of public lighting in the Republic of Croatia is currently being implemented with ESI funds from the European Regional Development Fund, using the financial instrument of loan at favourable interest rates offered by the CBRD to units of local and regional self-government. To this end, HRK 152 million are available and the loan covers up to 100% of eligible project costs. It is expected that this financial allocation will be utilized by 2020, and no later than 2023. The estimated savings in this first phase of the Programme are around 15 GWh in 2020 (2023). Considering the significant potential that exists in public lighting systems, ESI funds are planned to be used in the next programming period 20212027. By programming a larger allocation of funds for this purpose, the existing potential could be utilized by the end of 2030, which is estimated at around 225-280 GWh. At the same time, renovation of public lighting would meet the technical standards for road lighting, which would mean improving traffic safety and reducing light pollution. The financing models to be used in the next period should also enable the mobilization of private capital through energy services or public-private partnerships in order to achieve the best multiplier effect. Models to be considered include subsidies for interest rates on commercial loans/required returns to the service and guarantee provider, and for projects requiring investment in new public lighting infrastructure (columns, additional lamps and the like), in order to meet the standardized technical requirements, it is necessary to secure grants. It has been assumed that by the end of 2030, all the estimated potential for improving the energy efficiency of the public lighting system would be achieved, and an annual electricity saving of 25 GWh (0.90 PJ; 2.15 ktoe) has been estimated. (Note: The objectives, conditions and activities set out in this document are indicative and will be specified in detail in the Energy Renovation Programme of Public Sector Buildings for the period 2021-2030).  Activities: The following activities will be implemented within the measure:   In 2020, the MEE will develop the Energy Renovation Programme for Public Lighting Systems for the period 2021-2030, adopted by the Government, which is the basis for the use of ESI funds in the 2021-2027 programming period.  The implementation of the Programme itself should begin in 2021 by applying the selected financing model, which includes energy services and public-private partnerships and is in line with the rules for the use of ESI funds.  145  Funds needed for implementation: The estimated investment cost in the period 2021-2030 is HRK 2.88 billion. Funding Sources: ESI funds should be provided for the selected financing model, preferably subsidies for commercial loan interest rates, guarantees for service providers and grants for projects that are not profitable within an acceptable timeframe.  Executive body: MEE - establishes the implementation model; defines eligibility criteria for projects, concludes an agreement with CBRD/EPEEF on the implementation of the Programme; CBRD/EPEEF - cooperation with commercial banks; operational implementation of the Programme; LGUs - launching projects, contracting energy service/PPP  Monitoring (supervisory) bodies: MEE - NCB  Effect: Reduction of electricity consumption in public lighting systems, reduction of light pollution; estimated savings in 2030 0.90 PJ (21.50 ktoe); estimated CO 2 emission reduction in 2030 - 19.60 ktCO2e; cumulative energy savings in 2021-2030 4.95 PJ (118.25 ktoe); cumulative CO 2 emission reduction in the period 2021-2030 - 157.95 ktCO2e  Monitoring method: Energy Saving Monitoring, Measurement and Verification System, using the bottom-up method for replacement of public and outdoor lighting  Connection to other dimensions: with the potential integration of photovoltaic power generation systems for public lighting, there is a direct link with the decarbonisation dimension  Connection to climate change adaptation: /  Research and development: energy renovation of public lighting is an incentive for the further development of lighting technology and lighting management systems based on information and communication technologies, but also for the integration of other services into the public lighting system (e.g., broadband Internet, etc.)  ENU-9: Green public procurement Information measure; implementation 2014-2030  Objective and description of the measure: The Government of the Republic of Croatia adopted in 2015 the first National Action Plan for Green Public Procurement for the period from 2015 to 2017 with an outlook to 2020, and green public procurement was also accepted as a measure in the 4th NEEAP, which sets the target that by 2020 green public procurement criteria are applied in 50% of implemented public procurement procedures. A national Green Public Procurement Committee was set up to monitor the implementation of Green Public Procurement through a survey questionnaire and an electronic public procurement bulletin. This measure is a continuation of the initiated measures and further greening of public procurement procedures. Green public procurement will favour innovative low-carbon products and services, further boosting their entry into the market, with the public sector serving as a good example. The objective is to have 75% of implemented public procurement procedures that apply green public procurement criteria in 2030. Activities: The following activities will be implemented within the measure:   Training of participants in public procurement and promotion of green public procurement criteria;   Improving the monitoring of the implementation of green public procurement for the purposes of quantifying the effects - public procurement clients are obliged to publish their public procurement plans on the website at the beginning of the year, however the statistical public procurement report generated from the EPPC also contains information on whether the green public procurement criteria have been used and will be drafted for year 2017 as late as the beginning of 2018, however without specifying 146  details - therefore, it is not possible to calculate energy savings without elaborating how green public procurement is monitored in the EPPC and it is mandatory to improve the monitoring system;   Ongoing development of new criteria and benchmarks for green public procurement, including energy efficiency.   Funds needed for implementation: The funds needed to carry out all the activities envisaged are planned by the MEE as part of its regular activities and budget  Funding Sources: State budget (MEE)  Executive body: MEE in cooperation with the members of the Green Public Procurement Committee; State Office for Central Public Procurement; State administration bodies, L(R)SGUs and other public procurement clients  Monitoring Bodies: Ministry of Environment and Energy - National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency  Effect: Reducing energy consumption in public buildings; changes in the habits and behaviour of users of public sector buildings  Monitoring method: Monitoring the achieved energy savings in the future will be carried out by applying BU methods for each group of devices that have been procured, respecting the energy efficiency criteria. It is expected that the largest number of purchases will be related to computer and office equipment and motor vehicles. The State Central Public Procurement Office monitors the data on the quantities and types of equipment purchased and submits the data to the NCB, which enters them into System for Measuring, Monitoring and Verification of Energy Savings. The quantities of all procurement procedures applying the 'green' criteria should be monitored.  Connection to other dimensions: direct connection to the decarbonisation dimension (green electricity supply, electric vehicle procurement, etc.)  Connection to climate change adaptation: /  Research and development: Public procurement can be a major driver of development activities by continuously increasing 'green' requirements for devices, equipment and buildings.   Measures to promote energy audits and the energy management system The implementation of energy audits and promotion of systematic energy management in the period from 2021 to 2030, apart from the leading role of the public sector (continued implementation of Measure P.3, MEN-6), will be ensured through continued implementation of legally binding provisions. Namely, based on the Energy Efficiency Act and the Building Act, the following obligated parties in Croatia have the legal obligation to perform energy audits:  - large enterprises (assets > 130 mil HRK, revenue > 260 mil HRK, > 250 employees) every 4 years (except where energy and environment management system (ISO 50001) has been set up with an energy audit obligation); - public lighting; - ry 10 years; - existing buildings or parts of buildings constituting autonomous units and subject to the obligation of energy certification of buildings when they are sold, rented or leased; - heating systems in buildings with boilers using liquid (> 100 kW every 2 years) or gaseous fuel with a total nominal power of 20 kW (every 10 years) and larger (every 4 years);  147  - cooling and air conditioning systems in buildings with one or more thermal/cooling energy generating units with a total nominal power of 12 kW and larger (every 10 years). These statutory obligations shall remain in force in the period 2021-2030, and their further development is expected, particularly in the light of the amended Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.  In addition, for the period from 2021, the introduction of a new fiscal measure for the promotion of systematic energy management in the business sector is expected.  ENU-10: Energy management system in business (service & production) sector Fiscal measure; implementation 2021-2030  Objective and description of the measure: Although large companies are obliged to regularly carry out energy audits, this obligation does not ensure continuous consideration of energy consumption in the company, nor does it include small and medium-sized enterprises. In order to encourage companies to introduce certified energy management systems (ISO 50001), by 2020 a comprehensive analysis will be performed regarding the possibilities of using the tax system (including taxes and parafiscal charges) to stimulate companies to introduce such a system and thus ensure continuous consideration of energy consumption.  Activities: The following activities will be implemented within the measure:   In cooperation with the Ministry of Finance, the MEE shall in 2020 prepare a comprehensive analysis of the possibilities of using the tax system to encourage systematic energy management in the business sector - for each proposed solution, the effects must be evaluated and the method for monitoring them should be defined;  The recommendations of the analysis are incorporated into the laws and regulations related to the tax solutions that are proposed to be used and their implementation begins.  Funds needed for implementation: The funds needed to develop a comprehensive analysis of the use of the tax system to stimulate systematic energy management in the business sector are planned by the MEE as part of its regular activities and budget; the implementation of the tax policy itself does not require additional funds  Funding Sources: State budget (MEE)  Executive body: MEE - preparation of analysis and proposal of solution; MFIN - integration of proposed solutions into the tax system  Monitoring Bodies: Ministry of Environment and Energy - National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency  Effect: Reducing the energy consumption of businesses in the service and industrial sectors  Monitoring method: The monitoring method for the selected tax solution will be determined.  Connection to other dimensions: through systematic monitoring and understanding of energy consumption, the business sector will be able to become an informed participant in the energy market and to choose solutions that will contribute to decarbonisation  Connection to climate change adaptation: /  148  Research and development: encouraging systematic energy management opens up the need for research and development of energy monitoring and management systems based on information and communication technologies   Providing information to consumers and training measures  Providing information to consumers will continue through the improvement of the implementation of existing regulatory and informational measures.  ENU-11: Informative bills  Information measure; implementation 2014-2030  Objective and description of the measure: One of the fundamental measures of informing consumers is the legal obligation of the supplier to provide them at least once a year with informative calculations and energy billing information to consumers and the previous consumption of the final customer for measuring points that are the subject of a contractual relationship, including a comparison with the average normal or reference end customer from the same category of end customers of the supplier. The frequency of application of this statutory provision should be reduced to a monthly level, and it is absolutely necessary to ensure that the energy regulatory authority (CERA) carries out control over these obligations of the energy supplier. In addition, based on these regulatory provisions, it is also necessary to additionally inform consumers about the contents and meaning of the bill, which is the task of the National Coordination Body (NCB) for Energy Efficiency. Activities: The following activities will be implemented within the measure:   MEE - NCB will in 2020: - develop a guidance for suppliers that will define all the necessary information to be displayed on monthly invoices for the purpose of informing consumers; - develop and publish explanations of bills on the national energy efficiency portal;  Throughout the period, the MEE - NCB will systematically work to inform both suppliers and consumers of their rights and obligations.  Funds needed for implementation: The funds needed to carry out all the activities envisaged are planned by the MEE as part of its regular activities and budget  Funding Sources: State budget (MEE)  Executive body: MEE - NCB - developing a guide that will define how to inform users on monthly bills; developing and publishing explanations of bills on the national energy efficiency portal; CERA - supervising the implementation of legal obligations of suppliers  Monitoring (supervisory) bodies: MEE-NCB  Effect: Increasing consumer awareness of energy consumption and consequently changing behaviour along with reduced energy consumption  Monitoring method: The effects of this measure can only be monitored by top-down indicators.  Connection to other dimensions: informative calculations empower the customer in the energy market  Connection to climate change adaptation: /  Research and development: /  149  ENU-12: Providing information on energy efficiency  Information measure; implementation 2014-2030  Objective and description of the measure: Providing information to the general public and target groups shall be conducted through the organization of targeted information campaigns related to specific programmes of encouraging energy efficiency, particularly energy renovation of buildings. The NCB will maintain the national energy efficiency portal and provide up-to-date information to ensure continued promotion of energy efficiency and energy services. Particular attention should be given in the following period to informing consumers of the obligations of the supplier within the obligation system.  Activities: The following activities will be implemented within the measure:   Ensuring continuous information through the National Energy Efficiency Portal - portal www.enu.hr is the central point for current information in the field of energy savings in the Republic of Croatia. The content of the portal is grouped around three fundamental drivers of change: citizens, the public sector, the commercial sector along the EE heading in Croatia, which contains all important documents, strategic orientations and information on institutions operating within the field of energy efficiency. The portal publishes all information on activities, advice, events, projects, tenders, news and obligations related to energy efficiency in the Republic of Croatia. MEE - NCB is committed to maintaining and ensuring the full functionality of the portal;  Targeted information campaigns need to be implemented as part of other measures, in particular energy renovation measures for buildings, and the bodies responsible for implementing these measures are also in charge of implementing information activities.  Targeted information campaigns should also be directed to the professional public, which in cooperation with other stakeholders (professional associations, academic community, non-governmental organizations, etc.) should be regularly informed about the current issues and trends in the field of energy efficiency, including green building, circular economy and sustainable mobility  Funds needed for implementation: The funds needed to carry out all the activities envisaged are planned by the MEE as part of its regular activities and budget  Funding Sources: State budget (MEE)  Executive body: MEE - NCB; Bodies responsible for the implementation of other measures (MCPP, EPEEF, LGUs, etc.)  Monitoring Bodies: Ministry of Environment and Energy - National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency  Effect: Increasing the level of awareness of the benefits of energy efficiency with the consequent change in behaviour and reduction in energy consumption by applying concrete measures  Monitoring method: Monitoring the impact of this measure is possible by applying top-down methods on the sectoral level. Before conducting each info campaign, a market research should be done and the effects proven by repeating the same survey after the campaign.  Connection to other dimensions: /  Connection to climate change adaptation: Information should be provided about the link between energy consumption and climate change as well as the benefits of energy efficiency in terms of adaptation to climate change (increased resilience to, for example, extreme temperature conditions, etc.)  Research and development: the measure encourages innovation in the information segment (use of information and communication technologies)  150  ENU-13: Energy efficiency education  Educational measure; implementation 2017-2030  Objective and description of the measure: Training will be achieved by continuing the implementation of the existing measure and adapting the activities to the needs and the actual situation. It is especially important to systematically work on attracting young people to construction and other technical occupations, which will contribute to the availability of professional staff for the implementation of energy renovation of buildings in the long run, which is the basis for achieving the set energy and climate targets. Through education in the field of energy efficiency, the principles of green building will be set and applied: it is necessary to encourage the promotion and implementation of green building (building on the principles of sustainability) as an essential segment of sustainable development and the circular economy. It is necessary to strengthen and support the hitherto adopted policies of the Republic of Croatia in the field of sustainable development, energy efficiency and national guidelines for building quality and culture (ApolitikA), to apply the best global standards of green building (e.g. international green building certificates), to develop the national green building system, and to raise awareness of the untapped opportunities and risks (if not implemented) and of the various opportunities (if implemented) that arise from applying the principles of green building to the individual and the community as a whole, to the private and social sectors of the economy and investment.   Activities: The following activities will be implemented within the measure:   It is envisaged to further implement the system of continuous training and certification of construction workers - through authorized CROSKILLS training centres, according to the Ordinance on the system of training and certification of construction workers who install parts of the building that affect energy efficiency in building construction. This should lead to increased use of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources in everyday construction practice and increased demand for educated workforce, by increasing the practical knowledge of on-site workers who specialize in all phases of construction and maintenance procedures  The implementation of educational activities focused on the principles of green building is envisaged (activities in the previous period will produce a Guide and guidelines on green and sustainable construction and guidelines for the Croatian Green Building Certificate, so all activities in the period from 2021 onwards will be based on these guidelines)  Funds needed for implementation: The funds needed to carry out all the activities envisaged should be determined on the basis of the results and recommendations of CROSKILLS training centres  Funding Sources: ESI funds for strengthening human resources, with the aim of integrating the principles of green and sustainable construction and circular economy into existing systems of vocational, adult education and lifelong learning.  Executive body: AVETAE - co-financing training centres for the implementation of worker training; CES - co-financing of training/retraining of the unemployed; Faculty of Civil Engineering in Zagreb, within the CROSKILLS project; MCPP - setting up and applying the principles of green building in cooperation with the Croatian Green Building Council and the Faculty of Architecture (AF)  Monitoring (supervisory) bodies: MCPP and MEE-NCB  Effect: Available expert capacities for implementation of energy efficiency measures  151  Monitoring method: The number of educated experts within established educational programmes/training centres is monitored.  Connection to other dimensions: through education on green building, which includes significant use of RES, the connection with the dimension of decarbonisation is achieved  Connection to climate change adaptation: through education on green building, which includes the promotion of green infrastructure on buildings (green roofs, green facades, etc.), capacity to implement these measures is strengthened, which represent significant measures for adaptation to climate change (e.g. reduction of urban heat islands, etc.)  Research and development: educational activities in the field of green building stimulate research and development in this segment (technologies and methods for 'greening' of buildings)  ENU-14: Integrated information system for monitoring energy efficiency Information measure; implementation 2014-2030  Objective and description of the measure: The national system for monitoring, measurement and verification of savings (SMIV) has been established, based on the Energy Efficiency Act and the Ordinance on the system for monitoring, measurement and verification of energy savings. The system is extremely important because it monitors energy savings and the resulting reduction in greenhouse gases and the system data are used for reporting. In the next period, it is necessary to maintain and improve the functionality of the system, connect it to other systems (ISEM), and inform and educate obligated parties about the correct data entry required to calculate and verify energy savings.  Activities: The following activities will be implemented within the measure:   further upgrading, development and adaptive maintenance of SMIV, its integration with other systems in order to build an integrated information and computer system for monitoring the implementation of energy efficiency policy  Funds needed for implementation: The funds needed to carry out all the activities envisaged are planned by the Ministry of Environment and Energy as part of its regular activities and budget  Funding Sources: State Budget (Ministry of Environment and Energy )  Executive body: Ministry of Environment and Energy - National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency  Monitoring Bodies: Ministry of Environment and Energy - National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency  Effect: Systematic monitoring of the implementation of ENU measures and quantification of their effects; facilitated reporting at all levels; facilitated planning of new measures and revision of existing ones based on evidence of implementation effects  Monitoring method: /  Connection to other dimensions: /  Connection to climate change adaptation: /  Research and development: /   Measures in the process industry sector In the period from 2021 to 2030, ETS (MS-3: European Emission Trading System) remains the main policy instrument for reducing industrial sector emissions. For non-ETS facilities, the 152  obligation to pay CO2 emission fees (MS-5: CO2 emission tax for the non-ETS stationary sources), shall remain, according to the Regulation on unit charges, corrective coefficients and detailed criteria and standards to determine the special environmental fee for motor vehicles (Official Gazette 73/07, 48/09, 2/18) and the decisions on the amount of the unit fee for greenhouse gas emissions for operators of non-ETS facilities.  In addition, it is expected that the system of suppliers' obligations will also contribute to improving energy efficiency in this sector through the exploitation of cost-effective energy efficiency potentials and the use of market models, such as energy efficiency contracting. Therefore, in the period from 2021 to 2030, new financial incentives from public sources are not foreseen.  v. If applicable, a description of policies and measures to promote the role of local RES energy communities in contributing to the implementation of the policies and measures referred to in subitems i., Ii., Iii. and iv. Energy communities will be promoted under the RES-1 measure, and the regulatory framework necessary for their functioning under the RES-4 measure. vi. Description of the measures to exploit potential for increasing energy efficiency of the gas and electricity infrastructure Measures for increasing the energy efficiency of the electricity infrastructure (transmission and distribution grids) are based on ten-year development plans of the transmission and distribution grid for 2016-2025 and the CERA Decision on Implementation of Energy Efficiency Measures (more details in Chapter 1.2.2). The measure to increase the energy efficiency of the gas transmission system, is based on Plinacro's 10-year plan. It is also important for the Republic of Croatia to improve the infrastructure for production, transmission, and distribution of energy for heating and cooling.  ENU-15: Energy efficiency of the electricity transmission system Financial and organizational measures; implementation 2021-2030  Objective and description of the measure: Current levels of losses in the transmission grid of the Republic of Croatia amount to about 2% of the transmitted electricity, which is the amount at the level of other operators in the ENTSO-E transmission system. An important feature of the Croatian transmission grid, both in terms of plant safety and support of market activities, as well as in terms of losses, is the extremely strong connection with neighbouring power systems (interconnections). While, on the one hand, this significantly increases the safety of the plant, on the other hand, the transmission increases the grid losses. HOPS (Croatian Transmission System Operator) will continue to implement measures related to the operation of the power system operation development and measures related to the development of the transmission grid by 2030, with the aim of further reducing technical losses in the grid. For this measure, along with provision of funds by HOPS, it is proposed to programme the use of ESI funds in the next programming period 2021 - 2027.  153  Activities: The following activities will be implemented within the measure:   Measures related to the operation of the electricity system: topological changes in the grid depending on the current operating state; change of switching state of transformers 400/220 kV, 400/110 kV, 220/110 kV and 110 / x kV owned by/within the competence of HOPS and optimization of operation of transformers with oblique control (TS -HPP Senj); voltage management and optimization of power flows in the grid; optimization of generator operation (operating points with power factor in the range 0.95 -1).   Measures related to the short and long term development of the transmission grid include: replacement of old energy transformers with new transformers that have smaller losses (replacement of 10% of the oldest transformers in the grid responsible for about 20% of total fixed losses in transformations and about 15% of total variable losses in transformations); revitalization of old powerlines via a replacement of conductors (replacement of existing lines with new ones with a larger cross section directly reduces the resistance of the conductor, thus positively reducing the amount of technical losses due to load (variable part of losses), using HTLS conductors with a larger aluminium sheath cross section i.e. smaller losses; planned reinforcement of the transmission grid (construction of new lines). Replacing older equipment with new one which has a reduced amount of loss results in a reduction in overall system-level losses. Further reduction of losses in the future can be achieved by the development of new and more energy-efficient technologies, and the further revitalization and construction of the grid using the latest generation conductors with a smaller electrical resistance, i.e. smaller losses.  Funds needed for implementation: The funds needed to carry out all the activities envisaged according to the source of the funds and by activities envisaged are shown in the following tables:  HOPS Funds: Increasing transmission power - potential use of HTLS conductors 270.820.000 Planned grid reinforcement (TS revitalization) 631.623.051 Planned grid reinforcement (investments in new facilities) 714.870.212 Planned replacement of power transformers 178.250.000 Planned cabling of 110 kV overhead lines 35.600.000 TOTAL (HRK) 1.831.163.263  ESI Funds: Electricity connection of the Croatian south 1.085.000.000 Planned replacement of 110 kV submarine cables 490.000.000 Construction of DV 400 kV Konjsko - Lika - Melina with construction of TS 400 kV Lika 800.000.000 DV 2x400 kV Tumbri -   98.000.000 Increasing the transmission power of the 220 kV Konjsko - Brinje 210.000.000 TOTAL FOR SUBMISSION TO ESI FUNDS (HRK) 2.683.000.000 Expected contribution from ESI funds is 25 to 50%, which means between 670.750.000 and 1.341.500.000 HRK. Funding Sources: HOPS, ESI funds  Executive body: HOPS  Monitoring Bodies: Ministry of Environment and Energy - National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency, Croatian Energy Regulatory Agency  Effect: The following table shows the reduction of losses in the transmission system:  Measure Estimation of potential savings in losses (GWh/year)  2019-2021 2022-2024 2025-2028 154  Replacement of conductors in the overhead lines (HTLS conductors) 0,26 0,39 0,6 Replacement of 110 kV submarine cables 0,6 1.4 1,7 Planned grid reinforcement 7 15 25 Installation of compensation devices (2xVSR + 1xSVC) 0 -3,5 -3,5 Planned replacement of power transformers 0,2 0,3 0,4 Planned cabling of 110 kV overhead lines 0 0,4 0,5 Optimizing power flows 0,7 0,7 0,7 Optimizing generator performance 2,0 3,7 5 Optimizing the operation of power transformers 5,1 6,6 7,3 TOTAL APPLICATION OF ALL MEASURES (GWh/year) 15,9 25 38 According to the data in the table above, the savings that will be made at the end of 2028 are 20.9 ktoe (0.9 PJ; 242.9 GWh) and are 'alive' in 2030; estimated CO 2 emission reductions in 2030 19.0 ktCO2e; cumulative energy savings in 2021-2030 124.1 ktoe (5.2 PJ; 1.443 GWh); cumulative CO 2 emission reductions in the period 2021-2030 165.8 ktCO2e  The estimate of the savings is entirely based on the assumptions given in the 10-Year grid Development Plan 2019-2028. made by HOPS. Monitoring method: The monitoring of the effects of this measure is achieved on the basis of data on realized losses of electricity before and after the implementation of the measure with normalization according to the amount and duration of the load.  Connection to other dimensions: Investments in the transmission grid directly affect the dimensions of energy safety and the internal energy market, while reducing losses also achieves decarbonisation goals.  Connection to climate change adaptation: /  Research and development: the measure entails research and development by developing new and more energy-efficient technologies related to the transmission system (electricity equipment) and its management (information and communication technologies)   ENU-16: Reduction of losses in the distribution network and introduction of smart grids Financial and organizational measures; implementation 2021.-2030  Objective and description of the measure: In the period of up to 2030, HEP-DSO will continue to conduct activities to reduce technical and non-technical losses in the distribution power grid. A detailed analysis will identify the causes of increased losses in some parts of the grid and the priorities for implementing activities to reduce technical and non-technical losses. Based on the experience gained from the implementation of a pilot project for the deployment of advanced grids in pilot areas using ESI funds, it is necessary to programme the continuation of the use of ESI funds in the next programming period from 2021 to 2027 for the further development of advanced grids.  Activities: The following activities will be implemented within the measure:   Technical loss reduction activities, including:  - increasing the cross section of the conductors in the initial parts of MV and LV bushings in which the highest amount of losses is generated - separation of MV and LV bushings into two or more, depending on the topology of the bushing and the acceptance options in TS HV/MV and MV /MV or TS MV /LV - moving part of the LV bushing to an adjacent closer and/or less loaded LV bushing or TS MV/LV - replacement of HV/MV and MV /MV power transformers due to overload 155  - replacement of old MV/ LV energy transformers, with reduction of transformer overdimensioning - interpolation of new TS HV/MV, MV/MV and MV/LV (primarily when overloading existing TSs, i.e. when connecting new customers and manufacturers with larger connecting power) - transition to 20 kV and gradual introduction of 110/10 (20) kV direct transformation  Non-technical loss reduction activities, which include:  - further installation and introduction of as many advanced meters into the remote monitoring and readout system as possible  -  further comprehensive implementation of the connection and measuring points control (KPiMM), with the emphasis on detecting unauthorized electricity consumption -  and continued reconstruction of existing connections and measuring points, which are located in the customers' premises.  Funds needed for implementation: HEP-DSO funds: The total investment cost of installing advanced metering devices in all of 2.4 million measuring points in the period 2021 to 2030 is approximately HRK 2,356,000,000.  As EU directives require the transition from conventional metering to advanced metering devices, the use of ESI funds in the area of adaptation of the existing metering system to the system for working with advanced metering devices was foreseen. First of all, it is an investment in the adaptation of the existing authorized services for the preparation of calibration meters (gauges), which are adapted to the verification of electro-mechanical meters, to the technology that enables the preparation and certification of advanced electronic meters. With the adjustments it is additionally required to make available the support to work with new technologies, above all solving of communication problems (G3 PLC) and computing process problems (upgrades of FW meters and hubs, data acquisition, transmission and processing). The foreseen funds for the adaptation of the existing metering system to the system with advanced meters are estimated at around 110,000,000 HRK. In the next ten-year period, HEP-DSO plans to invest funds in the amount of HRK 6,696,197,000, of which it is planned to invest in energy facilities as follows:  investments in 110 kV energy facilities      HRK 1,227,481,000  investments in 35 kV energy facilities    HRK 602,610,000   investments in 10 kV and 20 kV energy facilities     HRK 1,771,766,000  investments in low-voltage facilities       HRKJ 656,895,000   investments in Smart grid pilot projects (co-financing from EU funds)  HRK 233,745,000     The following table provides an overview of the financial resources invested in Smart grid pilot projects:  No. Type of Investment Total 10Y 2019-2028 1 Advanced metering infrastructure 90,918,000 2 Development and optimization of conventional network 40,618,000 3 Distribution grid automation 102,209,000  Total 233,745,000  Funding Sources: HEP-DSO, ESI funds  Executive body: HEP-DSO  Monitoring Bodies: Ministry of Environment and Energy - National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency, Croatian Energy Regulatory Agency  156  Effect: Reduction of losses in the electricity distribution grid - The HEP-Distribution System Operator prepares a balance sheet for the previous year, which separately shows losses of electricity.  Total electricity losses consist of technical and non-technical losses. Technical losses are due to the operating state of the distribution grid and the technical characteristics of the grid elements. They can be divided into:   voltage-dependent i.e. permanent losses resulting from the maintenance of the power system in standby mode for the supply of customers with electricity,   electricity-dependent losses i.e. variable losses resulting from the flow of electricity through the components of the power system.  Based on the assumed changes in load, consumption, investment features and start-up of individual facilities, a possible total reduction in technical losses with the implementation of the 10-Year Grid Development Plan 2019-2028 is estimated at 284 to 455 GWh (these values represent cumulative savings in a given period), of which in the first three years (period 2019-2021) from 8.5 to 13.4 GWh on average per year. Measured according to the average annual consumption in 2015-2017 of 16,310 GWh, average annual decrease in technical losses in 2019-2021 ranges from 0.05% to 0.08%. The effect of measures i.e. the reduction of technical losses, grows over the years as the scope of measures increases with time. E.g. the number of transformers with reduced losses will be significantly higher at the end of the ten-year period, therefore the annual savings at the end of the ten-year period will also be higher. Non-technical losses i.e. commercial losses are the consequence of the taken over, i.e. consumed electricity that has, for some reason, not been accounted for. According to the estimate of the share of technical and non-technical losses in the total losses of the distribution grid, technical and non-technical losses account for about 50% of the total losses. Accordingly, for the purposes of the assessment of the effect in the period 2021-2030, a constant proportion of technical (50%) and non-technical losses (50%) in the total electricity losses was assumed.

Advanced meters are equipped with indicators for power outages and parameter changes, which enable the detection of unauthorized power consumption by signalling unauthorized access to the device and its unauthorized use, and, ultimately, remote shutdown of power to the customer at whose point such behaviour was detected.  Summation meters installed in transformer stations based on measurements of total consumption and energy production at low-voltage outputs from the transformer station allow accurate calculation of energy losses in the medium voltage and low voltage distribution girds, comparing the amount of energy consumed in TS MV/ LV and the amount of energy consumed by end customers. By installing summation meters, more efficient and faster detection and reduction of unauthorized consumption is expected.  A number of cost-benefit analyses for the installation of advanced measuring devices, carried out in EU Member States, have identified an expected reduction in unauthorized consumption of 50% of non-technical losses (Lithuania, Slovenia), which is in line with the experience of other international pilot projects. Based on the above, the forecast for the reduction of unauthorized consumption in the case of Croatia is set at 50% of non-technical losses. The non-technical losses incurred during the reference period by the implementation of advanced measuring devices and their networking systems are shown in the table below and calculated on the basis of an estimate of the amount of non-technical losses, an estimated maximum reduction of unauthorized consumption of 50% of the total non-technical losses after 157  completion of the implementation of advanced metering devices and systems for their networking.

Monitoring method: HEP-DSO prepares a balance sheet for the previous year, specifically showing electricity losses.  Monitoring method: HEP-Distribution System Operator prepares a balance sheet for the previous year, which specifically shows electricity losses.  Connection to other dimensions: lnvestments in the distribution grid directly affect the dimensions of energy safety and the internal energy market, while reducing losses also achieves decarbonisation goals. Advanced measurements strengthen the customer's role in the energy market.  Connection to climate change adaptation: /  Research and development:: the measure entails research and development by developing new and more energy-efficient technologies related to the distribution system (electricity equipment) and its management (information and communication technologies for advanced grids and advanced metering).  ENU-17: Increasing efficiency of district heating system Financial and organizational measures; implementation 2021-2030  Objective and description of the measure: In the existing large centralized heating systems, a large source of losses is the deteriorated distribution network, and this measure foresees the continuation of the replacement of deteriorated steel hot water pipes and steam lines with new pre-insulated pipes and a technological shift towards the fourth generation of district heating. In smaller systems with their own boiler room, it is necessary to allow for the reconstruction of boiler rooms, in particular by replacing them with high-efficiency cogeneration systems or systems using heat pumps. The measure also envisages the development of new heating and cooling systems, which use high efficiency cogeneration or renewable energy sources. In view of the provisions of Directive 2018/2002 on energy efficiency, and in particular with the introduction of the obligation of individual measurement at the level of the end-user, district heating systems have become systems with variable heat demand, which requires the introduction of advanced metering systems as an additional step towards the integration of different energy systems and increasing overall energy efficiency.  Activities: The following activities will be implemented within the measure:   Preparation of documentation for replacement of the deteriorated distribution systems.  Replacement of distribution systems with deteriorated insulation of steel hot water pipes and steam lines with new pre-insulated pipes.   Introducing advanced metering  158  Funds needed for implementation: An estimate of the funds has yet to be made according to the plans of the DHS operator  Funding Sources: DHS Operators, ESI Funds  Executive body: Manufacturers, distributors and suppliers of heat from DHS  Monitoring Bodies: Ministry of Environment and Energy - National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency  Effect: Reducing losses in DHSs  Monitoring method: The monitoring of the effects of this measure is achieved on the basis of data from distributors of thermal energy on losses before and after application of the measures.  Connection to other dimensions: decarbonisation, energy safety, energy markets  Connection to climate change adaptation: Taking into account the consequences of climate change in infrastructure planning  Research and development: Transition to the fourth and fifth generation of district heating and cooling; energy storage; flexibility of energy systems   ENU-18 Increasing efficiency of the gas transport network Financial and organizational measures; implementation 2021.-2030  Objective and description of the measure: The potential for increasing the energy efficiency of the gas transmission system is the largest in the consumption of natural gas, which is mostly (70%) consumed for preheating of natural gas before delivery to customers, and only a smaller part (30%) for heating of business premises and various technological burdens, i.e. blowing out the system. In the coming period, Plinacro will carry out energy efficiency improvement activities in accordance with the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of the Croatian Gas Transmission System 2018 2027. Activities: The following activities will be implemented within the measure:   Pressure reduction, from the pressure of the transmission system to the delivery pressure to the customers, causes significant subcooling of natural gas, which is unacceptable for technical and safety reasons, and consequently for commercial ones. This preheating is carried out at reducing metering stations and reducing metering nodes through gas boilers and associated heat exchangers and heating cables. In the next period, Plinacro will continue with the systematic replacement of boiler equipment (boilers, burners, boiler management system).   One of the measures will be to reduce the preheating temperature of the exhaust gas stated temperature reduction will only be possible for those facilities where a reduced outlet gas temperature will not affect the safety of gas supply and the safety of customers.   There is room for increased energy efficiency in the optimal management of the gas transmission system in relation to system pressures, since lower transmission system pressure means less gas reduction for the user and less preheating, and thus less energy and gas consumption. Of course, these possibilities are limited at the moment due to the current technical characteristics of the gas transportation system, the conditions for taking over domestic gas and gas from imports and its delivery to customers. However, with the further development of the gas transmission system, above all compressor stations, which are necessary, but which will be a significant buyer of propulsion energy, optimal operation and management of the system will have to be given great attention. When maintaining the system, every effort should be made to minimize technological gas emissions. 159   Electricity in the gas transmission system is used to drive electrical appliances, cathodic protection and, of course, lighting. Although its share in the energy consumption of the gas transmission system is significantly less than that of natural gas, its regular maintenance and (where necessary) replacement of inefficient energy using devices will effectively reduce its consumption.  Funds needed for implementation: Estimate made by Plinacro  Funding Sources: Plinacro  Executive body: Plinacro  Monitoring Bodies: Ministry of Environment and Energy - National Coordination Body for Energy Efficiency, Croatian Energy Regulatory Agency  Effect: Reducing losses in the gas transportation system  Monitoring method: The effects of this measure are monitored on the basis of Plinacro data  Connection to other dimensions: Reducing losses in the gas system contributes to the goals of safety of supply and decarbonisation  Connection to climate change adaptation: Taking into account the consequences of climate change in infrastructure planning  Research and development: Energy storage; flexibility of energy systems  vii. Regional cooperation in this area, if applicable. At a regional workshop held in Ljubljana in July 2019, the proposed topics for regional cooperation within the energy efficiency dimension were  exchange of experience and good practice in the field of energy efficiency,  regional freight management (encouraging the use of rail transport, energy efficient logistics),  regional planning for the development of alternative fuel infrastructure,  regional cooperation on the development of efficient public transport (rail, bus, green tourism). Countries participating in informal regional coordination are considering the proposals made and will agree on next steps. viii. Financial measures in this area at the national level, including EU support and the use of EU funds. For the period up to 2020, the following financial resources are available to stimulate energy efficiency in Croatia: - funds that the Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund collects from the sale of greenhouse gas emission allowances in auctions and distributes in accordance with the Plan for the use of financial resources obtained from the sale of the emission allowances in auctions in Croatia by 2020 (Official Gazette no.19/18) and - ESI Funds, in particular the European Regional Development Fund (EFRR) in accordance with the Operational Programme Competitiveness and Cohesion 20142020.  The funds and financial measures for which they are used are shown Table 31 and Table 32, and it should be noted that the funds from the EFRR and related measures are being 160  implemented by the end of 2023. The tables provide a proposal for the use of these resources for 2021-2030 for the continuation of the implementation of existing measures or the introduction of new measures. It should be made clear that the tables do not give an estimate of the necessary funds for the implementation of these measures for 2021-2030.
