 Energy Efficiency Dimension This chapter describes the planned policies, measures and programmes for achieving the indicative national energy efficiency target for 2030 as well as other objectives presented in point 2.2, including planned measures and instruments (also of a financial nature) to promote the energy performance of buildings. The NDPES 2030 document describes different measures to achieve one of the two sub-targets of the development plan  Estonian energy supply and consumption is more sustainable  and the barometers that quantify it. The following measures of the NDPES 2030 contribute most directly to energy efficiency:  Measure 2.1 Increasing the introduction of alternative fuels in transport;  Measure 2.2 Reducing the demand for individual motorised transport;  Measure 2.3 An efficient transport fleet;  Measure 2.4 Increasing the energy efficiency of the existing building stock;  Measure 2.5 Increasing the anticipated energy efficiency of new buildings;  Measure 2.6 Efficient thermal transmission;  Measure 2.7 The example set by the public sector; and  Measure 2.8 Energy savings in other sectors. i. Energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative policy measures under Articles 7a and 7b and Article 20(6) of Directive 2012/27/EU and to be prepared in accordance with Annex III to this Regulation In order To achieve the targets described in chapter 2.2, the taxation of energy carriers and measures in the final consumption sectors are considered. Energy carriers are required to pay VAT and fuel and electricity excise duty; see also chapter 3.1.3.i. The following measures are applied to enhance final energy consumption (descriptions provided in annex IV to this document): TR2 Increasing fuel efficiency in the transport sector; TR3 Promotion of sustainable driving; TR4 Spatial and land use measures in cities to increase the fuel-efficiency of transport and the efficiency of the transportation system; TR5 Development of convenient and modern public transport; TR6 Establishment of road charges for heavy-duty vehicles; HF1 Reconstruction of public sector and commercial buildings; HF2 Reconstruction of private residences and apartment buildings; The following measures are also planned: TR8 Additional promotion of fuel-efficient driving; TR9 Additional spatial and land-use measures in cities to increase the fuel-efficiency of transport and the efficiency of the transportation system; TR10 Additional activities for the development of convenient and modern public transport TR13 Development of railway infrastructure (incl. construction of Rail Baltic); HF5 Additional reconstruction of public sector and commercial buildings; HF6  Additional reconstruction of private residences and apartment buildings. ii. Long-term renovation strategy to support the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, including policies, measures and actions to stimulate cost-effective deep renovation and policies and actions to target the worst performing segments of the national building stock, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU. 105, which is currently in force, was submitted to the European Commission in October 2017. The updated long-term reconstruction strategy will be submitted to the European Commission by 10 March 202049.  iii. Description of policies and measures to promote energy services in the public sector and measures to remove regulatory and non-regulatory barriers that impede the uptake of energy performance contracting and other energy efficiency service models106 The development of the energy services market is regulated by Sections 31 and 32 of the Energy Sector Organisation Act. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications (MEAC) in cooperation with the organisations Environmental Investments Centre (EIC), the Development Fund and SA KredEX, has analysed the potential of the energy services market and possible market barriers to developing the energy services market. There have also been several round-table discussions on the topic of energy services. The main topic in 2019 was dealing with energy efficiency agreements to provide assistance to the public sector in procuring energy services. The relevant instructional material and a model agreement were prepared. A communication event for different parties took place in February 2019 on that topic. Thus, the objectives provided for in Section 31 of the Energy Sector Organisation Act are being fulfilled in close cooperation with stakeholders. Several instruments that help with the financing of projects addressing energy efficiency have been developed by the Estonian government (SA KredEx, EIC). For example, SA KredEx provides various forms of support to apartment associations and private individuals for home renovations. More detailed information is available on its homepage as well as the list of apartment building reconstruction specialists107. The Ministry of the Envdeveloped. The resource efficiency measure also supports the procurement of public sector energy services. This measure covers four activities: awareness raising, specialist training, performance of audits/resource use analysis and investments108.                                                            105 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/ee_building_renov_2017_et.pdf 106 In accordance with Article 18 of Directive 2012/27/EU. 107 http://www.kredex.ee/korteriuhistu/korteriuhistu-toetused/rekonstrueerimise-toetus/tehniline- konsultant-7/ 108 http://ressurss.envir.ee/ Several companies are active in the Estonian energy services market, such as Adven109, Fortum110, MTÜ Eesti Energiasäästu Assotsiatsioon111, Soletek112, AU Energiateenus OÜ113, Eesti Energia114, and others. Information on the entry into energy efficiency agreements and performed projects is available on their homepage. iv. Other planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency target for 2030 as well as other objectives presented in 2.2 (for example measures to promote the exemplary role of public buildings and energy-efficient public procurement, measures to promote energy audits and energy management systems115, consumer information and training measures116, and other measures to promote energy efficiency117).  The exemplary role of public sector buildings In order to fulfil the exemplary role of public sector buildings, the measures are applied for the reconstruction of public sector buildings (descriptions in Annex IV of this document). According to section 5 of the Energy Sector Organisation Act, the energy savings coordinator for immovable property owned by the central government arranges for the renovation of 3% of the total useful floor area of buildings occupied by the central government. Currently the Ministry of Finance performs the task of the coordinator for immovable property owned by the central government. Promotion of the energy efficient public procurements The promotion of energy efficient public procurements in Estonia is based on the Energy Sector Organisation Act. Section 6 of the Act establishes the obligation to purchase only products, services and buildings that are highly energy efficient for the central government. More specific requirements are established in the regulation 118. In addition, via sharing best practices, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications is required to encourage public sector institutions, including regional and local-level institutions, to follow the example of the central government and purchase only products, services and buildings that are highly energy efficient. Specific project-based activities are also carried out.                                                            109 https://www.adven.ee/ee/energiateenus/ 110 https://www.fortum.ee/ 111 http://www.eesa.ee/esco/ 112 http://soletek.eu/energiateenused/ 113 http://energiateenus.ee/ 114 https://www.energia.ee/et/tark-tarbimine/kokkuhoid 115 In accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2012/27/EU. 116 In accordance with Articles 12 and 17 of Directive 2012/27/EU. 117 In accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2012/27/EU. 118 https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/110032017016 Energy audits Section obligation to perform regular energy audits. Under Section 28 (1) ESOA, an undertaking which is not a small or medium-sized enterprise or a distribution network operator or transmission network operator must undergo the energy audit referred to in Article 8 of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU every four years. The energy savings coordinator draws up and publishes on their website a list of large companies. The purpose of drawing up and publishing the list of large companies is as a means to inform large companies and also to help the Technical Regulatory Authority (TRA) organise the supervision. The minimum requirements of the energy audit are laid down in Regulation No 76 119 of the Minister for Economic Affairs and Infrastructure, which was adopted on 22 December 2016. The first deadline for the energy audit of large companies in Estonia was 23 April 2017. Under Section 12 of Regulation No 76, companies could submit the energy audit through a simplified procedure. The next deadline for the energy audit is 5 December 2019 and thereafter every four years. The obligation for large companies to carry out an energy audit is consistent with the ongoing energy and resource efficiency measure planned under the leadership of the Ministry of the Environment in the period of EU structural instruments. This measure targets establishing the basis for the growth of the resource efficiency of industry in the future and it is primarily aimed at small and medium-sized companies. This measure includes four activities:  - awareness-raising; - training of specialists; - audits, or the analysis of resource usage, and - investment. Replacement of pipelines Support is available for the reduction of the diameter of district heating pipelines and the installation of pre-insulated pipes within the framework of measure EN3, Development of heating infrastructure. v. Where applicable, a description of policies and measures to promote the role of local renewable energy communities in contributing to the implementation of policies and measures in points i, ii, iii and iv Under the reformulated Renewable Energy Directive (EU 2018/2001), renewable energy communities should be promoted. A renewable energy community is a legal entity the primary purpose of which is to provide environmental, economic or social community benefits for its shareholders or members or for the local areas                                                            119 https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/123122016003 in which it operates, instead of financial profits (Article 2). Renewable energy communities are entitled to (a) produce, consume, store and sell renewable energy, including through renewables power purchase agreements; (b) share, within the renewable energy community, renewable energy that is produced by the production units owned by that renewable energy community, subject to the other requirements laid down in this Article and to maintaining the rights and obligations of the renewable energy community members as customers; (c) access all suitable energy markets both directly or through aggregation in a non-discriminatory manner (Article 22). Cooperative collaboration is wide-spread in Estonia, e.g. apartment associations, consumer associations, forestry associations, agricultural associations. For example, local communities can use the supports designed with measures that are related to reconstruction of buildings and heating sector primarily via apartment associations. Projects involving consumers of energy generation that have taken place to date have shown that the establishment of local energy communities requires the increasing of awareness in Estonia, finding leaders and providing counselling services120. The experience of Energy association's program that took place in the period 2014-2015 and involved ten potential energy associations (incl. the participation of 7 local authorities) showed that the prerequisite for creating an energy community in Estonia is a certain population density, experience with cooperative collaboration, the presence of fuel-free and other renewable sources and proper energy technologies, the capability to reconstruct buildings and the opportunity to sell energy to the network. This program resulted in one energy association out of 10 pilot associations that participated, i.e. the activity, interest and readiness of local communities to create an energy community or association was low, at least some years ago121. Banks have a high risk sensitivity towards cooperative energy production since there is no trustworthy experience with it. But the high-interest capital takes big part of the, for example, income received from the solar power station installed by the apartment association and hence makes the activity not so interesting. The solution is to ensure low interest (e.g. 2%) long-term funding or a credit guarantee for banks. It is necessary to train relevant sectoral experts to create financial, technical and legal support for the energy communities and plan measures for the founders of the energy association for using the services of these experts. Estonia has adopted the practice of the European Renewable Energies Federation122 as the basis for determining the role of energy communities and their designation as energy associations. Estonian legislation does not designate energy communities or energy association separately, but their activities overlap with the forms highlighted in the Commercial Code, i.e. the renewable energy communities can act within the meaning of the Commercial Code as private or public limited companies. Here an energy association means community joint activities with the purpose of generating, distributing or selling electrical energy and heat to their members through their own                                                            120 See more at Energy associations https://energiatalgud.ee/index.php?title=Energia%C3%BChistud 121 Estonian Development Fund 2015 http://basrec.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/EDF EnerCoop BASREC report final.pdf 122 REScoop https://www.rescoop.eu/ equipment for covering self-consumption, i.e. the electrical energy and heat is generated and distributed within the community in order to cover self-consumption. Public renewable energy generation means the generation of decentralised renewable energy which the owners (at least to the extent of 50%) are operators or citizens, local initiatives, communities, local governments, charity or non-governmental organisations, agricultural producers, associations or SMEs that create local value that may remain in the region. The potential and socio-economic impact of Estonian energy associations123 was assessed in 2015 within the context of the Energy Association Mentor Programme. The greatest energy-related potential for the establishment of energy associations is in apartment buildings and public buildings that are not located in district heating regions or are located in low consumption density district heating network regions. The potential of local cooperative electricity generation with solar panels amounts to 30 GWh/year (3% of the annual electricity demand of the buildings in case the price received with investment is lower than the price of the purchased electricity). Local electricity generation for the existing local distribution grid has a positive impact by making it possible to increase network capacity by a few percent. Wood gasification with energy cogeneration of 22 GWh/year also has potential. The production potential of wind energy does not match the locations of apartment buildings and public buildings in Estonia. The share of local energy production makes up 0.33% of the final electricity consumption of all buildings. The buildings with the potential for heating association make up 8-10% of the final heating consumption of all buildings. The potential of communities in energy generation can primarily be implemented at the local level. More than 9,200 cities have joined the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy,124 and from Estonia, Tallinn, Tartu, Rakvere, Jõgeva, Kuressaare, Rõuge and Võru have joined. Under the covenant, by 2030 carbon emissions should be reduced by 40% in the territories of those towns, the towns should become carbon-neutral by 2050 and tackling of the impacts of climate change should be improved125. The tasks of the Tallinn Energy Agency126 include, among other things, coordinating and organising performance of the covenant, and directing the energy savings of the communities in Tallinn. For, example, up to 100 solar electricity stations will be installed on the roofs of buildings by the end of 2020. The energy roadmap for Tallinn was - Agency of the Tartu Region manages different international energy community projects127: the Interreg project Co2mmunity, and Horisont 2020 projects PANEL 2050 and SmartEnCity.                                                            123 Estonian Development Fund 2015 Report on THE POTENTIAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE ENERGY ASSOCIATIONS https://energiatalgud.ee/img_auth.php/1/13/Eesti_Arengufond._Energia%C3%BChistute_potentsiaali_ja_sotsiaalmajandusliku_m%C3%B5ju_anal%C3%BC%C3%BCs_2015.pdf 124 Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy https://www.globalcovenantofmayors.org/our-cities/ 125 Decision of the Tallinn City Government file:///C:/Users/Irje.Moldre/Downloads/04.04.2019_otsus_59%20(1).pdf 126 Tallinn Energy Agencyhttps://www.tallinn.ee/est/energiaagentuur/Tutvustus-38 127 TREA www.trea.ee vi. Description of measures to develop measures to utilise energy efficiency potentials of gas and electricity infrastructure128 Section 7 of the Energy Sector Organisation Act129 governs the use of the gas and power infrastructure potential, requiring transmission and distribution system operators to determine the measures for improving energy efficiency in the network, the necessary investments and the agenda for the commissioning and submit an overview of these to the energy savings coordinator. Subsections 3 and 4 of the same section lay down that the cost of the energy efficiency measures is considered upon establishing the network fees of the network operators. The network fee must not hinder improvement of the overall efficiency of the gas or power system, including energy efficiency, demand-side management, and the participation of market participants in the balancing market or in the procurement of additional services. The NDPES 2030 measures that contribute most directly to the use of the energy efficiency potential of the electricity infrastructure can be found in Table 22. Table 22 Barometers of the measures for taking advantage of the energy efficiency potential of the electricity infrastructure65 Objective: Security of supply: Continuous energy supply is guaranteed in Estonia Measure no.

Share of the weatherproof network in the distribution system 75% (2030) In addition to the overview of the related measures in the energy sector development plan given in the table above (Table 22), the installation of remote reading devices for all consumers (completed on 1 January 2017) and optimisation of the network connections (see more detailed description below) are important measures in increasing the energy efficiency of electricity networks. Over the period 19992014, the losses of the three main distribution system operators fell more than threefold (see Figure 15).                                                             128 In accordance with Article 15(2) of Directive 2012/27/EU. 129 Riigikogu.

Relative loss of the largest distribution system operators130 Whereas the losses of the biggest distribution system operator (Elektrilevi OÜ, ~90% market share) were 5.9% in 2014, in 2017 that had fallen to 4.1%. The main measure that supported this reduction in losses was an obligation to install remote reading devices for all consumers, which was completed by 01 January 2017. Further increases in electricity grid efficiency can only take place via the reduction of under-consumption in the grid131. For example, the largest distribution system operator (Elektrilevi OÜ) has >1 100 km of lines and >300 substations through which not a single kWh has passed132. The unused line and substations increase losses and significantly reduce system efficiency. The extent of the losses in the transmission system depends on the amount of transmitted energy, cross-border energy trading and the distribution of the capacity flows in the interconnected power system and the resulting transit flows, and weather conditions such as humidity and rainfall, among other things. In 2016, losses accounted for 3.0% of the total amount of electricity put into the main grid. Great potential for increasing gas network energy efficiency lies in the assemblies that use energy. In essence, the Estonian gas system is a dead-end system where the only energy use takes place in the pressure-reducing metering stations where the gas is heated. There are no losses in the network and there are no compressor stations in the network. To ensure that the commercial losses of the transmission and distribution system are reduced to a minimum, all gas consumption points must have remote reading devices by 2020.                                                            130 The Competition Authority.

Estonia participates in the energy market interconnection working group on energy efficiency. Energy efficiency topics are also dealt with in the Committees of the Senior Officials of the Baltic Council of Ministers, as appropriate. These collaboration formats are described in chapter 1.4.ii. viii. Financing measures, including EU support and the use of EU funds in the area at national level It is planned that European Union support and Union funds should also be used in EU budget period years 2021 to 2027. Planning of the subsequent EU budget period is in the initial phases
