4.5. Dimension of the internal energy market 4.5.1. Electricity interconnectivity i. Current interconnection level and main interconnectors154 With the exception of Slovenia, the Hungarian electricity system is directly connected to all neighbouring countries. (See map showing the transmission network in Chapter 4.5.2.) Cross-border capacities are now available from 6 countries in a volume (NTC) corresponding to 85 % of annual consumption between 2015 and 2018, and to 62 % of maximum hourly consumption.                                                       154 With reference to overviews of the existing transmission infrastructure by the TSOs.  The capacity of high-voltage cross-border lines amount to approximately 50 % of the national gross installed capacity, significantly exceeding the 15 % EU target. The map in Chapter 4.5.2 shows voltage levels of interconnectors. The tables below summarise annual physical flows.

Projections of interconnector expansion requirements (including for the year 2030)155 Although Hungary significantly surpasses the EU interconnectivity target, expansion of interconnectivity is justified, as limited cross-border capacities from Austria and Slovakia limit cheaper electricity imports. (Positive and negative spreads alternate at other border points.) Due to limited capacities, the Hungarian annual average wholesale electricity price (day-ahead markets, hourly averages) has for years been higher than in neighbouring countries. Based on a broad comparison in Hungary's region, Hungarian wholesale prices are relatively high (Chapter 4.5.3). Construction of the Slovenian-Hungarian electricity interconnector is planned in the next years within the framework of PCIs.156 (See details in point i. of Chapter 2.4.2.) After construction of the Slovakian and Slovenian high-voltage transmission lines, the total capacity of cross-border high-voltage lines will reach 64 % of national gross installed capacities.                                                       155 With reference to national network development plans and regional investment plans of TSOs. 156 The line is expected to be entered into service at the end of 2021.  Point i. of Chapter Plan of the Hungarian Electricity System  international interconnection projects. Beyond the scope of the analyses performed within the framework of the Ten-year Network Development Plan referred to in point Hungarian electricity system MAVIR Zrt. is not planning an additional expansion of cross-border capacities. Based on the capacity calculations, with the development projects proposed in the ten-year network development plan, the international interconnections and transfer capacities of the Hungarian electricity system - in conformity with ENTSO-E requirements - allow the conducting of sufficient, secure and flexibly diversifiable commercial transactions, and do not limit electricity trade of a rational volume or the operation of the single electricity market. It is important to note that the Hungarian system operator, MAVIR Zrt., is working on integrating the 70 % minimum capacity referred to in Article 16(8) of Regulation (EU) 943/2019 on the internal market for rt of the Clean Energy Package, in the network development plan as a network development planning criterion. Based on the foregoing, other investments may also become necessary in the future; these will probably mainly be internal development projects. 4.5.2. Energy transmission infrastructure i.

The enforcement of the N-1 principle159 is the key requirement concerning the security of the transmission system, which means that the electricity system must be able to operate without interruption upon the contingency of a critical network element or a large power plant. Hungary is fully meeting the N-1 requirement. ENTSO-E applies the so-called remaining capacity indicator to measure the operational security of electricity systems. Remaining capacity corresponds to actually available capacity, less peak load and upstream system operator reserves. The required rate of remaining capacity varies for countries, typically between 5 % and 10 % of installed capacity. Based on the capacity of the largest domestic units, in Hungary the system operator takes into account gross 500 MW, corresponding to more than 5 % of installed capacity calculated on 1 January 2018. Originally only domestic generating capacities are considered for calculating remaining capacity. Thus, at certain times of the year Hungary would not only fall short of the required rate, but would even produce a negative capacity. Remaining capacity adjusted with the necessary export-import balance value, calculated in the manner referred to above, is in this case, by definition, sufficient even with the highest expected consumer demand. It may therefore be established that the draft of the power balance of the Hungarian electricity system  serving satisfaction of consumer demand  assuming higher consumer demand between February and December 2018 was met through the supply of 1 4003 400 MW in imports. The cross-border power line capacities necessary for imports were available. The periodically inadequate technical parameters of necessary reserves pose a risk in case of further high amounts of imports expected in the future.160                                                       158 http://mekh.hu/a-magyar-villamosenergia-rendszer-ver-2017-evi-adatai 159 Pursuant to the Network Code of MAVIR, by application of the N-ity system prevents both interruptions at customers during the single unavailability of the transmission network [upon failure of a system constituent], and the occurrence of overloading, voltage or frequency disturbances in the remaining operational netwo 160 Annual gross capacity plan of Mavir Zrt.  2019.

The system would be able to satisfy consumption significantly in excess of current demand. Hungary's interconnectivity with neighbouring markets is satisfactory. In theory it is possible to physically transfer more than 34 million m3 of natural gas daily from Hungary to its five neighbouring countries, while more than 82 million m3 of natural gas daily could be physically transferred from three neighbouring countries to Hungary.

Electricity and gas markets, energy prices i. Current situation of electricity and gas markets, including energy prices The energy sector is changing at an accelerating pace, posing growing challenges for both regulators and market participants. Owing to the spread of innovative technological solutions, the traditional, linear supply system will be replaced with a complex system difficult to centrally regulate, which accordingly requires substantial flexibility. The table below summarises trends with a major impact on main energy market trends.  Trends Characteristics    Based on international energy market forecasts, the next two decades will be characterised by electrification; the share of electricity within total energy consumption will increase, with a rise in electricity demand among the energy sources, which, however, will lead to the consumption of more climate-friendly electricity                                                       163 With reference to national network development plans and regional investment plans of TSOs. 164 https://www.mavir.hu/documents/10258/15454/HFT_2017.pdf/8826edb7-d17a-463e-8983-29b616337f76   Electrification (nuclear power and electricity produced from renewable energy sources). As the underlying cause, as a result of tightening climate policy measures and technological development, the consumption of electricity produced by more climate-friendly means will replace a growing share of energy consumption for transport and heating purposes through the spread of electromobility and the use of heat pumps, for example. The electrification of industrial processes  posing a more complex technological challenge  will also produce a substantial effect.  Sector coupling The convergence of energy systems (sector coupling) will intensify, involving the interconnection of the production processes of various forms of energy (electricity and heat, and fuels). The gas and electricity markets are already interconnected at a number of points. In the near future, however, sector coupling may also extend to new areas, such as the replacement of gas based heating and cooling with electricity based on renewable energy sources and heat pumps in regions with infrastructures with a low utilisation rate or which are not connected to the gas network. The convergence of energy systems is also supported by the development of energy storage technologies (e.g. battery, heat storage, power-to-gas technologies).   Decarbonisation The structure of electricity generation will also change; electricity generation from fossil fuels will gradually diminish, to be replaced with renewable forms of energy production with low GHG emission intensity. As a major challenge associated with the decarbonisation trend, however, weather-dependent renewables offer significantly variable capacities both an intraday and seasonal basis. For the above reason, more and more types of flexibility solutions will be needed in the future.    Decentralisation Supply based on the growing weight of renewable energy necessitates a completely different network structure. Large power plants will be replaced and/or supplemented with many smaller, decentralised production units that are commonly connected not to high-voltage networks, but to either distribution networks or operate as independent islands. The transformation not only affects the infrastructure, but classic consumer and producer roles will also change. Prosumers already exist, which not only consume but also operate as decentralised producers.         Digitalisation The capacity of the electricity grid is limited, therefore electricity supply must operate in complete harmony in real time with the demand of millions of consumers. Although the broad application of digital technologies is a major challenge, it also offers enormous opportunities for facilitating the interconnection of energy systems and energy market participants, including producers, network operators and consumers, and to enhance the intelligence, efficiency, reliability and sustainability of networks. In digitised energy systems, communication is faster between production, demand, storage and the network. It is easier to determine who needs energy where and at what time. The digitalisation of the systems can improve the efficiency of energy production, the transfer and distribution of energy, and also offers more opportunities and choices to consumers in determining their energy consumption. In the digital world of the 21st century a growing number of energy consumers expect accessible options  e.g. mobile applications, online administration  for administering their day-to-day affairs as fast and as efficiently as possible, reducing the time needed or without the need for personal administration to enable them to meet their needs with as little personal contact as possible. Table 34  Main trends of the energy transition Electricity market  A diversified national production portfolio and market integration are the two basic pillars of the current high level of the security of supply in the Hungarian electricity system. Installed capacities in the Hungarian electricity system, system peak load The gross installed capacity of power plants equalled 8 878.5 MW on 31 December 2018. Available capacity amounted to 7 415.9 MW. The table below provides details on installed and available capacities in 2018.

The largest participant on the Hungarian electricity market, the MVM Group, owes its dominant role mainly to the Paks Nuclear Power Plant. Its production portfolio includes other power plants; in 2018 this group accounted for more than one third (~37 %) of the base of Hungarian electricity generation, based on available capacity. Together with the other two larges~60 % of installed capacity in 2018. The share of the four largest market participants (the above three +  %. If we consider the companies of the MVM share of Uniper Hungary Kft.  holding the fourth largest amount of available capacity  was also high in comparison to the other companies, thus the share held by the four largest market participants exceed 55 % in the relevant year. In 2018 the Paks Nuclear Power Plant operated with the best utilisation rate (91.9 %). The Mátra Power Plant                                                       165 MAVIR ZRt. (2019): Data on the Hungarian electricity system (ES), 2018   % and 61.7 %, respectively. In 2018, the daily fifteen-minute peak of the annual and also winter gross system load was on 19 December. Its measured value equalled 6 869 MW at -6.8 °C average daily temperature. The summer daily peak load on 21 June equalled a registered value of 6 358 MW, with a 26 °C average daily temperature.166  Production, consumption, import dependency In the electricity supply of Hungary, base-load production is ensured by nuclear and lignite capacities. The gas-fired power plants capable of flexible operation play a key role in coordinating temporary fluctuations in demand and supply, and on the balancing market. Coal-fired production and gas-fired production in Hungary sharply declined in the 2000s and 2010s, respectively. This process was generally attributable to obsolete technology, high natural gas prices and the rgy production with low variable costs, as the production of temporarily or permanently shut down power plants was not competitive or  with a low utilisation rate  sustainable on the electricity market. The Hungarian supply structure, however, is not common in Europe. Imports play a key role in the capacity mix (~30 %). In Hungary there is essentially a structural demand for imports; during most of the year, domestic capacities  also considering balancing reserve demand  are insufficient for satisfying peak demand common in the period. Gas-fired power plants, with relatively high marginal costs, still account for a large share of domestic capacities, and play an important role on the balancing/regulation markets. Since coal and water capacities with a lower marginal cost are also available in neighbouring countries, there are also a significant quantity of imports  cheaper than domestic production  based on considerations of economy. The high import requirement is currently not causing short-term risks in the security of supply, as the cross-border capacities are strong even on an international scale. However, as noted in the Plan above, limited cross-border capacities from Austria and Slovakia limit cheaper electricity imports. (As regards price trends, the part of this chapter relating to wholesale prices is relevant.) As in most European and regional countries, renewable electricity production has increased in the past 10 years in Hungary as well. Among renewables, the rise in the burning of biomass/biogas was considerable; in addition to the use of household-scale PV panels, industrial scale PV power plants began to spread only in recent years. This strategy was favourable, as only relatively cost-effective renewable technologies were gaining ground, not entailing the rapid rise in support costs. The cost of PV electricity generation has                                                       166 https://www.mavir.hu/documents/10258/231457949/Havi+cs%C3%BAcsok+2001_2019_09HU_v1.pdf/e420b91f-533f- d9c0-2728-8de08aab6a7d  declined significantly, thus the market penetration of renewables is significantly increasing in Hungary. So far renewable capacities of 2 500-3 000 MW have been licensed, but an installed capacity of up to 5 000-10 000 MW may be realised by the end of the 2020s. As regards electricity generation it is important to note that today 62 % of domestic electricity is produced from GHG neutral sources, as the 11 % share of renewable resources is complemented with the roughly 51 % share of nuclear production.

As part of the Third Energy Package adopted by the EU in 2009, Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 prescribed the establishment of interconnected electricity markets. Initially only the Czech-Slovakian day-ahead market coupling operated in Hungary's region, which was joined by Hungary in September 2012 as a result of the Czech-Slovakian-Hungarian market coupling project, resulting in the launch of net transfer capacity (NTC) based day-ahead implicit allocation on the Hungarian-Slovakian border as well.

The core activity of the HUPX  reference pricing and exchange trading platform operation  effectively contributes to the development of the Hungarian electricity market. Based on its regulatory and approved trading framework, it contributes to strengthening the liquidity and improving the  efficiency of the Hungarian energy market, and also supports the flow of working capital within the sector on a regional level. Although the volume of intraday trading on the HUPX is continuously rising, the day-ahead market remains dominant; a larger share of renewables and/or an expansion of cross-border capacities would be needed for the intraday market to attain levels of Western European markets. The HUPX day-ahead market (DAM) had 58 members in 2018, with 12 founding members. In 2018, total traded quantity on the day-ahead market increased by 7.16 % (from 18 578 593.9 MWh to 19 908 782.4 MWh).

Natural gas market Consumption, production, imports and exports In 2018, 31 % of Hungarian primary energy demand was satisfied with natural gas. Hungarian natural gas consumption has been declining since 2005. The decline was initially attributable to energy efficiency projects launched in connection with significant gas price increases in 2006 and 2007 for final customers, and to the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009. Since the low measured in 2014, consumption has again been rising on account of economic stabilisation and relatively favourable price levels on the natural gas wholesale market since 2015. Annual natural gas consumption in Hungary fluctuated between 7.6 and 9 billion m3                                                       184 Available at: https://www.mavir.hu/web/mavir/havi-piac-jelentesek 185 http://mekh.hu/a-magyar-villamosenergia-rendszer-ver-2018-evi-adatai 186 www.mekh.hu  between 2014 and 2017187, reaching around 9.9 billion m3 188 in 2018.

Based on data of Eurostat and the Mining and Geological Survey of Hungary, the declining trend in domestic natural gas production is reversing: the volume of 1.6 billion m3 in 2015 increased to 1.73 billion m3 in 2018.

Hungarian imports are mainly supplied from the north. In 2018 (and in 2019) more than 70 % of gas is delivered through the entry point at Beregdaróc. The supply of gas from the west is restricted by limited capacities. Exports are essentially transits. Hungary conducts a large volume of transit flows to the east (toward Ukraine and Romania) and south (toward Serbia, Croatia). The figure below indicates gas trade.

Due to the uncertainty of Ukrainian transit deliveries, however, Hungarian gas storage facilities were used up to 100 % capacity before start of the 2019/2020 winter; the Hungarian system received a slightly larger                                                       190 The indicator shows whether supply can be ensured in case of the temporary, short-term loss of the largest import capacity.

Use of maximum capacity was necessary for two reasons: firstly, the difference in the winter and summer price of natural gas in Europe was high, thus it made sense for traders to buy; secondly, and more importantly, the gas transit agreement between Russia and Ukraine expired, and the Government was intent on approaching the current heating period by guaranteeing the security of gas supply, regardless of the outcome of relations between the two countries.

Table 36  Key data on Hungarian natural gas storage facilities Source: HEA The storage facilities significantly contribute to satisfying winter daytime consumption demand; based on data for January-March 2019, on average 40 % of consumption was satisfied with stored supplies, and this contribution could reach around 65 % for several days. Commercial natural gas storage facilities satisfy seasonal and short-term  daily and hourly  flexibility demands. Storage plays an important role in ensuring the system balance; its relevance in the security of supply is enhanced by the option of satisfying peak consumption demand and the physical availability of natural gas. Pursuant to the sectoral regulation of natural gas, on 1 October of each year the universal service provider must possess  directly or indirectly  natural gas reserves stored in Hungarian natural gas storage facilities corresponding to at least 60 % of highest winter consumption during the past 120 months.

Regional trends In recent years the largest share of natural gas imports  accounting for around two thirds of domestic consumption  is imported from Russia, but the remaining share on the Hungarian market is - on a molecular basis - also natural gas of Russian origin. As a major risk on the natural gas market, the future of the largest, Ukrainian supply route has become uncertain primarily for geostrategic reasons, and problems may also arise in connection with the technical condition of the Ukrainian transmission network. Currently the east-west direction of transmission is dominant in the Hungarian natural gas transmission system, which is also supported by the implemented natural gas transmission system. In the future, however, natural gas imports from Russia will not necessarily only arrive through Ukraine. If the Russian-Ukrainian situation escalates, the supply route through Ukraine may be replaced with entry from the south, which would necessitate additional investments for receiving larger volumes, reducing the flexibility of the natural gas transmission system. In case of transmission from the direction of Serbia, the cessation of demand for natural gas transits toward Serbia and ultimately to Bosnia and Herzegovina would entail additional costs. Storage demand linked to transits would also diminish. If gas is supplied to the region through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, Russian gas would reserve transfer capacities built for importing gas from the west at competitive prices into the region. Role of natural gas in electricity generation Natural gas-fired power plants play an important role in the supply of electricity in Hungary; beyond the Paks Nuclear Power Plant, natural gas-fired power plants play a key role. In 2017 electricity generated from natural gas accounted for approximately 25 %193 of total generated electricity. Its share steadily increased from 20.8 %194 in 2014 in parallel with the rise in gross domestic electricity production by around 9.6 %. As the main cause of the increase, while the global price of natural gas did not change significantly, electricity prices increased, which boosted revenues of natural gas-fired power plants. Owing to their fast dispatchability, natural gas-fired power plants in Hungary are mainly essential for ensuring dispatchable reserves for the electricity system and the uninterrupted operation of the electricity system. Operation of the Hungarian natural gas system Pursuant to the provisions of Act XL of 2008 on the supply of natural gas and Government Decree No 19/2009 of 30 January 2009 implementing Act XL of 2008 on the supply of natural gas, the                                                       193 MAVIR, Distribution of sources of Hungarian electricity generation in 2017. 194 Medium and long-term entry capacity increases of the Hungarian electricity system, 2015.  transmission system operator (FGSZ), natural gas storage facility licence holders and natural gas distributors operate an interconnected natural gas system. Ten regional distribution companies operate the natural gas distribution systems; five of these large companies carry out most of regional distribution. Storage is provided by two companies (Magyar Földgáztároló Zrt., MMBF Földgáztároló Zrt.). As a result of the natural gas market's liberalisation in 2004, the retail market is of a dual structure. Prices are determined by the market in the open market segment. Customers eligible for universal service may purchase natural gas at capped administrative prices.

Wholesale prices: The main achievement of capacity upgrades implemented in conformity with objectives defined in the National Energy Strategy, adopted in 2011, is ensuring availability of alternative gas sources beyond the Russian ones, implementation of import capacities not controlled by the Russian party and establishment of competition on the wholesale market. On the Hungarian gas market, gas products purchased by different traders from Russian sources and purchased on Western European exchanges are competing with each other.  Import diversification and the establishment of competition on the wholesale market has almost eliminated the competitive disadvantage of Hungarian gas customers compared to Western European customers since early 2014. In recent years the expansion of import opportunities and the availability of alternative trade routes significantly contributed to the decline in domestic gas prices: While gas cost 4-5 EUR/MWh more (based on border prices) on the Hungarian wholesale market than in Germany or Austria202 in 2012, the difference is now reduced to 13 EUR/MWh.203                                                       202 https://aegis.acer.europa.eu/chest/dataitems/51/view  203 https://aegis.acer.europa.eu/chest/dataitems/51/view    Figure 66  Supplier gas prices, 2012-2017  Source: ACER HU EN osztrák határár Austrian border price osztrák hub ár Austrian hub price cseh határár Czech border price német határár German border price magyar határár Hungarian border price szlovák határár Slovakian border price  During the past year spot gas prices significantly decreased on the CEEGEX and on major European markets.

Projections of development with existing policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) Electricity market Union regulation, Hungarian targets and energy policy priorities, and trends on international energy markets all point in the direction of electrification; as a result of tightening climate policy measures and technological development, the consumption of electricity produced by more climate-friendly means will replace a growing share of energy consumption for transport and heating purposes. Supply based on the growing weight of renewable energy and increasing consumption resulting from electrification necessitates a completely                                                       206 Note: CEGH: Central European Gas Hub (Austria).

The few large power plants will be supplemented with many smaller, decentralised production units that are commonly connected not to high-voltage transmission networks, but to medium- and low-voltage networks, and it will also be necessary to exploit dispatching capabilities available within the distribution networks (e.g. demand side response, energy storage). The number of household-scale PV systems connected to the grid is rapidly growing in parallel with the rise in electricity demand, thus consumers turned prosumers are becoming more active and conscious players on the market aiming to control their consumption and overhead costs. Availability of the adequate quantity and composition of capacities is key on the electricity market. The capacity analyses of MAVIR Zrt., its document entitled -term entry capacity increases of 210 in particular provide information relating to the above. Gas market and gas-based electricity generation Natural gas consumption has been declining in recent years mainly as a result of a sharp drop in natural gas demand necessary for electricity production. The role of natural gas in electricity generation was not replaced by other energy sources, but rather electricity imports displaced it among sources. This is presumably attributable to the fact that natural gas based electricity generation in Hungary is currently not competitive with imported electricity. The risk inherent to the reliable operation of the Hungarian electricity system is that the service life of a number of gas-fired power plants will expire in the 2020s, and substantial investments are needed to extend their service life. Based on the Ten-year Network Development Plan of FGSZ, the natural gas demand of customers supplied by distribution network operators is expected to stagnate. The demand of industrial consumers directly supplied by the natural gas transmission system is continuously growing, while the gas demand of power plant customers is expected to increase in a few years. Based on forecasts of Hungarian producers, without additional measures, annual net production in the period between the 2018/2019 and 2027/2028 gas years will drop from 1.835 billion m3/year to 0.633 billion m3/year, equalling a 1.202 billion m3/year decline; domestic production will decrease to 34.4 % of the current level (indicating an annual 1.2 billion m3 rise in import requirements by the end of the period). The plan also notes that with the approved upgrades, entry point capacities are expected to increase from 132.796 Mm3/day to 135.250 Mm3/day in the next 10 years. By the end of the reviewed period, entry capacity will increase by 20.454 Mm3/day over the baseline period and surplus entry capacity will increase from 18.453 Mm3/day to 29.450 Mm3/day, taking into account contracted transit demand. Also taking into account capacities increased with RO-HU phase II, Croatian medium-level, Slovenian and                                                       210 https://www.mavir.hu/documents/10258/15461/Forr%C3%A1selemz%C3%A9s_2018_IG.pdf/fc043982-a8ea-e49f-6061- 418b254a6391  Serbian entries at the entry points, entry point capacities are expected to increase from 132.796 Mm3/day to 170.370 Mm3/day in the next 10 years. By the end of the reviewed period, entry capacity will increase by 37.574 Mm3/day over the baseline period and surplus entry capacity will increase from 18.453 Mm3/day to 41.050 Mm3/day, taking into account contracted transit demand. -HU phase II entries, Croatian medium-level entries,  point capacities are expected to sharply decrease from the 2020/2021 gas year from 132.796 Mm3/day to 100.450 Mm3/day in the next 10 years (upon possible loss of entry from Ukraine). The decline is substantial notwithstanding that medium-level entry from Croatia was also taken into account, and delivery toward Ukraine and Serbia was not taken into account. Integration of electricity and gas markets The integration efforts still in progress facilitate the implementation of more efficient trade flows, the balancing of demand and supply side volatility between countries, and improve the security of supply. Market integration also supports maximising the cost-effectiveness of satisfying Hungarian electricity demand. Congestion, however, may arise both on the electricity and gas markets; this problem should be addressed with additional measures.
