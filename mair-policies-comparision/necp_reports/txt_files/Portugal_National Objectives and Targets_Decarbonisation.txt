NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 23   foment trans-border and inter-regional interconnections to achieve greater integration of the Iberian market/Iberian Peninsula with the rest of Europe, thus promoting the Energy Union and maximising existing European funding mechanisms. With the aim of meeting the challenge to incorporate renewable energies and the development of MIBEL, both governments reaffirmed the importance of the internal and external MIBEL interconnection.  1.2.4. Administrative structure for implementing national energy and climate policies  and energy policies, insofar as it allows not only the progress being achieved to be assessed but also ensures compliance with the commitments made at a Community level pursuant to the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Effort Sharing Regulation. On an international level, it ensures compliance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It is thus important to maximise already existing national monitoring structures, adapting them to this new and more integrated reality of energy and climate policies.  The National System for Policies and Measures (SpeM) will be used to this end, which was created by Council of Ministers Resolution No 56/2015 of 30 July 2015 and subsequently governed by Council of Ministers Resolution No 45/2016 of 26 August 2016, adapting it to include the monitoring of the policies, measures and forecasts that impact on energy transition. This system therefore promotes the debate, design and assessment of progress being made to implement the policies and measures that help reduce GHG emissions and assist in energy transition. This is in line with the targets set out at a national level in this integrated Plan, reinforcing the responsibility of the sectors to incorporate these dimensions into their sectorial policies. It also aims to help meet the monitoring, reporting and forecasting requirements set out in the Governance Regulation, which are largely derived from the requirements previously set out in Regulation (EU) 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 (MMR). Moreover, considering the existing synergies between climate and energy policies and policies and measures for Air, SPeM will continue to support monitoring as well as forecasts in this context. It will also ensure suitable coordination with the National Emissions Inventory System by Sources and Removal of Air Pollutants by Sinks (Sistema Nacional de Inventário de Emissões por Fontes e Remoção por Sumidouros de Poluentes Atmosférico - SNIERPA) and the monitoring and reporting system set out in the National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change (ENAAC 2020). A platform to monitor and report on the impact of the transversal and sectorial policies and measures concerning climate change and energy transition will also be developed, in conjunction with the sectors, by defining indicators and identifying the respective regulatory, financial and taxation instruments.  Governance Model Considering the strategic and transversal nature of energy transition, which has an impact on diverse levels of the economy and society, it is essential for the governance model to reflect the political commitment to this theme and to be implemented by means of effective action and support for progress in the transition. Thus, coherent coordination of the different components set out in this plan entails defining a system of governance, with suitable instruments, without prejudice to the specific competences assigned to the different sectors. The political effort invested in the transition to a competitive, resilient, low-carbon and circular economy which is fully integrated with the targets for economic growth resulted in the creation of the CA2 in 2015 of the NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 24   Inter-ministerial Commission for Air, Climate Change and the Circular Economy (CA2). This commission is presided over by the member of the government responsible for the environment, climate action and energy transition and includes representation by government departments in the sectors of energy, spatial planning, treasury, agriculture, the sea, the economy and innovation, transport, health, tourism, civil protection, regional development, local government, foreign affairs and cooperation, education and science and by representatives of the regional governments of the Azores and Madeira. This Commission provides policy guidelines with regard to climate change and air and also coordinates and integrates climate change policies in sector policies, while monitoring the implementation of the relevant sector measures, programmes and actions that are implemented. The specific competences of CA2 are set out in Official Order No 2873/2017 of 6 April 2017. These competences include the monitoring of compliance with commitments assumed by Portugal on a national and Community level and with regard to the United Nations, the promoting and monitoring of relevant national plans on climate change and circular economy, the validation of proposed policy options and measures with respect to mitigation, monitoring and support for establishing national positioning in international negotiations. Thus, once again using governing structures that already exist at a national level, this Commission will also monitor energy policy and sector policies impacting on national targets concerning air, climate change, circular economy and energy, considering the synergies between these themes. It will also promote, supervise and monitor NECP. To this end, the proposed model aims, firstly, to ensure a long-term political commitment, since the transition to a carbon neutral society is extremely relevant nationally and internationally and impacts on the economy and society, while also presenting an opportunity for Portugal. The governance model covers the following levels:  Figure 12 - Overview of the governance structure  Key PT EN COORDENAÇÃO POLÍTICA POLICY COORDINATION COORDENAÇÃO TÉCNICA SISTEMA DE ACOMPANHAMENTO E PROJEÇÕES TECHNICAL COORDINATION MONITORING AND PROJECTION SYSTEM Comissão para a Ação Climática (CAC) Commission for Climate Change (CAC) Grupo de Coordenação do PNEC PNEC Coordination Group Sistema Nacional de Política e Medidas (SPeM) The National System for Policies and Measures (SPeM)   The Commission for Climate Action is responsible for NECP policy coordination and will act as a structure to promote decision making on a politcy level. To this end it will be necessary to: (i) rename the CA28; (ii) determine that this Commission is responsible for promoting, supervising and monitoring NECP; (iii) update Official Order No 2873/2017 accordingly. Close coordination with other inter-ministerial commissions must be ensured, considering the importance of this theme for European development and funding policies, as well as to comply with national commitments for SDGs. This will thus ensure policy monitoring, while simultaneously defining priorities, validating responsibilities and setting implementation deadlines.                                                             8 Created by Council of Ministers Resolution No 56/2015 of 30 July 2015 (QEPiC) and amended by Council of Ministers Resolution No 190-A/2017 of 11 December 2017 (PAEC). Operational regulations approved by Official Order No 2873/2017 of 6 April 2017 by the Minister for the Environment.  NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 25   The Coordination Group will be responsible for the technical coordination of NECP and will coordinate and promote the preparation and revision of NECP complying with commitments made pursuant to the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and will facilitate the implementation of the policy guidelines set out in NECP. This group to coordinate NECP will be managed by the Portuguese Environmental Agency (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente, I.P. - APA) and by the Directorate-General for Energy and Geology (DGEG). To this end, it will be necessary to: (i) determine its formal creation and (ii) define its composition and competences. The system to monitor and prepare forecasts for NECP will be based on the current system (SPeM) created by Council of Ministers Resolution No 45/2016 of 26 August 2016 and aims: to involve and reinforce the responsibility of sectors to integrate climate aspects into sector policies; ensure accompaniment,  monitoring and reporting on the implementation of policies and measures and their effects, and reporting for forecasts of GHG emissions and otNECP and ENAR. For this purpose, the following will be necessary: (i) ensure greater dynamism among sectors, creating thematic groups that can meet autonomously, maintaining close coordination with Air Policies by providing greater autonomy; (ii) the coordination of each of the thematic groups will be shared between the NECP Coordination Group and the entity/entities with specific competences in the respective sector (coordinator of the thematic group  current SpeM focal point, other elements  the current SPeM involved entities); (iii) determine that SPeM is the system to monitor NECP policies, measures and forecasts; (iv) suitably adapt Council of Ministers Resolution No 45/2016 of 26 August 2016; (v) develop a reporting platform for transversal and sector policies and measures in conjunction with the sectors, identify the respective funding, regulatory, taxation and other instruments and build indicators and goals.   1.3. Consultations and involvement of national and EU entities and their outcome 1.3.1. Involvement of the national Parliament  Pursuant to the Constitution of the Republic of Portugal, the government is responsible, by means of its administrative competences, for carrying out all acts and implementing all measures necessary to promote socio-economic development and satisfy collective needs, which includes approving the National Energy and Climate Plan 2030. The National Energy and Climate Plan 2030 (NECP 2030) was approved by a majority in the Council of Ministers on 19 December 2019, by means of a Council of Ministers Resolution, which is awaiting publication. The national Parliament was involved with respect to the public consultation procedures that were held.   1.3.2. Involvement of local and regional powers  During the course of preparing NECP, meetings and consultations were held with delegations of entities from the Autonomous Regions of Madeira and the Azores pursuant to their autonomy and specific competences. At a local level, the respective entities participated in consultation processes associated with drafting the Plan.   1.3.3. Consultations with stakeholders, including social partners, and engagement of civil society NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 26   Institutional and civic participation was encouraged during the technical tasks of the process of preparing NECP and entities representing different sector interests actively cooperated in proceedings through diverse discussions of NECP in various locations around Portugal. This exercise benefited from the process of preparing the Roadmap for Carbon Neutrality 2050, which involved participatory dialogue with society. Various technical sessions were held with agents from the sector and a cycle of thematic sessions was organised in various locations around the country, focusing on transport (Porto), forestry (Pombal) energy (Lisbon) and fair transition (Lisbon). The entire process of preparing NECP  documents, images and videos of the various sessions  can be consulted on the website www.portugalenergia.pt, which will be constantly updated over the course of this process. Public presentation of NECP The process of broad participation while preparing NECP began with a public presentation of the main lines of action for the 2021-2030 period, which took place during a public session held on 28 January in Lisbon. This session was attended by a wide cross-section of stakeholders in this sector, higher education institutions and goals and targets for 2030, its vision for this time frame, strategic objectives and the main lines of action. Decentralised presentation sessions These sessions sought to disseminate the proposals set out in RCN and NECP and to foment debate around the challenges and opportunities they pose for society. Presentations were given in different parts of the country attended by members of the government, with emphasis on holding various sessions in higher education institutions. A total of five presentations were held between January and March 2018 (Coimbra, Porto, Évora, Faro and Funchal), which included a debate with the participation of diverse specialists from varied areas of energy and climate.  Figure 13 - Decentralised presentation sessions  Themed workshops  Thematic workshops were held with a view to discussing in further detail specific themes relevant to achieving goals and targets. The results obtained during these sessions were considered while preparing the current NECP proposal. NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 27    Thematic workshop on Energy efficiency and Energy Poverty (Lisbon, 18 March) This workshop was organised by the Energy Agency (Agência para a Energia  ADENE) and involved specialists from the energy and climate sectors as well as other specialists and representatives of stakeholders in sectors associated with the respective themes. Its main objective was to promote an in-depth discussion on the themes of energy efficiency for buildings and energy poverty, themes that are crucially important to ensure a fair, democratic and cohesive energy transition, creating conditions to achieve the targets set out for 2030 and ensuring carbon neutrality by 2050.  Thematic workshop on Research, Development and Innovation (Lisbon, 3 April) This workshop was organised in partnership with the National Laboratory for Energy and Geology, (Laboratório Nacional de Energia e Geologia - LNEG) and the Directorate-General for Energy and Geology (DGEG). It involved specialists from the energy and climate sectors as well as other specialists and representatives of stakeholders in sectors associated with the respective themes. Its main objective was to promote an in-depth discussion on the themes of Research, Innovation and Competitiveness, a vitally important theme to create the conditions to achieve the targets set out for 2030 and ensure carbon neutrality by 2050.  Thematic workshop on industry (Aveiro, 17 April) This workshop was organised in partnership with the Directorate-General for Energy and Geology (Direção Geral de Energia e Geologia  - DGEG), the Portuguese Environmental Agency (Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente - APA) and the Energy Agency (Agência para Energia - ADENE) and involved specialists from the energy and climate sectors, representatives of technological centres and associations connected with the field. Its main objective was to promote discussion on the theme of Industry, crucially important to create the conditions to achieve the targets set out for 2030 and to ensure carbon neutrality by 2050.  Public consultation After the round of presentations and thematic workshops was concluded, the results of which were incorporated into the current version of the document, a public consultation process was held between 7 May and 5 June 2019. After this process, 59 contributions were received from diverse sectors of the economy and society. These contributions were analysed and incorporated into the version of NECP presented herein.   Strategic environmental assessment To comply with Decree-Law No 232/2007 of 15 June 2007, which sets out the system to assess the effects of given plans and programmes on the environment, transposing Directive No 2001/42/EC of 27 June 2001 and Directive No 2003/35/EC of 26 May 2003 to national legislation, a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) was carried out for NECP 2030. The purpose of SEA is to support the decisions made with regard to the plan, by identifying, describing and assessing its strategic environmental effects, so as to determine opportunities and risks for sustainable development. SEA is based on identifying factors that are critical for making decisions, by which the aspects that are most important and relevant to national territory are analysed and assessed in terms of the environment and sustainability, encompassing the sectors included in NECP. This process began by preparing the Scope Definition Report (SDR) and the respective procedures for consulting with the Entities with Specific Environmental Responsibilities (ESER), pursuant to Decree-Law No 232/2007. Sixteen entities were consulted during this process between 9 July and 9 August 2019 and inputs were obtained NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 28   from 9 entities9: APA, DGT, ANMP, CCDR Centro, CCDR LVT, GPP, IAPMEI, ICNF and IMT. An Environmental Report (ER) and the respective non-technical summary were prepared based on these inputs and these documents were similarly submitted to the aforesaid 16 ESER and were made available for public consultation between 7 October and 28 October 2019. Seven replies were submitted in relation to ESER contributions to the consultations, namely, from APA, IMT, GPP, DG Território, CCDR Algarve, CCDR Alentejo and DGAE. Five entities participated in the public consultation process.   1.3.4. Consultations with other Member States  Consultations with other Member States were conducted through the regional cooperation mechanisms set out in Chapter 1.4 of this plan. It should also be noted that some of the topics with greater trans-border relevance covered by this plan have been discussed with more relevant Member States, particularly Spain and France, in forums such as the High-Level Group (HLG) in relation to interconnections in Southwest Europe. The Luso-Spanish Summit in Valladolid was also important for strategic commitments in matters which are relevant to NECP, more specifically with respect to interconnections, MIBEL and strategies to comply with the Paris Agreement. The Lisbon Summit, held in July 2018 (2nd Interconnection Summit) between Portugal, Spain, France and the European Commission, is equally of note in this regard. Consultation is currently underway with Spain in relation to the current version of NECP. A request has already been made to provide the final version of the Spanish NECP for consultation purposes.   1.3.5. Iterative process with the European Commission  Since 2015, Portugal has actively participated in the European Commission Technical Working Group on Integrated National Energy-Climate Plans (TWG NECP), maintaining open communication with the European Commission and other Member States. Through the status updates at the meetings of this Working Group and the quarterly questionnaires, Portugal kept the European Commission regularly informed of work underway to develop the National Plan. Of note with regard to this working group more recently was the holding last September of the bilateral meetings on energy efficiency and renewable energies. Portugal has also participated on a technical level in the Special Groups, JRC-IDEES (Joint Research Centre Integrated Database on the European Energy System) and POTEnCIA model (Policy-Oriented Tool for Energy and Climate Change Impact Assessment), thus contributing to the ongoing improvement of the database and to the improvement of assumptions and fine tuning of the projection models developed by these groups. As part of the initiative of the European Semester promoted by the COM, a COM delegation was received in November 2019 to discuss a number of topics associated with preparing NECP. Another COM delegation was also received in the same month and two meetings were held with this delegation, one with the DGEG team and the other with the Portuguese Environment Agency (APA) team, to discuss topics concerning the preparation and contents of the final version of NECP.                                                             9 Portuguese Environmental Agency (APA); Directorate-General for Territorial Planning (DGT); Foundation for Science and Technology; Entity for Public Administration Shared Services (eSPap); Department of Planning, Policies and General Administration (GPP); Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation (IAPMEI); Institute for the Conservation of Nature and Forests (ICNF); Institute for Habitation and Urban Rehabilitation (IHRU); Institute for Mobility and Transport (IMT); Directorate-General for Economic Activities (DGAE); Commission for Regional Coordination and Development for Northern Portugal (CCDR Norte); Commission for Regional Coordination and Development for Central Portugal (CCDR Centro); Commission for Regional Coordination and Development for Lisbon and the Tagus Valley (CCDR LVT); Commission for Regional Coordination and Development for the Alentejo Region (CCDR Alentejo); Commission for Regional Coordination and Development for the Algarve Region; (CCDR Algarve); and the National Association of Portuguese Municipalities (ANMP)  NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 1. Overview and process 29    1.4. Regional cooperation in preparing the plan 1.4.1. Aspects subject to joint planning or coordination with other States  Pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, Portugal participated in two initiatives aimed at promoting regional cooperation. The first initiative was promoted by the French Government, in which Portugal participated along with other nations, including Switzerland, in a session to present the French NECP. It also provided an opportunity to discuss themes associated with defining the plans, based on the NECP that was presented. The second initiative was promoted by the Spanish Government, in which both Portugal and France participated in a meeting where the parties presented their NECPs and the discussions centred on the internal energy market and energy security, especially in relation to energy interconnections.   1.4.2. Explanation of how regional cooperation is considered in the plan  In addition to that mentioned in point 1.4.1, it is important to note that Portugal, as part of foreign policy has promoted numerous interactions with neighbouring Member States, particularly with Spain, at this initial stage of the NECP development process so as to ensure a suitable level of involvement and agreement in areas of cooperation. Therefore, some of the topics with greater trans-border relevance covered by this plan have been discussed with more relevant Member States, particularly Spain and France, in forums such as the High-Level Group (HLG) in relation to interconnections in Southwest Europe. The Luso-Spanish Summit in Valladolid was also important for strategic commitments in matters which are relevant to NECP, more specifically with respect to interconnections, MIBEL and strategies to comply with the Paris Agreement. At this summit, and with particular relevance for regional cooperation, the importance of the Iberian Working Group on Renewable Energies was reiterated, as a contribution to promoting joint work by both countries in relation to energy transition. Also, of note in this regard was the 2nd Interconnections Summit, which resulted in the signing of the Lisbon Declaration by Portugal, France, Spain and the European Commission, with a view to reinforcing regional cooperation for the Energy Union and better integrating the Iberian Peninsula into the internal energy market. At this summit, the three countries agreed on a series of common guidelines with respect to energy and climate policy. 30 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 2. objectives and targets   2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 2.1. Dimension Decarbonisation 2.1.1. Objectives relating to GHG emissions and removals  i. The Member State's binding national target for GHG emissions and binding national annual limits under Regulation (EU) No 2018/842 Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on   binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement (known as the Effort Sharing Regulation), a goal was set for the Union stipulating a 30% reduction in its GHG emissions by 2030, as compared to 2005 levels, in the sectors that are not covered by the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (non-ETS). its GHG emissions by at least 17% as compared to its GHG emissions in 2005 and has committed to this goal at a Community level in non-ETS sectors.  Table 4- Target for the reduction of CO2eq emissions in the non-EU ETS sector (without LULUCF) with respect to 2005  2020 2030 National contribution to Union targets (non-ETS sectors) +1% -17%   Thus, for the period between 2021 and 2030, despite the flexibility envisaged in the Effort Sharing Regulation, Portugal must ensure that its GHG emissions in each year do not exceed the limit defined for the linear trajectory set out in the following table.  Table 5- Emissions limit in non-ETS sectors (Mt) 10  2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Emissions limit in non-ETS sectors   41.01  41.01  41.01  41.01  41.01  41.01  41.00  41.00  41.00  41.00  41.00   ii.  Regulation (EU) No 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry in the 2030 climate and energy framework (known as the LULUCF Regulation) set out commitments for Member States for the land use sector, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) that also contribute toward achieving the objectives of the AP and the Union goal of reducing GHG emissions for the 2021-2030 period.                                                              10 The indicative trajectory of emissions is estimated pursuant to Article 4(2) of the Effort Sharing Regulation, using the following values for the indicated years: (i) 2005: total emissions of 85.82 Mt (emissions inventory submitted to the UNFCCC in May 2019); (ii) 2005: emissions from non-ETS sectors of 49.39 Mt (considering the value of verified ETS emissions of 2005 of 36.43 Mt); (iii) 2016: emissions from non-ETS sectors of 41.57 Mt (pursuant to compliance with the Effort Sharing Decision); (iv) 2017: emissions from non-ETS sectors of 40.19 Mt (pursuant to the estimate for compliance with the Effort Sharing Decision); (v) 2018: total emissions of 67.54 Mt (proxy of the emissions inventory submitted to the European Commission in July 2019); (vi) 2018: emissions from non-ETS sectors of 41.28 Mt (considering the value of verified ETS emissions in 2018 of 26.25 Mt).  31 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 2. objectives and targets    Thus, for the period between 2021 and 2030, despite the flexibility allowed by the LULUCF Regulation, Member States are required to ensure that emissions from the LULUCF sector do not surpass the removals of the : a) forest area sinks planted in the last 20 years; b) emissions of areas that have been deforested in the last 20 years; c) sinks or emissions from managed forests, accounted for according to the forest reference level; d) sinks or emissions of the areas under agriculture and pasture, accounted for according to their levels in 2005-2007; e) sinks or emissions of the areas under humid zones and water bodies (from 2026 onward), accounted for according to their levels in 2005-2007. Similarly, pursuant to the approved system, the LULUCF and non-ETS regulations envisage the possibility of joint compliance, whereby possible excess emissions in the LULUCF sector can be offset by the reduction of additional emissions in the non-ETS sector and, in an opposite direction, the LULUCF sink can be used to offset non-ETS emissions, although in this case it is subject to a quantitative maximum, i.e. a maximum volume of offsetting provided for a Member State for 2021 to 2030, which in the case of Portugal will be 6.2 million tonnes equivalent of CO2. At present, Portugal does not anticipate using this flexibility nor the need to offset emissions between the LULUCF sector and non-ETS sector or vice-versa. Emission credits for these sectors are also not expected to be acquired or sold. In December 2018, Portugal submitted its draft to the European Commission concerning its forestry reference level for the 2021-2025 period. This was assessed by the Commission and experts from Member States, resulting in a series of suggestions and recommendations. The revised version of the original proposal is currently being prepared and will be submitted by 31 December 2019. It is expected to be implemented in the first half of 2020.   iii. Other national objectives and targets consistent with the Paris Agreement and existing long-term strategies Other objectives and targets, including sector targets and adaptation goals, which contribute to the overall commitment by the Union to reduce GHG emission Notwithstanding the aforesaid commitments made at a community level, achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 means a significant reduction of emissions, based on a trajectory of reducing -45% to -55% by 2030, -65% to -75% by 2040 and -85% to -90% by 2050, as compared to 2005 levels. This represents a series of truly transformational challenges in the way how some of the most decisive aspects of life in society are viewed, particularly in relation to production and consumption patterns, relationships with the generation and use of energy, how cities and living, working and leisure spaces are designed and the how we get from one place to another and view mobility needs. Thus, for the time frame set out in this current Plan, the following national goals are also important. T Table 6- National target for the reduction of CO2eq emissions (without LULUCF) with respect to 2005  2020 2030 Other national targets -18% to -23% -45% to -55% 32 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 2. objectives and targets   The following figure shows the trajectory to reducing total GHG emissions for the 2030 horizon, in keeping with the commitment to be carbon neutral by 2050.  Figure 14  Evolution in GHG emissions and established reduction targets for the 2030 horizon (Mt CO2e)             Key  PT EN Histórico Historic Redução  55% face a 2005 Reduction  55% over 2005 Redução -45% face a 2005 Reduction -45% over 2005  As has been mentioned, the evolution of national emissions in different carbon neutral trajectories indicates highly significant decarbonisation of the national economy for the 2030 horizon and as such, it will be necessary to ensure that the various sectors of activity contribute toward this target. In this sense, all sectors have the potential to reduce emissions, although it is not the same for all sectors and GHG, in large measure, depend on the degree of maturity of the technologies and cost-effectiveness. Thus, it is expected that decarbonisation will be more accentuated over the next decade in the generation of electricity and the transport and building sectors. The following national goals were jointly defined on a sector level for the 2030 horizon (non-ETS sectors).  Table 7- National sector targets for the reduction of CO2e emissions with respect to 2005  2020 2030 Services -65% -70% Residential -14% -35% Transport -14% -40% Agriculture -8% -11% Waste and Wastewater -14% -30% 33 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 2. objectives and targets   Figure 15  Evolution in GHG emissions by sector and established reduction targets for the 2030 horizon (Mt CO2eq)   Key PT EN Resíduos e águas residuais Waste and wastewater Agricultura Agriculture Transportes Transport Residencial Residential Serviços Services Indústria Industry Energia Energy  2.1.2. Objectives relating to renewable energy sources.  i. Contribution to the binding target of the Union of a minimum of 32% in renewable energy by 2030, as the share of energy from renewable sources in final gross energy consumption in 2030. With regard to renewable energy, Portugal has strong arguments to continue to build a strategy based on d determination the energy share of renewable sources in gross final energy consumption is one of the most ambitious at a European level. Table 8- Indicative trajectory and contribution of Portugal to the binding Union target of 2030  2020 2022 2025 2027 2030 Renewables in gross final energy consumption11 31%. 34%. 38%. 41%. 47%.  e gross final energy consumption for 2030 reflects two essential aspects: i) the path it has already traversed in promoting RSE, which has made Portugal a leader at a European level; ii) the existing potential. In particular, the main drivers were defined to achieve a 47% share for renewables in final energy consumption by 2030, with emphasis on the electrification of the economy and consumption, the evolution of installed capacity and the generation of electricity from renewable sources, increased penetration of electric vehicles and other solutions for sustainable mobility, the introduction of renewable gases and highly-efficient technologies in various sectors, research and innovation/maturing of alternative technologies to reduce costs.                                                             11 The indicative trajectory of the evolution of renewable energy in Portugal pertains to the reference points set out in the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, more precisely Article 4(a)(2), which states that by 2022, 2025 and 2027 the indicative trajectory must achieve the reference points of at least 18%, 43% and 65% of the total increase of the energy share of renewable sources between the binding national goal for 2020 and for 2030.  34 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 2. objectives and targets   The following figure shows the trajectory in the share of renewable energy sources in gross final energy consumption for the 2030 horizon. Figure 16  Evolution in the share of renewable sources in gross final energy consumption for the 2030 horizon     ii. Estimated trajectories for the sector share of renewable energy in final energy consumption between 2021 and 2030 in the electricity, heating and cooling and transport sectors On a sector level, to comply with the overall RSE goal and based on the principal drivers that have already been defined to achieve this goal, the following national goals and targets were defined for the 2030 horizon.  Table 9- Estimated trajectories for the sector share of renewable energy in final energy consumption for the 2030 horizon  2020 2025 2030 Electricity 60% 69% 80% Heating and Cooling 34% 36% 38% Transport 10% 13% 20%   In relation to the Electricity sector, there will be strong emphasis on electrifying the consumption associated with decarbonising production by reinforcing the use of renewable energies, with particular focus on solar and onshore/offshore wind technologies, while promoting distributed production and storage, reinforcing and optimising transport and distribution networks and promoting pilot projects (concentrated photovoltaic, stimulated geothermal and wave power). As has been mentioned, Portugal also has enormous potential to use endogenous resources to produce electricity and thus, to ensure compliance with the goals, the objective for the electricity sector includes reinforcing exploration of this potential.35 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 2. objectives and targets   Figure 17 - Evolution in the share of energy from renewable sources in electricity for the 2030 horizon     In this context, in relation to the generation of electricity, the following aspects are particularly worthy of note:  Hydroelectric Reinforce the use of national potential for hydroelectricity, namely, by concluding the construction of the Alto Tâmega hydroelectric complex, consisting of three hydroelectric facilities  Gouvães (with pumping), Alto Tâmega (turbine) and Daivões (turbine)  that together represent 1.2 GW of new capacity and will similarly contribute toward improving supply security due to its pumping capacity. In the Autonomous Region of Madeira, reinforcing the use of hydroelectric potential will include expanding the Calheta hydroelectric plant. Onshore wind energy Portugal also has significant potential for wind power that has yet to be explored, while it is simultaneously important to pay attention to existing wind farms, providing them conditions to be more competitive. To this end, the strategy to reinforce onshore wind energy will include new equipment and repowering, creating the necessary conditions to make these options viable. Solar Photovoltaic  A steep fall in the cost of technology and the extraordinary national potential to use the sun as a source to produce electricity mean that this will be a fundamental technology to meet targets. The two main instruments that will be used to accelerate the development of solar capacity in Portugal will be: (i) auctions to allocate network injection capacity and (ii) possibility of promoters to develop network expansions along with the network operator in situations where there is no reception capacity (ideally for large scale projects).  Applying a logic of complementarity with centralised energy generation instruments, the promotion and dissemination of decentralised energy generation from renewable energy sources and energy communities are particularly relevant and will increase very significantly in the next decades. Biomass Forestry biomass is an important endogenous resource and hence using it for energy is one of the solutions that will contribute toward creating value in the forestry sector. However, using new thermoelectric power plants to exclusively generate electricity will tend to be abandoned, as it is not particularly efficient and has a low rate of return, which makes it necessary to have a guaranteed tariff with positive discrimination (above the market price) to recover associated investments. Geothermal The Autonomous Region of the Azores has the potential to reinforce its use of geothermal resources and the installed capacity could be increased with a view to achieving maximum production from available resources. Support could also be provided for pilot projects involving deep-sea geothermal energy, considering the reduced cost of drilling and the fact that it is a relatively easy technology to generate electricity. Concentrated  Solar Thermal Pilot projects will be promoted based on concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) technologies as a technology that makes it possible to store energy. 36 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 2. objectives and targets    Offshore wind energy Promoting and using the infrastructure being created near Viana do Castelo, where investments have already commenced, with a view to achieving (in the first phase) 200 MW of new capacity, 25 MW of which has already been allocated to the Windfloat project. This investment aims to encourage national and international investors to maximise this infrastructure to promote offshore wind energy. Waves been initiated to expand the Ocean Economy, namely the installed capacity for wave power. Hybrid systems Promoting hybrid systems will provide greater flexibility for the system and greater efficiency using resources, considering the possibility of complementarity between forms/sources of energy (e.g. wind and solar), while simultaneously maximising the network connection capacity. Coal Electricity generation using coal is expected to be phased out by closing the two power plants that are currently operating in mainland Portugal  Pego and Sines  which will be permanently closed at the end of 2021 and 2023, respectively. Natural gas Will play an important role in the transition to an energy system based on renewable sources, functioning as a backup for the electricity-generation system, remaining in the system for the next two decades. A gradual reduction in its use is expected in the medium to long-term.   In relation to the Heating and Cooling sector, the role of fuel consumption in this sector is expected to reduce as energy efficiency measures and the electrification of consumption is reinforced. In this regard, it will be possible to increase the percentage of renewable energy through the greater use of biomass and renewable gases.  It is important to note that after the analysis carried out while preparing NECP, Portugal is one of the countries of the European Union where it may not be possible to increase the share of renewable sources of energy by 1.3% or 1.1% per year, as set out in Directive (EU) 2018/2001. However, considering that renewable gases, such as biomethane and hydrogen could play a more relevant role for the 2030 horizon, this perspective could change in the short to medium-term, after a more in-depth analysis of the potential of renewable gases in Portugal, which will take place over 2020-2021. Similarly, for the first time it was possible to account for the total contribution of renewable energy heat pumps in gross final energy consumption and therefore, during modelling, it was not possible to include data for heat pumps in this plan in the same way as they were accounted for to calculate the contribution of renewables in gross final energy consumption for the heating and cooling sector. This is why there is a difference between the historic data (2005-2018) and forecasts for this sector. This aspect will be revised in the updated version of NECP, which will be submitted to the COM at the end of 2024, to achieve higher levels of the incorporation of renewables in the heating and cooling sector. Figure 18 - Evolution in the share of energy from renewable sources in heating and cooling for the 2030 horizon  37 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 2. objectives and targets   Increasing the incorporation of renewables in the heating and cooling sector and thus complying with the goals for this sector will include:  Biomass: Forestry biomass is an important endogenous resource and as such, its use for energy is one of the solutions that will contribute toward creating more value in the forestry sector. The strategy includes decarbonising existing thermal consumption and promoting energy efficiency, namely by promoting the installation of small decentralised biomass thermal power plants (e.g. cogeneration), on a small scale, which does not place as much pressure in terms of availability of biomass and on the energy system. High-efficiency cogeneration High-efficiency cogeneration using renewable sources of energy makes it possible to achieve significant energy savings, being used preferably in industries that consume energy intensively. New studies on potential will seek to determine energy needs precisely that can be satisfied in a circular economy and identify economic and legislative barriers. Renewable gases Renewable gases, particularly biomethane and hydrogen, are a viable alternative for substituting fossil fuels in the heating and cooling sector. The renewable gases regulation and their introduction into networks transporting and distributing natural gas will make a significant contribution. Heat pumps In the residential and services buildings sector, along with other efficient solutions, heat pumps are one of the most efficient forms of heating and cooling, contributing toward increased comfort and reinforcing the electrification of consumption. Solar thermal In buildings, solar thermal energy will coexist with other technologies that have great potential and efficiency, such as biomass boilers and heat pumps. It will nonetheless continue to play a significant role in heating hot water and, along with other efficient solutions, is one of the most efficient forms of heating spaces and water, contributing toward increased comfort. In the case of industry, the capacity to satisfy low/medium-temperature heat requirements will grow substantially. Urban thermal networks Based on the studies and analyses that have been carried out, it was felt that this is not a good are not envisaged in the next decade.  With respect to the Transport sector, there will be an emphasis on sustainable mobility and the decarbonisation of energy consumption, the promotion and reinforcement of public transport, emphasising complementarity and modal coordination, a strong push for electric mobility, the promotion of more energy efficiency measures, which have a greater impact, and the promotion of advanced biofuels and hydrogen. Figure 19 - Evolution in the share of energy from renewable sources in transport for the 2030 horizon  38 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 2. objectives and targets   Increasing the incorporation of renewable energy in the transport sector and thus ensuring compliance with the goal for this sector will include:  Electric mobility Electric mobility, with particular emphasis on road transport, will be fundamental to ensure the progressive substitution of fossil fuels and promote greater incorporation of renewable sources in energy consumption. The introduction of electric vehicles will be promoted and supported and the charging infrastructure will be reinforced at various levels. Advanced biofuels and Hydrogen Advanced biofuels and hydrogen are an alternative solution and a complementary measure to electric mobility, particularly for the long-distance heavy goods road transport sector, heavy road passenger transport and passenger rail transport, the maritime freight sector and aviation, to leverage the decarbonisation of consumption and promote increased consumption of renewable sources of energy.   iii.
