INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 55   2.4 Internal Energy Market Dimension  Overview of key objectives:  ensure additional financial, human and technical resources to accelerate integrated development and management of the electricity distribution network for increased capacity, resilience to disruption, future development potential, connectivity and adaptability, thus enabling the exploitation of the flexibility of resources and loads, the integration of heat pumps, the accelerated deployment of e-mobility, the integration of renewable electricity generation and storage devices,  establish a development-oriented regulatory framework for determining the number of network charges for the transition to a climate-neutral society,  support the development of an efficient and competitive market to take full advantage of the flexibility of the electricity system and new technologies,  support for cross-sector integration and implementation of new cross-sector system services,  promote development and research cooperation between companies within and outside the sector,  ensure further development of the pipeline system in line with gas flows and system capacity, including new sources of renewable and waste gas,  prepare a regulatory and supportive environment for alternative renewable gas sources in the natural gas network and at the same time analyse and determine the maximum permissible fraction of hydrogen in the natural gas network,  support the implementation of pilot projects for the production of synthetic methane and hydrogen (an indicative target of 10% renewable methane or hydrogen in the transmission and distribution network by 2030),  ensure appropriate conditions to store and use as much renewable energy as possible, when and where necessary, and maximise the capacity of renewable generating facilities,  enable energy poverty to be mitigated and reduced by accelerating the implementation of social policy measures, general housing policy measures and existing targeted measures.  2.4.1 Electricity interconnectivity Slovenia's long-term goal is to continue to improve electricity connectivity in the region. Slovenia's electricity interconnectivity was 83.6% in 2017, with Slovenia well above the 10% target for 2020 and the 15% target for 203058.  2.4.2 Electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure Electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure The current development plan does not satisfy the expected additional needs in the area of electricity distribution. To achieve its ambitious energy and climate policy targets, Slovenia will ensure better conditions for the accelerated development of the electricity distribution network, which is the basis for the future transition to a climate-neutral society and                                                            58  State of the Energy Union  Slovenia, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta- political/files/energy-union-factsheet-slovenia_en.pdf. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 56   enables the accelerated integration of renewable energy generation facilities, the adaptation of production and consumption, increased connectivity and the integration of heat pumps and other elements behind the metering point, as well as fulfilling requirements associated with the expedited deployment of e-mobility. The objective is to increase capacity, resistance to disruption and future development potential and exploit electricity distribution network source and load flexibility in accordance with the sustainable needs of distribution system users. To ensure support for the operation of the electricity distribution network and development of the internal electricity market, appropriate development of telecommunications infrastructure will also be important, so it will be necessary to set up networks for the provision of machine-to-machine (M2M) communications for distribution telecommunications infrastructure for the entire territory of Slovenia. The deployment of smart grids in the electricity distribution system requires accelerated digitisation of the distribution electricity network and the provision of new services, including on the distribution and transmission network, which will require an appropriate number of professional staff and technical means to manage, develop and maintain a modern distribution network. Integration of the distribution and transmission systems and the establishment of a single platform for monitoring and insight into the current production and consumption of Slovenia's electricity at all times will be essential. Natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure Slovenia will ensure further development of the gas pipeline system in line with gas flows and the use of the system, including new sources of renewable gas and waste gas59. Based on an analysis of the envisaged infrastructure projects, it is estimated that the N-1 infrastructure standard will range between 65.6% and 75.0% over the next five years. In the longer term, we estimate that the transmission system operator can ensure the development of the N-1 infrastructure standard for the Slovenian transmission system with a connection to Hungary and/or an additional connection to Italy. About 30% of natural gas is supplied to final customers through the natural gas distribution network in 83 local communities (out of 212). The development potential of existing and new natural gas distribution networks lies primarily in ensuring the supply of renewable gas. The development and possible expansion of distribution networks is thus linked to the development and provision of alternative gases in the natural gas network. An important new use of distribution networks is to ensure the supply of motor vehicles with natural gas and, subsequently, with alternative gas, which will help to increase the share of renewable sources in transport. Decarbonisation of the natural gas supply The goal of the NEPN is to establish technical, legislative and incentive conditions for facilitating the decarbonisation of the natural gas supply in Slovenia. To this end, we will prepare a regulatory and support environment for alternative gas in the natural gas network, while analysing and determining the maximum permissible hydrogen content of the natural gas network. Efforts are being made to replace as much as possible fossil methane with alternative gases in the natural gas network (10% target by 2030), which will be produced in Slovenia or imported respecting the system of guarantees of origin. In accordance with EU legislation, the market for alternative renewable gases will be developed. Decarbonisation of the natural gas supply will be achieved by replacing natural gas with renewable gases:                                                            59  Transmission System Operator Development Plan for 2020-2029, available at: https://www.agen--2029/53c79c54-ced1-49fc-8225-3ab7693dd783.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 57   1. hydrogen - produced by electrolysis of water using excess renewable electricity (sector coupling), 2. synthetic methane - produced by CO2 or CO hydrogen methanation in catalytic or biological methanation reactors, in which hydrogen, CO and CO2 are obtained by means of the gasification of organic materials, using the hydrogen mentioned in point 1 and CO2 recovered from pollution sources, 3. biomethane  methane obtained from the gasification of wood biomass or from biogas produced by the decomposition of organic substances such as slurry, crop residues and plant material, municipal effluent in sewage treatment plants, etc., under anaerobic conditions in fermenters (digesters), since, because of its composition, biogas is not suitable for injection into the pipeline network (it may contain up to 50% of CO2 and, in smaller concentrations, other impurities). Sector integration The integration of the various energy sectors, in particular the integration of the electricity, gas and district heating and cooling sectors. will be crucial for the successful achievement of energy and climate objectives. To this end, we will ensure appropriate technical capacity for the conversion of renewable electricity60 into renewable gas, hydrogen or synthetic methane and heat (power-to-gas and power-to-heat). This will allow the seasonal storage of renewable energy in the form of methane, including in warehouses in neighbouring countries. If necessary, it will be possible to store renewable gases for a short time only or to offset briefer fluctuations in intraday consumption (in transmission pipeline storage facilities, heat storage tanks, etc.), which are made possible by the gas pipeline system and district heating systems to a greater extent than the electricity system. Thanks to energy conversion, the construction of the electricity and gas pipelines will be optimised, since the most appropriate network in any given conditions can be used for energy transmission. This helps reduce the costs of investments for the transition to a climate-neutral society. The increased volume of renewable electricity production will have a significant impact on the functioning and integration of energy markets, where, due to greater fluctuations in unpredictable production, it will be necessary to provide efficient market-based instruments to develop flexibility and necessary new energy services. By converting and storing surplus electricity to gas fuels and heat, we will link the gas, heat and electricity sectors to achieve synergistic effects and bring down energy prices. A national approach to integrating thermal infrastructure and integration into other sectors at the local and national level will need to be shaped.                                                               60  In this period possibly also surplus conventional electricity.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 58   2.4.3 Market integration The electricity and natural gas market in Slovenia is open and liberalised. Wholesale and retail electricity market The long-term goal of the NEPN is to continue to open up the electricity market in Slovenia without regulatory restrictions. Slovenia will continue to actively support activities in the area of market integration and merger to optimise the capacity of existing interconnectors for trading. Slovenia is one of the leading countries in this field and already has coupled day-ahead markets with Italy, Austria and Croatia. Slovenia achieves the 70% criterion for the availability of cross-border transmission capacities at all borders, and the exemption is likely to apply only to the Italian border, harmonised throughout the northern Italian border. Slovenia has no regulated prices in the area of electricity, except for the price of the last resort supply, performed by the distribution operator for customers if requested. This price should be higher than the market price but not by more than 20%. The purpose of this arrangement is to divert customers to a contract with a selected supplier at market price. Slovenia has completed the coupling of daily and intra-day markets with all its neighbours (Italy, Austria, Croatia). It is already linked to a common Central European daily market. The Central European Common Market is also linked to the intra-day market, except at the border with Italy. Long-term trading for transfer across Slovenian borders is carried out in a common Central European auction house. Once established, the same mechanisms will be used on the connection with Hungary. The daily and intra-day markets are projected to shift to flow-based cross-border capacity calculation in line with the joint development of this mechanism. In this area, Slovenia is not behind EU trends but is even maintaining a position at the forefront, the aim being to continue to participate in advanced mechanisms. The Exchange in Slovenia operates successfully and successfully operates as a Nominated Electricity Market Operator (NEMO). The share of energy exchanged on the stock exchange is high due to the large share of imports and exports in relation to energy consumed or produced in Slovenia. The daily and intra-day markets give a good price signal. The derivatives market is also under way. Part of the system services is already supplied by a response aggregator. In line with EU law, we will continue to develop solutions that allow system users to be able to offer their services through independent aggregators as well. The final introduction of advanced meters is planned by 2025. At the same time, a system for capturing and storing data and the advanced connectivity of elements behind the measuring point with those in front is being developed. In order to increase the efficiency of the network, we will strive to accelerate the introduction of advanced measurement systems (AMS) by 2023 at the latest. A single platform will be established for monitoring and oversight of current production and consumption of Slovenia's electricity at all times. There is great competition between suppliers, although the size of the market limits the number of competitors. Indicators will be difficult to improve in this area. The legal restriction that has weakened an effective price comparator was already lifted in 2019. Traditional suppliers are no longer dominant because the new supplier has the largest market share, having started with a market share of 0%. We expect that the pressure of new Slovenian and foreign stakeholders will continue to maintain pressure on retail prices. Within the envisaged legislative measures, more flexible consumption and all the roles of the active customer (promoting the introduction of battery storage, dispersed generation, community INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 59   aggregation, energy community, concurrent contracts with multiple suppliers and independent aggregators, the possibility of supply at a dynamic price, etc.) have been promoted. The development of an efficient and competitive market for harnessing the full potential of the flexibility of the electricity system and new technologies is an important development direction laid down in the NEPN. The Energy Agency maintains an active dialogue with stakeholders in the electricity market to establish a market with flexibility, aimed at identifying the areas that are the most demanding in terms of implementation and which will require more detailed consideration when introducing the market with flexibility in Slovenia. Outside current EU legislation, Slovenia does not have any other national targets identified that would be related to other aspects of the internal energy market. The natural gas market The long-term goal is to continue to open the natural gas market in Slovenia without regulatory restrictions, but with appropriate incentives, especially for greater use of RES. In future, Slovenia will continue to reinforce its links with outlets in neighbouring countries. The planned connection with Hungary will also enable direct delivery from the Hungarian point of sale.61 In order to achieve our energy and climate goals, Slovenia will also comply with EU guidelines and legislation for the gradual replacement of the share of natural gas with renewable gases, such as synthetic gas, hydrogen and biomethane. Adequate penetration of renewable gases into the energy balance will require the development of a renewable gas market, which may exist within the natural gas market or as a standalone market. Natural gas system operators must also contribute to the development of the renewable gas market with impartial connection and access to the system of producers of renewable and other low carbon gases.                                                               61  In order to locate and gain insight into the possibilities and opportunities regarding the integration of gas markets in no need for the Slovenian market to formally integrate markets according to the models recommended by ACER, target market model. Instead, Slovenia is advised that the regulator enforces network codes, and Slovenian traders may continue to use the easily accessible Austrian hub. Adequate short-term cross-border capacity at competitive prices is crucial. In addition, the study encourages the regulator and the transmission system operator to pursue projects that enable the diversification of gas sources (Self-assessment and Development Opportunities of the Slovenian Wholesale Gas Market, 2018, p. 54, available at: https://www.agen-rs.si/documents/10926/135879/Samoocena-in-razvojne--slovenskega-veleprodajnega-trga-z-zemeljskim-plinom----3dbe-4648-91ed-20284d1af87a. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 60   2.4.4 Energy poverty Slovenia's objective is to mitigate and reduce energy poverty through accelerated implementation of social policy measures, general housing policy measures (e.g. 100% subsidies in multi-household buildings) and existing targeted measures. International comparisons of primary indicators of energy poverty that have been carried out for Slovenia do not indicate a larger scope of the phenomenon in question, except for the indicator late payment for utilities due to financial problems, where the deviation of the indicator value is mostly related to payment habits and priority payments in Slovenian households.62 On the basis of international comparisons, the NEPN concludes that energy poverty in Slovenia is not significant, but due to the planned development guidelines in the area of energy and climate policy, measures should be prevented from affecting on an above average basis the most vulnerable part of the population, i.e. part of the population, which, due to insufficient resources, information and lack of competencies, is unable to defend itself from the negative effects of price increases and become aware of the availability of energy products through investments in greater energy efficiency and restructuring of energy sources. In the area of energy poverty, the NEPN sets out the following activities: 1. by 2021 at the latest, in sectoral legislation, identify energy poverty and determine the obligation to periodically measure the dimensions of the occurrence of energy poverty (estimates of the number of energy-poor households in the country), 2. by 2021 at the latest, based on the definition of energy poverty, determine how energy poverty is measured and specify indicators for the statistical measurement of the phenomenon, which will enable the measurement of energy poverty and the analysis of the phenomenon, as well as allow better insight into its magnitude and characteristics, 3. by 2021 at the latest determine the target indicator for energy poverty in future, with the aim of avoiding increases in energy poverty despite planned energy and climate action, 4. from 2022 monitor in real-time, whether existing general social policy measures, general housing policy measures and existing energy poverty target measures ensure that the objective is achieved, 5. by 2022 produce an action plan to tackle energy poverty, improve and increase the scope of existing instruments and identify additional measures to be taken in the event of a major gap between the measured energy poverty indicator and the target.                                                             62  See Cirman, A.: Energy poverty in Slovenia: expert bases for the preparation of the National Energy and Climate Plan, Ljubljana, 2019.
