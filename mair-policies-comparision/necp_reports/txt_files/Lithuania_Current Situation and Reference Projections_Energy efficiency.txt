4. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 210    4.3 Dimension Energy efficiency  The current level of primary and final energy consumption is reflected in the actual consumption in 2018 for individual sectors of the economy. It is worth noting that the main energy consumers in Lithuania are the transport sector (40% in the final energy consumption mix), households (27%), industry (19%) and services (12%). Other sectors, such as construction, agriculture and fisheries, collectively consume around 3% of final energy.   Table 4.3.1.

The Assessment of cogeneration potential analysed heat and electricity generation and supply technologies, heat and in the prices of fuels used and energy produced and trends in the development of the heat supply system, and described the 9 scenarios analysed and the economic calculations carried out for cogeneration plants.  Primary and final energy consumption projections per sector Primary and final energy consumption projections are derived from systematic modelling of fuel and energy consumption in the sectors of the Lithuanian economy. The model is based on statistical data reflecting the current energy consumption situation and specific assumptions influencing the energy consumption projections (such as direct energy efficiency improvement measures, energy efficiency improvements, fuel switching, measures to promote changes in consumer behaviour, technological trends observed in the market, etc.). Presented below are the main energy efficiency policy measures applied and their assumptions used in the assessment, which have links to the area of energy efficiency improvement:   EE2  Renovation of multi-apartment buildings. Updated in 2014, this measure is implemented until 2020 and is expected to be continued in the longer term. In the EPM scenario, it will extend until                                                            108 108 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/Lithuania_DOC_88658.pdf 4. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 211   2023. The continuation of the measure is foreseen in the PPM scenario. To renovate 500 multi-apartment buildings each year. This annual rate of modernisation is realistic and consistent with the volume of projects carried out in previous periods. It is assumed that the average heated area of 1 multi-apartment building is equal to 800 m2. The expected heat savings from integrated renovation will amount to about 70 kWh/m2.  EE3  Renovation of public buildings. This measure will be implemented from 2014 and will continue until 2030. The EPM scenario assesses the impact of the measure up to and including 2023. The continuation of the measure is transferred to the PPM scenario. The measure is expected to result in 20 GWh energy savings per year up to 2030 and to renovate about 960,000 m2 of public building area. Total energy savings will be around 1.1 TWh. Comprehensive renovation of public buildings is expected to deliver heat savings of 80 kWh/m2.   EE4  Agreements with energy suppliers on consumer education and advice. From 2017, energy suppliers must conclude agreements with the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Lithuania on end-user education and consulting on issues related to improving energy efficiency. By 2030, the measure is expected to save around 300 GWh of energy annually through changes in end-user behaviour. When modelling the realisation of the assumption, the following distribution of annual energy savings was assumed: 50% of the savings will go to industrial end-users and the remainder to households. In terms of energy type, electricity will account for 40% of energy savings, heat for 40% and natural gas for the remaining 20%.   EE5  SPI relief for industrial enterprises. This measure was adopted in 2019. It encourages large industrial companies to introduce energy efficiency improvement measures, thereby reducing energy consumption. In return, companies will be allowed to recover part of the SPI funds paid. By 2030, energy savings are expected to be around 100 GWh per year. The assessment of the measure assumes that the energy savings will be distributed as follows: 70% electricity savings, 30% heat savings. Savings are attributed only in the assessment of the energy needs in the industrial sector.   EE6  Energy saving agreements with energy companies. As of 2017, energy companies must conclude agreements with the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Lithuania on energy saving. These agreements require them to introduce EE enhancement measures in end-user facilities. By 2030, this measure is expected to generate annual energy savings of around 100 GWh. It is planned that this measure will apply to the services and industry sectors, assuming that the savings measures will generate 50% electricity and 50% heat savings.  Other EE measures that contribute most to reducing energy consumption include replacing inefficient boilers with more efficient ones using RES, connecting consumers to DH, renovating multi-apartment buildings, renovating public buildings, agreements with energy suppliers on consumer education and consulting, and agreements with energy companies on energy saving, the SPI exemption for industry and the introduction of smart metering. Below is a projection of the evolution of energy needs until 2040.  Primary energy consumption is calculated on the basis of the requirements of the Efficiency Directive by subtracting non-energy use and transformation in other enterprises from gross domestic consumption, i.e. primary energy does not include fuel (imported oil and petroleum products and natural gas) used as feedstock. 4.

Energy consumption in the light of the impact of existing measures (EPM)  Determining primary energy consumption in individual sectors is currently complicated, as more than 70% of Lithuania's electricity consumption is imported from neighbouring countries and its energy mix is unknown, and it is not clear how to estimate waste heat.  Minimum energy performance requirements for buildings are set out in Technical Construction Regulation STR 2.01.02:2016 'Building energy performance planning and certification'. According to the Regulation, the energy performance class of buildings for which the construction permit application was submitted after 1 January 2018, or, when construction permits are not required, the construction works started after 1 January 2018 should be least A+ and, as from 2020, A ++.  The amendment of the Regulation by the Ministry of the Environment in 2019 changed the energy performance requirements for newly constructed buildings as of February 1. The introduction of revised requirements for the standard characteristics of envelopes and engineering systems and minimum cost-optimal calculation data, as well as revised energy performance indicators for specified new buildings in energy performance classes B, A, A+, A++ in residential, public and industrial groups has facilitated the achievement of the building energy classes A, A+ or A++.  The overall fuel consumption in the EPM scenario is shown below (taking RES resources into account). 6558.5 6712.4 6587.2 6459.8 6378.2 6322.3 5566.2 5562.9 5459.1 5353.5 5285.9 5,239.5 153.6 153.8 150.7 151.2 151.8 152.4 2215.4 2219.5 2285.2 2249.7 2201.7 2183.5 649.9 649.9 626.3 601.3 598.7 596.2 1061.3 1061.3 983.9 947.8 947.8 947.8 1486.0 1478.3 1413.1 1403.5 1385.9 1359.6 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 2035 2036 2037 2038 2039 2040 4. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 214                              Fig. 4.3.2 Total fuel consumption in the EPM scenario  In the current policy scenario, overall domestic fuel consumption for energy purposes is projected to remain relatively stable. Compared to the actual situation in 2018, overall fuel consumption in the country will increase by 1.6% in 2030, while the projected level of consumption in 2040 slips by 1.2%. It is important to note that in the EPM scenario the modelling assumes that existing policy measures do not provide sufficient economic incentives or regulatory (norms, requirements, rules) system that would lead to a fundamental change in consumer choices for switching from polluting fuels to cleaner or renewable energy sources.
