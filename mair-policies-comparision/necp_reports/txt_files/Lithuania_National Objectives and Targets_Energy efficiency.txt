2.2 Dimension Energy efficiency                                                            34 https://www.baltpool.eu/en/ 35 Projection of the demand for RES in heat production, presented by the Ministry of Energy to the experts of the Ministry of the Environment on 5 September 2019, which served as a basis for the assessment of the adequacy of local biofuel resources. 36 2 October 2019 Letter No (12)-D8(E)-2416 of the Ministry of the Environment 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 37    Increasing energy efficiency is one of the key priorities in the energy area until 2050 and is enshrined in the National Energy Independence Strategy adopted in 2018. Lithuania attempts to continuously and consistently increase energy efficiency, introduce new and less energy-intensive technologies, increase consumer awareness and alter consumer behaviour. The industry, building and transport sectors have the greatest potential for energy efficiency improvement in terms of the cost-effectiveness of efficiency measures. The main objective of the Strategy in the field of energy efficiency is to ensure that by 2030 primary and final energy intensity is 1.5 times and by 2050 about 2.4 times below the 2017 level. The main sectors with the highest energy-intensity are transport, services, households and industry, and their consumption projections are presented in Table 2.2.1. It should be noted that achieving the EE targets for 2003 requires full implementation of the planned policy measure, as described in sections 3.2 and 5.1.  Table 2.2.1.

In order to achieve those targets, Lithuania has identified the following priorities:  To promote integrated renovation of multi-apartment and public buildings (giving priority to renovation of residential neighbourhoods) and save 5-6 TWh of energy by 2030.   To rapidly develop energy-efficient and energy-efficient industries and deploy and purchase state-of-the-art and environmentally friendly technologies and equipment. To increase energy efficiency in the transport sector by renewing the vehicle fleet, moving to modern and efficient public transport, optimising transport and alternative fuel infrastructure, electrifying it or using alternative fuels. In line with the requirements of Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EU) 2018/844, a binding target for Lithuania for the year 2030 has been calculated. According to the available Eurostat data, the final energy consumption was 5,099 ktoe in 2016, 5,347 ktoe in 2017 and 5,549 ktoe in 2018 according to Statistics Lithuania. The average three-year final energy consumption in Lithuania is 5,331 ktoe. The binding target for 2030 is 27.279 TWh. As the buildings sector accounts for a significant share of final energy consumption, Lithuania is making considerable efforts to improve the energy performance of buildings. Around 5,000 multi-apartment buildings, or 750,000 m2 in building area, are expected to be refurbished by 2030, saving about 5.5 TWh of energy. Efforts will also be devoted to the renovation of public buildings. According to 2018 data, Lithuanian central government authorities owned about 2.3 million m2 of buildings. Reform of the central government buildings sector is underway and the volumes of renovation of public buildings are growing. The total area of central government buildings is projected to decrease to 1.8 million m2 by 2021. The obligation imposed by Article 5 of the Energy Efficiency Directive to renovate 3% of central government buildings annually by 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 38   2030 would amount to about 510 000 m2. Lithuania is currently developing a long-term national strategy for the renovation of the public and private residential and non-residential building sector, which includes an overview of the existing building stockpile, the identification of technical, economic and physical measures and methods, and an implementation plan to convert all public and private residential and non-residential buildings to near zero-energy buildings by 2050.
