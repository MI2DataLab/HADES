Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness i. National objectives and funding targets for public and, where available, private research and innovation relating to the Energy Union, including, where appropriate, a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met The Ministry of Education and Research does not have currently in place long-term plans until 2030. The preparation of the National Smart Specialisation Strategy for the programming period 2021-2027 is projected for the second quarter of 2020. The national research and innovation targets are extracted from the National Research, Development and Innovation Strategy for 2014-2020.

They were premised on the fact that, by the end of 2020, public expenditure for research will increase to 1 % of the GDP according to the MEC strategy, in addition to the indirect aid granted to private companies. Nevertheless, the public funds allocation target in this sector will also be contingent upon the Governance Programme and the budget fiscal policy approved under the Budget Fiscal Strategy for the relevant period.

The research and innovation activity in the energy sector will also be supported by the strategic orientation of the transmission system operator. In the ETG Development Plan for 2018-2027, the operator established a preliminary list of specific research and innovation objectives, such as:  innovation will be the driving force propelling the company to implement the     research in the company will be focused on the development of national and international partnerships;  international level;  streamlining the general and specific objectives with the methodology promoted under the ENTSO-E Strategy on research and innovation;  the research and innovation works will be funded, as a priority, from own sources and from other sources, reaching the most consistent group of European network operators. Starting from the general approach, the fragmentary trajectories have been clustered as follows: Table 16  Research and innovation objectives of the National Electricity Transmission Operator Groups Functional objectives Comments C1  Modernisation of the energy system T1 Optimal grid design Planning, compatibility, tools T2 Smart asset management Predictive maintenance and maintenance based on the technical condition of the equipment, CAPEX optimisation T3 New materials and technologies New materials and construction and maintenance methods T4 Stakeholders and environmental challenges Impact on the environment, public acceptance, participation of stakeholders C2  System security and stability T5 Network observability PMU, WAM, sensors, information exchange with DO T6 Controllability of the network Stability of voltage and frequency, energy quality, synthetic inertia The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Groups Functional objectives Comments T7 Expert systems and tools Tools for decision-making support, automated control and expert systems T8 Reliability and elasticity Protection and restauration plans, probabilistic approach, risk assessment, self-recovery T9 Consolidated auxiliary services Consolidated auxiliary services for network operation, provision of cross-border services C3  Flexibility of the energy system T10 Integration of storage solutions Integration, definition and use of solutions, and their added value T11 Demand response Demand response, tools used for the demand response, load profile, impact of electric vehicles T12 RES projection Improvement of RES projections and optimal capacity operation T13 Flexible use of network Dynamic assessment of equipment, power electronic equipment, use of interconnections T14 Interaction with the non-electrical energy grids Interaction/coordination with other energy networks (gas, heat, transmission) C4  The cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the energy system T15 Market-network integration integrating the operation of the energy market with network operation in time T16 Business models Areas such as energy storage, network extension, distributed generation for optimal network investments T17 Flexible market design Flexible design for adequacy, flexible use, cross-border trade, rational use of RES, energy demand management C5  Information technology and telecommunications and digitisation of the energy system T18 Data kept and processed in large amounts Data management, extraction of data knowledge T19 Standardisation and data exchange Standardisation, communication and data exchange protocols with distribution operators and other network operators T20 Internet of Things  using the Internet to connect various devices New communication technologies to connect various devices T21 Cybersecurity Cybersecurity Source: Transelectrica ETG Development Plan for 2018-2027, Annexes   ii. Where available, national 2050 objectives related to the promotion of clean energy technologies and, where appropriate, national objectives, including long-term targets (2050) for deployment of low-carbon technologies, including for decarbonising energy and carbon-intensive industrial sectors and, where applicable, for related carbon transport and storage infrastructure The main ministries involved in the transition process are currently preparing an assessment of the main decarbonisation vectors by 2050. In terms of renewable energy potential, Romania could opt for the use of hydrogen in industrial processes, considering that natural gas accounts for 34 % of the energy mix currently used in the industrial sector and its replacement with hydrogen from renewable sources or with a low carbon rate is a significant decarbonisation The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         method24. At the same time, the demand for heat at high temperatures constitutes almost 60 % of the industrial energy demand. Hydrogen is one of the energy carriers/low-carbon heat agents appropriate for generation of heat at high temperatures. iii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to competitiveness The 2014-2020 National Competitiveness Strategy prepared by the Ministry of the Economy, Energy and the Business Environment sets forth five strategic priorities: 1. improving the regulatory environment; 2. partnership actions between the public and private environment; 3. support factors and services; 4. promoting the 10 future potential sectors; 5. preparing the 2050 Generation and societal challenges. For the activities in the field of energy and research-development, the following are outlined: Table 17 - Action plan and expected outcome in the framework of the National Competitiveness Strategy, which may be reflected in the energy sector, 2014 - 2020 Action lines Expected outcome 2.1 Long-term institutionalisation of public-private industrial/technological/RDI foresight centres o Setting up regional competence centres to establish: the sectoral policy, the RDI agenda, support services for sectoral development depending on the relevant territorial specialisation 2.3 Consolidation and development of competitiveness clusters/poles o Contribution of clusters to total exports: 20 % in 2020 3.2 Research, development and innovation: Ensuring 1 % public funding which enables the triggering effect on the research demand in the private sector o Increasing the expenditure committed by the private environment for RDI to 1 % of the GDP by 2020 from the current 0.17 % 3.3 Supporting SMEs in order to launch innovative products or services through risk capital grants, collaborative projects o 20 % SMEs introducing innovative products and services in 2020 (from 13,17 % in 2011) 3.7 Reducing losses in the electricity distribution networks o Reducing primary energy consumption by 19 % in 2020 compared to 16.6 % in 2012  4.2 Enhancing the attractiveness of investments in the ten sectors with smart o Increasing the level of direct foreign investments in priority sectors by 5 % at aggregate level                                                 24 , prepared by Trinomics (2019) for the Commission The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Action lines Expected outcome specialisation potential Source - The 2014-2020 National Competitiveness Strategy, Ministry of the Economy, Energy and the Business Environment
