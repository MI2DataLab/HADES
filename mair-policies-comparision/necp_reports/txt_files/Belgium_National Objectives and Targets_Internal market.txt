92 2.4. Dimension internal energy market 2.4.1. Electricity interconnectivity i. The level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030 in consideration of the electricity interconnection target for 2030 of at least 15%, with a strategy with the level from 2021 onwards defined in close cooperation with affected Member States, taking into account the 2020 interconnection target of 10% and the following indicators of the urgency of action: (1) price differential in the wholesale market exceeding an indicative threshold of EUR 2/MWh between Member States, regions or bidding zones; (2) nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30% of peak load; (3) nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30% of installed renewable generation. Each new interconnector shall be subject to a socioeconomic and environmental cost-benefit analysis and implemented only if the potential benefits outweigh the costs  Federal State In recent years Belgium has invested heavily in reinforcing its level of electricity interconnectivity with neighbouring countries. As a result, the maximum import capacity of the Belgian bidding zone will rise from 5,500 MW to 7,500 MW between 2018 and 2023. This is in line with the Federal Development Plan 2020-2030 (46), which was approved in April 2019 by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy. Given these confirmed infrastructure prate of electricity interconnection of 24% in 2020. Once the interconnector with Germany (ALEGrO) is commissioned in early 2021, this could rise to around 33%. In energy targets after 2025, have already been included on an indicative basis in the Federal Development Plan 2020-2030, namely Nautilus (Belgium-United Kingdom) and ALEGrO II (Belgium-Germany). Given that the final investment decision on these interconnector projects will only be made in the context of the next Federal Development Plan (2022), they have not yet been taken into account when determining the interconnection rate. In view of the expected increase in renewable energy sources, this percentage is currently set to fall towards the end of the reference period. However, it already well exceeds the European target for 2020 (10%), and even the target for 2030 (15%).  2.4.2. Energy transmission infrastructure i. Key electricity and gas transmission infrastructure projects, and, where relevant, modernisation projects, that are necessary for the achievement of objectives and targets under the five dimensions of the Energy Union Strategy  Federal State Belgium will assess where it may be desirable to construct additional cross-border system infrastructure or modernise existing interconnectors in order to support its energy targets. The domestic system will also be reinforced so that it can cope with the challenges facing electricity systems in the future: electrification, large-scale integration of renewable energy sources (including offshore), self-generators and flexibility needs. In the natural gas sector, the transition to lean gas will require investment, mainly by the DSOs, but under the responsibility of the regions. In this respect, the agreed timetable must be strictly observed. In addition, the system operator Fluxys plans further investments to ensure the integrity of the existing infrastructure and to make the adaptations needed to respond to new developments (e.g.                                                            46 See Section 4.1.9 for more details on the projects leading to this growth: https://www.elia.be/nl/infrastructuur-en-projecten/investeringsplannen/federaal-ontwikkelingsplan-2020-2030  93 renewable gas, hydrogen, etc.). In the face of growing public opposition to infrastructure work, system operators will assess, in liaison with the relevant authorities, which additional measures could ensure more support for projects and their completion within the set timescales.  ii. Where applicable, main infrastructure projects envisaged other than Projects of Common Interest (PCIs)  2.4.3. Market integration i. National objectives related to other aspects of the internal energy market such as increasing system flexibility, in particular related to the promotion of competitively determined electricity prices in line with relevant sectoral law, market integration and coupling, aimed at increasing the tradeable capacity of existing interconnectors, smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, and real-time price signals, including a timeframe for when the objectives shall be met  Federal State Market integration: Integration of the electricity market: in the electricity sector, Belgium has been active in the Pentalateral Energy Forum (PLEF) since 2007 in order to ensure, through greater market coupling, increased security of supply, optimisation of the electricity market and optimal use of the existing infrastructure. In 2015, this led to the launch of flow-based day-ahead market coupling between the countries in Central Western Europe (CWE) region (47). The results of the existing market coupling will be assessed at regular intervals during the period 2020-2030 on the basis of clear KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). If the results do not meet expectations, opportunities for improving existing mechanisms will be discussed in consultation with authorities, regulators, transmission system operators and market operators in the PLEF countries. In this context, Belgium will closely monitor the commercial capacity available from interconnections with neighbouring countries. Where appropriate, the correct and timely implementation of action plans to be drawn up under the Regulation on the internal market for electricity will also be closely monitored to ensure that energy security policy is not compromised. Flexibility: Flexibility: due to the growing contribution of intermittent energy sources in the electricity system and also demand variability, the need for flexibility measures to ensure system stability will only increase in the coming years. In recent years, the system operator Elia has therefore assessed not only security of supply in the strict sense of the term, but also flexibility needs.  - (48), Elia forecasts an upward flexibility need of 5,080 MW and a downward flexibility need of 4,340 MW in 2030. This is a 40% increase on 2020. The following are possible sources of flexibility: - flexible use of generating units - demand-side management - electricity storage                                                            47 The member countries of the PLEF are Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany and Austria. Switzerland participates in meetings as an observer. The secretariat is provided by the Benelux Secretariat-General. 48 http://www.elia.be/~/media/files/Elia/publications-2/studies/20190628_ELIA_Adequacy_and_flexibility_study_EN.pdf 94 - interconnectors. It also forecasts that sufficient flexibility sources will be available during the period 2020-2030 to cope with growing fluctuations between electricity fed into the system and consumption. Offshore: in 2017, it was decided within the North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC) to explore some clusters intensively and to develop them in practice. In addition to long-term projects such as Dogger Bank, the German Bight and developments in the Irish Sea, the Belgium-Netherlands-United Kingdom cluster is especially important because this area already has substantial offshore wind generation and collaboration will therefore be possible in the short term. Belgium is very active in the development of collaboration around this cluster, together with the Belgian Offshore Platform (BOP), the CREG (Belgian Federal Commission for Electricity and Gas Regulation) and Elia, and is exploring possibilities for connections, collaborations and further development of this cluster with the countries concerned.  Walloon Region A range of measures have been or will be implemented in Wallonia to enable and facilitate this flexibility (e.g. smart meters, Electricity Decree and Flexibility Order, renewable energy communities). This flexibility will have two aims. - Security of supply and system balance. With the phasing out of nuclear power, the energy mix will radically change and renewable energy sources, which are often intermittent, will multiply. The rend on the regions. - Congestion management. In terms of the distribution systems, multiple renewable energy sources risk creating congestion. Developing flexibility in those distribution systems can be combined with their reinforcement. The development of smart grids has the following aims:  maximise the capacity of infrastructure to accommodate generating units and flexible tools, and maximise synchronicity in order to optimise the overall stability of the electricity system;  maximise energy efficiency efforts;  remunerate systems based on performance indicators, starting with the removal of tariffs not connected with the electricity system. Furthermore, modernising distribution systems by rolling out smart meters in line with the framework set out by the Decree of 19 July 2018 will encourage the integration of decentralised generating units, develop new forms of flexibility and develop different methods of energy sharing, while empowering consumers who will have more accurate and virtually real-time information on their energy consumption or generation.  ii. Where applicable, national objectives related to the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met Not applicable.  iii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to ensuring that consumers participate in the energy system and benefit from self-generation and new technologies, including smart meters Not applicable. 95  iv. National objectives with regard to ensuring electricity system adequacy, as well as for the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met The increasing integration of intermittent, decentralised renewable energy also requires greater flexibility, which can be achieved in various ways: - by balancing supply and demand; - by developing connections between countries and making energy networks smarter; - by creating energy storage potential. The four entities will ensure that new centralised and decentralised storage systems and potential for peak-load shifting in both industry and private households continue to be developed. Residential storage, SME storage, local storage potential, electric vehicles in storage mode and local tools will increase further by 2030, as will the volume of daily demand shifts. An increasing proportion of these various capabilities will contribute directly to security of supply, in that they will be readily available and can be activated via the market. Market operation will be adapted to develop the framework for ensuring security of supply during the energy transition at the lowest possible cost.  v. Where applicable, national objectives to protect energy consumers and improve the competitiveness of the retail energy sector Walloon Region The aim is to ensure a competitive energy price compared with those countries with which Belgium is in competition.  2.4.4. Energy poverty ix. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to energy poverty, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met Federal State There is a federal policy for the protection of low-income or vulnerable residential energy consumers. Certain initiatives taken at federal level are helping to make energy bills more affordable.  Social tariff for electricity and natural gas  Since 2004, there has been a social tariff for electricity and natural gas. This is cheaper than the average market price for certain target groups of people who are in a vulnerable situation. Since 2010, the social tariff for electricity and natural gas has in most cases been automatically applied so that beneficiaries do not need to do anything to benefit from a lower price. The social tariff is calculated every six months by the Belgian energy regulator based on the lowest market prices, meaning that it moves with the market. Since 1 January 2020, beneficiaries connected to a district heating system have been able to benefit from the social tariff following the inclusion of such systems in the Gas Law via an amendment. This same amendment also expanded the types of social housing eligible for the social tariff, by including social rental housing provided by public social welfare  CPAS).  Fonds Gaz et Electricité (Gas and Electricity Fund) Through the Fonds Gaz et Electricité, the CPASs can offer preventive and remedial support to the most vulnerable who cannot pay their gas and/or electricity bills. 96  Fonds social chauffage (Social Heating Fund) The Fonds social chauffage was set up to help people who heat their homes using heating oil, but who find themselves struggling financially. This fund pays part of the heating bill for people in certain target groups.  Payment by instalment The payment by instalment system enables customers to pay their heating oil bill in instalments. The advantage of this system is that customers can receive a large delivery without having to pay a large sum of money in one go.  Gas and electricity campaign: osez comparer (dare to compare) In Belgium, every region has an energy prices regulator. Suppliers in each region must inform their respective regulator every month about their various tariffs. All these tariffs are recorded in a database and can be compared using an online simulator available on the website of each regulator. The campaign encourages people to use the simulators and annually compare prices in order to choose the best contract. The current measures at federal level primarily involve financial support that directly or indirectly helps people to pay their energy bills or financial support that can be used by the CPASs. These measures will continue in the future because it is vital that energy bills remain affordable for everyone and that those who are vulnerable do not find themselves in a situation of energy poverty due to being unable to pay their bills. Social tariff beneficiaries also benefit from protection measures if their power supply is disconnected. Both the government agreement and the federal plan to combat poverty 2016-2019 focus on assessing and improving existing federal measures to combat energy poverty. Based on this vision, the federal measures have been assessed by the various bodies concerned and by the government so that improvements can be made. These measures will continue because they are keeping energy bills affordable for vulnerable consumers so that they do not find themselves in a situation of energy poverty. Social tariff beneficiaries also benefit from further protection measures if their power supply is disconnected, meaning that they are supplied by the distribution system operator in the event of payment problems. The Federal Public Service for the Economy has also published a study on the impact of energy prices on growing inequality in the Belgian social model. Statbel, the Belgian statistical office, considers the inability to pay energy bills to be an element in material deprivation (the usual standard of living in terms of rent, water, electricity, etc.). In 2017, this figure was 5%. The Fondation Roi Baudouin (King Baudouin Foundation), which manages the Platform against energy poverty (Plateforme de lutte contre la précarité énergétique), published its second energy poverty barometer in 2018. This barometer distinguished between three different forms of energy poverty: measured energy poverty (14.5% of Belgian households have energy bills that are too high for their income), hidden energy poverty (4.3% consume as little energy as possible to make ends meet), and subjective energy poverty (4.9% say that they cannot heat their homes properly). The barometer linked these figures to size of family, housing and health, and concluded that single people, single-parent families, poor quality housing and poor health are risk factors for energy poverty. These areas are the responsibility of the Regions, which are taking the necessary measures in this respect. The various studies and statistics indicate that energy poverty has economic, structural and technical causes and that an overarching approach is needed. To into how the current measures at each level of government can contribute to that approach or be revised in order to support the fight against energy poverty and minimise consumption. It should not be forgotten that energy is a basic need and must be available to everyone, and that it must also therefore be affordable for those who are vulnerable.  97 Flemish Region Contextual analysis Between 2000 and 2019, the population of the Flemish Region increased by 11% to around 6.9 million inhabitants. From 2007 to 2019, the number of private households in the Flemish Region increased from 2.55 million to 2.8 million, a rise of more than 10%. Statistiek Vlaanderen, the Flemish statistical office, forecasts that this figure will rise by more than 150,000 households to 2.95 million (+5%) by 2030. According to the forecasts, between 2017 and 2030, single-person households will grow by 11% to 954,000 (+94,000 or 32% of all households) and two-person households will rise by 10% to 1,060,000 (+100,000 or 36% of all households). The number of elderly people in both categories will rise sharply. The need for adapted, affordable and quality housing will therefore increase based on this demographic change. Although the Flemish Region is one of the most prosperous regions in the world, energy poverty has long been a harsh reality. The Platform against energy poverty publishes an annual energy poverty barometer that measures energy poverty using three indicators: - hspend too much of their disposable income on energy costs (11.4% of Flemish households); - meaning that their energy costs are abnormally low compared with households living in a similar situation (3.1%); - hey struggle financially to heat their homes properly (2.5%). Bearing in mind the overlap between these categories, 15.9% of households in the Flemish Region are faced by a form of energy poverty (445,000). Most of them are single-parent and single-person (elderly) households. Having electricity and heating is generally regarded as an integral part of the right to decent housing and therefore as a basic need for a dignified existence. The gap between owners and tenants on the housing market has increased, with tenants facing more than twice the risk of energy poverty that owners face. Social welfare to prevent the disconnection of energy supplies and structural work to reduce energy consumption in housing are two of the ways in which Flemish energy policy is tackling energy poverty. The protection afforded to Flemish energy consumers against disconnection is one of the most successful approaches in Europe. The arrival of smart meters since mid-2019 is offering numerous options, particularly in terms of real-time consumption information, targeted communication and budget meters that can be set to even more proactively prevent the accumulation of debt. Given that the long-term renovation strategy 2050 covers all Flemish housing, measures have also been put in place to raise the awareness of vulnerable target groups and provide them with targeted support so that their homes eventually meet the long-term objective. In this respect, on 4 March 2016 the Flemish Government approved a programme against energy poverty consisting of 34 actions. For private rental housing, the mechanism of existing social roof insulation programmes (high level of financial support combined with practical support) was extended at the beginning of 2017 to cavity wall insulation and the installation of high-performance glazing. Vulnerable groups receive at least 50% extra on existing energy incentives and also vouchers to reduce the cost of energy-efficient domestic appliances. Vulnerable groups also qualify for a free energy scan of their homes, with over 20,000 such scans being carried out every year. In 2019, this programme was assessed following a new consultation with stakeholders, and further recommendations were made to the Flemish Government.  Objectives and timeframe 1. By 2021 at the latest, all traditional budget meters will be replaced with smart budget meters that offer more proactive assistance and support, therefore preventing the accumulation of debt. The public 98 service obligations that protect consumers from disconnection will be optimised as a result so that even more proactive work can be carried out to prevent the accumulation of energy debt. 2. A rolling fund for the energy renovation of housing purchased out of necessity will be launched in early 2020 to provide vulnerable owners with loans of up to EUR 25,000 with deferred repayment. In 2020 the effectiveness of this fund will be assessed with a view to possibly continuing the loans. 3. The measures aimed at existing target groups will be assessed and revised where necessary with a view to establishing an effective structural support framework in order to substantially increase the number of renovations among the vulnerable target group.  Walloon Region Walloon plan to tackle poverty Energy poverty is not clearly defined in law. It is generally accepted that energy poverty means a situation in which a person or a household faces particular difficulties in meeting their basic energy needs at home. Walloon plan to tackle poverty was adopted in order to strengthen the rministers and developed in partnership with operators in the sector, this plan aims to identify specific actions with a positive impact on the day-to-day lives of people living in poverty or at risk of this situation. It is therefore based around thematic priorities corresponding to the main categories of expenditure in the budgets of Walloon households: housing, food, energy, water, health, family policies, mobility, leisure, technology, etc. For each of these priorities, the plan sets out decisions, resolutions and concrete actions that the Walloon Government will take. Bearing in mind that 10% of the poorest households spend 19% of their annual income on energy, the energy part of the plan aims to improve the healthiness and energy performance of housing. Energy policy and poverty Access to energy for all and combating energy poverty are at the heart of Walloon energy policy. The objective in terms of consumer protection is to reinforce the current level of protection of the vulnerable. Measures to support struggling households (such as subsidies for low-income households, winter fuel allowance, social tariffs, preventive action plans for energy, etc.) will be improved. The concept of protected customers should be expanded to take account of the income level of households. This would enable vulnerable households not included in the existing categories of protected customers to benefit from the protection measures forming part of the public service obligations, in particular application of the specific social tariff. Ideally, this expansion should occur at federal level. With regard to aid mechanisms, the effectiveness of existing measures should be generally reviewed. Household support measures should also be improved, both in terms of energy savings and ability to access the market.
