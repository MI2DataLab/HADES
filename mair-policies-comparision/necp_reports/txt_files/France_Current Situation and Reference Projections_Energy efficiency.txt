4.3. Energy efficiency  4.3.1. Final energy consumption in the economy and by sector (including industrial, residential, services and transport)   changes in the French econoefficiency. Since 2009, as a result of the economic crisis in particular, final energy consumption for energy purposes has decreased slightly. Energy-demand control policies have stopped the rise in energy consumption due to population growth and economic growth, but have not yet resulted in a sustainable reduction in overall consumption.       213      Figure 43: Final consumption for energy purposes by form of energy  Data adjusted for climate variations, in  TWh Source: SDES calculations, on the basis of sources per form of energy    Electricité  Electricity  Gaz naturel  Natural gas  Pétrole  Oil  Charbon  Coal  Chaleur  Heat  Energies renouvelables et déchets  Renewable energies and waste    The average annual decrease in energy intensity since 2004 is 1.4%.  Figure 44: Change in final and primary energy intensity 19902018 (index) Source: SDES, Insee      214     In application of Article 3 of Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, France has set the double target of reducing its energy consumption to 1,528 TWh (131.4 Mtoe) of final energy and 2,557 TWh (219.9 Mtoe) of primary energy by 2020 (excluding international bunkers and non-energy uses).  In 2018, final energy consumption for energy use (excluding international bunkers), adjusted for climatic variations, was 1,628 TWh, and primary energy consumption (excluding international bunkers) was 2,890 TWh. The graph below shows the progress made towards achieving the targets (data adjusted for climate variations, expressed in base 100).  Figure 45: Change in final energy consumption and primary energy consumption (base 100 index in 2005)  Source: SDES   While France is generally involved in a process of reducing its final energy consumption, the current pace is insufficient to reach the 2020 target in the Energy Efficiency Directive. The reference scenario specifies that the target for 2020 will not be reached until 2023. Current measures would have to be rapidly stepped up or new measures adopted if the 2020 targets are to be achieved.    Analyses that can be used to break down the factors driving the progression of final energy consumption show that energy efficiency policies have led to significant volumes of energy savings that offset the effects of rising demographics or GDP growth (see figure below) 62.       62 . http://www.indicators.odyssee-mure.eu/decomposition.html                   215      Figure 46: Breakdown of the change in final energy consumption in France between 2006 and 2016 (in Mtoe) (Source: Odyssée, 2019)   TWh  TWh  Consommation finale  Final consumption  Activité  Activity  Démographie  Demographics  Modes de vie  Lifestyles  Structure  Structure   Energy savings  Climat  Climate  Autres  Other    The sectors do not all have the same impact on final energy consumption: the two major contributors are transport and residential-tertiary, followed by industry. Energy consumption in industry declined in 2008, during the crisis, and has been stable since. Energy consumption in transport and residentialtertiary is stable.  In 2018, the situation relating to energy by sector was the following:  Industry  Transport  Residential  Tertiary  Agriculture  Total  318  504  473  282  50  1628  Final energy consumption by sector in 2018 (TWh), adjusted for climate variations  Source: SDES    4.3.1.1. Residential sector     216    Final energy consumption in the residential sector has been stable for 10 years. The downward effects of improved energy efficiency in new buildings and the renovation of existing buildings are offset by the increase in the number of occupied dwellings (population growth, family undoubling, etc.).    Figure 47: Final energy consumption in the residential sector  Data adjusted for climate variations, in TWh Source: SDES calculations, according to sources per form of energy.   In 2018, real energy consumption in the residential sector, which was largely related to heating needs, decreased by 3.1% due to milder weather than in 2017. It stood at 449.6 TWh. Adjusted for climate variations, it was 473.7 TWh, a decrease of 0.7%.    4.3.1.2. Tertiary sector  Energy consumption in the tertiary sector grew until 2011, when energy efficiency policies stabilised demand. Since then, there has been a fairly stable, slightly downward trend.  Figure 48: Final energy consumption in the tertiary sector  Data adjusted for climate variations, in TWh Source: SDES calculations, according to sources per form of energy                   217       Énergies renouvelables  Renewable energy  Produits pétroliers  Oil products  Charbon  Coal  Gaz naturel  Natural gas  Électricité  Electricity  Réseau de chaleur  District heating system    In 2018, real energy consumption in the tertiary sector decreased by 1% to 273.5 TWh. Adjusted for climate variations, it was 282.2 TWh, an increase of 0.5%.     4.3.1.3. Transport sector   After a period of continuous growth between 1990 and 2001 (+1.5% annual average), final energy consumption for transport uses decreased slowly, by 0.3% per year on average, between 2001 and 2013, before rebounding between 2013 and 2015. In 2018, final energy consumption for transport uses was down compared to 2017, at 504.2 TWh. This fall followed a year of growth (+0.8% between 2016 and 2017).              218    Figure 49: Final energy consumption in transport, in TWh Source: SDES calculations, according to sources per form of energy     Électricité  Electricity  Gaz naturel  Natural gas  Gazole route (hors biocarburants)  Road diesel (excluding biofuels)  Essence route (hors biocarburants)  Road petrol (excluding biofuels)  Carburéacteurs et autres produits pétroliers  Jet fuels and other oil products  Énergies renouvelables (biocarburants)  Renewable energies (biofuels)    Energy consumption in transport is also relatively stable, which shows the importance of improving the system as a whole, because of major growth in mobility needs.    4.3.1.4. Industrial sector  Between 1990 and 2007, energy consumption in the industry remained relatively stable. There was a significant reduction in consumption related to the 20082009 economic crisis, followed by a rebound between 2009 and 2011. Energy consumption in industry has since been on a downward trend.  Figure 50: Final energy consumption in the industrial sector  Data adjusted for climate variations, in TWh Source: SDES calculations   219       In 2018, real final energy consumption in industry stood at 314.7 TWh (317.8 TWh adjusted for climate variation), one of its lowest levels since 1990, but nevertheless a rebound compared to 2017 (+1.9%).    4.3.1.5. Agriculture sector  The final energy consumption in the agriculture-forestry sector has been stable for a decade and in particular seems to be fairly unresponsive to fluctuations in agricultural production, which experienced inal consumption was 50.2 TWh.  Figure 51: Final energy consumption in the agriculture-fisheries sector, in TWh Source: SDES calculations, according to sources per form of energy                   220       Chaleur commercialisée  Heat marketed  Produits pétroliers  Oil products  Charbon  Coal  Gaz naturel  Natural gas  Énergies renouvelables  Renewable energy  Électricité  Electricity    4.3.2. Primary consumption of fossil fuels  The energy mix is changing slightly: renewable energies are growing at the expense of fossil fuels. However, this change is taking place slowly. The consumption of natural gas is relatively stable.    Figure 52: Primary consumption by form of energy  Data adjusted for climate variations, in TWh,   221    Source: SDES calculations, on the basis of sources per form of energy                         Hydraulique, éolien et PV  Hydro, wind and PV  Autres EnR et déchets  Other RE and waste  Charbon  Coal  Pétrole  Oil  Gaz  Gas  Nucléaire  Nuclear    In 2018, primary energy consumption, excluding non-energy uses, amounted to 2,693 TWh, a decrease of 0.7% compared to 2017. Adjusted for climate variations, it increased by 0.5%, a result of increased losses during energy transformation. This rebound can be explained by nuclear production and losses in heat incurred (for every kilowatt hour of electricity generated by a nuclear power plant, two kilowatt hours of heat are lost).  Overall, the real primary energy mix in Metropolitan France consists of 41.1% nuclear, 28.6% oil, 14.8% natural gas, 3.7% coal and 11.4% renewable energies and waste (see figure below). The energy independence rate is 56.1%.              Figure 53: Real primary energy mix in 2018 (Source SDES, according to sources per form of energy)     222       Nucléaire 41,1%  Nuclear 41.1%  EnR 11,4%  RE 11.4%  Gaz 14,8%  Gas 14.8%  Charbon 3,7%  Coal 3.7%  Déchets non renouvelables 0,6%  Non-renewable waste 0.6%  Pétrole 28,6%  Oil 28.6%  Biomasse solide 4,3%  Solid biomass 4.3%  Hydraulique (hors pompages) 2,3%  Hydro (excluding pumping) 2.3%  Biocarburants 1,3%  Biofuels 1.3%  Pompes à chaleur 1,0%  Heat pumps 1.0%  Éolien 1,0%  Wind 1.0%  Autres 1,6%  Other 1.6%    RE: renewable energies  Nuclear: nuclear energy at production (heat degraded by nuclear reaction, then converted into electricity), following deduction of the remaining exportable electricity    With the increase in the use of fossil fuels for electricity generation and rising demand for petroleum products, CO2 emissions related to the combustion of energy increased by 3% in 2017 in real terms and by 4% at constant values. Adjusted for climate variations, emissions remain 17% lower than in 2005, having fallen steadily between that date and 2016.  In 2018, France mobilised 3,046 TWh to meet final consumption (not corrected for climate variations) of 1,781 TWh. The difference consists of internal losses and uses of the energy system, net electricity exports, and international air and marine bunkers, conventionally excluded from consumption.  The real final energy mix is still dominated by oil. In 2018, petroleum products accounted for 38% of final energy consumption, followed by electricity (27%), gas (20%), renewable energies and waste (11%), heat (3%) and coal (1%). In line with the trend observed since the mid-2000s, the share of fossil fuels in the energy mix fell by 1% in 2018, while electricity and renewable energies increased. Heat, which shows no clear long-term trend, also grew in 2018.   223    Measures to control energy demand will enable an overall reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels. However, some additional measures will be required so that the reductions in consumption start with fossil fuels, especially more carbon-rich fossil fuels. The target tables by energy show particular fuelspecific measures where the effect will supplement the energy control measures.  The integration of the measures presented below into the energy scenario makes it possible to obtain the decrease shown in the figure below. The figure shows the area in which the primary energy consumption of fossil fuel would be, with the curves indicating the extreme values linked to different macroeconomic conditions.

Primary consumption of coal  After a historic low in 2016, at 100 TWh, consumption (adjusted for climate variations) shot up again in 2017. In 2018 it returned to its long-term trendline, returning to 99 TWh. The smelting sector has been the main consumer of coal in France since 2014, representing 48% of total consumption in 2018. It is followed by power and heat generation, which only represents 30% of consumption (compared to 48% in 2012), showing a particularly substantial fall in 2018 (-29% in a year). Final consumption (essentially by non-blast heat manufacturing) represented 16% of all primary resources consumed in 2018, an increase of a point and a half over a year (the difference corresponds to the statistical gap).

A total of 87% of these uses are concentrated in the iron and steel industry.  The Grand Est and Nord-Pas-de-Calais regions account for more than half of coal-using industries. Metropolitan France has 126 industrial sites consuming coal in 11 regions: the Grand Est region (39 sites), Hauts-de-France (29) and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (20). The other regions each account for fewer than 10 coal-consuming industrial sites.

Uses of coal in industry  As regards heat, there are already possible alternative uses of waste or biomass for industrial needs. For cement and plaster manufacturers, given the constraints in terms of temperature, waste could be recycled to cover 80% of demand. Biomass, solid recovered fuel (SRF) or biogas could be used in other industries including agrifood, cardboard, sugar, and beet and alfalfa drying.  Increasing the share of renewable and recovered energy in district heating systems or for the supply of industrial platforms could also reduce coal consumption.  The industrial process of the iron and steel industry combines the use of coal as a fuel and as a chemical agent63. In this sector, operational methods for the mass substitution of coal do not yet exist. Various solutions are being tested to reduce coal consumption and to reuse or store CO2 emissions. Recycling steel is also important, because used steel can replace cast iron produced in a blast furnace and therefore reduce the consumption of ferrous minerals and coal. Entirely substituting coal would involve finding an alternative to coal as a reducing agent in the production of steel.  Coal-free production technologies using hydrogen or electrolysis are currently being developed.    For all these industries, improving energy efficiency, particularly the recovery of waste heat, should also be integrated.  Non-energy uses of coal  Industry today consumes a large amount of fossil fuels for non-energy uses. In particular, the manufacture of plastic in chemistry requires naphtha, fertiliser production requires hydrogen produced from reformed natural gas, and the iron and steel industry requires coal in the manufacture of steel. For  63 Steel is manufactured from blast furnace combustion of iron ore and coke.   227    coal, this represented an equivalent consumption of 3.4 TWh in 2018 according to the energy balance sheet.  Energy uses of coal in the residential sector  There are 10 coal-fired district heating networks: in 2016, their consumption was 238,575 tonnes of coal, equivalent to about 1.9 TWh, or 6% of inputs.  Once major energy sources, fuel oil and coal have continued their decline, and now represent only 5% of the energy mix for district heating systems (compared to 60% in 1990).  Coal consumption in the residential sector is estimated as 0.31 TWh. This consumption is equivalent to 20,000 dwellings. The ANGDM estimates that the vast majority of coal-heated dwellings are in the Hauts-de-France region, mainly because of its mining and industrial past. The use of coal as heating energy accounts for 3% of all dwellings in that region. In particular, the ANGDM has identified between 500 and 1,000 households that are heated mainly by coal-fired stoves. The occupants are former miners or widows of miners. The ANGDM estimates that the share of coal in collective dwellings is decreasing because of the conversion operations being rolled out.  Given that the vast majority of households use a coal stove and not a boiler, the most accessible alternative technologies are wood or pellet stoves, electric heaters, or air-to-air heat pumps. For reasons of investment and usage costs, it is proposed that we prioritise replacing coal heating with biomass stoves.  The integration of the measures described here into the energy scenario makes it possible to obtain the decrease shown in the figure below. The scenario is not dependent upon the macroeconomic context.                    Figure 57: Past trend (20102018) and future scenario (20192028) of primary consumption of coal following MEP implementation (TWh)   228     Consommation charbon passée  Past coal consumption  Consommation charbon projection  Projected coal consumption    4.3.2.2. Primary consumption of oil  In 2018, domestic consumption of refined petroleum products (excluding biofuels) was 785 TWh, down by 3.6%. 2018 continues the long-term downward trend that began in the early 2000s (see figure below).    Figure 58: Total consumption of refined petroleum products by sector (excluding biofuels) (TWh)   Source: SDES calculations, from CFBP, Citepa, CPDP, DGDDI, DGEC, DGFIP, DPMA, EDF, Insee, LyondellBasell,  French Ministry of the Armed Forces, SFIC, SNCF, SNCU, SSP, Uniper  Consommation finale à usage non-énergétique  Final consumption for non-energy use  Résidentiel  Residential  Tertiaire  Tertiary     229    Industrie  Industry  Agriculture/pêche  Agriculture/fisheries  Tous transports  All transport   Electricity and heat production    Oil is the fossil fuel that produces the most greenhouse gas emissions after coal, during use. Reducing its use is therefore an important issue. The aim is to replace a million private oil-heating units by the end of 2023 and 3 million by 2028. Sectoral measures to control energy demand will play a role in reducing the demand for oil, including carbon contribution, along with all measures taken to reduce energy consumption in transport. Certain specific measures that complement these steps are also planned.  The integration of the measures described here into the energy scenario makes it possible to obtain the decrease shown in the figure below. The figure shows the area in which the primary consumption of petroleum products would be, with the curves indicating the extreme values linked to different macroeconomic conditions.    Figure 59: Past trend (20102018) and future scenario (20192028) of primary consumption of oil following MEP implementation (TWh)  4.3.2.3. Primary consumption of natural gas  Natural gas is a fossil fuel and, as such, will have to be removed from the energy mix by 2050. However, it is the fossil fuel that causes the lowest greenhouse gas emissions, which explains why the temporary transfer of some uses of coal or oil to natural gas is a relative improvement. This explains why there are no specific measures to reduce natural gas use. The demand for this energy will be reduced due to                                    230    demand control measures, particularly in building works. The outcomes of natural gas demand scenarios are presented in the following table.  The energy control operations should make it possible to change the final natural gas consumption as shown in the figure below. The figure shows the area in which the primary consumption of natural gas would be, with the curves indicating the extreme values linked to different macroeconomic conditions.

Current potential for the use of high-efficiency cogeneration and district heating and cooling systems   In application of Article 14 of and Annex VIII to Directive 2012/27/EU, France has sent the European Commission an analysis of its potential for the use of high-efficiency cogeneration and district heating and cooling systems. This analysis is still applicable and will be updated in accordance with Directive 2012/27/EU by 31 December 2020. It is available from the website of the Ministry for Ecological and Inclusive Transition64.     64 Website: https://www.ecologique-solidaire.gouv.fr/besoins-chaleur-et-froid     231    4.3.4. Projections on the basis of existing policies, measures and programmes in relation to energy efficiency for primary and final energy consumption in each sector at least until 2040 (including 2030)    Projections of energy consumption to 2050, on the basis of the policies and measures existing in 2018, have only been established for final energy consumption. These result in a drop in final energy consumption from 1,641 TWh (141.1 Mtoe) in 2015 to 1,589 TWh (136.6 Mtoe) in 2050, and thus a decrease of 3.2%. However, after reaching a minimum in 2030 of 1,580 TWh (135.9 Mtoe), and thus a fall of 3.7% compared to 2015, consumption will increase once again, as the effect of the measures becomes less marked over time. It will therefore reach a value of 1,584 TWh (136.3 Mtoe) in 2040.  Figure 61: Final energy consumption  Scenario with existing measures    Consommation énergétique finale  Final energy consumption  Consommation en TWh  Consumption in TWh    4.3.4.1. Residential sector  Final energy consumption in the residential sector will see a sustained fall until 2050, although this will be slowed significantly after 2030 with the decreasing effect of the measures. It will therefore fall from 490 TWh in 2015 (42.2 Mtoe) to 410 TWh (35.2 Mtoe) in 2050, a fall of 16% over the period, with intermediate values of 439 TWh (37.7 Mtoe) in 2030 and 424 TWh (36.5 Mtoe) in 2040.    232     résidentiel  Final energy consumption in residential sector  Consommation en TWh  Consumption in TWh  Charbon  Coal  Produits pétrolier raffinés  Refined oil products  Gaz  Gas  EnR thermiques et déchets  Thermal RE and waste  Électricité  Electricity  Réseaux de chaleur  District heating systems    4.3.4.2. Tertiary sector  Final energy consumption in the tertiary sector will experience a sustained decrease until 2050. It will therefore fall from 285 TWh in 2015 (24.5 Mtoe) to 238 TWh (20.5 Mtoe) in 2050, a fall of 16% over the period, with intermediate values of 258 TWh (22.2 Mtoe) in 2030 and 248 TWh (21.3 Mtoe) in 2040.

Transport sector  In this scenario, final energy consumption in the transport sector will increase from 509 TWh (43.8 Mtoe) in 2015 to 522 TWh (44.9 Mtoe) in 2050, a rise of 2.6% over the period. However, after reaching a minimum in 2030 of 500 TWh (43 Mtoe), and thus a fall of 1.7% compared to 2015, consumption will increase once again, as the effect of the measures becomes less marked over time. It will therefore reach a value of 511 TWh (44 Mtoe) in 2040.

Cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements resulting from national calculations, in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU   In application of Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU, France has undertaken a comparative analysis of the cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements and the levels actually set. This analysis was sent to the European Commission in 2018
