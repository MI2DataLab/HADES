 and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 51   2.5. Research, innovation and competitiveness dimension Luxembourg is a dynamic country in terms of industrial research, development and technology. In order to make the transition to a low-carbon economy and society, considerable efforts are needed to support technological development, research and development of new technologies and social innovation. The development of research and innovation activities is crucial for the competitiveness of a country, and the Luxembourg Government is therefore investing considerable financial and organisational resources in these activities. centre towards green finance and the emerging university and research landscape, make Luxembourg an ideal location for green tech and climate solutions. The Luxembourg Government will develop a concrete   In June 2010, the European Council adopted the development of the Europe 2020 strategy and thus confirmed the five joint EU targets: promoting the employment of those able to work, improving the conditions for accessing innovation, research and development, achieving the climate change and energy targets, improving the level of education and promoting social integration, in particular by reducing poverty. Each Member State has aligned its national 2020 targets with the core targets of the EU and set out a number of actions in its National Reform Programme (NRP). The NRP is a key contribution of the 9 of April 2019 explains how the objectives are to be achieved. Implementing an effective research policy for both the public and private sectors is a priority for the Luxembourg Government. For 2020, Luxembourg has set itself a national research intensity target of between 2.3% and 2.6% of GDP. The associated key measures for achieving the national target are set out in the NRP. In Luxembourg, the trend in state resources spent on research and   Public support for research and development is focused on innovation in all businesses. Research and development has traditionally focused on the steel, aviation and automotive sectors. In recent years, however, the government has made considerable efforts to develop further priorities in the areas of information and communication technologies, logistics, health technologies, materials, energy and                                                            9 https://odc.gouvernement.lu/fr/publications/rapport-etude-analyse/programme-national-de-reforme/2019-pnr-luxembourg-2020.html  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 52   environmental technologies (cleantech). Environmental technologies are among the priorities of the national economic diversification strategy. In recent years, Luxembourg has made concrete progress in the areas of sustainable construction, sustainable mobility and the circular economy. Initiatives in these areas are in line with EU policy and the various directives on issues such as the energy efficiency of buildings, smart transport systems or ecodesign requirements.  Thanks to its steel industry, Luxembourg has a long-standing tradition of materials-based research. Today it is working, among other things, on the development of sustainable building materials. In addition, Luxembourg now has three research teams in the field of materials research for solar photovoltaics, which are working on the further development of resource-optimised thin-film PV. Furthermore, Luxembourg also has innovation clusters that are dedicated to the issues mentioned above. Public research stakeholders, including the University of Luxembourg, play a key role in this. The same applies to Luxinnovation, the national agency for promoting innovation and research, which offers personalised consultancy and support for the stakeholders and the government in the areas of research and innovation (access to funding opportunities, finding partners, business creation, etc.) and thus plays an important role in terms of the European networks in this area.  To strengthen the competitiveness of the country, Luxembourg has in recent years created the liberal, modern, flexible, attractive and innovative legal framework needed to develop new activities, by means of an active economic policy.   Regarding competitiveness, compound index values that combine several pieces of information to form a single numerical value and therefore only give a rough overall picture of territorial competitiveness are increasingly being used for international comparisons. In Luxembourg, the Observatoire de la Compétitivité (ODC) analyses and monitors a number of international reference values and rankings in its annual competitiveness report10. The ODC monitors the annual reports, including those of the World Economic Forum, the Institute for Management Development, the Heritage Foundation and the European Commission. According to the results, Luxembourg is within the top 10 at EU level for the vast majority of the benchmarks analysed.                                                             10 https://odc.gouvernement.lu/fr/actualites.gouvernement%2Bfr%2Bactualites%2Btoutes_actualites%2Bcommuniques%2B2018%2B11-novembre%2B13-bilan-competivite-2018.html  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 53   of which are published in the competitiveness report and discussed with social partners and experts. Since 11, which is a flexible instrument that can be further developed over time and adapted if necessary. It covers the dimensions of competitiveness, welfare and sustainability and at the same time ensures that there is a balance between economic, social and ecological aspects. This Luxembourg reference value analyses 68 different indicators. This instrument makes it possible to summarise the performance of the countries in the indicators of the three aspects of economy, society and environment and the associated advantages and disadvantages. In the overall ranking, at EU level.  In terms of innovation, reference can be made to an annual comparative evaluation analysis by the European Commission, which measures the innovation performance of the EU Member States by and innovation systems and helps countries to identify areas that they need to address. The 2018 edition of the EIC emphasises that the innovation performance of the EU Member States is continuing to improve, progress is accelerating and the outlook is very positive. Since 2010, the average innovation performance of the European Union has risen by 5.8 percentage points and is expected to improve by a further 6 percentage points in the next two years. The 2018 evaluation is led by Sweden (average evaluation: 0.710 out of 1), followed by Denmark (0.668) and Finland (0.649). Luxembourg is also among the group of innovation leaders, in sixth place (0.611).                                                              11 https://odc.gouvernement.lu/fr/statistiques/tableau-bord-competitivite.html
