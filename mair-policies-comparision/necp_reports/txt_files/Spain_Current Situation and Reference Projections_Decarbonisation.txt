ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  230 A.2 DECARBONISATION DIMENSION Once the main exogenous variables have been explained, the Baseline and Target Scenarios are then described for the different dimensions included in the Plan. This section begins with decarbonisation, which in turn comprises two areas: GHG emissions and promotion of renewable energy.  A.2.1 Greenhouse gas emissions and removals The target of reducing GHG emissions by 20% compared to 1990 is a key element in the design of the INECP. Achieving this level of decarbonisation is only possible if it is accompanied by measures of the other dimensions that are interlinked with the reduction of emissions, such as the target of final energy production from renewable sources or the principle of energy efficiency first.  For more details about GHG emissions, please see the end of this annex.  The tables below show the total GHG emissions corresponding to the Baseline and Target Scenarios of the INECP, detailed by sector.  Table A.8.

The residential, commercial and institutional sector also makes an important contribution to meeting the emissions reduction target.  In conclusion, the key target established in this Plan is to reduce GHG emissions by at least 20% in 2030 compared to 1990. However, the result of the optimisation made using the TIMES model was 23%, with a 31% reduction in GHG emissions between 2020 and 2030.  A.2.2 Renewable energy Below are the results and projections of the contribution from the generation of energy using renewable energy sources to final energy consumption.  mitigation of GHG emissions up to at least a 20% reduction compared to 1990.  Contribution of renewables in gross final energy consumption  The total percentage of renewable energy in gross final energy in 2016 was 17.3%. Regarding the calculation method, the indications established in Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources were followed, as were the amendments introduced in this calculation in Directive 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018. Table A.12 and Table A.13 present the results in the Baseline and Target Scenarios, respectively.    ANNEX A.

In other words, as a result of implementing the measures set out in this Plan, there is a 16-point increase in the presence of renewable energy in final energy consumption.  The main reasons for this increase are outlined below:   In the Baseline Scenario, the largest contribution to the increase in the renewable percentage comes from the components of renewable electricity generation and heat pumps.ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  234  In the Target Scenario:o The contribution from renewable electricity generation from the Target Scenario is almost double the Baseline Scenario, thanks to the policies promoting renewable generation. o The contribution from heat pumps increases by 8.8% with respect to the Baseline Scenario. o Unlike the Baseline Scenario, in the Target Scenario there are increases in the use of final renewable energy in all sectors, i.e. agriculture, industry, residential and services. o According Table A.13, seemingly, the only sector where the use of end-use renewable energy decreases is transport. In reality, this is due to the fact that the figure shown does not include the electricity contribution, which is included under the electricity generation heading. Therefore, the high penetration of electrically-propelled vehicles is not directly reflected in this table, but is instead included within renewable electricity generation. o The gains in energy saving and efficiency increase the contribution from renewable energy in percentage terms, because of their effect on reducing final energy consumption.  The sectoral disaggregation of renewable energy is shown below.  Renewable energy in heating and cooling applications  Heating and cooling applications include the following sectors: residential, service and industrial. Table A.14 shows the results from this contribution.  Table A.14. Percentage of renewable energy in heating and cooling  Percentage of renewable energy in heating and cooling applications Years 2015* 2020 2025 2030 Baseline Scenario 17% 18% 22% 25% Target Scenario 17% 18% 25% 31% *The 2015 data are real; the rest are projections prepared by MITECO Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019  In the results from the table above, and in a manner consistent with the development of the global percentage, the Target Scenario shows a higher percentage of renewable energy in heating and cooling. The main conclusions in this regard are presented below:   The promotion of the use of end-use renewable energy, such as biomass, biogas and solar thermal energy, has a significant impact on the increase in this percentage. The increased use of heat pumps for air conditioning also has a significant impact. This effect is especially noted in the Target Scenario, since it is more economically viable to introduce heat pumps in dwellings.ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  235 Transport Table A.15 shows the percentages of renewable energy in the transport sector with respect to their final energy consumption. To this end, both the percentages obtained by direct calculation, i.e. determining the ratio of the contribution of renewables in transport to total final consumption in this sector, and the percentages obtained by applying the considerations of Directive 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources have been represented. In the latter, corrections are applied to aviation final consumption, and multipliers to advanced biofuels and biogas and renewable electricity.  Table A.15. Percentage of renewable energy in the transport sector  Percentage of renewable energy in the transport sector Calculation method Scenario 2015* 2020 2025 2030  Directive 2018/2001 Baseline Scenario 1% 10% 10% 11% Target Scenario 1% 10% 15% 28%  Straight percentage Baseline Scenario 1% 7% 7% 7% Target Scenario 1% 7% 8% 11% * The 2015 data are real; the rest are projections prepared by MITECO Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019  As can be observed in the table above, the compulsory national target of 14% for the share of renewable energy in transport for 2030, established in Directive 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, is met comfortably, reaching a percentage of 28% in 2030.  On the other hand, it is important to note that compliance with the 2020 target of 10% renewable energy in transport is verified in both the Baseline Scenario and the Target Scenario. This is achieved mainly through the use of biofuels.  It should be noted that the percentage of renewable energy in transport corresponding to 2015 is reduced due to the fact that the biofuel sustainability certification procedure was still not approved. For this reason, the consumption of biofuels without sustainability certification could not be included in the calculation of this percentage. This situation is apparent when analysing the information available on actual biofuel consumption for 2016, the figure for which is 5.3%.  The main differences between both scenarios are analysed next, resulting in a very significant increase in the presence of renewable energy in transport:   Modal shift to more efficient modes of transport. The change of mode of transport in the Target Scenario towards collective means of transport results in a much more efficient sector. Accelerated introduction of electrified vehicles in the Target Scenario. In 2030, there will be about 3 million electric passenger cars and over 2 million motorcycles, light trucks and buses in the vehicle fleet. These vehicles will total 5 million units. The introduction of electric mobility is gradual, going from the current values until it reaches this figure in 2030. It is important to bear in mind that electrified vehicles count in the percentage of renewable energy in transport in the proportion to which the electricity mix generates ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  236 electricity using renewable energy sources. Increase in mobility by means of electrified rail transport. This also has significant importance, provided that, as in the point above, the electricity generation comes from renewable energy sources. Use of advanced biofuels and biogas. The contribution of these fuels produced from the raw materials listed in Annex IX, part A of Directive 2018/2001 meets the minimum requirement. Table A.16 shows the different limits established in Directive 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, as well as the degree of compliance with these limits. As can be seen from the data presented, the minimum and maximum levels set by the Directive for the contribution of biogas and biofuels in 2030 are met.  Table A.16.

In the latter case, a renewable contribution of 74% is achieved by 2030, a value obtained simply by dividing the renewable energy supplied by the system by the total energy. ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  237 Below is a more detailed explanation of the electricity sector, since this is one of the most important components contributing to the decarbonisation of the energy system, as well as to meeting the renewable energy target.  Electricity sector  Firstly, the installed capacity of the different generation technologies is presented in the Baseline Scenario.  In the Baseline Scenario, the total installed capacity in Spanish territory increases from 114.5 GW in 2020 to 126 GW in 2030, representing a 10% increase during this period (11.7 GW). The main increases come from wind (onshore and offshore) and solar photovoltaic technologies, with around 10 GW each. It should be underlined that 100% of the nuclear thermal capacity remains in operation at the end of the period in this Baseline Scenario, compared to the installed capacity in 2020. In the case of coal, the closure of a series of plants scheduled for the end of 2020 is incorporated as a result of the application of European standards. This fact is reflected in the figure for 2025, and this capacity is maintained until the end of the decade.  Table A.18.

This heading therefore includes both active and inactive facilities.  In the Target Scenario, total installed capacity increases to 161 GW in 2030, representing an increase of 44% during this period (49 GW), as well as 30% more than in the same year in the Baseline Scenario. Similar to what was shown in the Baseline Scenario, the main increases come from wind (onshore and offshore) and solar photovoltaic technologies, with approximately 22 GW and 30 GW respectively. It must be remembered that although the renewable energy totals are agreed by the INECP, the relative figures from the different technologies are indicative and liable to modification according to technological developments, costs and availability of different technologies. Likewise, these figures include different typologies of existing and future technologies, e.g. including, but ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  238 not limited to: distributed generation and conventional generation capacity, onshore and offshore wind capacity, large photovoltaic generation plants and small individual installations.

This capacity, which offers greater power dispatch capability, will be complemented by the staggered introduction of storage devices (batteries) into the system, the aim of which must be to reduce wastage and maximise the production capacity of non-dispatchable renewable technologies. These batteries will have a capacity equivalent to approximately 2.5 storage at full charge. There was an increase in other renewable technologies in the period under consideration, reaching a value of 80 MW, including geothermal and marine energy. In sum, renewable capacity is increased by about 59 GW in the period 2021-2030, and total renewable capacity in 2030 is 122.7 GW. On the other hand, in the period 2021-2030 there is a decrease in the installed capacity of the nuclear power plants greater than 4 GW (the capacity corresponding to four reactors of the seven currently in operation). This decrease is part of the organised, phased and flexible closure plan for the existing nuclear reactors, which foresees the closure of another three reactors in the period between 2031 and 2035. There is also the termination of electricity generation from any coal-fired power plants that may continue to operate beyond 2020 (a maximum of five or six of the 15 currently in existence), by 2030 at the latest. In any case, it is not totally ruled out that part of the installed capacity will be maintained where investments have been made to comply with the Community framework although, given the current circumstances in the sector, a decrease in the installed capacity of coal-fired power plants is expected. ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  239 The main reason for this termination prior to 2030 will be the difficulty for coal-fired power plants to continue to be profitable in a setting that is strongly conditioned by the European response to climate change, in which the price of a tonne of CO2 will be at least EUR 35. At any rate, the termination of electricity generation at coal-fired power plants is considered essential for 1990. It should also be noted that there are plans to repower the entire renewable system currently in existence after its service life ends, maintaining the renewal and hybridisation measures in existing projects included in the present INECP. It must be stated that the primary objective of the electricity system is to guarantee the electricity supply to consumers, in optimal conditions of service quality and security. According to the feasibility studies carried out in relation to the proposed generation system, it will not be necessary to install additional backup thermal capacity as a supplement to the generation mix obtained with the TIMES-Sinergia model61. In any case, as system operator, REE will at all times seek to ensure the correct operation of the transmission and distribution networks, as well as the guarantee of electricity supply. Finally, as explained above, the high penetration of renewable capacity in the electricity generation system will be accompanied by the following actions:  promoting the necessary network infrastructure; maximising the use of the available access capacity by means of efficient capacity allocation procedures; simplifying the administrative and environmental processing for installation authorisations, so that this processing does not turn into an obstacle for the construction of generation installations and the infrastructure needed to commission them, especially in the case of repowering; reviewing the operation of the electricity market, if this is considered necessary, as a potential.Having explained the generation system, the results regarding electricity generation are shown below62:                                                               61 As can be confirmed in Annex D, the electricity generation system resulting from the TIMES-Sinergia model has been analysed by Red Eléctrica de España. 62 The generation values corresponding to 2015 are based on the values reported to Eurostat for that year, having made the necessary estimations according to the breakdown presented.

CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  242 Main conclusions related to the Target Scenario:   Final electricity demand increases from 240.5 TWh in 2020 to 249.2 TWh in 2030, rising by 4%. The net balance at the border is clearly export in 2030, totalling 40 TWh. This balance is driven by the high penetration of renewable capacity in the system. The percentage of renewable generation in the electricity sector experiences a 32-percentage-point increase during this period, going from 42% in 2020 to 74% in 2030.Thus, looking at both scenarios together, Baseline and Target, for 2030, it is important to highlight the main differences:   Total installed capacity of 124 GW compared to 161 GW, i.e. over 36 GW more of installed capacity in the Target Scenario compared to the Baseline Scenario. Net increase of renewable capacity of 62.3 GW in the Target Scenario compared to the 20 GW in the Baseline Scenario. Organised, phased and flexible closure of nuclear facilities, affecting four reactors during -fired power plants. On the other hand, the service life of all nuclear facilities is extended in the Baseline Scenario and it is assumed that coal-fired power plants that remain after 2021 are fully operational. Higher gross electricity demand in the Target Scenario, amounting to 38.3 TWh (12% increase compared to the Baseline). Higher percentage of renewable generation in the electricity sector in the Target Scenario: 74%, equivalent to 23 percentage points above what would be achieved in the Baseline Scenario. The net balance at the border strengthens its exporting role in the Target Scenario.
