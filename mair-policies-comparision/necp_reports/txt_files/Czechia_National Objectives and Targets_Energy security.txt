2.3  i. The elements set out in Article 4(c) 2.3.1.1 Cross-cutting targets Diversification targets are summarised in the target corridors of the State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic.

Ensuring self-sufficiency in electricity generation, based in particular on advanced conventional technologies with high efficiency of conversion and increasing share of renewable and secondary sources.  Gradual decline in electricity exports and maintaining the balance between +/- 10 % of domestic consumption in line with the conditions of the internal market.  Maintaining a positive power balance and ensuring the adequacy of the power reserves and control outputs (providing for the necessary support services) and permanently ensuring the power adequacy of -5 % to +15 % of the maximum load of the electricity system (free available capacity according to the ENTSO-E methodology).  Ensure a systematic solution to the loop electricity flows and transit from a safety and cost compensation perspective.  Ensure diversification of primary energy sources in accordance with the target corridors of the State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic, which, inter alia, means the continued development of nuclear energy in the Czech Republic. 2.3.1.3 Gas sector In the gas sector, the Czech Republic has the following main targets:  Ensure diversification of gas sources and transport routes through the implementation of planned infrastructure projects as well as the effective functioning of domestic gas storage facilities.  Ensure effective access to transit capacities for natural gas supplies to Czech consumers.  Permanently ensure the ability of reverse flow and the renewal and development of the gas transmission system. Ensure capacities for an increase in natural gas supply (increase necessary for heat supply, electricity generation and transport).  Maintain and potentially further strengthen the transit role of the Czech Republic in gas transmission.  Support projects ensuring the capacity of gas storage facilities in the Czech Republic at 3540 % of annual gas consumption and deliverability guaranteed for at least 70 % of the peak daily consumption in the winter. Create conditions for the reverse flow of the transmission system and the capacity to deliver gas from the North or the West of at least 40 million m3 per day.  Support financially and institutionally both the transformation of existing biogas stations to biomethane production, synthetic gas production stations and hydrogen production equipment, and new biomethane stations including their connection to the gas system.  Provide for the connection and potential gas transmission and distribution capacities for substitution of coal with gas for large customers (heat plants).                                                            31  Under this target, nuclear fuel is considered as an imported resource. For this reason, this value is not directly comparable to the value given in the analytical annexes to this document, because according to the energy balance, it includes nuclear reaction heat, which is not imported by definition.  -58-   In connection with the decarbonisation targets, prepare the gas transmission and distribution system for a higher share of new gas types and sector coupling. 2.3.1.4 Oil sector In the oil sector, the Czech Republic has the following main targets:  Support other projects increasing the diversification of oil and petroleum product supplies to the Czech Republic, e.g. increasing the capacity of the TAL oil pipeline, construction of an oil pipeline connection between the Litv√≠nov and Leuna (Spergau) refineries.  Support the development and strengthening of the existing system for oil transport to the Czech Republic in order to provide for and maintain sufficient transport capacity for the needs of refineries in the Czech Republic and, in cooperation with other countries (Slovakia, Ukraine, Russia), maintain the operability of the entire transmission system built in the past at high costs.  Preserve two functional supply routes for the transport of oil to the Czech Republic from two s oil security.  Maintain emergency stocks of oil and petroleum products in accordance with the new calculation methodology under Council Directive 2009/119/EC of at least 90 days of net imports and verify their availability for crisis use.  Ensure that oil processing capacities in the Czech Republic are permanently operational at least at 50 % of usual domestic consumption. 2.3.1.5 Heating sector In the heating sector, the Czech Republic has the following main targets:  As a priority, maintain economically efficient and energy-efficient heat supply systems.  Cover at least 60 % of heat supply from heat supply systems by high-efficiency cogeneration.  Renewal, transformation and stabilisation of heat supply systems, based primarily on national sources (nuclear, coal, RES, secondary sources) supplemented with natural gas.   Promote the transition of especially medium and small heat supply systems, multi-fuel systems using locally available biomass, natural gas, or, if applicable, other fuels, where especially natural gas will play the role of a stabilising and supplementary fuel.  Create conditions in heat supply systems for the efficient use of heat from renewable and secondary energy sources available at regional and local levels.  Provide for the necessary long-term supply of coal for the heat sector in a situation of decreasing exploitable reserves using legislative and regulatory measures, while respecting competition rules, giving priority to increasing efficiency and savings.  Significant increase in the recovery of waste in waste energy recovery facilities in order to achieve a high recovery rate of the incinerable component of waste after sorting by 2024.   Promote the use of preferably larger heating plants for regulatory services.  Create conditions for heating plants in island operations of individual areas to play their role in emergency situations.   Ensure the integration of smaller heat plants into smart grids and decentralised management.  Support and develop the energy supply capability in local (island) subsystems in the event of a system breakdown due to large-scale failures caused by natural events or terrorist or cyber attacks to the extent necessary to ensure the minimum supply to the population and maintain the functioning of critical infrastructure.  -59-   In connection with the ongoing decentralisation of electricity sources, it will be necessary to ensure the overall flexibility of the energy system. From this perspective, heating sources should be more involved in the provision of support services at the distribution and transmission system level. At the same time, thanks to the possibility of using cogeneration, production sources contribute to flexible electricity supplies; on the other hand, technology such as electric boilers and heat pumps have the potential to increase the ability to control electricity generation/consumption. ii. National objectives with regard to increasing: the diversification of energy sources and supply from third countries for the purpose of increasing the resilience of regional and national energy systems  The Czech Republic has a relatively well diversified energy mix. The targets for the diversification of energy sources are mainly incorporated in the target corridors of the State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic (see Chapter 2.3.1.1). With regards to the targets concerning the supply of energy commodities from third countries, more information is provided in point (iii) of this Chapter (see also Table 6).  iii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to reducing energy import dependency from third countries, for the purpose of increasing the resilience of regional and national energy systems Table 6 shows strategic targets of the State Energy Policy. In relation to reducing the dependence on energy imports / increasing the diversification of consumed (imported) resources, the following targets (or, more precisely, quantifiable indicators) can be emphasised.  ensure permanent self-sufficiency in electricity supply at a minimum level of 90 %;  reduce and sustain the diversification of primary energy sources below 0.25;  reduce and sustain the diversification of gross electricity generation below 0.35;  reduce and sustain the diversification of imports below 0.30;  reduce the share of energy imports in gross value added below 2010 levels;  stabilise the effect of energy imports on the balance of payments. iv. National objectives with regard to increasing the flexibility of the national energy system, in particular by means of deploying domestic energy sources, demand response and energy storage Possible measures in this area will depend on the implementation of new national legislation, especially discussion, specifically the revised texts of the draft regulations and the Internal Electricity Market Directive
