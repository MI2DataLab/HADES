  2 National objectives and targets 2.1 Decarbonisation dimension 2.1.1 Greenhouse gas emissions and removals i. Greenhouse gas emission reduction target, ESR and LULUCF National targets consist of targets the government has established for the Netherlands and targets that constitute a national interpretation of European policy. National targets in the Climate Act The national climate targets are established in the Climate Act (see Chapter 1.2 ii). The Climate Act focuses on CO2. This means that it is not based on sub-targets such as the share of renewable energy and energy savings. The focus on CO2 strives to base policy on the most efficient solutions. Renewable energy and energy savings are part of these solutions, but the final scenario is left open, in line with the principles of technology neutrality and cost efficiency. Focusing on the national target of a 49% CO2 reduction means that sectors that participate in the European ETS system (mainly industry and electricity) make a contribution to the national target. A 49% reduction by 2030 is consistent with a gradual emissions reduction pathway to achieve a 95% reduction in emissions by 2050. This long-term perspective makes a gradual transition possible, prevents shock effects and ensures that we can take advantage of economic opportunities. Since the outcome of international talks is not yet known, the ultimate 2030 national target may differ from the 49% emissions reduction currently assumed by the government. Obligations arising from the translation of European policy The European target of a 40% reduction by 2030 compared with 1990 has also been translated into obligations for national Member States for the non-ETS sectors. For the Netherlands, this means a national reduction requirement of 36% by 2030 compared with 2005 in non-ETS sectors. The "no net-debit" rule applies to the LULUCF target, which means that under the application of the accounting rules of the LULUCF Regulation, the Netherlands may not have any net emissions for the cumulation of all LULUCF accounting categories. It is expected that the package of measures used to achieve the national target will also suffice to comply with national targets arising from these European obligations. If the European target is increased to 55% in accordance with Dutch policy, this will also be translated into targets for the European ETS and national non-ETS targets. It is not yet possible to determine how this will relate to the national target of 49% and the current non-ETS target.

This includes the effects of the circular economy policy. For the discussions about the Climate Agreement, indicative CO2 reduction challenges for the five sectors comprising industry, mobility, the built-up environment, electricity, agriculture and land use were formulated, based on national cost-effectiveness. Below we discuss the targets in these five sectors. Electricity Combating climate change requires a climate-neutral electricity system. It must take into account increasing demand for electricity that exists because other sectors, such as industry and mobility, are switching from fossil fuels to electricity, partly due to climate policy. The limited availability of renewable sources in the Netherlands is an important point of concern. The technical possibilities for generating climate-neutral electricity are limited. Since the Netherlands is located along the coast and the wind is relatively strong, this offers potential for wind energy on land and offshore. The approach thus focuses on these sources: i. Generating circa 49 TWh wind energy offshore by 2030; ii. Generating 35 TWh of renewable energy (wind energy and solar power) on land; iii. Small-scale generation of renewable electricity from, for example, private solar panels, good for circa 10 TWh. With this commitment, the share of renewable electricity of total electricity generated in 2030 is expected to amount to 70 percent. Due to the transition to renewable sources, electricity generation will be more dependent on weather conditions. In order to be able to guarantee supply security with an energy mix largely consisting of wind and solar power, a growing need for flexibility is required, which will be achieved via the market. It is also relevant from the point of view of security of supply that sufficient controllable power is provided, which will increasingly have to be CO2 free. Mobility In the future mobility system all modes will ultimately be clean. This requires a fundamental change in the way we approach mobility and transport and our goods. An approach aiming to set this change in motion must also include all aspects of our current mobility. For the transition to an emission-free mobility system, the fuels used are crucial. The concern involves adequate availability of sustainable energy carriers, such as electricity, biofuels and green hydrogen. Electric cars will become competitive and charging infrastructure will be optimised. Using public transport and the bicycle will be more appealing, use of shared mobility will increase and people will work in a more flexible manner (and increasingly from home). This will reduce the need for work-related traffic and thus the daily pressure of traffic jams on the infrastructure and the environment. Because not all the necessary technology is available immediately in an intermediate phase, heavier road transport in logistics will use sustainable biofuels. Afterwards, this sector will also make the transition to electricity or green hydrogen as an energy carrier. Multi-modal hubs, where different forms of transport come together, play a key role in an alternative logistics system that is more efficient and more sustainable. In inland waterways, shipping agreements have been made on accelerating sustainability34, and aviation will also have to gradually change. Collaboration partnerships in the field of sustainable mobility will also take a different form. Central and regional governments will jointly compile mobility plans in which collective efforts will be made to work towards an integrated mobility system. Industry By 2050, the Netherlands will be home to a flourishing circular and world-leading industry where greenhouse gas emissions are virtually zero. The challenge for industry requires a future-oriented public-private approach in which the business community invests in a sustainable future, which the authorities facilitate and support in a targeted manner and in which the focus is on creating value (some of it new value). The emissions reduction target plays a key role. To achieve this while retaining our prosperity, a transition is                                                  34 https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/kamerstukken/2019/06/11/green-deal-zeevaart-binnenvaart-en-havens Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    needed with the development of new activities, the conversion of existing ones and the reduction of activities that are no longer consistent with a climate-neutral and circular economy in 2050. The transition to a new climate-neutral industry is a system change that requires coordination and collaboration between national actors: the basic and manufacturing industries, other actors in the chain, governments and knowledge institutions. Industry can shape the transition with measures such as process efficiency, energy savings, CCS, electrification, the use of blue and green hydrogen and the acceleration of circularity (such as plastics recycling, bio-based raw materials or basic chemicals). Blue hydrogen (a combination of electricity generated using fossil fuels and CCS), green hydrogen (based on electricity generated from renewable sources) and the circular economy are the ultimate themes with which the Netherlands can distinguish itself internationally. Transformation processes take place in the region. This is where the synergy between businesses must be organised; where the connection to, for example, the demand for heat in the built-up environment is established. A large share of industrial emissions originates from regional clusters. It concerns Rotterdam/Moerdijk, Zeeland (Terneuzen and the surrounding area), North Sea canal area, Noord-Nederland (Eemshaven-Delfzijl and Emmen) and Chemelot (Geleen region). The twelve large energy-intensive companies, which are collectively responsible for over 60% of industrial CO2 emissions in the Netherlands, occupy key positions in these five industrial clusters. In each of the five industrial regions, a multi-year industrial frontrunner programme is being developed, partly with the support of central government, in which efficiency improvements go hand in hand with increased sustainability of raw material consumption and CO2 reductions. Many of the reduction options are found in the demonstration and innovation phase and will only have an effect over time. It is expected that industry will have to invest between nine and fifteen billion euros to actually implement these projects. Built-up environment The Netherlands is shifting away from using natural gas. Homes and other buildings in the Netherlands will be made more energy-efficient and more comfortable in a gradual, sustainable transformation of the built-up environment. There will be a shift from fossil heat sources, such as the traditional central heating boiler, to natural gas-free alternatives such as heat pumps, residual heat or geothermal energy. This helps achieve the established climate targets and makes it possible to speed up the rate at which gas extraction is reduced in Groningen. The greatest challenge in the built-up environment lies in insulating existing buildings and making them natural gas-free, with over 1.5 million homes and other buildings by 2030. These include privately owned homes, rented homes and non-residential buildings. By 2050, all seven million-plus homes and one million other buildings must be more sustainable. The approach to make the built-up environment more sustainable follows two tracks: supporting and unburdening individual homeowners and a district-oriented approach. An insight into the (technical) possibilities and effective forms of funding are important to support individual homeowners and unburden them with regard to making their homes more sustainable. A standard per housing type which includes sustainability requirements will provide people with an idea of the efforts involved in making their home more sustainable. This standard will be translated into target values per insulation measure. The latter will indicate whether a measure is appropriate for a "no regrets" conversion; this means the measure concerned will, in any case, pay for itself. A wide range of appealing, applicable and responsible funding options will be developed. They will provide all groups of homeowners with an action perspective to start work on their home. There will also be a district-oriented approach. Each district is unique, and the challenge goes further than homes alone: entrepreneurs, such as the baker on the corner, must be supported in making their business more sustainable. Some alternative heat sources - such as a heat grid - can best be applied at the district level. A district-oriented approach makes it possible to bundle demand, which enables (possibly consortia of) builders, installers and other providers of energy-saving measures to offer concepts and scale-ups that unburden the customer. Therefore, it is obvious that a city-centre district that is densely built-up and also has many businesses requires a different approach to a green, newly-built district on the edge of a municipality. Municipalities will manage the district approach and provide local customisation. Municipalities assume the directive role in the transition to gas-free districts. In a diligent process that involves district residents they will have to weigh up the best solution per district, if houses are no longer heated using natural gas. The solution may differ per district. By 2020 at the latest, central government and local and regional authorities will draft a procedure related to the way in which adjustments will be made if the plans in the context of the transition visions for heat collectively appear to be insufficient in making Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    1.5 million homes and other buildings natural gas-free by 2030. Two preconditions are essential to make over 1.5 million homes and other buildings more sustainable by 2030: the speed at which the process to make the built-up environment more sustainable can be implemented and the related costs. The aim to bring housing cost neutrality within reach for an increasing number of households: this means the costs of measures to increase sustainability can be recouped via the energy bill. This can be achieved through cost reduction, an affordable energy bill, grants and attractive funding. The Climate Agreement includes an indicative allocation of CO2 targets for sectors. For the built-up environment this is 3.4 Mton of additional CO2 reduction by 203035. According to this indicative allocation, maximum CO2 emissions in 2030 amount to 15.3 Mton for the built-up environment. For the other indicative milestones related to the built-up environment we refer the reader to 2.2.ii. Agriculture and land use Sustainable agriculture is important for a good food supply, a healthy environment and a robust business model for entrepreneurs. Current greenhouse gas emissions are primarily caused by the release of the so-called other greenhouse gases, methane and nitrous oxide, in livestock farming and CO2 from burning fossil fuels in greenhouse horticulture. Methane and nitrous oxide, the so-called other greenhouse gases, are converted into CO2 equivalents. In livestock farming reductions can be achieved by adapting livestock housing (including manure storage), feeding and breeding animals, and effective processing of the manure. This is possible, for example, through methane oxidation or mono-manure fermentation. Emissions can be reduced in greenhouse horticulture through energy savings, generating renewable energy and using residual heat and CO2 supplied by third parties. In this sector, emissions and capture through land use are also examined, in addition to emissions from agricultural activities. Examples include the release of CO2 as a result of the oxidation of peat meadow areas and organic matter from agricultural soil, as well as CO2 capture in the soil and in forests and other biomass. This means it is important that trees are planted, deforestation and the oxidisation of peatland due to drainage are reduced and that forest and agricultural land are managed using a climate-smart approach. What's more, the agricultural and forestry sector plays a major role in expanding the range of sustainable biomass that can be used as food or as a raw material in other sectors. Therefore, it is important that the biomass chain is extended where possible. In addition we must bear in mind that biomass is also important in agriculture for soil fertility and the carbon stock in the soil. The government's vision on circular farming and the implementation plan focuses on robust and sustainable agriculture, which adopts a more efficient approach to raw materials and the environment, and that is valued more from a social and ecological perspective. The success of circular farming requires radical transitions in all agricultural sectors. i. Other national objectives and targets, including sectoral objectives and climate adaptation National Climate Adaptation Strategy (NAS) In December 2016, the government adopted the National Climate Adaptation Strategy (NAS).36 The NAS comprises all climate adaptation policies and supplements the Delta Programme. The Delta Programme focuses on mitigating the effects of climate change related to the water system, such as a rise in sea levels, the increase of prolonged rainfall and the resulting increase in river discharge and flooding in regional water systems, peak rainfall, drought and heat (as well as a combination of these elements). The Delta Programme is a large-scale, inter-administrative programme in which central government, the provinces, water boards and municipalities work together under the leadership of the Delta Commissioner. The Implementation Programme for the NAS (UP NAS 2018-2019) was completed in April 2018.37 The UP NAS contains a number of priorities that focus on those sectors and themes that have not yet been sufficiently mapped out, including heat stress, agriculture, nature and the built-up environment. The Delta Programme The Delta Programme is by far the Netherlands' largest national climate adaptation programme and covers a significant share of the impacts of climate change for the Netherlands. Every year, led by the Delta Commissioner, a Delta Programme is compiled and presented by the government to parliament as part of the IenW (Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management) budget. The                                                  35 This is based on the National Energy Report 2017 36 For more information see: https://ruimtelijkeadaptatie.nl/nas/. 37 See: https://ruimtelijkeadaptatie.nl/nas/ Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    Delta Programme contains an overview of new scientific insights, reports on the progress and proposals for new policy agreements and implementation programmes for the themes of water security, freshwater supply and spatial adaptation.38 One important milestone in the Delta Programme takes the form of the Delta Plan on Spatial Adaptation (September 2017), which aims to ensure the Netherlands is climate-proof and water-resilient in spatial terms by 2050.39 To achieve this, central government, provinces, municipalities and water boards must act in a climate-proof and water-resilient manner as of 2020. Circular Economy The Coalition Agreement states that agreements in the state-wide programme for the circular economy and the transition agendas in the Raw Materials Agreement will be implemented as part of the climate challenge. The aim of these agreements is to achieve a fully circular economy in the Netherlands by 2050, with the intermediate target of a reduction of 50% of primary raw materials consumption by 2030. Hydrogen Programme It was agreed in the Climate Agreement that the Netherlands would start a hydrogen programme. This programme will focus primarily on unlocking the supply of green hydrogen, developing the necessary infrastructure and cooperating with various sector programmes, and facilitating ongoing initiatives and projects. This programme also promotes synergy between infrastructure and the use of sustainable (both blue and green) hydrogen. It is crucial that already in the short term this programme focuses on gradually scaling up the generation of green hydrogen from renewable electricity. The reasons for this are:  The necessary large-scale generation of green hydrogen requires a rapid price reduction of electrolysers and the price of renewable electricity. For the electrolysers it is expected that by 2030 the market parties involved can achieve a reduction of 65% on the capex of escaling up to 3-4 GW of installed electrolysis capability.40 Linked to expectations regarding the cost of renewable electricity generation, green hydrogen can be competitive over time.  Sufficient supplies of renewable electricity are needed to satisfy the growing demand for green hydrogen. Attention also needs to be devoted to a certain link between the growth of electrolysis capacity and the growth of offshore wind energy. In this context, consideration must be given to how the capacity, deployment and locations of electrolysis installations can contribute to the integration of renewable electricity in the energy system. The consequences related to infrastructure will be included in the Integrated Infrastructure Outlook 2030-2050 that Gasunie and TenneT will conduct in 2020.  Given the Netherlands' excellent starting position with regard to the generation and deployment of green hydrogen, the Netherlands can assume a prominent position in this field if our country leads the way in this development.  The ambition of this programme is to have achieved 3-4 GW installed electrolyser capacity by 2030, in which the development must be consistent with the additional growth in the share of renewable electricity. Moreover, the programme will focus on developing optimal hydrogen infrastructure. During the period up to 2025, it is expected that there will be a need for regional infrastructure for green hydrogen in the different industrial clusters and energy clusters. With an installed capacity of 3-4 GW, there will also be a need for hydrogen storage and a connection to several clusters. This is largely possible with (adapted) existing natural gas infrastructure. On this basis over the coming years, preparations will be made to achieve nationwide basic infrastructure for green hydrogen (transport and storage). Leading up to 2030 this programme will consist of the following distinctive phases and objectives:  2019-2021: Preparatory programme for rolling out green hydrogen, including the many ongoing initiatives and projects as the basis, ending with an evaluation to optimise the continued development and targets of the subsequent phases;  2022-2025: Based on the results of the first phase, especially if the electrolysis cost reduction and the commitment of the parties involved provide an adequate basis, scaling up to a potential 500 MW of installed electrolysis capacity,                                                  38 The annual Delta Programme can be found on the website of the Delta Commissioner, www.deltacommissaris.nl. For the 2019 Delta Programme, see https://www.deltacommissaris.nl/deltaprogramma/deltaprogramma-2019 39 Also see: https://deltaprogramma2018.deltacommissaris.nl/viewer/chapter/1/2-deltaprogramma-/chapter/deltaplan-ruimtelijke-adaptatie. 40 The capex currently covers around 30-35% of the cost of electrolysis. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    combined with the development of the demand for hydrogen and regional infrastructure, and a connection to the different clusters;  2026-2030: Scaling up to 3-4 GW of installed electrolysis capacity, connection to storage locations, expansion of infrastructure, including subject to the extra growth of renewable electricity. -40 million a year extra for demo facilities and pilots, from the funds in the climate envelope, for industry and electricity, where possible via existing schemes and funding options. Synergy with the focus on electrochemical conversion is also sought for innovation programmes. Inclusion in the SDE++ will apply when hydrogen is competitive in terms of price with other options in the scheme. The price development of hydrogen will be examined annually. Clean Air Agreement The government's ambition is to bring about a continuous improvement of air quality together with local and regional authorities in order to achieve health benefits for everyone in the Netherlands. This ambition is outlined in the Clean Air Agreement, which will be established by the government in association with local and regional authorities. Citizens and businesses will also be involved in its implementation. Therefore, the government will reserve funds for implementing the measures in the draft budget 2020.41 The Clean Air Agreement strives for a downward trend in emissions to the air in all sectors to achieve health gains of 50% by 2030 from emissions originating from Dutch sources compared with 2016. This contributes to achieving the WHO recommended values in 2030. 2.1.2 Renewable energy i. Contribution to the binding EU target of at least 32% renewable energy by 2030 In the European context, with the Netherlands' support, European targets have been agreed for renewable energy (32%) and energy savings (32.5%). The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions plays a major role in the Netherlands' climate and energy policy. Renewable energy and energy savings are important possibilities for achieving the CO2 reduction targets. Expected share of renewable energy The expectation according to the KEV 2019 forecast is that by 2030, the Netherlands will achieve a 24.9% share of renewable energy (bandwidth 20.2%-26.7%). However, not all measures in this field are included in the KEV 2019, such as one of the planned offshore wind farms, increasing the sustainability of heat supplies and a large number of measures in the Climate Agreement focusing on energy savings. Consequently, the expectation is that the share of renewable energy will ultimately be higher than estimated in the KEV 2019. Based on the mid-term estimate of 24.9% in the KEV 2019, the PBL estimates that the share of renewable energy in 2030, including the measures of the Climate Agreement, will amount to 30% - 32%. The European Commission has indicated that a contribution of 26% by the Netherlands is considered reasonable. In any case, the Netherlands is focusing on achieving 27% as a contribution to the European target in the field of renewable energy. The intention is to achieve this contribution through the indicative process agreed at a European level in which the contribution in 2022 is at least 16.3%, 19.6% in 2025 and 22.5% in 2027. For 2020, an expected renewable energy share of 11.4% will result from the KEV 2019; this means that the European renewable energy target of 14% is out of reach. The government is doing everything it can to achieve the target of 14%. For this purpose, the government announced an additional package of measures on 1 November 2019.42 The government is also examining all possible measures that could make up the deficit in 2020, which does not exclude foreign options. These measures are in addition to the extra measures the government took recently in the context of Urgenda and measures like an extension of the net-metering scheme43 and the approach to bottlenecks in the electricity grid.                                                  41 It implements the agreement in the Coalition Agreement to arrive at a national air quality action plan and the Veldhoven motion (Parliamentary document 34 550 XII, no. 46) 42 Parliamentary document 32 813, no. 400 43 Letter to Parliament on the Further elaboration of phasing out the net-metering scheme, Parliamentary document 31 239, no. 305 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030     Offshore wind energy Renewable on land (>15 kW) Other renewable options (incl. CO2-free adjustable capacity) Total ii. Estimated trajectories for the share of renewable energy in the electricity, heating and cooling, and transport sectors The government is committed to increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix between 2020 and 2030. The indicative trajectory of the Dutch contribution to the EU renewable energy target between 2021 and 2030 is non-linear due to the nature of large-scale renewable energy projects, which are completed intermittently. Electricity The indicative challenge in the Climate Agreement for the electricity sector is first and foremost to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 20.2 Mton by 2030. This will specifically involve scaling up electricity generation using renewable sources to 84 TWh. The measures and actions required to achieve this are detailed in specific agreements on renewable on land and offshore wind energy (see 3.1.2). The intended transition to increase generation using renewable sources requires a close link to the increased sustainability of the other sectors. See below the intended distribution between electricity generation techniques: Table 1 Ambitions for generating electricity from renewable sources in 2030  Heating and cooling The Climate Agreement cites the following main tracks for heating and cooling: i. Built-up environment In the context of making the built-up environment more sustainable, it has been agreed that a gradual, sustainable transformation of the built-up environment will be implemented. There will be a shift from fossil heat sources, such as the traditional central heating boiler, to natural gas-free alternatives such as heat pumps, residual heat or geothermal energy. First of all, new homes will no longer be connected to the natural gas network. The objective is to make 1.5 million existing homes and other buildings natural gas-free by 2030. In addition a district-oriented approach will be adopted as a result of which, in 2021 municipalities will have a heat plan that provides direction for the transition. The Heat Act will impose renewable source requirements on the heat supplied to homes. The requirements will be periodically tightened so that the heat supplied will be generated entirely by renewable sources by 2050. In the Climate Agreement it was agreed that by 2030, CO2 intensity of the heat supplied will be reduced by 70% compared with the current central heating boiler. 2. Industry Industry can bring about the transition using measures such as process efficiency, energy savings, electrification, and the use of blue and green hydrogen. Transformation processes take place in the region. This is where the synergy between businesses must be organised and where the link with, for example, the demand for heat in the built-up environment must also be established. The quantity of residual heat available from industry is estimated at 50 petajoules. The elaboration of the regional energy strategies must reveal whether this residual heat can be used. 3. Agriculture Emissions could be reduced in greenhouse horticulture through energy savings, generating renewable energy, using residual heat and CO2 supplied by third parties. In the Climate Agreement it was agreed that by 2030 at the latest, parties will endeavour to supply 10 petajoules of external heat to the greenhouse horticulture sector on an annual basis. The geothermal energy sector has already committed to scaling up geothermal energy in greenhouse horticulture as well as the built-up environment via the Geothermal Heat Master Plan. There are currently 17 such projects in which geothermal energy is used by greenhouse horticultural businesses. Funding is available from the SDE++ for this purpose. The target is to achieve 35 additional projects in the period up to and including 2030. 49% basic package 55% 49 TWh 120 TWh 35 TWh  Not quantified  84 TWh   Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    Transport People want to be able to travel from A to B safely, quickly and easily. Businesses want their goods to reach their destination quickly and reliably. This will not change, but the way it happens will. Our transport produces a quarter of CO2 emissions. The aim is for all new cars to be emissions free by 2030 at the latest. Consider hydrogen-powered and electric cars. When used, these cars do not emit any greenhouse gases, they keep our air clean and they produce less noise pollution. In the future, the government envisages an important role for hydrogen as the energy carrier in heavy transport, such as trucks, public transport buses and potentially to replace diesel-powered trains, as well as for passenger transport. On the path to zero emissions in 2050, emissions from existing vehicle (including logistics) fleets will be reduced through innovative biofuels. Much biofuel is already being produced from waste products and residual waste. The increase in biofuels must largely be obtained from renewable residual waste (including cascading). This is consistent with the government's objective to use biomass as qualitatively as possible and in developing the circular economy. Therefore, it has been agreed that to achieve this renewable energy target for transport (including the 27 petajoules), no additional biofuel from food and livestock fodder will be used in the Netherlands above the 2020 levels.44 iii. Estimated trajectories for each renewable energy technology Offshore wind energy approach The 2013 Energy Agreement included the ambition to increase the capacity of offshore wind energy to 4.5 GW of installed capacity by 2023. The Offshore Wind Energy Road Map 2030 strives to achieve this at a faster pace. In the coming years, new offshore areas will be designated as potential future parcels for offshore wind energy. In 2018 and 2019, permits were granted for the construction of two new wind farms, both without grants. The Offshore Wind Energy Act is currently being amended to allow the permits for offshore wind energy to be tendered more effectively without a subsidy. There will be improved criteria for granting permits by means of a comparative assessment. It will also be possible to auction permits. In addition, energy - in anticipation of system integration - can be brought ashore in ways other than using electricity cables. The following diagram shows the timetable for future offshore wind farms:45   Renewable on land approach Locations for the small-scale generation of wind energy and solar power give the energy system a strong decentralised character. Electricity generation is shifting from a few central locations to dozens of locations spread throughout the Netherlands. This may require the existing electricity grid to be expanded locally; after all, the electricity grid has a lower capacity in sparsely populated areas. What's more these energy-generating locations consume (scarce) space: this means the effective spatial integration of new energy applications is also important.

The common goal is for, no later than 1 January 2025, all requested permits required to have been issued and for tenders for issuing projects to have been completed with a view to the timely achievement of the related challenge. To ensure adequate volume and to compensate for failed projects greater scope will be sought and planned in the RESes and environmental visions. With regard to cost reduction it is essential that a continuous, stable and predictable pipeline of projects exists for solar and wind energy on land. The basic principle is that in 2025, an SDE+- subsidy will be requested for 35 TWh. iv. Estimated trajectories for bioenergy demand and for biomass supply, including the impact of forest biomass on the LULUCF sink The use of biomass today and leading up to 2030 and 2050 is necessary to make our economy more sustainable and to achieve the climate target. Biomass is used as an energy source in all climate sectors. Biomass is important in agriculture for soil fertility and the carbon stock in the soil. Over time biomass can increasingly serve as a material/raw material. The optimal and thus most efficient use of the available quantity of biomass is desirable to maximise climate gains and increase the economic value of biomass. The basic principle is that only renewable biomass actually contributes to making the economy more sustainable and that renewable biomass on a global level will be scarce in the long term. See Chapter 3.1.2. for more information. v. Other national trajectories and objectives, also in the long term or per sector The Netherlands has decided to completely halt natural gas extraction from the Groningen field. As of 2022, it is expected that only a limited volume will be needed from the Groningen field. This will be reduced to zero over the course of the following years. In the meantime, additional measures have been developed, which in 2020 will already ensure an additional decrease in gas extraction in Groningen by 4.1 billion Nm³ (compared with GTS' estimate of 31 January 2019) to a total of 11.8 billion Nm³ for the coming 2019/2020 gas year, assuming an average year in terms of temperature. This brings the extraction below the level recommended by the Dutch State Supervision of Mines of 12 billion Nm³. Gas extraction in Groningen is expected to decrease to zero from mid-2022 onwards
