 -213-  In this respect, all biomethane from waste materials (i.e. advanced biomethane) injected into the gas network is expected to be consumed within the transport sector (respecting the mass balance approach), while non-advanced biomethane injected into the gas network will be consumed in same proportion as the natural gas. Chapter 2.1.2 part (v) provides information on the expected consumption of biogas, or biomethane, as part of the sold heat. The above is only a summary of a fairly comprehensive analysis that is published in the supporting  Another gas that can be described as renewable when produced from renewable energy sources is hydrogen, which is currently mainly used in industrial production. Hydrogen produced from natural gas by pyrolysis or steam reformation in combination with carbon capture technologies is considered decarbonised gas and caHowever, the potential for using hydrogen in the context of a low-carbon economy is much broader. In particular in the gas sector, the possible injection of hydrogen into the gas infrastructure is being discussed in order to create a mixture that will be further transported to end consumers. However, hydrogen and natural gas have different chemical and physical properties, which results in some parts of the gas infrastructure not being fully prepared for transporting a gas with higher than current hydrogen content. Therefore, the expansion of hydrogen (and other gases from renewables) is subject to research into the behaviour of hydrogen in the infrastructure and the adaptation of the infrastructure needed for storage, transport, distribution and final consumption; this includes potential analysis of the extent to which this infrastructure will need to be modified. The regulatory and legislative frameworks will need to be adapted to further develop hydrogen.  4.3  i.

The results are briefly summarised as follows:  The potential for the development of high-efficiency CHP has been identified especially with smaller sources with power output of up to 10 MWe. The potential will probably lie in increasing the number of micro-cogeneration units (capacity less than 50 kWe), small (capacity less than 1 MWe) and medium-sized CHP-based natural gas sources. Growth of sources with high-efficiency cogeneration can also be expected in the area of biomass utilisation, biogas stations (including heat transfer from existing sources) and the development of energy recovery of waste. However, the development of these high-efficiency CHP areas is conditional on maintaining stable economic incentives for investors and resource providers.  In relation to large sources, only limited potential for the development of high-efficiency CHP was identified. Heat from large sources such as CHP plants, company power plants and most power plants is currently being used at the place of production, or transferred to the consumer through a heat supply system (HSS). In HSS with large sources, it will rather involve a change in the fuel base (co-firing of renewable energy sources (RES)) or alternative fuels, or improvement (increase) of CHP parameters (achieving higher efficiency or primary energy savings) as a result of resource reconstruction. However, concerning large sources, the risk of a possible reduction of electricity production from high-efficiency CHP cannot be overlooked. Current developments in the energy markets (and their consequences in the form of a reduction in wholesale electricity prices) can cause a downturn in electricity generation from high-efficiency CHP at large sources and a switch to a partially heat-plant operating regime. Most of the major heating sources in the Czech Republic use solid fossil fuels. Maintaining the current level of electricity generation from high-efficiency CHP is therefore also threatened by the tightening of environmental requirements and the expected increase in CO2 allowance costs.  -216-   The study identified a technical potential for the growth of micro, small and medium gas CHP plants (up to 5 MW) of 830 MW; in a subsequent cost-benefit analysis (CBA), it identified an parameters:  a)  a growth of 33 MWe for newly installed sources of micro-cogeneration up to 50 kW;  b) a growth of 227 MWe for newly installed sources of small and medium-sized gas cogeneration fuels with an output of 50 kW to 5 MW; c) a growth of 62 MWe for newly installed sources of cogeneration from RES and other alternative fuels. We divide the entire forecast into four parts: 1. CHP used in the replacement of existing mainly coal sources 2. CHP within the framework of sold heat, biogas and waste recovery  3. CHP that will replace or supplement heat plants using natural gas 4. Micro-cogeneration C) Summary of expected development in new cogeneration in the period 20202030: Table 82: Expected overall development in cogeneration Year Installed electrical capacity (year-on-year increases) (MWe)  CHP used in the replacement of existing mainly coal sources CHP within the framework of sold heat, biogas and waste recovery CHP that will replace or supplement heat plants using natural gas Micro-cogeneration  2020 10 14 25 2 2021 30 55 25 2 2022 30 15.5 25 2 2023 30 17.5 25 3 2024 25 13.5 25 3 2025 25 4 25 3 2026 25 4 25 3 2027 25 3 25 3 2028 10 12.5 25 3 2029 10 12.5 25 3 2030 10 2 25 3 Total 230 153.5 275 30 D) Reconstruction and modernisation of CHP plants that are currently in operation For the sources currently in operation, we expect that most of these will continue to be operated between 2021 and 2030 and many will also be reconstructed and modernised in that period.   Electricity-generating facilities that are eligible for current support and are energy efficient will be able to apply for new operating aid schemes aimed to keep these generating facilities operational (electricity support to keep the electricity-generating facilities in operation or support for electricity production in  -217-  a modernised electricity-generating facility) if they do not receive any other operating aid (e.g. support for RES or SES)  as overlapping of operating aid is compliant with the rules for State Aid set by the EU Environmental and Energy (EEAG) rules.  Therefore, based on the information in the previous paragraph, it is assumed that after the end of the current support for electricity from CHP, the support for CHP will only be used by electricity-generating facilities using fuels other than RES (such as support for the maintenance of an electricity-generating facility or support for electricity produced in a modernised electricity-generating facility).

Development and current state of use of secondary resources138: In 2018, a total of 61 sources using secondary sources were registered in the OTE system, which were operated in 41 electricity-generating facilities. Most power-generating facilities are registered in electricity-generating facilities using mine gas from open / active mines, which have a total of 22 sources with a total output of 304 MW (most sources are with an output of 1.56 MW or 25 MW). This is followed                                                            138 Information from the system of the electricity and gas market operator, OTE, a.s.  -218-  by power-generating facilities using mine gas from closed mines, of which there are a total of 18 sources with a total output of 21.4 MW (most sources with an output of 1.56 MW). There are also 4 municipal waste incineration plants registered in the OTE system. The rest of the sources and facilities generating electricity secondary sources are other secondary sources, which mostly involve heat or energy recovery. B) Expected development  possibilities of new installations and reconstruction and modernisation of current facilities New electricity-generating facilities; taking into account Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy in EU (EEAG) and the requirements of the revised Directive on the promotion of the support will have to aimed at electricity and heat generating facilities utilising heat recovery. For heat recovery, the support will have the form of specific and non-unified (atypical) projects, which cannot be unified under one reference project used for setting the amount of operating aid  it is appropriate to focus on investment support. It will also include electricity-generating facilities using mine gases, where the form of operating aid is appropriate. For electricity-generating facilities using mine gases, it is necessary to focus primarily on keeping current electricity-generating facilities in operation until the dangerous gas generated by mining activities is exhausted (support for electricity to maintain electricity-generating facilities in operation or support for electricity production in a modernised electricity-generating facility); completely new electricity-generating facilities will be supported only in isolated cases.  Given the nature of sites where mine methane is mined and incinerated, it is appropriate to maintain the operating aid for electricity from mine gases as electricity support, not heat support. There is not much room and capacity to create new electricity-generating facilities that use mine gases. Areas around Most or Ústí nad Labem are unlikely to be eligible, as lignite does not produce methane spontaneously. Although hard coal mining in the Moravian-Silesian Region is expected to end in 2024, mine gas sources for new electricity-generating facilities are almost exhausted and the capacity of existing sources is already trending downwards. In 20192020, it is expected that 3 new electricity-generating facilities mine gases will be put into operation (based on available information). Each of these facilities should have a capacity up to 1 MW. In many cases, electricity-generating facilities will only change the technology of consumption of existing resources using mine gas (the transition from the use of mine gas from open / active mines to the use of mine gas from closed mines). For the prediction of operating aid from secondary sources in 20212030, we assume that the modernisation of current mine gas electricity-generating facilities will be realised in the given period. Regarding new mine gas electricity-generating facilities, we assume that if there were any new electricity-modernisation of electricity-generating facilities that are already in operation, as the amount of available mine gas will continue to decline in the future. For currently operational electricity-generating facilities powered by secondary sources, we assume that after the end of their eligibility for support they are currently using, a number of these or most of these electricity-generating facilities will continue to operate after 2021 through operating aid for electricity to maintain the a facility in operation or through support for electricity in a modernised mine gas facility until the available mine gas is exhausted. Heat supply systems  -219-  In this respect, it is also desirable to maintain central heat supply systems where their operation is more efficient and more environmentally friendly than individual heating technology. In order to ensure a sufficient level of energy security in the heating sector, maximum use of domestic primary energy sources is needed. In relation to central heat sources, it mainly involves the most efficient use of domestic coal within high-efficiency CHP, in line with best available techniques (BAT). At the same time, it is desirable to increase the share of biomass in final heat consumption, whether in the form of co-firing with coal on central heat sources or in the form of domestic biomass boilers. Within central heat supply, it is necessary to create suitable conditions for the use of waste heat. In accordance with Act No 165/2012, on supported energy sources, as amended, an efficient system of heat energy supply is a system to which one the following amounts of heat were supplied in the last calendar year: at least 50 % of heat from renewable sources, 50 % of waste heat, 75 % of heat from cogeneration or 50 % of heat from a combination of the above. The Energy Regulatory Office is legally obliged to keep a record of efficient heat supply systems and to publish an overview of them by 30 April139. As of 1 January 2016, the amendment to the Supported Energy Sources Act does not allow subsidies for heat pumps or solar systems that would impair the overall average annual efficiency of existing efficient heat supply system. iii. Projections considering existing energy efficiency policies, measures and programmes as described in point 1.2.(ii) for primary and final energy consumption for each sector at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)140 4.3.1.1 National energy efficiency target by 2020 The analysis of the trend in energy consumption has shown a year-on-year increase in final energy consumption since 2014. Consumption grew by 3.1 % year-on-year in 2017, which in absolute terms represents 31 PJ. According to the updated aggregate energy balance of the Czech Republic prepared according to the revised Eurostat methodology, the final energy consumption in 2017 was 1 028 PJ141. The year-on-year increase in final energy consumption caused an increase in consumption in all sectors of the economy. The fundamental fact is that, despite the increasing final energy consumption, the energy intensity of the economy has been decreasing for a long time. However, the level of energy intensity stagnated in 2017, reaching 391 GJ/CZK million of GDP142.                                                            139  Overview of efficient heat supply systems as of 29 April 2019 is available at the following link. 140 This reference business as usual projection shall be the basis for the 2030 final and primary energy consumption target which is described in 2.3 and conversion factors. 141  The level of final energy consumption corresponds to the overall energy balance of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, which was prepared on the basis of the new Eurostat methodology. 142  Gross domestic product at 2010 market prices (source: Eurostat).  -220-  Chart 65: Development of energy intensity of the Czech Republic, 20102017  Source: Ministry of Industry and Trade, Eurostat If we look at the final energy consumption in the light of the original Eurostat methodology, Europe 20202030, which is decisive for the Czech Republic in demonstrating the fulfilment of the national energy efficiency target by 2020, it must be stated that the final energy consumption of the Czech Republic exceeds the target value for 2020, i.e. 1060 PJ. It is clear that according to the original Eurostat methodology, final energy consumption values are higher compared to the official revised Eurostat methodology used to prepare the overall energy balance of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. 37039041043045047049020102011201220132014201520162017GJ/CZK million of GDP -221-  Chart 66: Fulfilment of the national energy efficiency target (Europe 20202030), 20102017  Source: Eurostat Energy consumption in the household sector increased by 1.7 % year-on-year in 2017, reaching around 307 PJ. The energy intensity of households expressed per housing unit has also been increasing in the long term. In 2017 it grew by 1 % year-on-year and reached 73 GJ/apartment. In the previous period, household energy consumption was also influenced by the increase in the number of new apartment units, increase in the average floor area of apartment units143 and a decrease in the number of people living in one apartment unit144. In terms of demography, consumption is influenced by an increase in population and in disposable household incomes145, which leads to the increasing standard of living and influences consumer behaviour with an impact on energy consumption.  Taking into account the climate-adjusted final energy consumption for heating in the household sector, it can be stated that this energy consumption is growing at a slower rate that is less than 1 %. In 2017, climate-adjusted energy consumption for heating per apartment unit reached 51.37 GJ, which represents a 0.3 % deterioration in energy efficiency in households compared to 2016.                                                            143  In 20042015 the average floor area of apartments increased by 5 % (Source: CZSO  ENERGO 2015). 144  The decrease in the number of persons living in one apartment unit is due to the trend of independent living. The average number of persons in a flat decreased by 11 % between 2004 and 2015 (Source: CZSO  ENERGO 2015). 145  Gross disposable income grew by 4 % year-on-year in 2017 and by 3.4 % year-on-year in 2016 (Source: Eurostat).  -222-  Source Ministry of Industry and Trade In the transport sector, there has been a consistent increase in energy consumption. Energy consumption in the transport sector rose by more than 3 % year-on-year in 2017, totalling around 8 PJ. The increase in consumption was due mainly to an increase in the number of passenger-kilometres, which grew by almost 4.5 % year-on-year. Despite the year-on-year increase in passenger-kilometres, energy consumption per person-km was reduced year-on-year in 2017 (including individual car and public transport146) as well as energy consumption per car (includes only individual car transport). Based on the development of these indicators, it is possible to assume that efficiency in passenger transport has increased.                                                            146  Public transport includes rail, bus, air, inland waterways and urban public transport. 6264666870727476788020102011201220132014201520162017GJ/apartmentChart 67: Final energy consumption per household, 20102017  -223-   Source: Ministry of Transport; Ministry of Finance  Chart 69: Energy consumption in the transport sector per car, 20102017 Source: Ministry of Transport; Ministry of Finance 2.1802.2002.2202.2402.2602.2802.3002.3202.340201020132014201520162017GJ/pkm47484950515253545556201020132014201520162017GJ/carChart 68: Energy consumption in the transport sector per passenger kilometre, 20102017  -224-  Compared to the previous long-term decline in consumption, the industrial sector recorded a year-on-year increase of 4.5 % in 2017.

Based on the long- % year-on-year. There has also been a consistent decline in the ratio of energy consumption to industrial production, which is measured against the Industrial Production Index (IPI)147.

The increase in consumption in the services sector was mainly due to the increase in the economic performance of the sector and the increase in the number of employees. On average, energy consumption per employee in the services sector has increased on average since 2014, reaching approximately the 2013 level in 2017. 2.5002.7002.9003.1003.3003.50020102011201220132014201520162017GJ/IPI -226-  Source: Czech Statistical Office, Eurostat  4.3.1.2 Contribution of the Czech Republic to the non-binding EU target by 2030 The national target will be determined as the maximum potential for reducing energy consumption in individual sectors of the economy, i.e. at the limit of final energy consumption that the Czech Republic can realistically achieve. This potential reflects the effect of planned strategies, policies and measures to be implemented in the period up to 2030, under the following assumptions:  considering the climatic conditions, an increase in the number of tropical days in the summer and significant changes and intensities of the heating season compared to 2016 are not envisaged;  GDP growth in line with the assumptions in Chapter 4.1.1.2;  annual increase in residential area, taking into account the demographic developments in the Czech Republic in accordance with the assumptions in Chapter 4.1.1.1;  growth in transport performance in the transport sector;  a change in the structure of the economy (growth of the services sector and a decrease of heavy industry);  increase/decrease of production in industry.

In each of these sectors, the most energy-intensive products, e productions that are statistically monitored by the Czech Statistical Office and it is therefore possible to  -228-  evaluate historical trends and at the same time to continuously evaluate the differences between the anticipated and the real development. Energy consumption is also monitored for these products and it is therefore possible to determine the energy intensity of their production. In this respect, assumptions have been made on the expected reduction in energy intensity individually for each product, taking into account existing technologies and measures in the sector and the remaining potential for the use of technologies that meet the best available technology criterion. The monitored products form a significant part of the energy consumption of the industry sector; the energy consumption not directly related to the technological process was then quantified separately. Final consumption without energy savings then corresponds to developments in the industry sector, provided that there is no change in the energy intensity of individual products, which would remain constant at 2016 levels. The main boundary conditions are the development of the production of individual products related to the overall assumptions about the economic development and the development of the energy intensity of the individual monitored products. This procedure allows the development of the quantities influencing the boundary conditions to be statistically monitored and the possible deviations to be evaluated. Chart 73: Development of final consumption in the industry sector  Source: Prepared by MIT for the purposes of the National Plan The expected development of final consumption in the transport sector is based in particular on the expected development of passenger and freight transport performances, which are also based on assumptions about the development of economic growth and other socio-economic variables. Detailed assumptions about the development of transport performance are part of this document. Final consumption without saving shown in the graph below shows a situation where there would be no decrease in energy intensity relative to the unit of transport performance. Final consumption, including savings, then assumes decreased intensity in relation to the expected development and the relevant policies in transport. 050100150200250300350201020112012201320142015201620172018201920202021202220232024202520262027202820292030PJFinal consumption incl. savingsFinal consumption excl. savings -229-  Chart 74: Development of final consumption in the transport sector  Source: Prepared by MIT for the purposes of the National Plan Energy consumption in the household sector reflects the rate and depth of renovation of existing buildings corresponding to the likely scenario of a long-term renovation strategy for buildings and, in case of new construction, requirements for the energy performance of new buildings.

Member States were required to introduce legislation by in 2012 to increase the energy performance of new and refurbished buildings in accordance with this Directive. The specification of the energy performance improvement in buildings must be carried out by individual Member States on a cost-optimal level so that the measures required by legislation are cost-effective. The EU requests that input data for cost-optimal level calculations be updated by 2017. For the required optimisation, in June 2011 the European Commission issued methodological guidelines which partly specified the general methodological framework set out in the Directive. Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU Calculation of cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements 1. The Commission has established by means of delegated acts in accordance with Articles 23, 24 and 25 a comparative methodology framework for calculating cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements for buildings and building elements. The comparative methodology framework has been established in accordance with Annex III and differentiates between new and existing buildings and between different categories of buildings. 2. Member States have calculated cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements using the comparative methodology framework established in accordance with paragraph 1 and relevant parameters, such as climatic conditions and the practical accessibility of energy infrastructure, and compare the results of this calculation with the minimum energy performance requirements in force. Member States shall report to the Commission all input data and assumptions used for those calculations and the results of those calculations. The report may be included in the Energy Efficiency Action Plans referred to in Article 14(2) of Directive 2006/32/EC. Member States shall submit those reports to the Commission at regular intervals, which shall not be longer than five years. The first report shall be submitted by 30 June 2012. 3. If the result of the comparison performed in accordance with paragraph 2 shows that the minimum energy performance requirements in force are significantly less energy efficient than cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements, the Member State concerned shall justify this difference in writing to the Commission in the report referred to in paragraph 2, accompanied, to the extent that the gap cannot be justified, by a plan outlining appropriate steps to significantly reduce the gap by the next review of the energy performance requirements as referred to in Article 4(1). In this respect, it is also necessary to note that the Czech Republic has sent an update to the cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements in 2018
