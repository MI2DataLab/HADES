INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 280   4.6 Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness   i. Current situation of the low-carbon-technologies sector and, to the extent possible, its position on the global market (that analysis is to be carried out at a European Union or global level)  Despite the presence of excellence, Italy is still performing badly when it comes to R&D in the energy sector, as a result of the relatively low priority level attributed to research, the fragmentation of the stakeholders and the lack of coordination; this generates a technological dependence from overseas and a growing commercial deficit in high-technology products.  In recent years, there has been a strong focus on more extensive use of alternative sources, partly driven by environmental obligations that have provided impetus for new technological demand. The positive results recorded in recent decades in the field of thermo-electromechanics do not currently appear to be capable of overcoming the limits of a weak specialisation, contrasted by much greater strengths at a European level. The greatest difficulties include the lack of presence among technologies using renewable sources, with the exception of some strong points in solar power (CSP), geothermal and bioenergy.  potential sense. In addition, the policies on the demand side of technologies have been and are still inadequately related to those on the offer side, as is demonstrated, for example, by the significant financial effort to support energy production from renewable sources, which has given rise to rather incomplete results in terms of the ability to drive innovation and creation of production chains.  technologies is evolving into a more coordinated framework of initiatives; this has also been boosted by the alignment of the key actions in the SET Plan and participation in the Horizon 2020 Programme and Mission Innovation. The Italian research system is well positioned internationally, demonstrating a willingness to seize all the most innovative ideas appearing on an international level.  Developments in European research can impact positively on the process of rationalising the objectives of the research, enhancing and targeting the various national competencies operating in the sector. However, the national research system must be capable of rapidly updating priorities, positions and assessments of competitiveness in the energy technologies sector and allowing the country to make an effective contribution to the chosen futures that will be taken in the context of the European SET Plan, whilst also protecting industrial competitiveness and encouraging the capacity for innovative production.  The process of aligning the national R&D policies with the priorities set out in the SET Plan has been underway for some years now and the Ministry of Economic Development has contributed through the Fund for electrical systems research (funded by the A5 tariff component), which, as part of the recent three-year plans for 2012-2014 and 2015-2017, made a significant link with the SET Plan, allowing, in particular, ENEA [the Italian Energy Agency] and RSE (thanks to the transfer of the results of general interest research  funded in full as part of the Programme Agreements) to compete effectively in the context of both the 7th Framework Programme for EU R&D, achieving the top positions in the classification of European research organisations in terms of funds raised and Horizon 2020. The new INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 281   three-year plan for 2019-2021, which aims to strengthen this link with the SET Plan definitively and permanently, has recently been approved.  In 2016, the Italian Ministry of Education and Research (MIUR) also launched the National Research Plan (NRP), the reference tool for the national research strategy, with a budget of  billion of public resources for research purposes. In particular, the energy sector is considered in innovation termsthrough technology clusters, which make it possible to identify specific subsystems on which the implementation of research and innovation policies can play a significant part in a intensive use of matching fund tools and support for the use of competitive European funds is envisaged to allow Italian enterprises and research institutions to detect opportunities and consolidated   A new National Technology Cluster for energy has also been launched (referred to in section 3.5.i). This is based on a public interest call for mixed public-private groups that intend to execute the objectives set out. The National Technology Clusters are assigned the objective of generating technological and innovative development opportunities for the industrial system at the crossroads between public and private research. This objective can be measured in terms of its capacity to generate shared and agreed technology roadmaps, future technology opportunities and scenarios for Italian industry and, more generally, information tools that are able to support the drafting of informed policies and the channelling of funds dedicated to industrial research.  ii. Current level of public and, where available, private research and innovation spending on low-carbon-technologies, current number of patents, and current number of researchers  Although they are demonstrating an upwards trend compared with previous years, the resources allocated for energy research conducted by public bodies and by publicly controlled  billion in Italy in 2015 compared with  billion  billion in France.   INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 282    Figure 62  Resources allocated for research and development (%)   Figure 63  Trends in resources allocated for energy research and development ( thousand)   Patents  In terms of patent registration, Italy does not play a major role in the European landscape  and even less so from a quantitative perspective  contributing 0.7% of global energy patents in 2014 compared, for example, to 7.0% from Germany and 3.0% from France; it should also to patents in all the sectors over the past decade, the percentage of Italian energy patents among the total national patents has fallen from 5% to around 3%. Moreover, only 0.34% of all patents applied for worldwide in the electric sector and 0.23% of those relating to sustainable mobility originate from Italy. It must also be stressed, however, that Italy does INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 283   not differ greatly from the rest of Europe, which certainly does not shine in the number of innovations submitted, with the exception of Germany (with more than 1 700 electric patents).  The sector in which Italy was relatively more active in the electrical sector in 2016, from an innovative standpoint, is energy storage (a fifth of the total), but also photovoltaics and wind power, which, together, draw 37% of the innovations produced by the country, coming mainly from Lombardy and Lazio. None of the European countries particularly excels in producing patents on the subject of electrical mobility. With the exception of Germany, Italy (23 patents in total) is only performing better than Spain (18) and is still at a similar level to entrated predominantly on energy accumulation, while little attention is still being paid to hybrid vehicles and recharging produce half of all patents.  The situation is different, however, if you move away from transport research to the sustainability of transport on the roads. Italy performs well here, at least in terms of grams  only coming behind France. This result was also obtained thanks to the historical tendency to thanks to the most recent regulations on this subject, Italy will be able to make effective use of bio-methane.  Start-ups  Lombardy is still the most productive Region for the setting up of new innovative entrepreneurial activities (one in four energy start-ups operates in Lombardy). Energy start-ups are also present in high numbers in the northern regions and in Lazio, but it is interesting to note that these areas are, on average, more active than other sectors on the patent front; there are no particular geographical differences in this area. The size of the enterprise is certainly still the main critical element: the overwhelming majority of Italian start-ups invoice   both in the energy sector (over 90%) and in other sectors  and there are few cases where the workforce exceeds ten employees (around 5%). The main difficulty when it comes to growth, in addition to those that often have clear organisational limits, is in raising capital.  The most obvious delay currently affecting Italy is the lack of a mature Venture Capital market. However, given the constant growth of this sector, the impact that these enterprises have on the national economy is starting to become significant; this can be quantified in  billion overall, of which around 15% is generated in the energy sector alone. The impact is still marginal in terms of employment, which can be evaluated at around 60,000 jobs (more than half of which are in northern Italy), only 8,000 of which are in the energy sector, a number that is, however, destined to grow in the near future, given the forecasts and the ever-increasing attention being paid to this type of entrepreneurial activity.  iii. Breakdown of current price elements that make up the main three price components (energy, network, taxes/levies)  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 284   Overall spending by the Italian system on electricity consumption is estimated as being about  billion in 2017, split as follows:  40% on retail services (spending on energy supply on the market42, spending on marketing and retailing, spending on supplying dispatching services);  14% on network services (spending on transmission, distribution and metering services);   28% on general system charges for correct operation and economic and environmental sustainability of the country's system (A components, UC components, MCT component);  18% on taxes (excise duty, VAT).  Compared with 2016, the items experiencing the greatest growth have been retail services (+11.6%) and network services (+2.7%), while those in sharp decline have been general charges (-11.1%) and excise duty (-9.4%). Overall, spending has increased by just under 0.7% (but a net reduction of 7% compared with the last 5 years). It is also observed that, in absolute  billion in the last year recorded by the marketing and sales, transmission/distribution and VAT revenue items was compensated for by the reduction in general system charges and excise duty revenue. Among the general charges, the component that played a greater role is the A3 component (to cover incentives for renewable sources  billion.   With reference to the retailing item, there was an increase in supply (+22.4%) and marketing-retail sales (+2.8%), and a decrease in expenditure to cover the costs of purchasing resources for dispatching services (-17%). In particular, supply, which represents 72.5% of the retail services, was affected due to a significant increase in thermo-electric production at higher cost due to the rise in fuel prices on the main markets (effect on National Single Price with an average increase of around +11.2 euro/MWh). It is observed that the increase in production by fossil plants served to cover the increase in demand (+2.1%), taking into account both the contribution from foreign trade and that from renewable generation (mainly solar photovoltaic and wind power). Marketing sales, i.e. income from the intermediary, which represents 12% of the items included in the retail services, has, however, been affected by an increase that can eabegan in 2016; this was a decision by the ARERA and affected customers in the enhanced protection scheme43. Lastly, expenditure on purchasing resources for dispatching services decreased, mainly thanks to the reduction in revenue collection from the uplift payment fee (-12.3%) and from that to cover the costs incurred for the remuneration of the relevant plants called for essential servicing (-52%). In addition, the major significance of the uplift component (70.3%) on expenditure on purchasing resources for dispatching services is confirmed.                                                              42 Spending on purchasing energy incurred by end customers belonging to the free market was estimated on the assumption that all purchases are made from the Power Exchange. On this assumption, the volume supplied by the free market will be the difference in total purchases on the Exchange (net of hydroelectric pumps consumption) less the quantities purchased by the Single Buyer for customers in the enhanced protection scheme, monetised by the annual weighted average of the PUN resulting from the day-before market. 43 The marketing and retail expenses incurred by the end customers belonging to the Free Market were estimated by applying the marketing and sales component of the enhanced protection service to the sampling points of the free market, this component being calculated, however, on the basis of the average costs incurred by enterprises in the free market.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 285   To simplify matters, the general charges group together the tariff components intended to cover the general system charges (components A) and comparable charges (components UC and MCT, since they derive from regulatory requirements). The type A components component funding incentives for renewable and similar sources (A3) accounted for 85%, a percentage that can be confirmed in line with that of previous years.  The network services refer to the tariff components laid down by the ARERA to cover the costs of transmission, distribution and metering services. The distribution system account for  million compared with 2016, the distribution percentage was around 60%. The total amount for network services has not seen a significant change compared with recent years and still  billion. Dividing the overall cost by the national level of consumption gives an estimate of the unit cost of electricity for the community as a whole. In particular, last year, in 2017, this unit cost is estimated to be 17.39 euro cents for each kWh retrieved, around 1.4% less than in 2016 and around 4.7% less than 2012 (in real terms 201044 the reduction between 2012 and 2017 is around 6.7%).  iv. Description of energy subsidies, including for fossil fuels  Parliament assigns to the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Natural Resources and the Sea Article 68 of Law No 221 of 28 December 2015, containing measures for the green economy and the efficient use of resources). This is an inventory showing the existing subsidies in Italy, with particular emphasis on their environmental impact.   As set out in the lebroadest sense, including, among other things, direct incentives, exemptions, tax reductions and discounts, tax relief and implicit subsidies. The subsidies catalogue serves as a useful tool:  - to identify the area of intervention for a possible reform of the general taxation of the market. - to identify measures that contribute to an environmental tax reform (reduction in fiscal pressure that encumbers the labour productivity factor and enterprises with the concurrent recovery of revenue through forms of environmental taxation that are levied on pollution, natural resources, consumption and production that is damaging to the environment); -   Overall, the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Natural Resources and the Sea has identified 161 environmental subsidy measures that are relevant to all sectors of the national                                                             44 The carry rate was calculated by referring to the average annual consumer price index for blue- and white-collar households (FOI index) net of tobacco since the FOI index is used by the Italian National Statistical Institute (ISTAT) to determine the monetary revaluation coefficient.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 286    billion. In particular, for the purposes of the INECP 57 measures have been identified that affec billion  billion is made up of fossil fuel subsidies (45 measures).  The Italian government volunteered to be subject to the G20 peer review process on fossil fuel subsidies. In fact, since the G20 (Pittsburgh summit)in 2009, Italy has committed to  and market distortions, prevent investment in clean energy and undermine efforts to tackle climate change. In the absence of timeframes and fully shared methodology, with effect from 2015 the G20 initiated a voluntary peer review programme of national reports on fossil fuel subsidies (two countries each year: one advanced economy and one emerging economy).  This exercise, which involved China and the USA in 2016, and Mexico and Germany in 2017, entailed an examination of Italy and Indonesia in 2018; the reports were presented at the G20 in Japan in April 2019. Argentina and Canada (Presidencies in 2018 of G20 and G7 respectively) are the candidates for the 2019 review; other countries could also be added later.  The tables below list a) the 30 subsidies which have a significant environmental impact for the Energy and Climate Plan and that have been identified as those to be examined and assessed in more depth as a priority, including with the Authorities and representatives of the citizens and enterprises involved, in order to identify any compensation (detailed priority list); b) the 10 subsidies that require further technical analysis (secondary list to be analysed in more technical detail); c) the 3 subsidies to be reformed at a Community or global level; d) the 12 energy subsidies that are favourable to the environment. Complete, evidence-based estimates of the financial impact for 2016 and 2017 are almost complete; the drafting process for 2018 is underway.
