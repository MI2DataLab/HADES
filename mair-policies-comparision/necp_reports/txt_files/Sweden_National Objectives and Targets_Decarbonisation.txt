2.1 Dimension decarbonisation  2.1.1 GHG emissions and removals  2.1.1.1 The elements set out in point (a)(1) of Article 4  With respect to greenhouse gas emissions and removals and with a view to contributing to the achievement of the economy wide Union greenhouse gas emission reduction target:  The Member State's binding national target for greenhouse gas emissions and the annual binding national limits pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/842. For the emission sectors22 emission allowance trading. For the (EU ETS) or LULUCF23 sector, each Decision/non-traded sector (ESD24/ESR25). Sweden's contribution to effort sharing is to reduce its emissions to 20% of their 2005 levels by 2030.  The Swedish national intermediate target for 2030 is to reduce emissions from the non-EU ETS or LULUCF sectors by 63% compared to their 1990                                                       22 Examples of sectors that do not belong to the EU ETS or LULUCF are heating of homes and commercial premises, agriculture and national transport (excluding national flights). 23 LULUCF stands for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry . In this sector, carbon storage changes are reported for each soil type and for harvested wood products. https://www.naturvardsverket.se/Sa-mar-miljon/Statistik-A-O/Vaxthusgaser-utslapp- och-upptag-fran-markanvandning/. 24 Decision No 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the effort of Member States to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to 2020. 25 Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013. 15 (199) levels, equivalent to a 59% reduction of their 2005 levels. Sweden has Annual Emissions Allocations and intends to continue to cancel any scope Sharing Decision. This is to ensure that the emission reductions achieved in emission margin is reduced by the amount by which Sweden has overachieved its target. The Riksdag makes decisions on cancellation every year.  Sweden's annual emission path for 2021-2030 will be determined once the implementing act is clear at EU level.  Member State's commitments pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/841 Under the LULUCF Regulation26 (period 20212030) each Member State undertakes to ensure that the removals and emissions from the LULUCF rules. The Regulation aims to provide an incentive for additional actions within the LULUCF sector; it is up to the Member States to choose appropriate actions.  Sweden's 2021-2025 reference levels for its LULUCF forestry accounts have not yet been determined. At the beginning of 2020 the European Commission will determine the reference level for the accounts of Sweden's actions and their outcome. For other types of land Sweden follows the same LULUCF guidelines as other Member States.  2.1.1.2 Where applicable, other national objectives and targets consistent with the Paris Agreement and the existing long-term strategies. Where applicable for the contribution to the overall Union commitment of reducing the GHG emissions, other objectives and targets, including sector targets and adaptation goals, if available. The Riksdag adopted a national climate policy framework for Sweden in June 2017. The framework consists of a climate act, national climate targets and a climate policy council. See Section 1.2 for more information about the Climate Policy Framework.  Sweden has four main climate policy targets.   An overall environmental quality target, with no specific deadline, to help limit the rise in global average temperatures.  A long-term Swedish emissions target for 2045.                                                       26 Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry in the 2030 climate and energy framework, and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 and Decision No 529/2013/EU. 16 (199)  Intermediate targets for Swedish emissions outside the   A special intermediate target for greenhouse gas emissions from national transport (except for national aviation, which belongs to the EU ETS) for 2030.   To provide a clear structure for environmental work in Sweden, the Riksdag has adopted 16 environmental quality goals. One of these, Limited Impact on the Climate, forms the basis for action on climate change. The target has been defined27 as:   ºC above its pre-industrial level and making efforts to achieve an increase of less than 1.5 ºC above the pre-industrial level. S  A long-term emissions target Sweden must reduce its net emissions of greenhouse gases to zero by 2045, and then achieve negative emissions. This means that greenhouse gases from Swedish territory must be at least 85% lower in 2045 than they were in 1990. Capture and storage of carbon dioxide of fossil origin must be included in the measures to achieve this target in the absence of reasonable alternatives. Additional measures will also have to be taken into account to achieve net zero emissions. The climate goal is illustrated in Figure 1.  Intermediate targets for greenhouse gas emissions in 2020, 2030 and 2040  In 2020, the greenhouse gas emissions of the ESR sector in Sweden28 must be 40% lower than they were in 1990. A maximum of 13% of emission reductions may be made by implementing additional measures in the form of credits29.  By 2030, the greenhouse gas emissions of the ESR sector in Sweden must be at least 63% lower than they were in 1990. A maximum of 8% of emission reductions may be made by implementing additional measures.  By 2030 greenhouse gas emissions from national transport, excluding national flights, must be at least 70% lower than they were in 201030.  By 2040, the greenhouse gas emissions of the ESR sector in Sweden must be at least 75% lower than they were in 1990. A maximum of 2% of emission reductions may be made by implementing additional measures.                                                        27 Government bill 2016/17:146, Report 2016/17:MJU24, Riksdag communication 2016/17:320. 28 ESR stands for Effort Sharing Regulation. Emissions are regulated nationallis called the ESD, Effort Sharing Decision. 29 Credits may include emission reductions in other EU Member States and credits from the Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol. 30 National aviation is not included in the target as it belongs to the EU ETS. 17 (199) Additional measures Under international rules, additional measures may be taken into account to achieve the long-term goal for 2045 and the intermediate targets. However, no decision has yet been made about how to do this. Current additional measures include net removal by forests and land, verified emission reductions through investments in other countries and capture and storage of biogenic carbon dioxide (bio-CCS).

The Government adopted the first National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy in March 201831. The strategy establishes mechanisms for coordinating, monitoring, evaluating and reviewing climate change adaptation work. Seven particular areas have been highlighted for further work on the basis of the predicted consequences for society. The work should be informed by a number of guiding principles.  As climate change adaptation involves many different fields, the work is largely governed by existing national and international regulations, frameworks and objectives. These include the goals of the 2030 Agenda and the Planning and Building Act (2010:900).                                                       31 Government bill 2017/18:163. National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy 18 (199)  Air pollution control policy The revised National Emission Ceilings Directive32 (2016/2284/EU) on the reduction of atmospheric pollutants sets ceilings for Sweden's emission reduction commitments for sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), particulate matter (PM2,5) and ammonia (NH3). The emission ceiling must be complied with by 2020 and 2030 and there are also indicative targets for 2025, which must demonstrate a linear emission reduction between 2020 and 2030. Table 2 and Table 3 show Sweden's commitments for 2020 and 2030.  Table 2. Sweden's commitments for 2020 and 2030 under the new Ceilings Directive in per cent with 2005 as the base year.

The Ordinance covers the work of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and other relevant agencies on the National Air Pollution Control Programme, emission statistics, scenarios, environmental monitoring and reporting to the EU under the provisions of the Directive.  2.1.2 Renewable energy  2.1.2.1 The elements set out in point (a)(2) of Article 4  With respect to renewable energy: With a view to achieving the Union's binding target of at least 32% renewable energy in 2030 as                                                       32 Directive (EU) 2016/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2016 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants, amending Directive 2003/35/EC and repealing Directive 2001/81/EC. 19 (199) referred to in Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, a contribution to that target in terms of the Member State's share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy in 2030, with an indicative trajectory for that contribution from 2021 onwards. By 2022, the indicative trajectory shall reach a reference point of at least 18% of the total increase in the share of energy from renewable sources between that Member State's binding 2020 national target, and its contribution to the 2030 target. By 2025, the indicative trajectory shall reach a reference point of at least 43% of the total increase in the share of energy from renewable sources between that Member State's binding 2020 national target, and its contribution to the 2030 target. By 2027, the indicative trajectory shall reach a reference point of at least 65% of the total increase in the share of energy from renewable sources between that Member State's binding 2020 national target, and its contribution to the 2030 target.  By 2030, the indicative trajectory shall reach at least the Member State's planned contribution. If a Member State expects to surpass its binding 2020 national target, its indicative trajectory may start at the level it is projected to achieve. The Member States' indicative trajectories, taken together, shall add up to the Union reference points in 2022, 2025 and 2027 and to the Union's binding target of at least 32% renewable energy in 2030. Separately from its contribution to the Union target and its indicative trajectory for the purposes of this Regulation, a Member State shall be free to indicate higher ambitions for national policy purposes. Sweden has no national targets for the share of renewable energy in 2030. Sweden's draft Integrated Energy and Climate Plan33 used the Swedish Energy Agency's long-term scenarios34 from 2016 and the policies adopted at that time as the basis for a nconditions recommended by the EU indicated that renewable energy would account for 65% of gross energy consumption in 2030. The Agency's latest long-term scenarios35 show that this is still a reasonable contribution which should be achievable with the policies adopted (see Section 4).  Under the Renewable Energy Directive36, Sweden's binding target for the share of renewable energy in gross energy consumption in 2020 is 49%. Figure 2 shows the indicative trajectory from the binding target for 2020 to a national contribution of a 65% share of renewable energy in gross energy consumption in 2030. The indicative trajectory does not place any limits on higher national ambitions and objectives or the development of national policies.                                                          33 https://www.regeringen.se/rapporter/2019/01/sveriges-utkast-pa-integrerad-nationell-energi--och-klimatplan/. 34 The Swedish Energy Agency  Scenarier över Sveriges energisystem 2016 (ER2017:6). 35 The Swedish Energy Agency  Scenarier över Sveriges energisystem 2018 (ER2019:7). 36 Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. 20 (199)  Figure 2 Sweden's indicative trajectory for the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption between 2020 and 2030.   2.1.2.2 Estimated trajectories for the sectoral share of renewable energy in final energy consumption from 2021 to 2030 in the electricity, heating and cooling and transport sector. The EU Reference Scenario is described in detail in Section 4.2.2 including trajectories for the share of renewable energy in the electricity, heating and cooling and transport sectors.  2.1.2.3 Estimated trajectories by renewable energy technology that the Member State projects to use to achieve the overall and sectoral trajectories for renewable energy from 2021 to 2030, including expected total gross final energy consumption per sector in Mtoe and total planned installed capacity (divided by new capacity and repowering) per technology and sector in MW.  The future profitability and competitiveness of different renewable energy sources will depend on developments on the market. The Government believes it is more cost-effective to leave it to the market to determine which technologies are used instead of setting specific targets.  Section 4.2.2 describes the estimated distribution of renewable energy by technology and energy consumption in 2030 according to the EU Reference Scenario, in total and by sector.  The expected total gross final energy consumption37 of 37 Mtoe given in the EU Reference Scenario does not change from 2020 to 2030. In the heating and cooling sector, the equivalent energy consumption increases by 1 Mtoe to 17 Mtoe in 2030. The energy consumption in the transport sector falls slightly from 2020 to 7 Mtoe in 2030; in the electricity sector it is unchanged at 13 Mtoe in 2030.                                                       37 The denominator in the calculations of renewable energy shares. 21 (199)  In the scenario, the total installed electricity generation capacity increases from around 39 GW in 2017 to nearly 45 GW in 2030 in spite of the fact that two nuclear reactors are expected to be decommissioned during this period (see the estimated distribution between different technologies in Figure 3). The installed capacity for wind power is expected to increase the most, by 5 GW between 2017 and 2030. Solar power is expected to increase by 2 GW in the same period. There is no information on the division between new capacity and repowering.   2030, GW.

For forest biomass, an assessment of its source and impact on the LULUCF sink. consumption increases by 14 TWh between 2017 and 2020 to a total of 157 TWh. The estimated bioenergy consumption for 2030 is 161 TWh, as shown in Figure 4.  In the heating and cooling sector, bioenergy consumption increases by 10 22 (199) TWh up to 2020 and then by 2 TWh to 121 TWh in 2030. Solid biofuels38 account for 9 TWh of the increase and depend on increased use for heat generation in district heating plants and for heating in the housing and services sector.  In the transport sector, the consumption of bioenergy (but only liquid biofuels) increases by 3 TWh up to 2020 and then remains constant until 203039. The increase is due primarily to increased consumption of biodiesel in the form of HVO (around 2 TWh) which is currently produced primarily from waste and residues.  In the electricity sector, bioenergy consumption increases by only 1 TWh up to 2020 and then by 2 TWh up to 2030. Solid biofuels account for the largest proportion of this increase.  At present, Sweden imports a relatively large amount of biofuel feedstocks for all three consumer sectors, although there is significant national potential for most types of feedstock. However, there is no state policy for controlling the balance between domestic production and imports; it is controlled by market forces.                                                          38 Including lyes, a residual product of paper production. 39 The scenario only contains the current levels for the reduction obligation. 23 (199) Figure 4 Bioenergy consumption in the Heating and Cooling, Electricity and Transport sectors from 2005 to 2017 by type of biomass, and assessment in the EU Reference Scenario up to 2030, TWh.

Note: T = transport; E = electricity and HC = heating and cooling.  The model used in the EU Reference Scenario does not indicate which specific types of solid biofuel are used, in other words whether or not they are based on forestry feedstocks. However, the consumption of solid biofuels increases by nearly 8 TWh between 2017 and 2020 and then remains constant. If felling residues in the form of branches and tops account for most of this increase, it has little impact on the carbon sink; but the removal of more stumps can be detrimental. However, stores of carbon could be increased by growing trees for biomass on derelict land formerly used for annual crops.  2.1.2.5 Where applicable, other national trajectories and objectives, including those that are long-term and sectoral (such as share of renewable energy in district heating, renewable energy use in buildings, renewable energy produced by cities, renewable energy communities and renewables self-consumers, energy recovered from the sludge acquired through the treatment of wastewater)  The 2040 target is 100% of electricity generated from renewable sources. 24 (199) That is a target, not a deadline for banning nuclear energy; nor is it a policy decision to stop generating nuclear energy.  Progress towards the target of 100% electricity generated from renewable sources was assessed during the first review40 of the Energy Agreement in 2019. Electricity generated from renewable sources as a proportion of total electricity generation increased from 57.6% to 58.4% in 2017. In the 84% in 2040. Nuclear energy accounts for most of the remaining electricity generated from non-renewable sources, followed by electricity from burning residual fossil gases (coke and blast furnace gases) from the steel industry and the fossil content of waste.  Section 4 describes the trend in the generation of energy from renewable sources shown in the EU Reference Scenario using the calculation method from the Renewable Energy Directive.  2.2 Dimension energy efficiency  2.2.1 The elements set out in point (b) of Article 4  2.2.1.1 The indicative national energy efficiency contribution to achieving the Union's energy efficiency targets of at least 32.5% in 2030 as referred to in Article 1(1) and Article 3(5) of Directive
