152 3.4 Improvement in energy efficiency The definition of policy measures for energy efficiency improvement in the period 2021-2030 aims to cover twelve different policy priorities (PP3.1-PP3.12), as presented in Figure 6. PP3.1: Improvement in energy efficiency of public buildings and exemplary role of public sector - Improvement of urban public space microclimate PP3.2: Strategy for renovation of the building stock in the residential and tertiary sector PP3.3: Promoting energy efficiency contracts by energy service companies PP3.4: Promoting market mechanisms PP3.5: Promoting innovative financial instruments to ensure private capital leverage and financial sector involvement PP3.6: Improvement in energy efficiency and competitiveness of the industrial sector PP3.7: Framework for the replacement of polluting passenger vehicles and goods vehicles PP3.8: Developing infrastructure and plans for a shift in transport operations PP3.9: Energy efficiency improvement of electricity and gas infrastructures PP3.10: Promoting measures for modernising water supply / sewage and irrigation infrastructures PP3.11: Promoting efficient heating and cooling PP3.12: Training/informing professionals and consumers on energy-efficient equipment and rational use of energy Figure 6: Policy priorities to promote energy efficiency over the period 2021-2030. The policy measures that have been specified in the above policy priorities are analysed separately in the following sections.   153 3.4.1 Energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative policy measures The objective under Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU will be attained by combining the energy efficiency obligation scheme and implementing alternative policy measures. The energy efficiency obligation scheme applicable to energy providers will continue to be implemented and its functioning through a new regulatory framework will adjust the energy savings target assumed by the parties involved by taking into account the achievable technical-financial potential for energy savings and will improve both the functioning and efficiency of the scheme. Moreover, the implementation of this scheme will be extended to cover also the distribution network operators for both electricity and natural gas, setting a specific energy efficiency improvement objective and at the same time ensuring that it will not distort competition for the energy providers of the respective energy products. The setting of the objective to be allocated to the schemes in the new period depends directly on the type of measures that will be eligible. The setting of the objective to be allocated to the schemes in the new period depends directly on the type of measures that will be eligible.   154   Energy efficiency obligation schemes Energy efficiency obligation schemes are the most widespread market mechanism that leads to optimal implementation of energy efficiency improvement measures in terms of costs and results. Obligation schemes will make a significant contribution towards attaining the objective under Article 7 in the period 2021-2030 by aiming to promote specific energy savings interventions in order to minimise the burden imposed on obliged parties. Obligation schemes will account for a minimum of 20% of the total cumulative energy savings target, while both energy providers and distribution network operators will participate in the scheme. The target will be allocated to obliged parties by taking into account the achievable technical-financial potential for energy savings in the obliged planned. A significant contribution towards the attainment/fulfilment of the target can be made by the use of dedicated innovative digital modelling as an incentive for the overall lifecycle of a building, from its design/construction to its mode of operation and its adaptation to the ever-changing needs of the enterprises and organisations using it. The contribution of alternative policy measures to the attainment of this target will be significantly greater, and the process for further specifying these measures is under way. It should be noted that alternative policy measures, which represent the majority of policy measures, are outlined in the following sections. 3.4.2 Long-term strategy for the renovation of the national building stock In order to mobilise the required investments, a specific package of policy measures is envisaged to improve the energy efficiency of public and private buildings, through the long-term strategy for the renovation of the building stock or the renewal of end-of-lifecycle buildings along with recycling of the construction and demolition waste produced, which is expected to be completed in March 2020, in accordance with the requirements of Directive (EU) 2018/844. The long-term strategy for the renovation of the building stock aims to ensure the 155 technical-financial analysis and determination of optimally efficient measures for attaining the high renovation rate set for the building stock. In particular, the financing programmes for the renovation of both residential and tertiary sector buildings in the context of the new programming period will be implemented by adjusting and improving the existing financing model, with a view an increase in the existing leverage levels by beneficiaries. These programmes aim to: - increase the number of potential beneficiaries; - simplify the certification of interventions, using unit cost data; - ensure more active involvement of domestic financial institutions in the financing of necessary interventions; and - promote innovation in the domestic construction and manufacturing industry. In the new programming period, successful financing programmes for improving the energy efficiency of residential buildings will continue, and their operating framework will be duly modified by streamlining the incentives for maximising energy benefits, while at the same time supporting households which are vulnerable in terms of finances and energy. In the case of public buildings, the redrafting of the financing model for energy upgrading actions has been completed, while in the case of other tertiary sector buildings focus will be given to adopting new smart technologies and an effort will be made to achieve an optimal cost-benefit ratio and ensure equal access for all interested parties. Meanwhile, alternative financing mechanisms, such as energy performance contracts, will be adopted. Upgrading the role of energy managers of public buildings is expected to make a significant contribution, as a relevant clause will be added in financing programmes for the energy upgrading of public buildings. The electronic platform for monitoring the energy behaviour of buildings, which has been completed, aims to assist energy managers in carrying out their functions. The revision of the relevant regulatory framework aims to upgrade their role, in order to ensure the rational use of energy. Continued improvement of the energy efficiency of public buildings will also be strengthened through the implementation of the Action Plans for Sustainable Energy and the Action Plans for Energy Efficiency of Buildings, which must be drawn up by regions and municipalities, supported by targeted financing programmes. The implementation of energy management systems will make a substantial contribution in this direction. In any case, a key priority for public buildings will be to promote measures and programmes that are technically feasible and optimal in terms of social costs and results. 156 The new minimum requirements will be incorporated in the revised Regulation on Energy Efficiency of Buildings and emphasis will be placed on increasing the number of near-zero energy buildings in accordance with the requirements of Directive 2010/31/EU. The adoption of new regulatory measures (also in the context Directive 2010/31/EU, as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/844) will aim both at elaborating an appropriate framework and creating incentives for maximising the number of buildings which would exceed the minimum energy efficiency requirements. For example, the following regulatory provisions will be promoted:  After 31 December 2023, all buildings housing public authorities must be classified under energy category B or higher on the basis of the energy performance certificate.  As of 1 January 2021, all new buildings or building units rented or purchased by central government bodies must be near-zero energy buildings (energy category A or higher).  As of 1 January 2021, for each building or building unit that is available for sale or rent, the energy efficiency index shown in the energy performance certificate should be declared in all commercial advertisements. Successful and efficient policy measures, such as the mandatory installation of solar thermal systems in new buildings and those undergoing major renovation, will be continued and improved as appropriate. Finally, the new regulatory framework, coupled with tax, financial and town planning incentives, is expected to increase the pace of energy upgrading of private buildings. All the above policy measures will be analysed and further specified in the context of the long-term strategy for the renovation of the building stock.   157 Renovation of the building stock the national energy plan. Successful financing programmes will be continued and adjusted, to make them more cost-effective by increasing the levels of leverage and to ensure effective contribution towards protecting vulnerable social groups in the population. An effort will be launched in this direction for the energy upgrading of 12-15% of buildings and/or building units in the decade 2021-2030 through targeted policy measures designed and implemented in the context of the implementation of the NECP by 2030. Overall, the energy upgrading of the building stock is expected to increase added value by EUR 8 million and create and maintain over 22 thousand new full-time jobs. Finally, a specific mechanism will be developed to monitor, measure and assess the degree of attainment of the target and the anticipated economic and social benefits. 3.4.3 Policies and measures to promote energy services in the public sector Improving the energy efficiency of public buildings through energy performance contracts and generally through PPPs will be one of the key policy measures in the following period. Therefore, an immediate priority is to adjust the relevant framework of support financing programmes and of support structures in order to address the technical and administrative difficulties detected, with a view to further developing energy services in public buildings. A major contribution to the above pursuits will be made by the redrafted ILEKTRA programme, consisting in financing energy efficiency interventions in general government buildings, including participation in the implementation of interventions by energy service companies through energy performance contracts.   158   Moreover, the further development of energy services should contribute towards putting in place sustainable solutions for improved energy efficiency of private buildings. The regulatory framework will be completed and improved taking into account the experience gained to date, whereas the necessary framework for easier access to funding under favourable terms for the parties involved will be developed.  ILEKTRA programme The key aim of the programme is to create attractive and sustainable energy upgrade investments for the buildings used by public bodies (general government bodies), by effectively leveraging funds from both the private and public sector. The adjustment of the regulatory framework facilitates the mobilisation of private funds in a sector with considerable potential, which will contribute significantly towards attaining the ambitious objectives of the national plan for the energy upgrading of buildings. More specifically, the ELEKTRA programme strengthens the energy upgrading of public buildings by financing part of the required investments through investment loans, which will be repaid by the programme. It also provides for the participation of energy service companies, whereas payments to them, in the context of energy performance contracts, are guaranteed through securities. 3.4.4 Other planned policies, measures and programmes to attain the indicative national energy efficiency target for 2030 Implementing specific measures to improve energy efficiency in infrastructure is expected to yield significant results. For example, priority is given to projects for promoting HECHP plants, deploying district heating and cooling networks, and expanding gas distribution networks, including the deployment of autonomous compressed (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) networks. Focus will be given to the implementation of the policy measures to be proposed in the context of the comprehensive assessment for promoting efficient heating and cooling, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2020. Priority will be given to the use of waste heat under these policy measures, in industrial and crafts establishments in particular.   159 Existing mechanisms to support energy efficiency improvement measures, such as the energy upgrade programme for street lighting by local authorities, will continue, and further financing instruments will be promoted to modernise water supply and irrigation infrastructure (network replacement, remote control/command systems, replacement of older pumps with new ones, more energy-efficient ones, etc.), which are also expected to have a significant impact on energy savings and at the same time on the cost of providing water services. In the context of a holistic approach, the planning and implementation of policy measures in the building, transport and network sectors is taking place with a view to promoting innovative smart city models. In this context, both buildings and vehicles, as independent entities, will be capable of communicating and interacting through support structures based on the use of advanced ICTs. Smart meters and smart networks will form a key part of these plans, allowing for the monitoring and management of the large amounts of information that will be necessary for their harmonious operation. When completed, the programme for the deployment of smart meters will contribute significantly towards the rational use of energy by final consumers. Furthermore, combined with the new regulatory framework for the demand response mechanism, better electricity balancing and peak load management are to be achieved. The energy savings potential related to the correct implementation of the EU legislative framework for ecodesign and energy labelling of products will be best utilised through systematic controls of their implementation. Information actions on energy efficiency will also contribute to awareness-raising and, ultimately, to encouraging final consumers to adopt more rational practices of energy use. Both upgrading the role of energy performance certificates  by looking into alternative ways of converting them into tailored roadmaps for the energy upgrading of buildings or building units  and developing new certification schemes for installers to ensure the proper implementation of energy savings interventions and the maximum utilisation of the options offered by the relevant technologies are expected to make a contribution in this direction. Additional horizontal actions contributing to the implementation of energy upgrades in the building sector are both the development of a common and open database and the establishment of a legislative framework for setting up innovative technology procurement groups, as well as the use of innovative digital models for the construction and management of buildings over their lifecycle. The aim of the database will be to better identify the relevant savings potential of the projects under preparation and to facilitate benchmarking between similar buildings through the available energy features of listed buildings and ex-post data of 160 energy savings projects with a view to mitigating the risk of relevant investments. Accordingly, the setup of innovative technology procurement groups will lead to lower costs for the design and implementation of energy savings measures. Green procurement is expected to play a major role in the new period through the inclusion of criteria for the promotion of highly energy-efficient technologies and services, while at the same time demonstrating the exemplary role of the public sector. Policy measures in the transport sector, which are expected to be further specified in the context of the strategic plan for transport, are a priority for the new period, just like the completion of the infrastructure needed to promote alternative fuels in transport, the consideration of new regulatory measures, the revision of the existing institutional framework for the development of a market in alternative fuel infrastructures and the adoption of tax incentives for all types of alternative fuels. More specifically, the promotion of electromobility is a key priority in the transport sector. An analysis of policy measures for promoting electromobility is provided in Chapter 3.3. In respect of the use of natural gas in road transport, the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as fuel for heavy vehicles is of particular interest. In this context, plans are being made to deploy a network of 8 LNG refuelling stations by 2030. The network of compressed natural gas (CNG) refuelling stations for vehicles is being deployed, whereas provision has been made for 55 CNG stations to be in operation throughout Greece by 2030, to meet the relevant demand. Finally, the relevant institutional framework has already been drawn up, and there is appropriate know-how in the market in such matters as the establishment and operation of CNG stations, vehicle retrofit shops, technicians, car repair shops and technical control centres (KTEOs) for CNG vehicles, as well as transport of CNG by road to users outside the gas pipeline network. Moreover, the implementation of infrastructure projects in the field of road and rail transport, combined with the drafting of plans for a shift in commercial transport operations, is expected to significantly improve energy efficiency in the sector.   161 Sustainable urban mobility plans will play a major role in improving energy efficiency in the transport sector by incorporating the key principles of circular and cooperative economy. Sustainable urban mobility plans will cover all modes and means of transport, including public transport and active modes of travel, such as walking and cycling, as well as shared means of movement and smart mobility. On a complementary basis, targeted actions, such as bioclimatic restructuring programmes, will be launched in conjunction with sustainable urban mobility plans. Furthermore, priority will be given to the definition of a compulsory quota of vehicles with higher energy efficiency in public agencies and organisations by setting higher energy efficiency limits, while at the same time making plans for upgrading public transport by the use of new technology vehicles to the extent that this is efficient in financial, technological and energy terms. Finally, the replacement of passenger vehicles and light goods vehicles with new high energy efficiency ones will be promoted through a combination of measures such as planning a targeted programme for passenger vehicle scrapping, putting in place a more effective legislative framework to link vehicle taxation to energy efficiency and CO2 emissions, and implementing a broader financing programme for the replacement of public and freight vehicles with low-emission ones. Please note that the market in vehicles using alternative fuels will contribute significantly towards improving energy efficiency in the road transport sector. As regards converting existing vehicles to use alternative fuels, it is necessary to put in place an appropriate institutional framework for certifying the conversion of such vehicles. The existing framework for mandatory energy audits on large enterprises will facilitate the promotion of similar audits on SMEs and households. Furthermore, incentives will be established for implementing the energy savings measures proposed through energy audits not only to obliged large enterprises, but also to SMEs and households. Moreover, new measures will be developed to support the implementation of energy management systems in SMEs in order to keep improving their energy efficiency. In the industrial sector, the existing programmes for the provision of financial incentives to improve the energy efficiency of industries and manufacturing enterprises will continue in the new programming period and, in addition to that, the measure for the relocation of industrial plants to industrial-business zones will be strengthened. New policy measures will support 162 actions at an industrial-business zone level for better energy management and increased savings, such as central heat production and distribution systems. Furthermore, the promotion of natural gas as fuel in industries established far from the high pressure network through the transportation of liquefied natural gas is expected to be important. In the same context, the production of energy from the utilisation of waste heat and the replacement of conventional fuels with alternative ones will be promoted. Finally, special financing mechanisms will be designed to strengthen the implementation of energy efficiency improvement measures in the industrial sector through energy performance contracts, such as subsidising borrowing costs and facilitating access of energy services companies to financing. Finally, a specific package of policy measures aimed at improving energy efficiency in the agricultural sector is currently being considered. For example, a measure to improve the energy efficiency of pumping stations, as well as new measures such as the energy upgrading of agricultural machinery and the reduction in energy consumption in greenhouses and livestock farms are being planned. 3.4.5 Policies and measures to promote the role of local energy communities More active involvement of stakeholders at local and regional levels will be ensured initially by drawing up both the Action Plans for Sustainable Energy and the Action Plans for Energy Efficiency of Buildings under the responsibility of regions and municipalities and then by implementing the proposed interventions with support from targeted financing programmes under the regional operational programmes for the new programming period. These may also make a crucial contribution towards specific policy measures, such as promoting energy services in the public sector through specific demonstration projects, facilitating obliged parties in the context of the obligation scheme through the concentration of candidate energy savings projects and the development of sustainable urban mobility plans and a shift in transport operations. Finally, focus should be given to actions aimed at ensuring that the energy communities scheme contributes both to the use of waste to produce electricity or biomethane for use in transport, as well as to the implementation of energy upgrading projects by the use of recyclable materials.   163 3.4.6 Measures to exploit the energy efficiency potential of gas and electricity infrastructure Specific measures to improve the energy efficiency of electricity and gas infrastructures will be implemented by operators in the context of development programmes, focusing on energy efficiency improvement in transmission, distribution and load management, network interoperability, and energy generating installations, including micro energy generators. Electricity and gas infrastructure operators will prepare reports describing the actions implemented regarding transmission, distribution, load management and interoperability, and connection to energy generating installations, including access possibilities for micro energy generators. Moreover, concrete measures and investments will be identified for the introduction of cost-effective energy efficiency improvements in the network infrastructure, with a timetable for their introduction. Finally, consideration will be given to modifying the existing framework for the determination of regulated charges, granting an incentive to transmission and distribution network operators of enjoying a higher return on invested capital if they attain specific energy efficiency improvement targets. 3.4.7 Measures to improve energy efficiency under Article 7 The energy savings objective under Directive (EU) 2018/2002 on energy efficiency in the period 2021-2030 amounts to 7,299 ktoe of cumulative energy savings taking into account the obligation to achieve energy savings annually equal to 0.8% of the average final energy consumption of the 2016-2018 period (Table 19). Please note that the energy savings objective was calculated on the basis of a provisional estimate of final energy consumption for 2018 (16 317 Ktoe), as opposed to the years 2016 and 2017 for which official data published by EUROSTAT (16 694 and 16 752 Ktoe, respectively) were used.   164 Table 19: Setting the energy savings objective under Article 7 of Directive (EU) 2018/2002.

More specifically, energy efficiency obligation schemes will account for 20% of the total cumulative objective for the period 2021-2030, whereas a total of nine alternative policy measures will be implemented to cover the remaining part of the objective, reflecting the key policy priorities and the most important energy efficiency improvement measures. A detailed description of the alternative policy measures and of the basic principles of the energy efficiency obligation schemes is given in a relevant computer file developed using the format proposed by the Regulation, regarding all technical issues relating to the correct application of Article 7. 165 Table 20: Mix of policy measures to attain the objective under Article 7 of Directive (EU) 2018/2002.

Moreover, as referred to in Section 1.4 on regional cooperation participation through its representatives in CA-EED and CA-EPBD contributes significantly to cooperation between Greece and other Member States. 3.4.9 Financing measures including support from and use of EU funds in this area at a national level The challenges resulting from the planning and implementation of the funding measures envisaged consist, inter alia, in maximising the expected leverage, using available State resources more efficiently, adopting innovative financing tools and mobilising the domestic financial sector more actively. To that end, all available resources will be mobilised at national and EU levels, including the structural funds. Particular emphasis will be placed on the energy upgrading of the building stock through energy performance contracts and generally through PPPs. The establishment of the Energy Efficiency Fund will significantly enhance the implementation of energy efficiency improvement measures in all energy consumption areas. More specifically, the Energy Efficiency Fund is expected to facilitate the access of stakeholders to financing, to help improve the cost-result indicator of the programmes implemented, and to allow for more effectively utilising the untapped potential for energy savings in specific sectors. Also, the measure of tax relief through the doubling of depreciation rates for fixed assets used in energy savings investment by legal persons will continue. Similar tax relief measures will be further specified, such as tax exemption through expenditure on the energy upgrading of buildings, taking due account of the estimated impact on the Greek economy as a whole. The implementation of a wholly new measure introducing tendering procedures for achieving energy savings is expected to give a significant boost to energy efficiency improvement in specific sectors, such as the tertiary and industrial sectors. This measure will aim at introducing tendering procedures to improve the cost-effectiveness of the technologies used and to reduce 167 the risk of measures implemented by third parties through the grouping of small individual projects. Finally, innovative and dedicated financing instruments will be designed to promote energy services more broadly and exploit the untapped potential for energy savings in specific sectors.   168 Implementation of new financing mechanisms and instruments (1/2) The new financing instruments to be implemented will contribute primarily to the effective use of potentially available resources for improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. These include mobilising additional sources of funding from the Greek financial sector, the envisaged National Energy Efficiency Fund or the Structural Funds in the context of the new programming period 2021-2027. National Energy Efficiency Fund The National Energy Efficiency Fund is expected to provide the basis for the development of new financing tools, aiming to finance programmes and other measures for energy efficiency improvement and to develop the market in energy services. The Fund may serve as both lending fund and guarantee fund. Initially, part of the capital of the structural funds is expected to be transferred to the National Energy Efficiency Fund in order to support energy savings projects by considering the use of the revolving capital mechanism. which loans are granted and in the context of which loan repayments are made and re-leased. Using this mechanism, the Energy Efficiency Fund can grant favourable loans to public authorities or to energy service companies with a view to implementing savings projects. To make investment more attractive, available funds may be used to subsidise part of the cost of the project or to further improve the conditions for financing loans to energy service companies or public authorities. Finally, advisory services are expected to be funded, to identify potential savings and monitor projects in order to ensure proper results.   169 Implementation of new financing mechanisms and instruments (2/2) Innovative financing instruments for blended funding Moreover, innovative blended/hybrid finance programmes will be designed in cooperation with the domestic financial sector. These programmes will combine public and private financing on favourable terms, to support energy efficiency improvement in specific sectors with a high potential, such as the tertiary, domestic and industrial sectors. In this direction, new mechanisms will be considereconcessional loans), lease-financing, risk-sharing instruments such as blended insurance and guarantee instruments, as well as mechanisms focusing on aggregation. Financing instruments can be used by energy service companies that need financing to implement energy efficiency plans in order to better manage repayment thereof, whereas consideration will also be given to extending their scope to include other sectors too (SMEs). Tendering procedures for energy savings The new measure of tendering procedures, in its pilot application, is expected to focus on final energy savings, thus making a significant contribution towards the attainment of the objective under Article 7. The measure will provide financial support for technical energy savings interventions in sectors with high potential, such as the industrial and tertiary sectors. Provision is made for the tendering procedure to focus primarily on the cost-effectiveness of the interventions and to conform to clear-cut guidelines for calculating and verifying the energy savings achieved. Moreover, the measure will be highly flexible as it will be open to all domestic enterprises, while it is expected to increase the competitiveness of energy savings investment projects.   170 3.4.10 Summary of policy measures Table 21 summarises the policy measures envisaged with a view to attaining the individual energy efficiency objectives.   171 Table 21: Policy measures envisaged to improve energy efficiency.
