3.2. Dimension of energy efficiency Planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030 as well as other objectives referred to in point 2.2, including planned measures and instruments (also of a financial nature) to promote the energy performance of buildings, in particular with regard to the following: i. Energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative policy measures referred to in Articles 7(a) and 7(b) of Directive 2012/27/EU, to be drawn up in accordance with Annex II of this Directive Energy efficiency targets are currently served mainly by programmes referred to in above points 3.1.1 and 3.1.3. It is also worth noting that a new tax advantage was introduced in 2017, offered to undertakings in relation to efficiency-improving investments. The tax advantage scheme  serving enhanced stability of operation  is being fine-tuned with solutions in conformity with EU regulations and universally adopted by national regulations to also ensure the implementation of projects requiring larger investment and offering a greater energy saving potential. The National Network of Energy Engineers was set up in 2017 as an advisory network operating at government offices and district offices. The advisers are responsible for supporting the energy efficient operation of public bodies  including local authorities  and undertakings, and the reduction of retail energy                                                       57 Government Decree No 186/2019 of 26 July 2019.  consumption with professional consulting. By enhancing the National Network of Energy Engineers it is necessary to ensure the provision of free online and personal consulting services to the public with the involvement of energy and engineering specialists, economic specialists and architects. In the future, indication of the contact information of the closest network consulting point will become mandatory for building performance certificates. As two new instruments of the energy efficiency policy, we have introduced the obligation scheme referred to in the EED and encourage use of ESCO-type financing solutions. Within the obligation scheme, Hungary requires energy distributors and/or retail energy trade undertakings to introduce programmes and implement measures resulting in evidenced energy savings for final customers. The companies concerned are responsible for finding the most cost-effective means of such solutions, thus the introduction of the scheme is expected to achieve the economically optimal fulfilment of energy efficiency objectives. The obligation scheme also allows suppliers and/or distributors to choose the group of customers  industry, households, public bodies or the services sector  for the given investment. The cost-effectiveness of the obligation scheme can be further enhanced with ESCO-type financing solutions that simplify and extend access to funds in both the retail and corporate sectors (to increase energy production capacities supporting product manufacturing). The ESCO services can additionally increase the share and volume of economically sustainable investments, ensure uniform quality of implementation, and contribute to establishing acceptable price levels on the demand side.  financing  implementation - modules and are operated at system level. The substance of individual modules, however, can be flexibly modified, and adjusted to the options and needs of the given project promoters (customers). In the course of energy efficiency investments implemented with ESCO financing, purchased facilities and equipment are stated in the balance sheet of the ESCO company, i.e. the costs and risks of the investment are borne by the customer (off-balance sheet financing). The project is recovered with surplus funds generated with energy savings or the flat-rate service fee paid by the customer. The Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) model is applied in the first case, while the Shared Savings Contracting (SSC) model is applied in the latter case. Both models are suitable to also satisfy energy saving needs in parallel with implemented modernisation, and to guarantee the development and implementation of economically sustainable investments. The EPC model is also committed to realising the savings ratio measured in advance and subsequently specifically set out in the energy savings contract. In relation to building energy performance, energy efficiency investments of the central budget and local authorities, the ESCO based services minimise or render unnecessary the use of budgetary resources and EU non-refundable aids, thereby contributing to reducing general government debt and the more rational use of diminishing funds in the 2021-2027 programming period.  Combined financing available to ESCO companies enables not only the more enhanced use of financial products, and thereby the use of financing sources available for energy efficiency upgrades, but also the implementation of more risky investments. Financial products have a strong multiplier effect and owing to their reusability, they can multiply limited available funds. ii. Long-term renovation strategies to support the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings in private and public ownership58, including policies and measures promoting cost-effective deep renovations aimed at the worst performing segments of the national building stock, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU Hungary will draw up a Long-term Renovation Strategy by March 2020. (Measures implemented in this field are presented under the above point.) iii. Policies and measures promoting energy efficiency services in the public sector, and description of measures aimed at eliminating regulatory and non-regulatory barriers impeding the uptake of energy performance contracting and other energy efficiency service models59 Energy efficiency improvements in the roughly 960 000 public buildings of 12 00015 000 Hungarian public bodies offer a substantial energy saving potential. Based on experience in other countries, public bodies can reduce energy consumption by 15-30 % in 5 years. The combined improvement of energy efficiency and the efficient use of buildings can significantly reduce operating costs, also enabling cuts in the relevant budgetary expenditures. We are prescribing more stringent legal obligations to exploit the energy saving potential in the operation of public buildings and are developing a personal incentive scheme for operators of public bodies. We are clarifying rules for implementing the proposals of energy auditors and consultants. We are clarifying legal regulations relating to the construction of nearly zero energy buildings and the decree on certifying building energy performance. (For additional information see point 3.2.i.)  iv. Other planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030, and other objectives referred to in point 2.2 (e.g. measures to promote the exemplary role of public bodies, energy-efficient public procurement, measures promoting energy audits and energy management systems60, measures to inform                                                       58 In accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU.  59 In accordance with Article 18 of Directive 2012/27/EU.  60 In accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2012/27/EU.  consumers and to provide training61, and other measures promoting energy efficiency62)  In the economic sector, a key objective is sustainable and climate-friendly energy management even by maintaining and further increasing industrial output. The competitiveness of energy and GHG intensive industrial activities is guaranteed by their ability to not exceed the unit energy consumption and GHG emissions of their European industrial competitors. Enforcement of this criterion can be monitored partly through the operation of the EU ETS, and the GHG intensity and emission allowance data of Hungarian sectors and European competitors. The goal is for emission allowances of Hungarian sectors to at least reach the EU average. As a central instrument of this goal, it is necessary to use funds of the Innovation Fund  managed by the European Commission  by Hungarian industrial producers to the extent possible.  In parallel with maintaining the existing energy intensive industrial sectors, from an energy strategic point of view future industrial investments should be made in low energy and GHG intensive, high-tech industrial sectors that support the sustainable and competitive development of the Hungarian economic structure. v. Where applicable, a description of policies and measures to promote the role of local renewable energy communities in contributing to the implementation of policies and measures in points i, ii, iii and iv Details are provided under point v. of Chapter 3.1.2. vi. Description of measures aimed at exploiting the energy efficiency potential of the natural gas and electricity infrastructure63 The use of gas pipelines and, within this context, changes in network access fees are also relevant in relation to the distribution network. We aim to assess  in accordance with Government Decision No 1772/2018 of 21 December 201864  the potential phasing out of distribution pipelines with a low utilisation rate (below 10 %) and their possible phasing out with the offer of heating alternatives with low carbon intensity. We are installing 1 million smart consumption meters in the electricity sector. We will prescribe the replacement of conventional consumption meters  upon their expiry  exclusively with smart metering                                                       61 In accordance with Articles 12 and 17 of Directive 2012/27/EU. 62 In accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2012/27/EU. 63 In accordance with Article 15(2) of Directive 2012/27/EU. 64 Government Decision No 1772/2018 of 21 December 2018 on decisions laying the groundwork for a new National Energy Strategy.  equipment upon fulfilment of certain conditions, the cost of which may not be charged to consumers. In parallel we will require universal service providers and authorised traders to offer flexible tariff packages encouraging the more effective use of the network to consumers with smart meters. vii. Regional cooperation in this field, if applicable viii. Financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds, in the area at national level Targeted solutions offered by companies within the obligation scheme in all economic sectors, with support provided under ESCO-type financing schemes. Own funds of economic operators, and credit products of the EBRD and money market credit institutions should also be used. Funds may be supplemented with refundable aid offered under the relevant operational programme in the 2021-2027 programming period, and financing provided from the national budget (e.g. maintained corporation tax advantages serving energy efficiency investments). Innovation in industrial energy efficiency can be implemented with national innovation funds, operational programmes of the 2021-2027 period and financing opportunities offered by programmes directly managed by the EU. Credit offered on the market and by the European Investment Bank is also a potential financing instrument. Support of the smart cost allocation programme of homes with district heating and the installation of smart consumption meters with non-refundable aid provided by operational programmes in the 2021-2027 period. Carbon credit revenues and the non-refundable funds of the Modernisation Fund launched in 2021 are also potential financing instruments for developing the district heating sector.
