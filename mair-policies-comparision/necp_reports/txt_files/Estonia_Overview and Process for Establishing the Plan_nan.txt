SECTION A: NATIONAL PLAN 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN  Executive Summary i. Political, economic, environmental, and social context of the plan. The year 2019 marked 28 years since Estonia regained its independence. We have been a member of the EU for 15 of those years. In 2019, the main factors behind the ever-increasing energy demand were open offices and working from home, zero-energy buildings, air-conditioning and ventilation, electric scooters and parcel robots, social media, smart devices and cloud services, There are currently no exact projections of the impact of these new energy dependencies on the climate and the environment, on energy management or human health. The Estonia 2035 strategy1, which assesses global megatrends and will influence lifestyles - and hence energy demand - is currently being drafted. In 2019 there are 1.32 million people living in Estonia, with an average monthly gross Economic growth was approximately twice as rapid as the EU average (in 2018, real GDP growth in Estonia was 3.9%, whereas the EU average was 2.0%=. The generation of electricity from oil shale and wind power decreased in 2018 compared to the previous year, while electricity generation from wood fuels increased. The production and export of wood pellets continues to increase. Estonia has three times as much organic farmland than the EU average, accounting for 20% of the land. The air in Estonia is - for example Tallinn ranks fourth on the list of capital cities with the purest air. There is still a need to address air pollution particulates (PM2.5) and related emissions from local heating that are due to ageing heating equipment and incorrect wood-based heating methods2. e3, the current Government plans to develop the Estonian economy into a competitive, low-carbon economy by the middle of the century. On 3 October 2019, the Government decided to support the establishment of an EU-wide long-term climate neutrality objective by 2015 if there are sufficient transition measures and the differences and different baselines of Member States and sectors are taken into account. Member States should retain the right to select appropriate ways of achieving the targets, including making sovereign tax assessments to achieve climate neutrality. Measures for achieving a climate-neutral economy in Estonia by 2015 are currently under development and hence cannot be included in this plan.                                                            1 Materials on the Estonia 2035 strategy can be found at: https://www.riigikantselei.ee/et/valitsuse-toetamine/strateegia-eesti-2035/materjalid  2 This section uses data from the Statistics Estonia portal, www.stat.ee.  3 https://www.valitsus.ee/sites/default/files/content-editors/valitsus/Ratasellvalitsus/vabariigi_valitsuse_tegevusprogramm_2019-2023.pdf  communication that has been drawn up to meet the requirement laid down in Article3(1) of Regulation (EU) No 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy  according to which each Member State is to prepare and submit to the Commission its national Energy and Climate Plan every ten years. The plan must be submitted to the Commission by 31December 2019 and any updated versions or justifications for not updating the plan must be submitted by 30 June 2023 and 30June 2024. The Regulation sets out a template for the plan to ensure all Member State plans are comparable. The Commission will publish all the plans on its website.4 In Estonia, strategic planning by the State is based on the State Budget Act5. According to the Act, there are two types of development document in Estonia, namely those concerning fundamental elements of policy and development plans. Documents concerning fundamental elements of policy are approved by decision of the Estonian Government following discussion in Parliament. This means that in Estonia, the energy objectives and actions required in the national energy and climate plans of Member States are laid down primarily as sectoral development documents and documents on fundamental elements of policy. 1) are as follows6: 2) 7: 3) Plan for climate change adaptation by 20308; 4) 2014-2020 transport development plan9 (2021-2030 plan is under preparation); 5) 2011-2020 forestry development plan10 (2021-2030 plan is under preparation); 6) 2014-2020 national waste management plan11 (2021-2030 plan is under preparation); 7) Estonian 2014-2020 rural affairs development plan (2021-2030 plan is under preparation); NECP 2030 will be updated in future years based on the development plans being drawn up for the following decade and submitted to the European Commission by 30 June2013 and in connection with supplementing the national targets by 30 June 2024. NECP 2030 describes the provisions of these development documents and highlights the relevant measures and trends. The development plans on which the NECP 2030 is based are the strategic environmental assessments (SEA), in accordance with the Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental                                                            4 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/governance-energy-union/national-energy-climate-plans  5 The State Budget Act can be found at: https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/107072017040  6 http://www.envir.ee/sites/default/files/362xiii_rk_o_04.2017-1.pdf  7 https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/enmak_2030.pdf.  8 https://www.envir.ee/sites/default/files/kliimamuutustega_kohanemise_arengukava_aastani_2030_1.pdf  9 https://www.mkm.ee/et/tegevused-eesmargid/transport  10 https://www.envir.ee/et/metsanduse-arengukava-2011-2020  11 https://www.envir.ee/et/eesmargid-tegevused/jaatmed/riigi-jaatmekava-2014-2020  Management System Act (KeHJS). The NECP 2030 does not constitute a strategic planning document under Section 31 of the Act, as the requirement to draw it up is laid down in Regulation (EU) No 2018/1999. NECP 2030 includes both measures from national development documents and measures under discussion. Future updates to the NECP 2030 will include case-by-case assessment of whether, depending on amendments to the document, the document fulfils the functions of a strategic planning document within the meaning of the Act. The Act lays down provisions concerning national strategic planning documents, but not the process of initiating and drafting the SEAs of documents required under EU and international agreements. For the reasons given above, no SEA procedure carried out for the NECP 2030 12. In addition to the above-mentioned development documents, the following studies were used in the course of drafting to develop measures: 1. National general energy efficiency obligation for the period 2021-2030 and achievement of the renewable energy target (2018); https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/180917_energiatohusus_2030_aruanne.pdf  2. Study to identify the most cost-effective measures for achieving climate policy objectives and the aims of the Effort Sharing Regulation in Estonia (2018); https://www.envir.ee/sites/default/files/news-related-files/aruanne_kliimapoliitika_kulutohusus.pdf  3. (drafted by SEI Tallinn, Finantsakadeemia OÃœ) https://www.sei.org/publications/eesti-kliimaambitsiooni-tostmise-voimaluste-analuus/  This document has been drawn up jointly by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Rural Affairs based on the development documents and studies referred to above and other relevant analysis. These development documents were drawn up during the creation of NECP 2030 and involved experts from business, research and development institutes, local government bodies and their representative organisations, and community, environmental and professional associations. ii. Strategy relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union. NECP 2030 has been drawn up on the basis of the applicable development documents, which in their turn had been drafted taking into consideration EU and international environmental, energy and climate aims. Chapter 1.2.ii considers the five dimensions of the Energy Union in Estonian policy and measures. Together with the Nordic countries,                                                            12 11.11.2019 No 1-5/19/5595-2.  Baltic States and EU Member States, as well as various national organisations, Estonia is moving towards the development of an energy community that takes consumers into account and the markets, spreads best practices, applies the latest scientific developments and innovations and up-to-date technological solutions to achieve a climate-neutral, competitive, environmentally friendly and socially responsible, sustainable economic model. The objective of the Energy Union13 is to give EU consumers - households and businesses - secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy. It requires the creation of a Europe-wide energy system. The climate change strategy of the Energy Union to create a sustainable climate-friendly economy with reduced CO2 emissions includes: consumer empowerment, alignment of the policies and legal frameworks of the Member States, elimination of barriers to entry and isolated areas, establishment of an integrated energy market, thereby ensuring affordable energy prices, upgrade of energy infrastructure to allow greater production capacities of renewable energy and increase investment, investments in new high-tech industries, business models, professions and competitive businesses to create new jobs. To increase energy security, sustainability and competitiveness, the Energy Union aims to:  Develop the internal energy market, make energy consumption more efficient, diversify energy sources and supply routes, work closely to ensure security of transparency of the gas supply (the energy security, solidarity and trust dimension);  Interconnect markets, fully implement EU energy legislation with the internal market for energy measures, enhance regional cooperation, empower consumers and make new deals with consumers, and decrease energy poverty (the fully integrated internal market dimension);  create a more energy-efficient construction sector and an energy-efficient, decarbonised transport sector (the energy efficiency dimension);  Plan an ambitious climate policy, retain leadership in the area of renewable energy (the decarbonising the economy dimension);  Be at the forefront of next generation of renewable technologies, storage solutions, smart grid and home solutions, smart cities, building neutrality, clean transport, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear energy files under Horizon 2020 (the research, innovation and competitiveness dimension); iii. Overview table with key objectives, policies and measures of the plan                                                            13 Energy Union package on A Framework Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union with a Forward-Looking Climate Change Policy. http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/documents/com/com_com(2015)0080_/com_com(2015)0080_et.pdf  The key objectives of NCEP 2030 are as follows:  Achievement of an 80% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 (including 70% by 2030); In 1990, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 40.4 Mt CO2ekv (excl. LULUCF14), in 2017 they were 20.9 Mt CO2ekv (incl. 14.7 Mt CO2ekv from the energy sector). The projected GHG emissions for 2030 when the existing and additional measures under the NCEP 2030 are applied are 10.7-12.5 Mt CO2ekv, (excl. LULUCF).  Achieve a 13% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels in the sectors falling under the scope of the Shared Effort Regulation (transport, small-scale power, agriculture, waste management, forestry, industry). According to the 2019 GHG inventory, in 2005 GHG emissions in the sectors covered by the Shared Effort Regulation totalled 6.3 Mt CO2ekv15, i.e. in 2030 emissions from the sector might total 5.5 Mt CO2ekv (the exact target for 2030 will become clear in 2020, when the national emission levels for the period 2021-2030 will be determined for the sectors under the Regulation).  The share of renewable energy in total final consumption must be at least 42% by the year 2030: In 2030, production of renewable energy will be 16 TWh, which is 50% of final energy consumption, including 4.3 TWh renewable electricity (2018 = 1.8 TWh), renewable heat 11 TWh (2018 = 9.5 TWh) and transport 0.7 TWh (2018 = 0.3 TWh);  In 2030, final energy consumption must remain at 32-33 TWh:  consumption at the same level. The general energy saving objective of 14.7 TWh for the period 2020-2030 applicable under Directive 2012/27/EU (the Energy Efficiency Directive) will help keep final energy consumption at the same level. Making primary energy consumption more efficient will help reduce energy consumption.  Reduction of primary energy consumption to 14% (compared to the peak of recent years): In the period 2020-2030, Estonia is capable of reducing primary energy consumption by steps such as modernising the shale industry.  Ensuring energy security by keeping the rate of dependency on imported energy as low as possible: Use of local fuels is kept as high as possible (including increasing the use of fuel-free energy sources), developing biomethane production and potential uses.  Meeting the minimum criteria for interconnectivity of electricity grids: Increasing capacity towards Latvia and synchronising the power grid with the Central European frequency band by 2025.  Use of research and development and innovation in measures to retain the competiveness of the economy:                                                            14 Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry. 15 Estonian GHG emissions inventory1990-2017: https://www.envir.ee/et/eesmargid-tegevused/kliima/rahvusvaheline-aruandlus/kui-palju-eestis-kasvuhoonegaase-tekib  research and development programme will enable the application of measures using research and development results. A total of 71 measures have been developed to meet the NECP 2030 objectives: 22 for agriculture, 16 for transport, 13 for energy, 8 for forestry, 6 for building stock, 4 for waste management and 1 for industry. One measure is cross-sectoral. The impact of these measures on GHG reduction, renewable energy and energy-efficiency is shown in Annex III of the plan and the measures are described in Annex IV. The main energy and climate measures of the plan are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Main energy and climate measures by sector.

Involvement of the national parliament The draft NECP 2030 and its drafting procedure was first introduced by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communication and the Ministry of the Environment to the Economic Affairs Committee of the Estonian Parliament (Riigikogu) on 13 November 2018. The final version of NECP 2030 was presented on 18 November 2019, 19 November 2019 and 2 December 2019 in accordance with the Parliamentary Committee for EU, Economic and Environmental Affairs. ii. Involvement of local and regional authorities Proposals made regarding the draft NECP 2030, and an overview of how these proposals were assessed, can be found in Annex V. Preparations for drawing up the draft ENMAK 2030 began in October 2012, involving local government, organisations representing the energy sector and stakeholders in Estonian policy-making regarding energy. All local government bodies in Estonia were informed that ENMAK 2030 and a strategic assessment of its environmental impact were being drawn up. Local government representatives also took part in discussions related to the drafting of ENMAK 2030. They were similarly involved in the drafting process for th Local government bodies who had been actively involved in drawing up ENMAK 2030 were informed in June 2018 about the draft NECP 2030 by a joint letter from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communication and the Ministry of the Environment. The joint letter invited interested parties to express their interest in participating in the process of drafting NECP 2030 using an online form19. Local government representatives and others were invited to attend a draft NECP 2030 introduction event on 9 October 2018. The Association of Estonian Cities and Municipalities, which is the organisation representing local government in Estonia, is a member of the Energy Council of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications. Before the introduction event, working documents related to the draft NECP 2030 were published on the cloud page of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications20. The working version of the draft NECP, supplemented based on the proposals received by June 2019, was presented on 4 October 2019 after the presentation of the 21  to 165 representatives of the energy sector. There were also NECP 2030 discussions on the topic of the just transition and low-carbon technologies with 60 participants at the Ministry of the Environment on 18 October 2019. On 14 November 2019 the final draft version of NECP 2030 was presented to 150 participants at a conference on research into and use of renewable energy sources at the Estonian University of Life Sciences in Tartu22. The drafts were presented on 18 November 2019, 19 November 2019 and 2 December 2019 in accordance with the Parliamentary Committee for EU, Economic and Environmental Affairs. Public consultation on draft 2030 NCEP The first working version of the draft NECP 2030 was published in the Estonian Information System for Legal Drafts of the Government of the Republic (EIS)23 on 10 December 2018 with an invitation to submit general comments on it by 20 December 2018 and detailed comments by 6 February 2019. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications forwarded the notice about the public consultation on 7 December 2018, among others, all parties that had expressed a wish to receive information on the progress of NECP 2030 using the online form.                                                            19 http://bit.ly/REKK_2030_huviline.

The comments, in Annex V, were taken into account when drafting NECP 2030. The NECP 2030 document submitted to the European Commission by the end of 2019 was coordinated with other ministries via the EIS and other interested parties were able to express their opinion about the draft during this process. Executive summary of the initial considerations submitted about the draft NECP 2030 Comments submitted on the draft and how they were taken into account in the draft NECP 2030 can be found in Annex V to the draft. In 2019, the following institutions submitted their comments: the European Commission, Estonian Fund for Nature, Estonian Green Movement, Estonian Environmental Law Centre, Estonian Seminatural Communities Conservation Association, Estonian Energy Industries Union (ETL), Elektrilevi OÃœ, Estonian Renewable Energy Association, Fermi Energia OÃœ, the oil shale processing industry company Viru Keemia Grupp AS, the Ministry of Finance, Tiit Kallaste (Estonian Hydrogen Association), International Association of Oil & Gas Producers, AS Estonian Cell, Team Paldiski OÃœ, Teet Randma, environmental organisations and the Competition Authority. On the whole the comments and proposals were related to energy supply and transmission, production capacities, production and carbon price projections; specification of plan targets, indicators and measures and implementation of measures. The Minister of the Environment and the Minister of the Rural Affairs approved the October 2019 working version of the draft NECP 2030 in the EIS, while the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Education and Research sent supplementary drafting proposals. Evaluating the initial comments concerning the draft NECP 2030 The draft NECP 2030 has been publicly available for comments since December 2018. Comments received from the European Commission and other organisations as of 29 November 2019 have been taken into account in the preparation of NECP 2030 as shown in the table of responses to the comments in Annex V  iii. Consultations of stakeholders, including the social partners, and engagement of civil society and the general public Other stakeholders have been involved in drawing up ENMAK 2030, KPP 2050 and NECP 2030 in exactly the same way as local governments, whose involvement was described in chapter 1.3.ii. The most important stakeholder representatives of the stakeholders belong to the Energy Council of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications The Energy Council is considered the multilevel climate and energy dialogue that Member States must establish pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 2018/1999. iv.

A summary of the main objectives of the plan and the measures were sent for comments to the Baltic Council of Ministers in October 2019 and to the Finnish ministry responsible for energy issues.  Cooperation chapters 1.4.ii and 5.4.i with harmonised content were drawn up on the initiative of Latvia. v. Iterative process with the European Commission Annex V shows the comments submitted by the European Commission concerning the draft NECP 2030 and our evaluation. There were several European Commission working groups in autumn of 2019 involved in the preparation of the national energy and climate plans and the suggestions made there were taken into account in supplementing the draft NECP 2030.  Regional cooperation in preparing the plan i. Elements subject to joint or coordinated planning with other Member States The NECP 2030 objectives and measures were sent for coordination to Lithuania, Latvia and Finland in October 2019 but these countries have not sent amendment proposals. ii. Explanation of how regional cooperation is considered in the plan Estonia participates in various forms of region cooperation on energy and climate policy (in the context of the climate and energy policy of the Paris Climate Agreement), including:  Baltic Assembly24;  Summits of the Prime Ministers of the Baltic States;  The Baltic Council of Ministers;                                                            24 Cooperation among the National Parliaments of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.  European Union Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region EUSBSR) and Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEIMP);  Baltic-Nordic Energy Research Programme25. Regional cooperation takes the form of the Baltic Council of Ministers (BCM), within which the Committee of Senior Officials has been established. The Committee convenes regularly according to the working programme of the Presidency (the presidency rotates yearly).  Joint activities for the development of the regional electricity and gas market and enhancement of joint infrastructure projects are discussed within the framework of the Energy Council. The Committee guides and monitors the work of the regional gas market coordination group, whose aim is to create a regional gas market that operates under common rules and covers the Baltic States and Finland.  Its work is based the action plan for the development of a single gas market. Estonia participates actively in the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP) work group that discusses the regional cooperation options in the area of electricity, gas, renewable energy (including offshore wind farms26) and energy efficiency. The BEMIP synchronisation high level working group consists of the Baltic States, Poland and European Commission members. It monitors and coordinates implementation of the synchronisation action plan for the electricity systems of the Baltic States. Intensive coordination of the energy policy of the Baltic States takes place on the level of senior officers of the Baltic Council of Ministers, but broader regional cooperation also covers Finland, Sweden, Poland, Denmark and Germany. In the context of the European Union, regional cooperation takes place in the BEIMP covering the infrastructure planning and more efficient use of financial resources, including the Connecting Europe Facility that supports only cross-border energy projects by boosting cooperation in the Baltic region. Several joint projects have improved the security of supply of electricity and gas in the Baltic region by helping ensure effective market development. The most important regional project is synchronisation of the Baltic power system with the European power system. There are also other important projects to ensure the effective functioning of the market, like improvement of the cross-border interconnectors and development of the regional gas market. The Baltic States consulted between themselves on the topic of NECPs within the BCM framework. Meetings of senior officials took place in the second half of 2018 and during 2019 generally and in connection with possible policy measures that could be applied jointly:                                                            25 Baltic Nordic Energy Research programme; https://www.nordicenergy.org/programme/the-joint-baltic-nordic-energy-research-programme  26 STUDY ON BALTIC OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY COOPERATION UNDER BEMIP https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/9590cdee-cd30-11e9-992f-01aa75ed71a1/language-en   Meeting of the BCM Environment Senior Officials in Vilnius on 26 April 2018; introduction of climate policy measures;  Meeting of the BCM, Environment Ministers, Vilnius on 23-24 May 2018; introduction of climate policy measures;  Nordic-Baltic Energy Conference, 29 September 2018 in Tallinn;  Meeting of the BCM Energy Senior Officials on 30 October 2018 and 29 August 2019;  Nordic-Baltic Energy conference 24-25 October 2019 in Tallinn. Estonia had a meeting and exchange of information with Finland in respect of NECP objectives, measures and strategic environmental impact assessments in September and October 2019. Regional consultations determined the opportunities for regional cooperation on renewable energy and associated technologies, specifically in the development of the offshore wind farms on the border between Estonia and Latvia and Latvia and Lithuania taking into account maritime spatial planning. According to a recent study on the potential of Baltic offshore wind farm energy27, the potential total capacity of the Baltic region is over 93 GW (187 wind farms with a total electrical generation capacity of 500 MW), incl. the following:  14 offshore wind farms in Estonia with a capacity of 7 GW and annual production of 26 TWh;  29 offshore wind farms in Latvia with the capacity of 15.5 GW and annual production of 49.2 TWh;  9 offshore wind farms in Lithuania with a capacity of 4.5 GW and annual production of 15.5 TWh; As of 2019, a total capacity of 2.5 GW from offshore wind farm applications in Estonia has been applied for and according to maritime spatial planning, a further total capacity of 5GW is being planned. Implementation of NECP 2030 involves regional cooperation on the gas market, synchronisation of the power system and cross-border electricity and gas projects. Cooperation in transport sector involves the implementation of the Rail Baltic project. Cooperation concerning agricultural and GHG emission reduction requires implementation of Directive 91/676/EEC (nitrate emission) and the air pollution control plan (ammonia emissions). The Baltic States agreed that the regional cooperation will be expanded to energy efficiency and development of renewable energy, especially in the transport sector, incl. the following:                                                            27 STUDY ON BALTIC OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY COOPERATION UNDER BEMIP https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/9590cdee-cd30-11e9-992f-01aa75ed71a1/language-en   Biomethane production and market development;  Coordination of biofuel requirements (topics related to mixing and taxes);  Coordination of possible road charges and heavy duty cargo customs. It is also possible to expand regional cooperation to include the agricultural and forestry sector (e.g. land improvement, measuring soil quality, etc.) by considering the cross-border impacts of agriculture, forestry and fishery To plan and apply the long-term (until 2030 and 2050) energy or climate policy and measures, requires the exchange of experience and knowledge of reduction of carbon emissions and energy efficiency in mutual cooperation, as this makes it easier to select appropriate methods and actions for meeting specific targets. The Baltic States have been and will continue to cooperate with the following bodies in the development and implementation of measures contributing to renewable energy, energy efficiency and climate change control and research and development:  The Nordic Council of Ministers; Nordic Energy Research; The regional operational security coordinator Baltic RSC, created by the Baltic TSOs (Elering, AST, Litgrid);  Union of Russia, Belarus, Kaliningrad, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia for the Coordination of Transmission of Electricity BRELL;  Nordic power exchange Nord Pool; Regional Gas Market Coordination Group (RCMCG); The natural gas market operator UAB GET Baltic and International Energy Agency (IEA), scientific cooperation projects and PhD exchange within the framework of the Nordic-Baltic Energy research programme. The project of common interest for synchronisation of the Baltic States with the Central Europe frequency band is carried out in cooperation between different partners,  Balticconnector, Rail Baltic and building the electrical system integrated cable connections
