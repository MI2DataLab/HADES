  13   PART 1 GENERAL FRAMEWORK SECTION A: NATIONAL PLAN 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 1.1 Executive Summary i. Political, economic, environmental and social context of the plan The European Union (EU) aims to be a global leader in the fight against climate change and is therefore striving to achieve the targets set in Paris Agreement reached by the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change while simultaneously ensuring clean energy across the Union. In order to fulfil this commitment, the Union has set the following binding targets for climate and energy to be achieved by 2030:  reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by at least 40 % compared with 1990;  increasing energy efficiency (EE) to at least 32.5 %;  increasing the share of energy from renewable sources (RS) in gross final energy consumption in the EU to at least 32 %;  ensuring a level of electricity interconnection between Member States equivalent to at least 15 %. In order to ensure a co-ordinated and concerted approach across the Union and implementation of the European Union Energy Strategy, each Member State (MS) was required to submit to the European Commission its draft Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (INECP) by 31 December 2018 and its final Integrated Plan by 31 December 2019. In accordance with Article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of 18 June 2019 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the governance of the Energy Union and climate action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament   14  and of the Council (Regulation (EU) 2018/1999), the Commission published its assessment of, and recommendations on, the draft plans in June 2019. mendations on board in the final version of Ministry of Energy, together with the Ministry of the Environment and Water, have made use of grant assistance under the Structural Reform Support Programme (SRSP) for the period 20172020 established by Regulation (EU) 2017/825 and managed by the Structural Reform Support Service. The process entailed the development of the final version of the Integrated Plan, taking into account the forecasting model in the area of energy and climate, and a long-term strategy in the area of climate. The consultant was ructural Reform Support Service (SRSS) and a technical assistance agreement was signed with the consultant on 19 August 2019. This Integrated Plan has been developed in accordance with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 and takes into account all recommendations received from the Commission on the draft INECP. It sets out the main objectives and measures for the implementation ies in the context of EU law, and the principles and priorities for energy sector development. The objectives set out in the INECP are as follows:  promoting low-carbon economic development;  developing a competitive and secure energy sector;  reducing dependence on fuel and energy imports;  ensuring that energy is available at affordable prices to all consumers. The national energy priorities can be summarised as follows:  increasing energy security and diversifying the supply of energy resources;  developing an integrated and competitive energy market;  using and developing energy from renewable sources based on available resources, network capacity and country specifics;  enhancing energy efficiency by developing and implementing new technologies for a modern and sustainable energy sector;  consumer protection by ensuring fair, transparent and non-discriminatory conditions for the use of energy services. The Integrated Plan complies with the main strategic documents at EU and national level.  The following national strategic documents (and draft documents in respect of which consultations are currently under way) were used in its preparation:  Energy Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria until 2020;   15   National Strategy for the Development of the Mining Industry until 2030;  participation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution;  Long-term national strategy for support for national residential and non-residential building stock renovation with an implementation horizon until 2050;  Innovation Strategy for Smart Specialisation;  National Programme for Energy Efficiency of Multi-Family Residential Buildings;  National Policy Framework for the development of a market for alternative transport fuels and deployment of the relevant infrastructure;  National Action Plan for promotion of the production and accelerated penetration of environmentally friendly vehicles, including electromobility in Bulgaria for the period 20122014;  Integrated Transport Strategy until 2030;  National Renewable Energy Action Plan;  National Energy Efficiency Action Plan 20142020;  National Forest Biomass Energy Action Plan 20182027;  National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan;  National Strategy for Development of Scientific Research in Bulgaria for the period 20172030;  Third National Climate Change Action Plan (20132020);  2028;  Ten-year plan for the development of the networks of Bulgartransgas EAD for the period 20192028. For the purpose of the INECP, energy balance projections were developed on the basis of a combination of forecasts for the extraction and import of energy carriers necessary to meet demand for the consumption of fuels and energy in Bulgaria. The analysis and projections are based on predictive modelling, and more specifically on the (B)EST long-term assessment and energy planning model developed by E3-Modelling. In accordance with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 two scenarios  WAM (with additional policy measures) and WEM (with existing policy measures)  have been developed. In the basic scenario, WEM projections are based on existing policy measures. In the target scenario, WAM projections are based on achievement of the targets and objectives set out in this Integrated Plan. In other words, WAM projections are based on both existing and planned additional policy measures that need to be implemented in order to achieve the national targets set in the INECP. The   16  WEM scenario is detailed in point 4 and the WAM scenario is detailed in points 2 and 3 and Annex I. The INECP has been developed on the basis of the following main assumptions and strategic objectives:  macroeconomic growth and added value of the sector, projecting the respective growth in energy supply and demand;  appropriate energy efficiency measures to achieve a downward trend for the energy intensity of the economy;  an integrated approach to the modelling of energy use and developments in the economy and the environment, based on historical data and forecasts, with social development;  Including applicable EU policies and restrictions in the environmental area in the modelling and planning of energy production and climate.  developing the energy, and more specifically the electricity sector, with a focus on national and regional energy security, domestic market integration and achieving a balanced energy mix that relies on a variety of domestic and imported energy sources;  efficient use of local energy sources (coal) in compliance with environmental requirements;  maintaining a sustainable level of dependence on imported energy resources at a level below the EU average;  continued accelerated liberalisation of energy markets, taking into account the needs of vulnerable social groups and managing potential social risks and negative impacts;  sustainable development of renewable energy sources on market terms, facilitation of price regulation and setting of realistic energy efficiency targets   adding the energy to be generated by a new nuclear power plant to the national energy mix after 2030.  The E2018 draft INECP, which were received in June 2019, have been taken into account. ii. Strategy relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union s in the area of energy and climate: Regarding the Decarbonisation dimension, Bulgaria will make efforts to increase the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption and reduce   17  endation, Bulgaria has raised the level of ambition regarding the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption from 25 % to 27.09 % and will thus aim to achieve the target set in Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. To do so, Bulgaria will expand its generating capacity with an emphasis on wind and solar power. If necessary for achieving the targets set after 2025, tenders for additional renewable energy capacity may also be conducted, taking market conditions into account. Biomass use is projected to increase in all sectors  electricity, heat and cooling, and transport. The planned changes in transport will have a strong impact on the development of energy from renewable sources and GHG emissions reduction. More specifically, Bulgaria will promote the introduction and use of electric and hybrid vehicles in public and private transport and plans to create low-emission zones in large cities. These measures, among others, will contribute to the significant reduction of GHG emissions.  As regards the Energy Efficiency dimension, Bulgaria will strive to achieve energy savings in final energy consumption, focusing on improvement of the energy performance of buildings and on energy generation, transmission and distribution.  In line wiBulgaria considers energy efficiency to be a top priority in view of its importance for improving energy security by lowering dependence on energy imports, for reducing energy costs for businesses and households, for creating more jobs, for improving air quality, for cutting GHG emissions and for improving the quality of life of citizens.  In connection with this, national targets have been set for achieving a 27.89 % reduction in primary energy consumption and a 31.67 % reduction in final energy consumption by 2030 as compared with the PRIMES 2007 reference scenario.  area has also been taken into account and, in line with Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, Bulgaria places emphasis on alternative policy measures to promote energy efficiency. Such measures include financial incentives for implementing energy efficiency projects, the promotion of energy performance contracts with guaranteed savings (ESCO contracts), and the renovation of the existing building stock with a view to increasing the number of nearly zero-energy buildings. Regarding the Energy Sto diversify the sources of - and the routes for  its natural gas supply by implementing the following projects: building an interconnector between Bulgaria and Greece (IGB project), building an interconnector between Bulgaria and Serbia (IBS project), participating in the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Alexandroupoli, and gas infrastructure development in connection with the plan to build a regional gas distribution centre (Balkan Gas Hub). Bulgaria aims to increase its energy security by diversifying its energy supplies, making efficient use of domestic energy resources and further developing its energy infrastructure. In order to achieve these goals, efforts will be   18  focused on grid development and enhancing the flexibility of the electricity system, e.g. by further developing the 400 kV and 110 kV transmission grid. Regarding nuclear energy, ts and the Guidelines published by the EURATOM Supply Agency (ESA), Bulgaria is fulfilling its commitments and is currently conducting a technical and economic analysis to inform its efforts to diversify fresh nuclear fuel supplies for Units 5 and 6 of the Kozloduy NPP. The top national priority in the area of energy security is to implement a robust strategy for diversifying the sources of - and the routes for  its natural gas supply. At the same time, Bulgaria is encouraging crude oil and natural gas exploration in the Black Sea, with several projects currently under way.  Regarding the Internal Energy Market dimension, Bulgaria will develop a competitive market by fully liberalising the market and integrating it into the regional and wider EU market, as stated in relation to the Energy Security dimension. The protection of recommendation for the development of competitive wholesale and retail markets, Bulgaria will phase out regulated electricity prices by the end of 2025 while promoting competition and transitioning to fully market conditions. The coupling of the day-ahead market with Romania is expected to be completed by the end of 2020, and with other neighbouring countries by 2025. The intra-day market was coupled with Romania in November 2019. Other policy measures for the development of the internal energy market in line with the goals of the Energy Union include the development of a market-oriented capacity mechanism, consumption optimisation, incentives for creating energy communities for renewable energy generation and consumption, and encouraging consumers to play a more active role.  Regarding the Research, Innovation and Competitiveness dimension, Bulgaria is committed to promoting scientific progress in the area of innovative energy technologies, including clean power generation. Important projects promoting business innovations and digitalisation will be developed. Bulgaria plans to participate in a number of programmes in this area. In line with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, Bulgaria will review progress towards achieving the INECP targets in 2023. iii. Overview table with key objectives, policies and measures of the plan up to 2030 is set out in the table below, following a review to ensure that the recommendations of the European Commission have been taken into account.

National and Union energy system and policy context of the national plan Bulgaria pursues a transparent energy policy with a view to protecting national and public interest. The governfunctions in accordance with market principles and further create conditions for energy independence, sustainable energy development, efficient use of energy and energy resources, meeting public demand for electric power and heat, natural gas and fuels. It is focused on:                                            1 Share of electricity from renewable sources in gross final consumption of electricity  2 Share of heating and cooling from renewable sources in gross final consumption of heating and cooling 3Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption in transport   20   maintaining a secure, stable and reliable energy system;  diversifying the sources and routes of natural gas supply;   modernising and expanding the gas transmission network;  eliminating dependence on imported energy resources through the use of indigenous resources (incl. coal);   modernising and extending energy infrastructure;  nuclear power development in line with modern requirements for reliability, safety and cost-effectiveness;  improving energy efficiency and increasing the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption;   active participation in establishing a single and robust European energy market;  developing a competitive energy market and pursuing a policy aiming to meet energy demand and protect the interests of consumers;  ensuring fair access to the network for all consumers under clear and non-discriminatory rules;  achieving a balance between energy quantity, quality and price for final consumers. In pursuing national energy policy, Bulgaria has adopted the core energy policy objectives of the European Union of security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability. National policy is further consistent with the five interrelated dimensions of the European Energy Union: energy security, solidarity and trust; a fully integrated European energy market; energy efficiency contributing to demand moderation; decarbonisation of the economy; and research, innovation and competitiveness. ii. Current energy and climate policy measures relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union 1) Decarbonisation Decarbonisation policy measures are summarised in the National Climate Change Action Plan (NPDIK) 20132020. The sectorial policy measures set out in the NPDIK are consistent with and contribute to the achievement of the main objective of the plan  reducing GHG emissions in Bulgaria and ensuring compliance with the applicable EU law in the area of climate change. Priority axes for the development of each sector have been identified and relevant measures for each priority axis have been determined.  The measures are divided into two groups  measures with a measurable impact on GHG emissions reduction and measures with an indirect impact, which also contribute to emissions reduction but their impact is more difficult to measure. The plan proposes instruments necessary for the implementation of each measure. Such instruments can   21  be, inter alia, legislative changes, application of laws and by-laws, implementation of programmes, plans, schemes, etc. as well as the implementation of incentive mechanisms, conducting information campaigns and training, among others. Target groups, the institutions responsible for reporting on implementation, the start date of implementation and relevant implementation periods, the financial resources necessary and sources of financing are indicated for each measure. A performance indicator which is directly or indirectly related to the calculation of the estimated effect is established and yearly target values are set. Additional information regarding the measure has been provided. It specifies the legal act or strategic document in which the measure is set out, the projections used to calculate emission reduction, the link between the measure, the instruments, the responsible institutions, etc. As the energy sector has the highest share in total GHG emissions, it is of primary importance for the achievement of the national emission reduction targets. Coal-fired generation of electricity and heat contributes to over 90 % of the GHGs in the sector; the main potential for emission reduction is concentrated here. The policies and measures in the energy sector as laid down in the NPDIK are based on the policy measures set out in 020 Energy Strategy and in the National Renewable Energy Action Plan.  The implementation of the additional measures envisaged for the sector will result in GHG emissions reduction by 13.8 % by 2020 compared to the baseline scenario4.  There has been an increase in GHG emissions from the households and services sector due to higher energy consumption by households. The measures in this sector are based Directive 2006/32/EC and aim to promote energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources in gross final energy consumption. The projected emissions reduction in the sector in 2020 to be achieved through the implementation of the measures set out in the NPDIK is 22 % compared to emission levels in the baseline scenario.  The waste sector is critically important and has an extremely high potential for emissions reduction. Reductions expected after implementing the NPDIK measures account for 36.4 % compared to the emissions in the baseline scenario. This sector appears to be one of the main sources of GHG emissions along three major lines: emissions from waste disposal, wastewater treatment and waste incineration. The measures focus mainly on the waste disposal subsector, which has the highest share in emission levels. Most of the measures planned in this sector can be achieved by applying the existing legal framework without investing substantial financial resources. This makes them highly efficient. The importance of taking measures in the transport sector is underpinned by the fact that the sector is one of the largest GHG emitters and has been continually growing, although until recently its impact on climate change has been largely overlooked. To this end, the main measures in the sector aim to achieve an optimum                                            4 baseline scenario (policy measures before the reference year 2009): reducing emissions by 3.1 Mt CO2 eq. or by 11.5 % as compared to 2005, National Climate Change Action Plan 20132020.   22  balance in the utilisation of the potential of different modes of transport and are grouped in four priority axes:  reducing transport emissions;  reducing fuel consumption;  transport diversification;  consumer awareness and training. The implementation of the additional measures planned for the sector will result in GHG emissions reduction by 11.3 % compared to the baseline scenario levels set out in the NPDIK. The overall impact of the proposed measures by sector, expressed as projected reduction in GHG emissions by 2020, is 44.832 Mt CO2eq.  Bulgaria is currently pursuing a targeted renewable energy development policy. Various support schemes have been introduced over the years to ensure that renewable energy production and consumption will develop to levels at which it can contribute substantially to the security and diversity of energy supply, competitiveness, environmental and climate protection, regional development and the deployment of new technologies. A set of regulatory, administrative and financial measures have been introduced to promote the production and consumption of renewable energy. The Energy from Renewable Sources Act (ZEVI) is the main legal instrument governing public relations in the area of renewable energy. The ZEVI and the implementing regulations thereto transpose the requirements of Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of renewable energy (Directive 2009/28/EC) into national law. The purchase of electricity generated under long-term contracts at preferential prices was one of the most attractive incentives for the generation of renewable electricity envisaged in the ZEVI. According to Article 18(2) of the ZEVI the achievement of the binding national target for 2020 constitutes grounds for discontinuation of certain previously available incentives, such the incentive for power plants for renewable energy, which apply for connection [to the grid] after the date of the report of the Minister for Economy and Energy (27 December 2013) confirming the achievement of the overall national target for a share of renewable energy in the gross final energy consumption (16 %).  For this reason and in view of the need to optimise support schemes in line with the current state of play and development of the sector, the ZEVI was amended in 2015 in accordance with the Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy 20142020 and Commission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014 of 17 June 2014 declaring certain categories of aid compatible with the internal market. As a result of the amendments in question, after 1 January 2016 the incentives relating to the purchase of renewable electricity at preferential prices under long-term contracts are now granted only to small power units (with an installed capacity of up to 30 kW),   23  provided that they are installed in existing buildings in urban areas, including on the roofs and facades of such buildings, and in the land plots in which they are situated. The amendments to the ZEVI aimed to align the overall support mechanism with electricity market liberalisation and address some negative impacts of this process. The amendments to the Energy Sector Act (ZE) adopted in 2018 and 2019 changed the rules for the promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources. The enacted amendments restrict support for renewable electricity generation by means of preferential prices. In the future, support will be provided only for electricity generated by plants with a total installed capacity of less than 1 MW. In addition, the ZEVI also sets out specific incentives for the generation of energy for heating and cooling and gas from renewable sources, including through support for and implementation of projects for the construction of heat transmission networks in agglomerations that meet the requirements for a designated area when the viability of renewable heat has been demonstrated; projects for the construction of small decentralised heating and/or cooling systems; the connection of renewable heat generation systems to the heat transmission network and purchase by the heat transmission company of heat generated by other producers. To achieve the binding target of 10 % share of renewable energy in transport, the ZEVI has introduced an obligation for the persons placing petroleum-derived liquid fuels to offer said fuels on the market at the time of their release for consumption blended with a bio-component in a specific ratio. In accordance of the requirements of Directive (EU) 2015/1513 amending Directive 98/70/EC relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Directive 2009/28/EC, in April 2017 a national target for new generation biofuels was set and submitted to the European Commission, notably 0.05 percentage points of energy content of the share of renewable energy in all forms of transport is to be met through the use of new generation biofuels. The target is to be achieved by 2020. In order to achieve this target, the Law amending and supplementing the ZEVI (published in the State Gazette (SG) No 91 of 2 November 2018) sets out specific measures, which will become effective on 1 April 2019. The amendment introduced an obligation on the persons that place on the market petroleum-derived liquid transport fuels to market fuels for diesel engines with a minimum biodiesel content of 6 volume fractions, with new generation biofuel being at least 1 volume fraction of the biodiesel. Such an obligation was also introduced for final distributors and for the distributors of petroleum-derived liquid fuels. 2) Energy efficiency Energy efficiency (EE) policy is an essential component of national and EU policies on energy and climate change. The switchover to an energy system with low levels of harmful emissions requires higher energy efficiency, greater use of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption, improved energy management,   24  development of the energy infrastructure and building the internal market, as well as designing various concepts and deployment of new technologies and services. In keeping with EU priorities, energy efficiency is accorded top priority within energy policy and is essential to the achievements of targets set for the period 20202030. National legislation on energy efficiency has been brought in line with EU law. The primary statutory instrument for policy implementation is the Energy Efficiency Act (ZEE). According to the requirements laid down in the ZEE and the provisions of Directives 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency and 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings (Directive 2010/31/EU) the following strategic documents have been developed and are currently being implemented:  National Energy Efficiency Action Plan 20142020;  National Plan for nearly zero-energy buildings 20152020;  National plan for improving the energy performance of heated and/or cooled State-owned buildings occupied by the public administration;  National long-term programme to promote investments in the implementation of measures improving the energy performance of buildings of the public and private national residential and commercial building stock.   achieving energy savings of 8 325 GWh by 2020;  achieving annual energy savings of 1.5 % of the volume of energy sales;  taking action to improve the energy performance of at least 5 % of the total gross floor area of all heated and/or cooled public buildings used by the civil service;  increasing the number of nearly zero-energy buildings;  ensuring that secure and affordable energy is available to all consumers;  minimising the adverse effects of energy use on human health and the environment;  improving living standards in Bulgaria.  increasing the competitiveness of the Bulgarian economy. The measures and policies envisaged for the period after 2020 ensure a link between existing and the planned policy measures within the Decarbonisation dimension, as well as a link between existing and the planned policy measures in the other dimensions of the Energy Union in the period until 2030. In view of the specificity and the interdependence of effects and expected outcomes, the policy measures in the area of renewable energy are consistently combined with those in the energy efficiency dimension. Efforts are made to co-ordinate national climate and energy policies by   25  making full use of the opportunities for regional co-operation with other Member States to attract the investments to enable policy implementation. The policy measures build on the scope and substance of those already in place in order to better deploy and integrate renewable energy in achieving the main indicators for a financially affordable, safe, competitive, secure and sustainable energy system. Progress at the level of 5 % has been achieved in the development and expansion of household gasification in Bulgaria  one of the priorities set out in the Energy Strategy. Electricity use in final consumption leads to three times higher costs for primary energy compared to the environmentally friendly alternative of direct natural gas use. Therefore, replacing electricity with natural gas for heating and other household purposes would contribute to threefold savings compared to current levels of primary energy used and should be considered as a possibility for increasing energy efficiency.  In order to create incentives for increasing the share of household gasification across the amount of EUR 10.9 million from the Kozloduy International Decommissioning Support Funds (KIDSF). The objective of the project is to encourage household gasification by supporting the initial investment to be made by approximately 10 000 households in order to be connected to the existing gas distribution network (fixed fee of 30 % of the eligible investment cost and 100 % of the connection fee, but not more than EUR 1 000 per household for systems with high-efficiency boilers and not more than EUR 1 200 per household for condensing boiler systems).  The implementation of the project will result in the reduction of atmospheric pollutants to be achieved by replacing fuels with high levels of emissions of harmful atmospheric pollutants with natural gas.  3) Energy security  Security in the electricity sector axes:  efficient use of indigenous energy resources;  increased interconnection. Bulgaria makes maximum use of the existing potential of indigenous coal in compliance with applicable environmental regulation. The coal has the potential to provide resources for electricity generation in the next 60 years.  The use of indigenous coal reserves has the potential to act as a stabilising source of energy in the future. Power plants fired by indigenous coal account for approximately 48 competitiveness of the Bulgarian economy. They are baseload plants and therefore essential for the Bulgarian electricity system. Being the main supplier of balancing   26  of indigenous coal as a strategic energy resource for Bulgsecurity. The Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, being a baseload plant, plays a prominent role in maintaining the sustainability of reserves in the electricity system. It has a share of approximately 33 % of total electricity generatenergy security.  A project has been successfully implemented, which will allow the operational life of Units 5 and 6 of the Kozloduy NPP to be extended following an upgrade of the two reactors to ensure that they meet the latest global safety requirements for nuclear power plants. The implementation of the project is a strong argument for the planned long-term operation of the nuclear plant. which was adopted by the National Assembly on 1 June 2011, in 2017 and 2019 the Bulgarian Nuclear Power Regulatory Agency extended the operating licences of Units 5 and 6 for a period of ten years in accordance with the provisions laid down in national law.  The project for the extension of the operational life of the two units was implemented in two stages due to the large scale of the project:  During the first stage a comprehensive survey and assessment of the remaining operational life of Units 5 and 6 of NPP Kozloduy was conducted by an international consortium. The compelling justification of project feasibility relied on rigorous application of a methodology of a high standard, which is fully consistent with the requirements for an EU Member State.  The results of the comprehensive survey demonstrated that the technical condition of the structures, systems and components of Units 5 and 6 conform to all applicable requirements laid down in statutory instruments and design and construction specifications for the operation of NPP Kozloduy.  During the second stage, programmes were implemented to prepare the facilities for long-term operation, which included specific measures determined on the basis of the results of the comprehensive survey. A total of 240 measures were implemented in order to upgrade Unit 5 and 200 measures were implemented in order to upgrade Unit 6. The process of drafting the justification of the feasibility of extending the operational life of Unit 6 entailed safety analyses, projections and qualitative assessments of the remaining operational life of the facilities and equipment that ensure the safe and reliable operation of the Unit.    In parallel to the upgrade undertaken to extend the operational life of the two units, the regular safety review of the two units was conducted. It involved a systematic review of all safety factors having an effect on the project and on the operation of the entire nuclear power plant. The safety review is a mandatory requirement for the licensing of the plant. The results of the latest periodic review confirmed that the two Units satisfy all safety parameters and are therefore fit for operation during the next period covered by   27  the licence. They have also demonstrated a high level of nuclear, radiation and technological safety comparable to that of the most advanced power plants.  Increasing interconnection  The opportunity for electricity exchange with neighbouring countries is an important factor in increasing the security of the energy system in Bulgaria and the region. To enhance the existing capacity for electricity interconnection, plans for the construction of new interconnectors have been developed. The main projects are as follows:  The construction of an overhead interconnecting power line between Bulgaria and Greece will have a considerable impact on the security of electricity supply in the region and will enhance the flexibility of the electricity system, the transmission of renewable electricity, and the interoperability and secure operation of the system. All projects in the group increase the net transmission capacity across the Bulgarian-Greek border, accelerate market integration and foster competition. The project is included in the list of projects of common interest and is divided into the following sub-projects:   Overhead electricity interconnecting power line between Maritsa Iztok substation and Nea Santa substation (Greece);  Domestic power line between Maritsa Iztok substation and Plovdiv substation: feasibility works;  Internal power line between Maritsa Iztok substation and the Open Power Distribution Device of Maritsa Iztok 3 Thermal Power Plant: feasibility works;   Internal power line between Maritsa Iztok substation and Burgas substation;  Increasing the transmission capacity of the power lines between Bulgaria and Romania, including the construction a 400 kV power line between Burgas and Varna substations;  Yadenitsa Dam Pumped Storage Plant is a project of common economic interest co-financed by the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The implementation of the Yadenitsa project aims to increase the volume of the lower reservoir of Chaira Pumped Storage Plant (PAVETs) through the construction of Yadenitsa reservoir and a reversible pressure tunnel connection to the Chaira reservoir. The Yadenitsa project covers construction of two basic facilities: Yadenitsa reservoir wall with a water storage facility and Yadenitsa reversible pressure tunnel. The implementation of the investment project will the further development of electricity generation from renewable sources in line with the long-term strategies for energy sector development in Bulgaria and the European Union.   28    Security of natural gas supply The diversification of the sources and routes of natural gas supply is an essential factor for the security of supply. As an element of energy security, it is vital to Bnational security. In order to enhance its energy security, Bulgaria is currently implementing a number of key projects in the area of natural gas of national and regional importance. These include:  The gas interconnector Greece-Bulgaria (IGB)  The interconnector has a total length of 182 km and capacity for the transportation of 3 up to 5 billion m3 of natural gas per year. Given sufficient interest, the capacity can be increased up to 10 billion m3 per year. The interconnector will be built between Komotini, Greece, and Stara Zagora, Bulgaria. It will connect the transmission grids of DESFA and TAP in Komotini, Greece, and the transmission system of Bulgartransgas EAD in Stara Zagora. The project for the construction of an interconnector between Greece and Bulgaria has been included in the list of projects of common interest (PCI) of the European Union with accordance with Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure. It is one of seven priority gas projects implemented within the framework of the Central and South East Europe Energy Connectivity (CESEC) initiative. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2020.  The direct effects of project implementation include real diversification of the sources of natural gas supply to Bulgaria, creating an opportunity for the supply of natural gas via the Southern Gas Corridor and from LNG sources, and connecting and transforming Bulgaria and its gas transmission system into a major part of the infrastructure for gas supply from alternative sources for the entire region of Central and Southeast Europe.  The project will ensure that Bulgaria is able to import the contracted quantity of 1 billion m3 of natural gas per year after the Shah Deniz 2 gas field in Azerbaijan becomes operational. The interconnector will also provide a possibility for gas supply via the LNG terminal in Alexandroupoli from producers like the United States, Qatar, Algeria, Nigeria, etc., including Israel and Egypt in the future.   Construction of a gas interconnector between Bulgaria and Serbia (IBS)  The planned reversible gas interconnector between Bulgaria and Serbia (IBS) will connect the national gas transmission networks of the two countries. With a total length of 170 km, it will run from Novi Iskar in Bulgaria to Nis in Serbia along a route that comprises a 62.2 km section in Bulgaria. The gas interconnector will be reversible, allowing two-way gas transmission of: 1 billion m3 per annum up to 1.8 billion m3 per annum from Bulgaria to Serbia and 0.15 billion m3 per annum from Serbia to Bulgaria. The project is expected to be completed in mid-2022.   29  The Bulgaria-Serbia interconnector is a project of common interest for the European Union within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 347/2013 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and a project of common interest for the EU energy community. The project is an element of the infrastructure necessary for the construction of the Balkan gas hub. It is one of seven priority gas projects implemented within the framework of the Central and South East Europe Energy Connectivity (CESEC) initiative. The implementation of the project will ensure the diversification of routes via an interconnector, enabling the transmission of natural gas to Serbia from the new entry in the Bulgarian gas transmission network. At the same time, it will allow the importation of natural gas from Serbia in crisis situations.   Project for the construction of an LNG terminal in Alexandroupoli The terminal has a rated annual capacity of 6.1 billion m³ and a storage capacity of 170 000 m³. It is a modern technological project involving the construction of an offshore floating unit for the reception, storage and re-gasification of LNG and a system comprising a subsea and an onshore gas transmission pipeline through which the natural gas will be shipped into the Greek national natural gas system and onwards to final consumers. The LNG terminal is strategically situated in proximity to the gas transmission network of the Greek national gas operator DESFA S.A. The European Commission has included the project in the list of projects of common interest in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure, including in the third and fourth lists of the European Commission. Bulgaria has been a strong advocate for the inclusion of the LNG terminal in the PCI list. The terminal is expected to start commercial operations in 2022. The rated annual capacity and LNG storage capacity of the terminal will enable Greece but also Bulgaria, Romania, North Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary to balance needs on their respective domestic markets. Bulgaria considers the Alexandroupoli terminal project as complementing the gas interconnector with Greece and the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP). It will give it access to producers and suppliers of liquefied gas from the United States, Qatar and Algeria as well as Israel and Egypt, among other countries, in the future.  Bulgartransgas EAD will acquire a 20 % share in the LNG terminal construction project and Bulgargas EAD will participate in the legally binding stage by booking transmission gas terminal near Alexandroupoli is of key importance for the country and the entire region of Southeast Europe. The synergy between the LNG terminal and the construction of the interconnector between Greece and Bulgaria will contribute to the security and diversification of energy supply.  The Balkan Gas Hub   30  The concept developed with assistance from the European Commission envisages the construction of a gas distribution centre (gas hub) in Bulgaria, including the necessary transmission infrastructure, and a natural gas exchange. The gas hub will connect the natural gas markets of all Member States in the region  Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Hungary, Croatia and Slovenia, linking the region to Central and Western Europe and to Serbia, North Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, which are members of the Energy Community. The concept for the construction of a gas distribution centre for South East Europe in Bulgaria is based on the idea of creating a gas trading platform by building infrastructure that will enable the supply of significant quantities of natural gas from different sources intended for further transportation via several physical entry points. The Balkan gas hub has been included in the list of projects of common interest of the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 as a group of projects that contribute to the development and enhancement of gas infrastructure. The projects for the interconnectors between Bulgaria and Greece and Serbia, respectively, and for the upgrade and rehabilitation of the gas transmission network of Bulgartransgas EAD have also been included in this group. In the context of the European objectives for developing an interconnected and single European gas market, the implementation of the gas hub concept fits in with the projects for the development of the Southern Gas Corridor and in line with the plans for gas infrastructure development in Europe. The Balkan gas hub would be able to rely on natural gas supplied via the newly constructed submarine pipeline in strict compliance with the requirements for the Third Liberalisation Package of the EU and along the existing route; natural gas extracted from the Bulgarian and Romanian sections of the Black Sea shelf; natural gas from the Southern Gas Corridor (Caspian area, Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean), and LNG terminals in Greece and Turkey. Since 9 December 2019 a gas exchange has been operating in Bulgaria on which natural gas will be traded via gas release auctions  a possibility already envisaged in the Energy Sector Act. The exchange segment will be operated by Gazov Hub Balkan EAD, a subsidiary of Bulgartransgas EAD. During the initial stage of operation of the exchange, Gazov Hub Balkan EAD will provide the participants in the natural gas market in Bulgaria and the wider region with the possibility to use a platform with integrated software solutions for wholesale energy trading developed in accordance with the requirements laid down in Article 10 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 312/2014 establishing a Network Code on Gas Balancing of Transmission Networks.  On 2 January 2020, multilateral trade was launched via the trading platform of Balkan Gas Hub EAD, including the so-called short-term (spot) and long-term segments of the market and via gas brokers.   Expanding the capacity of Chiren Underground Gas Storage (UGS) Facility   31  The project entails a staged increase of the capacity of the only gas storage facility in Bulgaria in order to expand gas storage volumes, achieve higher pressures in the gas reservoir and higher average 24-hour gas extraction and pumping capacity. The project envisages an increase in working gas volume up to 1 billion m3 and an increase in gas extraction and pumping capacity up to 810 million m3 per day. The extension of the Chiren UGS facility is a project of common interest for the European Union within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 347/2013 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and is an element of the Balkan Gas hub concept.  The expanded UGS facility is expected to become operational in 2025.  The Chiren UGS facility is a major instrument enabling the functioning of the gas market in Bulgaria, which will compensate seasonal variations in domestic natural gas consumption, providing the flexibility necessary to balance the differences in supply and demand and serving as an emergency reserve.  The project is highly important for the security of gas supplies. In the mid-term, the Chiren UGS facility will assume an important commercial role for the development of competition in the regional gas market, enhancing the flexibility of regional gas transmission systems and contributing to the management of excessive load and the seasonal optimisation of gas transmission networks.  Rehabilitation, upgrade and expansion of the Bulgarian gas transmission network The project is a comprehensive multi-component project for the upgrade, rehabilitation and expansion of the existing gas transmission infrastructure in Bulgaria. It will involve three stages during which the following activities will be implemented: upgrade and rehabilitation of compressor stations; repair and replacement of pipes in certain sections following inspection; expansion and upgrade of the existing network; inspections to ascertain and report on the condition of gas pipelines; implementation of systems for pipeline technical condition management optimisation.  The project for the rehabilitation and expansion of the gas transmission infrastructure in Bulgaria has been included in the list of projects of common interest for the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure as an element of the infrastructure necessary for the implementation of the Balkan Gas Hub. It is one of seven priority gas projects implemented within the framework of the Central and South East Europe Energy Connectivity (CESEC) initiative. The facilities included in the second phase of the project are expected to become operational in 2022. The Bulgarian gas infrastructure will ensure the transmission of Azeri natural gas and gas from LNG sources via the IGB to IBR and IBS to Romania and Serbia, and onwards to Hungary and Central Europe.    32   4) Internal energy market Liberalisation of the electricity market In order to achieve the objectives set out in the national Energy Strategy for the period the EU, in 2012 the Energy Sector Act (ZE) was amended with a view to transposing Directive 2009/72/EC concerning the internal market in electricity into national law. The adopted legislative act and implementing regulations thereto have created conditions for energy sector development and market liberalisation in line with the requirements laid down in the Third Energy Package of the EU.  Rules have been developed and adopted for the separation and subsequent certification of the electricity grid operator ESO EAD based on the Independent Transmission Operator model. The final customers eligible to participate in the regulated market were limited to household and non-household customers connected to the low-voltage grid. The necessary legislation enabling the activities of suppliers of last resort has been adopted and licences for the respective activities have been granted. Legislation enabling the operation of the balancing energy market has similarly been adopted. On 19 January 2016, the day-ahead segment and the centralised bilateral contracts segments of the market were launched and in April 2018 the intraday segment of the Bulgarian Independent Energy Exchange EAD (BNEB) became operational. The primary task of the BNEB is to create and operate an electricity exchange. The Bulgarian electricity exchange has also been instrumental in implementing EU policy on national markets integration and the creation of well-functioning regional markets and hence a common European market. As a result of the legislative amendments adopted in early 2018, all electricity generated for the free market is traded only on the BNEB platforms. Following the approval and introduction of Standard Load Profiles by the Energy and Water Regulatory Commission (KEVR), since 1 April 2016 household and non-household customers connected to the low-voltage grid not only have the right but also the possibility to change their electricity supplier and conclude transactions at freely negotiated prices. Despite this, the market segment for trading at regulated prices remains substantial, with a share of about 40 % of net electricity generation. For this segment, electricity prices are regulated along the entire chain from production to final consumption through the public provider NEK EAD, which performs the function of a single buyer for this market segment. With regard to transmission capacity (interconnector cross-sections in particular), ESO EAD conforms to the requirements for the Third Energy Package and has signed agreements with neighbouring operators for auction-based capacity allocation in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 714/2009 and the relevant Network Codes (including on capacity allocation and congestion management).    33  Liberalisation of the natural gas market In order to achieve the goals set out in the national Energy Strategy for the period until 2020 the Energy Sector Act (ZE) was amended in 2012 with a view to transposing Directive 2009/73/EC concerning the internal market in natural gas into national law. As an important step to natural gas market liberalisation in Bulgaria and with the aim of 2020, the KEVR adopted a set of rules establishing a new balancing regime for the natural gas transmission system. The rules address the commercial balance of the natural gas market. To develop a competitive natural gas market and in the context of the EU objectives for developing a single interconnected European gas market, actions were taken to implement the Balkan Gas Hub concept in Bulgaria. The concept is in line with the projects for the development of the Southern Gas Corridor and with the plans for the development of EU-wide gas infrastructure. The aim is to improve the security and diversify of the sources and routes for natural gas supply. In order to create an appropriate market environment for the implementation of the Balkan Gas Hub, a subsidiary of Bulgartransgas EAD was established as a gas exchange operator in Bulgaria. Bulgartransgas EAD ensures compliance with the requirements for the Third Energy Package by applying the Regional Capacity Booking Platform (RBP) as required by Regulation (EU) No 984/2013 establishing a Network Code on Capacity Allocation Mechanisms in Gas Transmission Systems. 5) Research, innovation and competitiveness One of the priority areas in the Innovation Strategy for Smart Specialisation 20142020 is the development of clean technologies with a focus on transport and energy (energy storage, energy saving and efficient energy distribution, electric vehicles and eco-mobility, hydrogen-based models and technologies, waste-free technologies, technologies and methods that include by-products and materials from one production in other productions). To date, several national scientific programmes in the area of energy and climate have been developed in Bulgaria, notably the Low-carbon energy for transport and the household sector (EPlus) and Environmental protection and lowering the risk of adverse weather events and natural disasters. The main focus of these programmes is the storage and conversion of renewable energy, effective methods for carbon dioxide capture and utilisation, hydrogen-based technologies and eco-mobility as a transition to a low-carbon economy and applied research aimed at creating a more sustainable, favourable and beneficial living environment. The programme implementation period is 3 to 5 years and the available budget is BGN 13 300 million Energy and energy efficiency infrastructure projects are financed by Operational Programme Innovation and Competitiveness 20142020 (OPIC). In connection with this, a grant of BGN 76.2 million was awarded under OPIC for the construction of a gas   34  interconnector between Greece and Bulgaria. The implementation of this project will enable the construction of gas transmission infrastructure for the Southern Gas Corridor and will ensure the security of gas supply for Bulgaria by enhancing the transit capacity to the countries in Southeast Europe. This will contribute to the diversification of the sources of natural gas supply.  Technical assistance will be provided under OPIC 20142020 to support the preparatory activities necessary to commence construction works on the Bulgarian section of the Bulgaria-Serbia interconnector (IBS). In addition, a call for proposals for enhancing energy efficiency at large enterprises has been launched under the OPIC. It is an opportunity for large enterprises to receive grants for the implementation of energy efficiency measures with the aim of achieving sustainable growth and building a competitive economy. iii. Key issues of cross-border relevance In line with the EU policy for creating a common energy market, Bulgaria is currently implementing a number of projects of importance for the region and the entire European Union. These are described in detail in point 2.4.2. The main projects aim to increase the coupling of energy markets. They will enhance energy security in Bulgaria and the wider region, ensure the security of supply, diversify sources and routes, and boost the development of energy and gas markets. This is a guarantee the competitiveness of local businesses and for the economic development of Bulgaria and the wider region. iv. Administrative structure for the implementation of national energy and climate policies According to Articles 3 and 4 of the ZE government policy in the energy sector is developed and approved by the national Parliament and the Council of Ministers and implemented by the Minister of Energy. Government policy on improving energy efficiency is implemented by the Sustainable Energy Development Agency (AUER), a body operating under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Energy. The Agency is also responsible for promoting renewable energy generation and consumption.  Government policy on the environment, including sectoral policies on climate, are implemented by the Ministry of Environment and Water. The Ministry of Economy is responsible for the implementation of government policy on building a competitive low-carbon economy, promotion and acceleration of investment, innovations and competitiveness. The Ministry of Transport, Information Technology and Communications implements the government policy on transport, development of road infrastructure, electronic communications and postal services. The Ministry of Regional Development and Public Works is responsible for the reform in   35  technical infrastructure and implementing the National Programme for Energy Efficiency of Multi-Family Residential Buildings. The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forests implements national policy on agriculture, food and forests. Government policy on social assistance is implemented by the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy (MTSP), which administers a heating allowance scheme. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for the sound and transparent management of public finances in Bulgaria and supports the government in building an efficient public sector and creating conditions for economic growth. Bulgarska nezavasima energiyna borsa (Bulgarian Independent Electricity Exchange) EAD has been granted a ten-year of the company is the Bulgarian Stock Exchange  Sofia AD. Bulgarian foreign policy and relations with other countries are managed, co-ordinated and supervised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which maintains and develops foreign policy dialogue, security policy and bilateral, regional and multilateral co-operation. It is responsible for the overall co-international stage. The policy on scientific research is within the remit of competence of the Ministry of Education and Science. The Water and Energy Regulatory Commission (KEVR) is an independent specialist government body responsible for energy sector regulation in accordance with the provisions of the ZE and the ZEVI. Its remit of competence includes the monitoring of electricity and natural gas markets. The regulation of the safe use of nuclear energy and ionising radiation, as well as of the safe management of radioactive waste and spent fuel is within the remint of competence of the chairperson of the Nuclear Regulatory Agency. 1.3 Consultations and involvement of national and Union entities and their outcome i. Involvement of the national parliament According to Article 3 of the ZE government policy in the energy sector is implemented via the National Assembly and the Council of Ministers. In this regard, in parallel to the launch of consultations with the EC on the draft INECP, consultations will be held with the National Assembly to develop the final Integrated National Plan.  On 19 December 2019, the Integrated Plan the Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of Environment and Water jointly presented the Integrated Plan before the Environment Committee and the Energy Sector Committee of the 44th National Assembly. Representatives of businesses, NGOs and the academic community took part in the discussion of the INECP with MPs from the two Parliamentary committees and had an   36  opportunity to share their views and opinions and ask questions. A summary of the outcome of the hearing at the national Parliament is annexed to this Plan. The integrated plan has been consulted with all ministries and approved by a dedicated decision of the Council of Ministers prior to being notified to the European Commission. ii. Involvement of local and regional authorities Consultations with all stakeholder ministries actively involved in the development of the recommendations on the draft Plan, the Ministry of Energy notified them to all stakeholder ministries, inviting submissions. The input received has been taken into account in the final version of the INECP. The Ministry of Environment and Water (MOSV), the competent authority responsible for environmental and climate policies, has defined the targets, the policy measures for the Decarbonisation dimension, compiled historical data on GHG emissions, and made the relevant projections. It has further provided information about waste management, the circular economy, air pollution. biodiversity and the management of Natura 2000 sites. The Ministry of Environment and Water has provided information about energy efficiency in connection with the National Building Stock Renovation Programme, which is currently being developed and is expected to be finalised in 2020 in accordance with the Energy Efficiency Directive. In order to ensure consistency between the various strategic documents, the modelling results underlying this Plan should be taken into account in the development of the National Building Stock Renovation Programme. The Ministry of Transport, Information Technology and Communications has provided input on the plans and policy measures for the transport sector. The principal development guidelines and the strategic goals of the national transport system for the period until 2030 are set out in a dedicated Integrated Transport Strategy with the same time horizon. The Strategy has been approved by Decision No 336 of 23 June 2017 of the Council of Ministers. The national policy framework for development of the alternative fuels market in transport and building the relevant infrastructure was approved by Decision No 87 of 26 January 2017 of the Council of Ministers and amended by Decision No 323 of 11 May 2018 of the Council of Ministers. It covers the period until 2020 with a time horizon until 2030. The Ministry of Transport has provided information about planned policy measures in the transport sector. The Minister of Transport, Information Technology and Communications has approved an annual program for the construction, maintenance, repair, development and operation of railway infrastructure for 2020 and a Programme for the development and operation of railway infrastructure for the period 20202024. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forests has provided forecasts for the development of the sector, along with the strategic documents and policy measures developed. As the only strategic document in the sector for the period after 2020 is the National Action Plan for   37  energy from biomass for the period 20182027, modelling for the purposes of the projections set out in the INECP has relied on historical data from the National Plan. The input received from the Ministry of Finance includes data on microeconomic indicators and trends and information about the sources of financing for the policy measures set out in the Plan. At the same time, a consultation was launched with the European Commission on the draft INECP. In the context of the public consultations launched, the INECP was published on the webpage of the Ministry of Energy: https://www.me.government.bg/files/useruploads/files/_.pdf. Prior to notifying the Plan to the European Commission, it was also published on the webpage of the Ministry of Energy in the context of the public consultation and sent to all ministries for the purpose of interinstitutional co-ordination.  No feedback and comments were received from local and provincial authorities during the stage of finalising the Integrated National Plan. iii. Consultations with stakeholders, including the social partners, and engagement of civil society and the general public The competent Bulgarian authorities responsible for drawing up the INECP participated in a number of conferences, round tables and forums with the relevant stakeholders and had the opportunity to discuss a wide variety of topics relating to the INECP. The draft INECP has been published and all stakeholders have been given the opportunity to submit their comments and recommendations. Following the presentation of the Plan the ministries continued to receive opinions and recommendations from stakeholders. Written opinions on the draft have been received from various stakeholders, including NGOs, private and government energy companies, industrial associations, economic institutes, etc. These include: WWF Bulgaria, the Hydro Energy Association, the Wind Energy Association, the Bulgarian Industrial Association, the Balkanika Fishing Club, the Technical University, EVN Bulgaria EAD, the Centre for Study of Democracy, the EnEffect Energy Efficiency Centre, Environmental Association Za Zemyata, the Institute for Market Economy, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the National Energy Chamber, the Bulgarian Natural Gas Association, the Energy Management Institute, the mining company Maritsa Iztok AD, the Bulgarian Federation of Industrial Energy Consumers.  An annex to the Plan sets out a summary of the opinions received from stakeholders in tabular form. The comments received vary in terms of content and approach. Some of the opinions contain general comments and recommendations relating to the draft INECP.   38  Areas have been identified in which similar and consistent comments were received. These include recommendations to:  set more ambitious targets in the Plan;  ensure that the final Plan contains clearly worded and carefully considered policy measures;  ensure that the Plan provides clarity on the future of coal-fired power plants and the way forward to achieve the targets for decarbonisation of the economy;  set more ambitious targets for the use of energy from renewable resources, mostly solar and wind power; set out measures for lowering administrative barriers.  It has also been recommended that the INECP sets more specific legislative and regulatory measures that ensure achievement of the targets set, along with a schedule and financial estimates for their implementation.  The Plan should prioritise the policy measures and projects to be implemented, set deadlines and contain a schedule for their implementation.  The links and interdependencies between the measures and targets in the various dimensions and subsections of the INECP should be clearly articulated and any inconsistency between them addressed.  State aid grants and measures should be clearly identified and a roadmap for phasing them out should be provided.  The incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy sources must be consistent with market economy principles and a clear demarcation line should be drawn between incentives for the industrial sector and households.  It has been recommended that the INECP sets out specific legislative and regulatory steps to enable the construction of new powers plants relying on renewable sources and their integration into the market.  Areas have been identified that require restructuring mechanisms to ensure that the energy transmission system operates with greater efficiency and is geared up for the future.  There is a clear need to address the absence of a legal framework and strategic documents for the development of nearly all sectors of the economy after 2020. The existing documents with a time horizon after 2020 are not entirely consistent with the goals and tasks set out in the INECP.  or a justification should be provided as to why they are considered inapplicable.  The proposed policy measures and policies should be properly costed.   39  The comments received from stakeholders concern all sections of the draft INECP. The overview set out below contains a summary of the key comments and recommendations received.  Decarbonisation  emissions and removals maintain the operation of its coal-fired power plants during the entire period indicated in the draft INECP, i.e. until proven lignite deposits are depleted while at the same time achieving the EU decarbonisation and renewable energy targets. The cost of achieving the targets has also been questioned.  Most opinions expressed by stakeholders, including NGOs, economic institutes and associations of renewable energy producers, recommend that the Plan be improved in terms of the calculations made to cost the effort needed to achieve the GHG emissions reduction target. The recommendations include the development of a clear road map setting out the steps to be taken to decommission or upgrade coal-fired power plants, phasing out coal as the principle resource on which the energy system relies and transforming coal mining areas while placing special attention on the prevention and management of potential direct and indirect negative social and economic impacts on employment in the coal mining industry. It is also recommended that specific steps be taken to ensure transition to a low-carbon economy. This may involve Bulgaria joining the EU programmes for the restructuring of coal regions (Coal regions in transition), embracing an approach for alternative industrialisation and construction of power plants relying in renewable resources in the affected areas. On the other hand, in its comments Mini Maritsa Iztok EAD points out the need to clarify the issue with a view to enabling the company to plan its future operations in light of the concession agreement signed for the period until 2043, which grants the company an option to have it extended. Another opinion calls for greater clarity in terms of the transition of certain coal-fired power plants to waste or biomass  a step some energy producers in Bulgaria have already taken. Stakeholders are mainly concerned that this may lead to a potential increase of air pollution. Other recommendations insist on introducing more robust measures and focusing more efforts on sectors such as agriculture and waste. Comments have been received suggesting that data, expressed as a percentage, should be provided about GHG emissions reduction in ETS and non-ETS sectors as compared to 2005 levels and overall GHG reduction compared to 1990 levels. All opinions comment on the links between decarbonisation and the diversification of natural gas supply and the need to develop policies on access to natural gas as transition fuel in the future. Renewable energy sources   40  Most opinions also contain extensive comments on renewable energy sources. More specifically, the comments concern the integration of renewable sources into the liberalised energy market and the need for additional mechanisms to develop RES in an urban environment, active consumers and energy communities. Most opinions received also comment on the need to eliminate administrative barriers to the market entry of renewable sources and create incentives for the RES development in industrial zones and urban areas, mainly for auto-production. This has been linked to recommendations to upgrade the existing grid and develop smart grids. A proposal was received to increase the share of energy from renewable sources to at least 27 %, with some proposals containing even higher targets. Stakeholders with various interests and goals have also made contradictory proposals and statements. Although electricity generation by hydropower plants is clearly defined as the renewable resource with the highest development potential, some comments allege that the operation of hydropower plants has a significant negative impact on the environment, biodiversity and the Natura 2000 network. A special emphasis has been placed on the measure envisaging an increase in the use of biomass for energy generation set out in the draft INECP because an increase in the use of biomass will significantly increase the threats for air quality and biodiversity. There have been several requests for a breakdown of the share of energy renewable sources in the sector of energy for heating and cooling and further clarity regarding energy from renewable sources in transport and the plans and policies for conversion and electrification of public transport, particularly as regards any incentives that may encourage sector-wide transformation. Energy efficiency Energy efficiency remains hotly debated, with many comments and proposals received. These include calls for clear articulation of energy efficiency targets for all sectors and planned energy savings in primary and final consumption, including in the sector of energy for heating and cooling. A special emphasis has been placed on the incentives for achieving energy efficiency targets by households and in the industrial sector. Questions were received about the measures that will continue to be implemented after 2020, planned changes to the ESCO mechanism and the financial mechanisms that will be available under the Modernisation Fund. Several opinions contain requests for more detailed information about plans for building stock renovation in the private and public sector, the implementation of the Energy Efficiency Directive and the requirements for buildings that conform to the definition of nearly zero-energy buildings, including the necessary investment and target final energy savings. As regards the requirements for energy efficiency, some proposals have suggested that there is a need to alter the current obligatory scheme applied in Bulgaria. Some stakeholders, including obligated parties, have made specific recommendations for the introduction of new requirements and incentives to raise the efficiency of EE projects.   41  Domestic market Regarding the domestic market, comments were received questioning the need for small renewable energy producers to be integrated into domestic market development. Some of the opinions call for promoting investment in energy storage facilities, smart grids, enhancing demand response, electricity interconnectivity, and the integration of markets within the European electricity system. Most comments received concern market liberalisation and the need for regulatory changes to achieve it. Stakeholders believe that the development of the day-ahead and intraday market segments are crucial for the development of renewable energy sources. As regards market integration, stakeholders believe that the INECP should place a special emphasis on aspects of auto-production and the market integration of small producers who can mobilise the significant potential inherent in decentralised energy generation. It has been recommended that existing legal barriers, the absence of clear definitions in current regulatory framework and the complex formalities of administrative licensing regimes be addressed. Energy security Most comments concern the planned nuclear power capacity planned. Some proposals d that some coal-fired plants switch from coal to natural gas. The energy sector security policy needs to be further developed as regards the efficient use of indigenous energy resources and the integration of additional RES and nuclear capacity into the system. In connection with the Decarbonisation dimension, the decommissioning and/or conversion of coal-fired plants, the need for a plan to enable the transition of mining areas, and the need to give priority to projects ensuring diversification in terms of both routes and sources of natural gas have been raised. Research and innovation The comments relating to this dimension primarily concern the fact that it has not been developed in sufficient detail in the INECP  a deficiency that needs to be addressed in order to set targets and introduce specific financial incentives for the promotion of research and development in line with the goals of the INECP. Some comments concern the potential for the development of hydrogen technologies. Recommendations and comments included in the final version of the INECP: The bulk of the comments have been taken into account in this Plan.  Most comments, which concerned various inconsistencies and the lack of coherence between targets and policy measures set out in the draft and the lack of specific estimates for RES, EE, GHG emissions and the investments required, have been addressed by the inclusion of the energy and environment sector projections developed specifically for the Plan. The final INECP contains a description of the policy measures planned and a list of the direct and indirect subsidies available, including for fossil fuels.   42  The air pollutant emissions have been modelled. The resulting projections included in the INECP take into account thermal power plants, which have applied for derogations from environmental requirements. An increase in the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption up to 27 % by 2030 has been projected. In the same period the share of primary energy production from fossil fuels will decrease. Regarding energy generation from renewable sources, the government does not have plans to introduce new subsidies on the assumption that RES technology costs will reach parity with the cost of their implementation. On the other hand, electricity market liberalisation will act as an incentive for free electricity price formation, creating in turn an environment that is conducive to the implementation of projects for the utilisation of the potential of renewable energy. In order to promote energy generation from renewable sources, measures are set out in the Plan that will support its integration into the electricity market. These include easing the administrative burden, setting up one or several contact points, etc.  The development of wind farms has been taken into account in the projections and this Plan as it presents an opportunity to increase wind power generation. Specific legislative and regulatory measures have been outlined that will enable the entry and market integration of electricity from renewable sources, increase installed capacity by constructing new power plants for renewable electricity, and promote investment in electricity storage facilities and smart grids. Regarding interconnectivity in the electricity sector within the broader framework of the European electricity system, the targets were described as realistic and achievable. The plan further contains a section on market coupling initiatives. Regarding energy efficiency, the table setting out the cumulative energy savings referred to in Article 7(1) of the Energy Efficiency Directive has been included in the Plan. The measures and projections relating to energy savings have been taken into account in GHG emission projections. The Plan confirms that the residential building stock renovation programme will be extended beyond 2020. In addition, the Plan contains detailed sections on the Energy Security and Internal Energy Market dimensions, which have been linked to other dimensions of the Energy Union. The targets for investment in research and development activity and specific projects in which Bulgaria plans to participate in order to additionally enhance the sustainability of its energy system and encourage transformation to a low-carbon economy have also been included.  iv. Consultations with other Member States Bulgaria has developed the Plan following consultations with neighbouring countries capacity to engage in regional co-operation in each of the five dimensions of the Energy Unions. To facilitate the process Bulgaria provided a summary of its draft INECP.   43  The following potential areas for future co-operation have been identified on the basis of the consultations:  Cross-border projects in the area of renewable energy sources;  Projects for energy storage in the electricity and natural gas sectors;  Coupling of energy exchanges in Southeast Europe;  Increasing the level of interconnection with other countries;  Co-operation with a view to lowering energy poverty;  Diversification of energy sources and routes;  Digitalisation of electrical power grids and enhancing the rule of consumers in electrical power management. In addition, the following potential barriers to future co-operation have been identified:  Placing national interests above shared regional interest;  Currently existing differences in national legislation resulting from different approaches taken to transposing EU legislation into national law;  No pipeline of projects of common interests, except those in the area of interconnections or the internal market (i.e. renewable energy sources and energy efficiency). More specifically, the Energy Efficiency dimension was discussed at a meeting in the framework of bilateral co-operation between the Sustainable Energy Development Agency (AUER) and the Austrian Energy Agency. At the meeting, the national targets to be achieved by Bulgaria and Austria were discussed, along with the possibilities to exchange good practices in the implementation and development of policy measures to improve energy efficiency in both countries. v. Iterative process with the Commission The Regulation on the governance of the European Union provides for ongoing consultations with the EC, comprising an evaluation of the INECP by the Commission and updates of the plans and preparation of progress reports by the Member States. 1.4 Regional cooperation in preparing the plan i. Elements subject to joint or coordinated planning with other Member States Regional cooperation in the energy sector in Southeast Europe currently takes place in the framework of the Central and South Eastern Europe Connectivity initiative (CESEC). The CESEC was established primarily to help address the historical vulnerability of Southeast Europe in terms of security of energy supply, and more specifically natural gas supply.   44  support, as a matter of priority, to new interconnection infrastructure projects. The CESEC Action Plan identifies a number of infrastructure projects of major importance for Bulgaria, such as the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), the interconnectors to neighbouring countries, including Greece, Romania and Serbia, and the upgrade and enhancement of -border tariffs and capacity allocation are also discussed within the framework of the CESEC. CESEC activity is primarily focused on operational infrastructure aspect of regional co-operation in the area of natural gas. A number of market coupling projects are currently being implemented as part of the CESEC action plan following an extension of its scope. Bulgaria participates in the efforts to couple the day-ahead segment of its energy exchange with the day-ahead segments of the Greek and Italian energy exchanges, develop a methodology for calculation of the total capacity of Southeast Europe together with Romania and Greece, and complete the coupling the day-ahead market with the day-ahead segments of the energy exchanges of North Macedonia, Croatia and Serbia. A number of studies of the potential for development of energy from renewable sources in Southeast Europe show that available capacity is currently underutilised. The topic is an element of the CESEC plan to evaluate the potential of energy from renewable sources (until 2030 and 2050) and promote the development of instruments for financing renewable energy. The CESEC views energy efficiency, including its role in addressing energy poverty, as a priority. The current role of the CESEC is related to the exchange of information and best practices in areas such as:  raising private financing and the use of financial instruments;  providing assistance for improvement of project quality at the stage of implementation;  analysing the role of energy efficiency as an effective means for alleviating energy poverty; Opportunities for regional cooperation Regarding the opportunities for regional cooperation, Bulgaria will start exploring the following opportunities for bilateral co-operation, including via existing platforms such as the CESEC: Electricity market  Coupling on the day-ahead energy exchange with 4M MC, in addition to the coupling initiatives specified in the CESEC document;  Exploring the possibilities for regional co-operation in the area of energy poverty, for example by establishing a thematic working group on energy poverty at the level of the CESEC.   45   Natural gas market  Improving the natural gas storage capacity;  Regional co-operation on liquefied natural gas;  Integration of energy from renewable sources;  Regional co-operation with a view to increasing the capacity of pumped storage hydropower plants (PAVETs);  Regional co-operation on matters relating to the social and economic transition of mining areas, more specifically aiming to ensure that the transition is adequately funded;  Regional co-operation on cross-border projects related to the use of energy from renewable sources with CEF financing (more than EUR 1 billion in available financing);  Regional co-operation on energy storage capacity co-ordination. Research and Development and Innovation (R&D&I) Taking into account the policy measures set out in the INECPs of Romania and Greece, Bulgaria has identified possibilities for co-operation in the following areas:  Development of innovative technologies for energy storage, such as capacity of back-up systems for the integration of electricity from renewable sources through battery storage systems;  Digitalisation of energy networks through the development of smart grids and smart metering, smart medium-voltage and low-voltage electricity distribution systems and efficient use of local energy sources.  Consumer protection and addressing energy poverty.  ii. Explanation of how regional cooperation is considered in the plan In accordance with Article 12 (1) of Regulation (EU) cooperate with each other, taking account of all existing and potential forms of regional cooperation, to meet the objectives, targets and contributions set out in their integrated  In connection with this and in line with the EU policy for creating a common European energy market, Bulgaria is implementing a number of projects of European and regional neighbouring countries in the region and achieve the coupling of energy markets. The aim is to enhance the energy security in Bulgaria and the wider region, ensure the security of supply, diversify the sources and routes of supply, and develop the energy and gas markets. This is a guarantee the competitiveness of local businesses and for the economic development of Bulgaria and the wider region.
