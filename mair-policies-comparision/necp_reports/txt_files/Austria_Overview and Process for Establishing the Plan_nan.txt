Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 6 of 268  SECTION A: NATIONAL PLAN  1. OVERVIEW AND PLAN DEVELOPMENT PROCESS   1.1. Summary   i. Political, economic, environmental and social context  Austria is a federal republic built on the economic principles of the social market economy. Balancing the interests of employers and employees plays an essential role in political discourse, very high, even by European standards, and the long-term average unemployment rate is relatively low. Social benefits and the progressive taxation of wages and income have an equalising effect on society. Since 1990, population growth in Austria has accelerated significantly, in particular due to immigration from EU Member States and third countries. This growth is concentrated primarily in metropolitan areas, while some of the surrounding rural areas are exhibiting downward population trends.  The environmental situation in Austria can be described as positive in terms of essential parameters such as water quality, air quality (with the exception of certain regions) and the use of renewable energy resources. Furthermore, by European standards a very high percentage of agricultural land is farmed in an ecological or environmentally appropriate way, and there are very high levels of sustainable forest use. There are, however, areas for improvement, such as the development of transport, in particular in conurbations and along transit routes, and the accompanying immission levels. This problem area is being addressed, including on a long-term basis, through the continuous development of rail infrastructure. Currently, Austria already has the highest share of rail transport within the European Union.  Austria is also currently intensifying its efforts to achieve CO2 savings in the area of private transport. The Tax Reform Act 2020 [Steuerreformgesetz 2020] that has been adopted implements additional ecological measures in the area of mobility and introduces the taxation of sustainable fuels. The intention, among other things, is to provide a price signal as early as the point at which the purchase decision is made by introducing a registration tax that is dependent on price and emissions (with a tax rate of up to 32% and a penalty for particularly emission-intensive passenger cars). A CO2 component will also be introduced in the area of engine-related insurance tax (current motor vehicle tax), thereby steering a course towards low-emission motor vehicles. In addition, electric bicycles will become eligible for input tax deduction and tax incentives will be provided for biogas, sustainable hydrogen and liquefied natural gas. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 7 of 268   Together with companies and private households, public budgets are the main sources of financing for measures focussing on the climate and energy. Sustainable public finances thus create the room for manoeuvre needed to develop strategic options for meeting climate and energy targets. In view of the long-term challenges of decarbonisation, the Austrian government is therefore committed to sustainably consolidating public budgets and permanently reducing the general government debt. In order to do so, it is necessary to critically examine whether the existing expenditure and revenue structure is compatible with the climate and energy targets. It is also important to minimise the risk to public budgets from missed or delayed action (cost of inaction), as this is counterproductive to the objective of permanently reducing general government debt. For the first time since 1954, the government will spend less than it receives. This means the end of the debt management policy, without introducing any new taxes. These sustainable budget and tax policies must also be pursued for the rest of the 2020s. In the interests of budgetary sustainability, it is therefore necessary to ensure that a system of reciprocal financing is provided for measures that are relevant in terms of budgets and tax policy.  In several regions, land use is a critical issue. Alongside population trends and economic prosperity, the primary reason for this is the lack of adequate spatial planning tools at local and regional level.  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are also of paramount importance. These goals are to be implemented in Austria through mainstreaming in all policy areas, thus ensuring sustainable economic, environmental and social development, while explicitly taking into account the principle of budgetary sustainability.  As one of the basic prerequisites for sustainable development, real equality between the genders is anchored in the SDGs as a cross-cutting issue. These state that the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are geared towards achieving gender equality, and achieving this equality will in turn make a decisive contribution to the progress of all of the goals. One of the key factors is that women have political participation and decision-making power at all levels on an equal footing with men.  In the Austrian constitution, the federal government, provinces and municipalities have committed themselves to real gender equality. Austria implements this through the strategy of gender mainstreaming, which involves taking into account the impact on both sexes from the outset of all decision-making processes. The aim is to achieve equality between women and men by keeping the gender perspective in mind in all areas and at all levels of policy making and corresponding action. Austria is thus fulfilling its obligations at national, European and international level.  As a result, the economic, environmental and social dimensions are taken into equal Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 8 of 268  integrated Climate and Energy Strategy.      ii. Strategy on the five dimensions of the Energy Union  In May 2018, the Austrian Federal Government adopted its Climate and Energy Strategy (#mission2030). The Strategy aims to meet the Sustainable Development Goals in the areas of greenhouse gas reduction, renewable energy and energy efficiency by 2030, in line with the objectives of the European Union. Security of energy supply, competitiveness, affordability (including budgetary sustainability considerations) and research and development complete the aims of the Strategy, making it largely consistent with the five dimensions of the Energy Union. accordance with the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action1, but also provides the medium- and long-term framework for transforming the energy system in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Long-term decarbonisation must be used in the best possible way in terms of the eco-social market economy, as well as from an economic, environmental and social standpoint. Accordingly, the implementation of these long-term objectives does not denote a loss of prosperity, but must be shaped in such a way as to result in a highly successful economic, environmental and social model of a resource-efficient economy. For this to happen, all relevant provisions must be taken in the vision for 2030 and stranded costs and lock-in effects must be avoided.                                                                        1 OJ (EU) L 328 of 21.12.2018, p. 1.

Current policy and administrative structures   i. Energy system at national and EU level  political context of the plan    European context  Within its 2030 climate and energy policy framework, the EU has three main objectives:   reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% (compared to 1990 levels);  increase the share of renewable energy sources to 32%;  increase energy efficiency by at least 32.5%.  put forward several legislative proposals  including the Directive on the revision of the emissions trading system2, the Regulation on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by 3, the Directive on renewable energy, the Directive on energy efficiency and the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action4  all of which have since been adopted by the European Parliament and the Council. Consequently, for the dimensions of decarbonisation (greenhouse gases and renewables) and energy efficiency in particular, a binding legal framework is in place, which is to be systematically implemented over the coming years.  In addition to this National Energy and Climate Plan, the Member States are also required in accordance with the Regulation on Governance to prepare and submit a long-term strategy in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change by 1 January 2020. The European Commission submitted its draft long-term strategy for the European Union at the end of November 2018  shortly before the UN Conference of the Parties (COP 24) in Katowice.                                                                          2 Directive (EU) 2018/410 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/87/EC to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments, OJ L 76, 19.3. 2018, p. 3. 3 Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030, OJ L 156, 19.6. 2018, p. 26. 4 OJ L 328, 21.12. 2018, p. 1. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 19 of 268  Austrian context  If we look at developments in greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency in comparison with economic development since 2005, it is clear that Austria has made significant progress in all three areas over the past decade. The uptake in renewable energy has been most successful, while greenhouse gas emissions have fallen and primary energy consumption has stabilised. For the latter two indicators, there has also been a relative decoupling vis-à-vis GDP throughout the period. However, from 2015 to 2017, greenhouse gas emissions, primary energy consumption and GDP largely increased in parallel.

This project concerns the long-term transformation of the energy system in order to meet the future challenges in relation to climate protection and fulfil the commitments made under the Paris Agreement and at European level. This means that by 2030, emissions in non-ETS sectors must be reduced by at least 36% compared to 2005. In order to achieve this, Austria has set ambitious targets for expanding renewable energy and improving energy efficiency. The aim of this national strategy is to increase the share of renewable energy to 45-50% by 2030, with 100% of the total electricity consumption being covered by renewables. Primary energy intensity should fall by 25-30% compared to 2015. Further details of the objectives under the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action are set out in Chapter 2 of the Plan.  To achieve these ambitious targets, #mission2030 provides for a range of measures, and intensive work is already under way to implement them. Twelve - and long-term measures. However, additional measures will be required and these are described in Chapter 3 of the plan.

Current policies and measures in relation to the five dimensions of the Energy Union    Dimension 1: Decarbonisation  Greenhouse gas emissions  Decision No 406/2009/EC on the effort of Member States to reduce their greenhouse gas 5 set Austria a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in non-ETS sectors by 16% by 2020 compared to 2005. This target was laid down in the Austrian Climate Protection Act [Klimaschutzgesetz, KSG] and divided up among the various emitting sectors. In order to ensure that the target trajectory is adhered to, multi-annual action plans were agreed with the provinces. As things stand, these cover the years 2013-2014 and 2015-2018. A regular implementation review and (internal) reporting take place every two years. These measures are currently in the implementation phase. A follow-up plan for the years 2019 and 2020 has been initiated but not yet completed.  The main focus of these measures is on expanding the share of renewable energy and improving energy efficiency in the main emitting sectors (in particular transport and buildings), as well as preventing non-CO2 greenhouse gases in the agricultural sector (reducing methane and nitrous oxide emissions through climate friendly farming practices, above all in relation to fertiliser management, tillage and livestock farming), the waste management sector (reducing methane emissions from landfills) and F-gases. Essential measures are set out in European legislation, such as the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) or the Directive on the promotion of renewable energy.  Transport In 2017, greenhouse gas emissions from the Austrian transport sector (excluding air transport) amounted to 23.6 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, making it the second largest emitting sector after industry (including ETS). Emissions in the transport sector are exhibiting an upward trend:                                                                     5 OJ L 140, 5.6. 2009, p. 136. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 24 of 268  since 1990, they have increased by 73%. The causes for this are manifold; as well as the sharp increase in the distances driven in Austria, the export of fuel in fuel tanks has contributed significantly to this development. Greenhouse gas emissions from road goods transport (heavy and light commercial vehicles including fuel export) have increased by 109% since 1990, while from passenger road transport they have increased by 58%. In 2017, almost two thirds (64%) of greenhouse gas emissions from road transport came from passenger transport. In both segments, the increase in distances driven is the largest cause of emissions, followed by fuel exported in fuel tanks.  Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector are implemented at different levels. At federal level, the main objectives of the measures are inter-regional infrastructure development, the creation of strategic framework plans, transport-related taxation and financing issues related to financial equalisation between local authorities (allocation of tax revenues to provinces and municipalities). The provinces and municipalities, meanwhile, are primarily responsible for providing an attractive range of local and regional public transport, spatial planning, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure and parking space management or parking ordinances.  The following transport measures have so far been successfully implemented:   Increasing the share of renewable energy sources in the fuel sector by implementing corresponding EU provisions  in Austria, the biogenic content of diesel, in terms of energy value, is around 6.3%, while for petrol it is currently around 3.4%.  The standard fuel consumption tax, which is chargeable when a car is first placed on the national market (new car purchase or private import) and provides incentives to buy vehicles with low CO2 emissions.  Gradually expanding the inter-regional rail infrastructure. Of particular note are the extension of the Western Railway to four tracks (Vienna to Innsbruck, with significant sections as a high-speed line), the ongoing expansion of the Southern Railway (Vienna  Graz  Klagenfurt) including the Semmering and Koralm tunnel projects, and the construction of the Brenner Base Tunnel, which is essential for the trans-European goods transport between Germany and Italy.  The ongoing improvements to local and regional public transport services in metropolitan areas.  Providing mobility management for businesses, towns and cities, municipalities and aktiv rt the development and implementation of climate-friendly measures for clean, low-CO2 mobility at business and municipal level and in the tourism sector.  Drawing up and implementing the Cycling Masterplan [Masterplan Radfahren] and the Walking Masterplan [Masterplan Gehen] and supporting the creation of cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, with federal co-financing. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 25 of 268   Implementing concepts relating to energy spatial planning and the revitalisation of town centres (functional diversity) and other spatial planning initiatives.  Providing significant support for e-mobility through the package of measures introduced by the Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism [Bundesministerium für Nachhaltigkeit und Tourismus, BMNT] (Domestic Environmental Support [Umweltförderung im Inland]) and the Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology [Bundesministerium für Verkehr, Innovation und Technologie, BMVIT] together with the motor vehicle industry. These measures aim to promote e-mobility using renewable energy by funding the purchase of electric vehicles and the expansion of the recharging infrastructure, by simplifying things from an organisation and fiscal point of view (standard fuel consumption tax, engine-related insurance tax, benefits in kind) and by introducing key provincial supporting initiatives promoting e-mobility within their area of impact.  Implementing the Eurovignette Directive for heavy goods vehicles.  The possibility of VAT input tax deduction for e-bikes.   Buildings Since 2005, greenhouse gas emissions in the buildings sector (residential buildings and private and public service buildings) in Austria have decreased by about one third (-34%). A variety of effective measures have contributed to this, in particular the switch from oil- and gas-powered heating systems to renewable forms of energy and district heating systems, the thermal renovation of existing buildings built during particularly energy-inefficient construction eras (1950s-1980s) and the gradual increase in construction regulations for new buildings and, increasingly, for renovations.  Over the past 10 years, significant momentum has been created through federal and provincial funding instruments. In an agreement under Article 15a of the Federal Constitution between the Federal Government and the provinces, high energy standards were set for housing subsidies (above all for social housing) which go beyond the standards laid down in construction law. Between 2009 and 2018, a total of around 2.65 million tonnes of CO2 per year were saved through the use of energy measures in housing subsidies (renovations and new buildings) (data taken from notifications from the provinces under the agreement). In addition to provincial housing subsidies, the Federal Government (together with the provinces) provides funding under the renovation initiative (and paid via the Domestic Environmental Support scheme) not only for ial premises. Consequently, in the past few years, considerable numbers of building renovations or conversions to renewable heating systems have been carried out. Between 2009 and 2018, support in the form of renovation vouchers led to a total CO2 reduction of around 725,000 tonnes per year. This combination of instruments strengthens their effects as, to some extent, both instruments can be used. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 26 of 268   Adjustments to building legislation have also been made in recent years in response to the requirements laid (which are responsible for building regulations) have recently agreed on a new road map for -ile optimising costs. The aim is to ensure that, despite the significant increase in construction as a result of population growth, the rise in specific living space and a growing desire for comfort, greenhouse gas emissions can be kept at a low level. In addition, there are minimum standards in place for building renovations (major renovations). For commercial properties above the low energy standard (new buildings), funding is offered through the Domestic Environmental Support scheme.  Agriculture and forestry A key instrument for achieving climate-friendly agriculture is the agri-environmental programme ÖPUL (Austrian programme for environmentally friendly agriculture [Österreichisches Programm für umweltgerechte Landwirtschaft]). This is based on a horizontal approach which aims at providing the widest possible coverage of agricultural environmental services in relation to climate, soil, water and biodiversity. In 2018, around 91,700 farms participated in the ÖPUL, which represents more than 83% of the total number of Austrian farms in IACS6. In total, therefore, around 80% of all Austrian agricultural land (excluding alpine pastures), some 1.84 million hectares, were involved in ÖPUL measures. Compared to other EU Member States, Austria therefore has a high participation rate in such voluntary agri-environmental measures.  The key climate protection issues included in the ÖPUL include:  a. limited use of inputs and the creation of broadly closed nutrient cycles (e.g. organic farming); b. accumulation and retention of organic matter as carbon pools in arable soils; c. maintenance and location-adjusted management of permanent grassland and wetland habitats; d. grazing of cattle, sheep and goats. Point (a) 7EEB82018 alone around 760,000 ha9 refrained from using mineral fertilisers, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Commitments to reduce fertiliser use are also covered by the ÖPUL                                                                     6 Integrated Administration and Control System. 7  8  9   ha. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 27 of 268  Naturschutz[Vorbeugender Grundwasserschutz], combined with fertiliser balancing and training. As improved fertiliser management is, in principle, very dependent on awareness of the problem and the willingness of farmers to change their methods, the current ÖPUL also contains increased relevant further training and requirements on carrying out soil testing.  Point (b) The more diverse crop rotation that is common in organic farming and supported under the agri-environmental measures, nitrogen fixation using legumes and the use of organic fertilisers (e.g. solid manure, slurry, compost) all contribute to the development of humus and carbon in agricultural soil. Greening arable land for as long as possible by growing catch crops and fodder also helps to develop humus  in 2018, almost 460,000 ha10, land, were covered by ÖPUL greening measures. The accumulation of organic matter, or protection against soil erosion, is also aided by the reduction in tillage implemented under the Mulch- und Direktsaat] (approx. 130,000 ha arable land in 2019).  Point (c) Due to the high proportion of organic matter, grassland soils are important carbon pools. The conversion of grassland into arable or permanent crop land or into settlements, traffic areas or economic areas results in high humus losses. Meadows and pastures are currently protected both under the first pillar of the CAP (as part of greening) and by various ÖPUL measures. Support for the tailored management of extensive grassland areas, and in particular wetland habitats with particularly high levels of soil organic mattmeasure.  Point (d)  Tierschutz  WeideAlpung und Behirtung] are also relevant to climate protection. Grazing of animals leads to a rapid separation of manure and urine, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions and atmospheric pollutants (ammonia). In 2018, 870,000 grazing or alpine-pasturing LUs11 received ÖPUL support.  In addition to the ÖPUL measures, the Austrian nitrate action programme should also be highlighted in this context, as it contains rules on fertilisers which are compulsory for all farmers.  Austria also has a long-standing expert committee, the Council for Soil Fertility and Soil Protection [Fachbeirat für Bodenfruchtbarkeit und Bodenschutz], which forms part of the BMNT. This                                                                     10  Begrünung  Zwischenfruchtanbau]: 270,000 ha (as of 2017); ÖPUL measure  Begrünung  System Immergrün]: 188,043 ha (as of 2017). 11 Livestock units. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 28 of 268  committee operates at inter-institutional level (Federal Government, provinces, research institutes, agricultural counsellors, etc.), drawing up recommendations for farmers, above all in relation to fertilisers. These recommendations are used, for example, as a basis for giving advice to farmers, for teaching in agricultural schools or as a basis for the nitrate action programme.  In principle, the provinces have constitutional regulatory powers in relation to fertilisers and soil protection  with the exception of forest soils and water legislation.  At European level, six priorities have been set for rural development, which are reflected in the funding programmes of each Member Sta-efficient, climate-resilient meeting climate and energy goals as well as for wider climate issues.  In the Austrian Special Directive Rural Development Funding Programme 2014-2020 [LE-Projektförderungen 2014-2020], the following climate and energy measures in line with Priorities 5 and 6 are available in the area of agricultural production:  -efficient, climate-resilient e  Education  European innovation partnership (EIP-AGRI)  Advisory services  Investment in inter-farm irrigation infrastructure  Investment in infrastructure to develop and diversify agricultural and forestry holdings through the use of energy from renewable raw materials and through energy services  Photovoltaics in agriculture  Investment in renewable energy    Education  European innovation partnership (EIP-AGRI)  Creation and operation of clusters  Creation and operation of networks  Advisory services  Diversification into non-agricultural activities  The educational and advisory measures are not quantifiable in terms of CO2 equivalent, but they are crucial to the implementation of climate and energy-related measures within agricultural holdings. The measure concerning investment in agricultural production under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 is also very important, as it allows for expensive construction and mechanical emission reduction measures (such as ground-level slurry Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 29 of 268  application or capping farmyard manure storage) to be carried out.  The forestry sector is of great importance to Austria. Decades of multifunctional forest management have already led to the accumulation of grearole as a reservoir has increased enormously. The continuous growth in sustainable wood and biomass harvests has also resulted in a very high share of renewable energy sources in electricity and heat production, which contributes significantly to the high share of renewable energy sources in Austria. Through the increased recycling of wood and the associated substitution effects, the forestry sector and the timber industry make a significant contribution to climate protewhich state that in the medium to long term, the concept of sustainable forest management tion.  In recent years, the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events has shown that climate change is already having an impact. The priority is therefore to introduce medium- to long-term climate change adaptation measures in order to protect and stabilise terrestrial carbon pools and maintain ecosystem performance (conservation of productive arable land, grassland and forest, greater reduction in soil loss, protection against natural hazards, etc.).     Waste management and F-gases Since 1990, greenhouse gas emissions in the waste management sector have fallen significantly  despite the increase in waste quantities. Successful measures that have led to proven reductions in emissions include, in particular, the prohibition on depositing untreated municipal waste in landfills, the installation of landfill gas collection systems, material recycling measures and large-scale thermal treatment of residual waste in modern waste incineration plants, which also contribute towards energy production (electricity and heat). Based on the planned increase in the recycling of biogenic waste, anaerobic digestion and the resulting energy production will also become more important.  In order to achieve a sustainable reduction in the use of fluorinated gases (F-gases), which are harmful to the climate, statutory requirements are laid down by the Fluorinated Greenhouse Gas Act 2009 [Fluorierte Treibhausgase-Gesetz 2009], which is supplemented by EU law (Regulation) and adjusted accordingly.

Alongside regulatory law and public funding, klimaaktiv is an instrument in use in the field of voluntary measures and incentives under Austrian climate and energy policy. Through standards, awareness-raising, information, consultation and further education, klimaaktiv provides incentives and market stimulus to use renewable energy sources for energy aktiv klimaaktiv provides guidance and serves as a quality assurance system for public funding, helping to ensure more efficient use of funding, in particular the Domestic Environmental Support scheme and the Climate and Energy Fund. As well as providing consultation, awareness-raising, partnerships, training and certification, klimaaktiv cities, municipalities, regions and the tourism sector, in conjunction with the Domestic Environmental Support scheme and the Climate and Energy Fund, providing financial support for the implementation of measures for clean, low-CO2 mobility, the focus of which is on mobility management, e-mobility, alternative propulsion methods using renewable energy, cycling and innovative, flexible mobility services. Some 15,000 klimaaktiv mobil projects have already been initiated. Under the klimaaktiv mobil programme, financial support in the amount of some EUR 122.4 million  approximately EUR 112.6 million of which from national BMNT funds in the context of klimaaktiv mobile, the Climate and Energy Fund and the Domestic Environmental Support scheme and EUR 9.8 million from EU funds (EAFRD)  has triggered total environmental investments of around EUR 816 million in clean mobility and safeguarded 7,000 jobs. By financing klimaaktiv and klimaaktiv mobil through the Domestic Environmental Support scheme, the Climate and Energy Fund and its own budget, the BMNT assumes the role of a key driver and moderator of the societal move towards a sustainable economic, energy and mobility system. klimaaktiv is a multilevel governance instrument, combining administration, economy, science and civil society. Based on this integrated approach, klimaaktiv provides a communication and cooperation platform for climate protection which promotes integrated analysis and better networking between the public and the private sector. klimaaktiv works together with the economic sector and the provinces, towns, cities and municipalities on a number of issues, and has partnerships with a range of companies. It has therefore had a positive impact on the location on both the demand side and the supply side.     Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 31 of 268  Achieving 2020 targets  -ETS sectors were below the target trajectory in accordance with Decision No 406/2009/EC on the effort of Member States Act. In 2017, the target trajectory was exceeded for the first time, by 2.1 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, partly due to one-off effects. The reasons for this included the adjustment of the target trajectory in line with EU law (reduced by around 1 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent) and an increase in emissions of 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent compared with 2016. According to the provisions of the Austrian Climate Protection Act, additional measures must therefore immediately be negotiated between the Federal Government and the provinces and implemented, in order to ensure that the targets under the Effort Sharing Decision are met. On the basis of the provisions of the Fiscal Equalisation Law 2017 [Finanzausgleichsgesetz 2017], any costs arising from a breach of target values (purchase of emissions allowances) are additionally divided between the Federal Government and the provinces at a ratio of 80:20. As the target has been more than met in the years 2013-2016, there are still currently unused emissions allowances, which Austria may still use in the period 2017-accordance with the rules of the Effort Sharing Decision).

With regard to energy use for space heating and air conditioning, the share of renewable energy in 2017 was 32%. The share of renewable energy in gross electricity consumption in 2017 was 72.2%, while it constituted 9.7% of energy use in the transport sector.  Due to its topographical location, Austria has at its disposal the two main renewable energy sources: hydroelectric power and biogenic energy. These two renewable energy sources make up the greatest share of domestic primary energy production, with the share of biomass on the increase. Other types of renewable energy, in particular the use of ambient heat (heat pumps, solar heat and geothermal energy) and primary energy production using wind and photovoltaics, are also constantly and visibly increasing.

These include in particular the Green Electricity Act [Ökostromgesetz], support for renewable energy systems in the heating sector (particularly in buildings) from the Federal Government (Domestic Environmental Support scheme, to promote the conversion of heating systems) and the provinces (housing subsidies, to cover the energy requirements of residential buildings) and the replacement of fossil fuels with biofuels in the transport sector. The Green Electricity Act was amended in 2017 with the aim of creating greater flexibility, particular for households, and facilitating better integration of existing installations, for example through the incorporation of storage technologies. This guarantees security of supply in a more decentralised energy system. The Green Electricity Act was last amended in October 2019. The key elements of this revision are described in more detail in chapter 3.1.2 (i).      Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 35 of 268  Key federal laws concerning renewable energy  Federal Act on Support for Electricity Production from Renewable Sources (Green Electricity Act 2012  ÖSG 2012)  BGBl. I No 75/2011 The Green Electricity Act 2012 provided an ambitious basis for promoting green electricity in Austria, replacing the Green Electricity Act in force since 2003 (in the version of Federal Law Gazette I No 104/2009) for new installations. In order to ensure a fairer and more even allocation of the available funding among applicants and boost the expansion of green electricity production, funding amounts have increased significantly and feed-in tariffs have been reduced or applied degressively, where economically reasonable for the installations. In the wind and hydroelectric power sector, applicants currently on the waiting list have been given the opportunity to receive support immediately by accepting a discount  scaled on the basis of time and tariff size  on the feed-in tariff requested. The model also provides a solution for capping the green electricity tax for large consumers, whereby the green electricity support tariff is linked, in percentage terms, to charges for grid use and grid losses, without constituting a scaling of taxes based, for example, on grid level. End consumers located within the same grid level are not differentiated between based on province or network area. A central point of contact and settlement centre for green electricity support, OeMAG Abwicklungsstelle für Ökostrom AG, was established under the Green Electricity Act 2012. Also, in order to relieve the burden on green electricity installation operators, administrative procedures were able to be reduced and simplified, for example by establishing a register of installations or by limiting the requirement to submit an application in respect of decisions of recognition.  Federal Act on support for measures in the areas of water management, the environment, contaminated land remediation, protection of the environment abroad and in relation to the Austrian JI/CDM programme on climate protection (Environmental Support Act [Umweltförderungsgesetz  UFG])  BGBl. No 185/1993 On the basis of the projects supported in the period 2014-2018, the Domestic Environmental Support scheme for renewable energy sources (with an energy output of 1,916 GWh/a) and energy efficiency measures (with an energy output of around 2,588 GWh/a) are making a vital   Slightly less than a third (around 560.4 GWh/a, or 29%) of the energy produced from renewable energy sources by approved projects was attributable to local biomass heating. On average, each local heating installation that received support produced 1,519 MWh/a of thermal energy, which it used to feed a local heating grid. Further significant amounts of energy were produced by heat distribution projects.  The focus of support for heat distribution also includes around 40 projects for feeding waste heat into new or existing local and district heating grids or establishing waste heat distribution grids. At around 349 GWh, these projects make up the majority of renewable energy use in this area of Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 36 of 268  focus.  Support for energy savings is also playing an increasingly significant role. The projects supported in the period 2014-2018 achieved annual energy savings of around 2,588 GWh/a, of which around 1,816 GWh/a came from general operational energy saving measures and 772 GWh/a from thermal building renovation measures.  In the areas of local biomass heating, biomass CHP, boiler replacement, heat distribution and optimisation of local heating installations, and for some demonstration installations, the provinces were obliged to provide co-funding. In the period 2014-2018, this compulsory provincial support amounted to EUR 41.5 million. Projects in these areas also received EU co-funding.  Ordinance of the Federal Minister for Agriculture and Forestry, Environment and Water Management on fuel quality and the sustainable use of biofuels (Fuel Ordinance 2012 [Kraftstoffverordnung 2012])  BGBl. II No 398/2012 The Fuel Ordinance established the obligatory use of renewable energy in road transport at national level, in accordance with the objectives of the EU Directives (Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and the Fuel Quality Directive (200all fossil fuel distributors are required to substitute a certain proportion of the fossil fuel placed on the market with renewable energy. More specifically, current targets are to substitute 6.3% of diesel fuel and 3.4% of petrol fuel based on energy value. Both targets are mainly achieved through the addition of around 7% biodiesel to diesel (B7) and 5% bioethanol to petrol (E5) by volume, which occurs nationwide. In order to avoid as far as possible any negative environmental effects from the biofuels used, the Fuel Ordinance contains detailed requirements and criteria intended to guarantee that the biofuels used are sustainable and have a positive environmental impact.     Achieving 2020 targets  Under EU law, Austria is required to increase the share of renewable energy in its gross final energy consumption of energy to 34% by the year 2020. This figure has already almost been reached. In 2017, the share of renewable energy under EU Directive 2009/28/EC was 32.6%. The shares of the individual energy sources in the total creditable renewables are as follows: hydropower (37.5%), wind (5.4%), photovoltaics (1.1%), biofuels (4.7%), heat pumps (2.4%), renewable share of district heating (10.4%) and other renewables (38.5%; includes wood fuels, lyes, biogases, solar heat and geothermal energy).    Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 37 of 268   Dimension 2: Energy efficiency  Austria transposed the key elements of the Energy Efficiency Directive (2012/27/EU, referred to below as EED) by way of the national Energy Efficiency Act ([Bundes-Energieeffizienzgesetz]; BGBl. I No 72/2014, referred to below as EEffG). The contents of the EEffG include:   Compliance with the requirements of the EED.  Stabilisation of final energy consumption at 1,050 PJ and cumulative final energy savings of 310 PJ by 2020.  The requirement for large companies to carry out an external energy audit or to implement an energy or environmental management system. Section 9 of the Energy Efficiency Act requires large companies to carry out an energy audit. This requirement on companies first entered into force with the EEffG at the start of 2015, and the first audits were to be reported by the end of 2015. A small number of companies did not pass the threshold for classification as a large company until 2016 or 2017. Energy audits are to be carried at least every four years, so the next major submission of energy audit reports is expected at the end of 2019.  Support programmes to encourage SMEs to implement energy and environmental management systems.  The requirement for energy suppliers to implement energy efficiency measures. The obligations scheme for energy suppliers is laid down in Section 10 of the EEffG. From 1 January 2015, energy suppliers with an annual energy output of at least 25 GWh have been required annually to implement energy efficiency measures with final energy consumers in Austria, and to report their energy efficiency to the monitoring body12.  The requirement for the Federal Government to implement energy efficiency measures.  Strategic measures (including provincial support for housing construction, energy and environment, the Domestic Environmental Support scheme  see above) to promote energy efficiency measures.    Achieving 2020 targets  Maximum final energy consumption by 2020  PJ exceeded the 2020 target value of 1,050 PJ.                                                                     12 The monitoring body for energy efficiency has been established by order of the BMNT. It is a point of contact and information for companies, public bodies and energy service providers subject to the requirements of the Energy for evaluating energy efficiency measures. It also has various reporting obligations to the general public and the BMNT. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 38 of 268  In comparison to the previous year (2016), it had risen by some 1.8%. According to Statistics Austria, the main reasons for this were increases in traffic levels and industrial production. The provisional energy balance sheet for 2018 shows a value of 1,122 PJ for final energy consumption, a decrease of just under 1% compared to the previous year. The main reason for the decline, according to Statistics Austria, was higher outdoor temperatures during the heating period, which caused the heating degree total to drop by about 10%13.    Figure 6: Final energy consumption (provisional value for 2018) and target trajectory under the Energy Efficiency Act  Source: Austrian Energy Agency, Statistics Austria, 2019 Endenergieverbrauch Österreich Final energy consumption in Austria Zielerreichungspfad Target trajectory Österreichische Energieagentur Austrian Energy Agency Daten: Statistik Austria Data: Statistics Austria  On the basis of the data available, it now unlikely that the energy efficiency target value of 1,050 PJ in 2020 will be achieved. Progress towards this target value is partly dependent on fairly volatile factors which are difficult to influence, such as weather patterns, population growth and economic growth.  Cumulative energy efficiency target of 310 PJ in the period 2015-2020 Progress towards achieving the target under Section 4(1)(3) EEffG presents a different picture. The savings from the measure notifications under the obligations scheme and from strategic measures totalled (2014-2017) 168.3 PJ, and contribute towards the savings target of 310 PJ. This suggests that the EEffG target of 310 PJ will be achieved by 2020.  Energy efficiency measures notified The majority of the cumulative annual savings from 2014 to 2017 came from energy taxes                                                                     13 https://www.statistik.at/web_en/statistics/EnergyEnvironmentInnovationMobility/energy_environment/energy/energy_balances/index.html, retrieved September 2019 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 39 of 268  (strategic measurobligations scheme).  Household measures accounted for annual savings of 25.4 PJ, comprising 37.34% of total savings. In low-income households, the measures taken resulted in annual savings of 0.62 PJ, comprising 0.9% of total savings.

Of all energy audits reported, 59% found potential energy savings of between 1% and 10% at the company. The transport sector shows relatively high potential savings on average, ranging between 5% and 20%. In energy audits with potential savings of over 20%, the key focus is on building measures.  For the creation of the energy audits, a total of 570 qualified energy service providers were listed in the public register of external energy service providers on the website of the energy efficiency monitoring body as of July 2019.  Energy management in SMEs In order to encourage SMEs to implement energy and environmental management systems, a BMNT support programme was launched with a total of EUR 5 million. Energy advisory programmes, co-financed by the Domestic Environmental Support scheme, are also offered to SMEs in the provinces.     Dimension 3: Security of energy supply  General  Around a third of the energy from primary energy sources comes from Austrian production, a large and ever increasing share of which comes from renewable energy sources. Biogenic fuels and propellants and hydroelectric power are the two main energy sources in terms of domestic production. Photovoltaics, wind power and ambient heat are growing constantly and rapidly. Energy imports account for around two-thirds of gross inland energy consumption, with oil and gas the main two imports. Although domestic oil and gas output is relatively modest and exhibiting a downward trend, in 2017 they still constituted 6.1% (oil) and 13.4% (gas) of gross inland energy consumption.  Security of supply indicators have shown positive developments over the last 10 years in Austria. The net import tangent, which shows the level of dependence on imports, has fallen significantly since 2005, from 72.2% to 64.5%. Natural gas storage capacity sits at 8,216 million cubic metres (mcm), slightly less than the annual natural gas consumption in Austria, while emergency oil reserves, standing at more than a quarter of the average annual consumption, are greater than Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 41 of 268  the obligatory emergency reserves required by the International Energy Agency. As well as trend in the energy price index (EPI) shows a significant increase in household energy prices up to 2012, followed by a significant decrease up to 2016, before prices started to rise again in the last two years. However, the real EPI in 2018 will be only slightly higher than in 2005. The Austrian electricity price index (ÖSPI) fell sharply up to 2016  after an initial considerable increase  and has also risen again in the last two years. The development of gas industry prices in Austria shows, similarly to the international price trend, an increase in real prices up to 2012, followed by a significant decline. Since 2008, the price of electricity has become continuously cheaper for Austrian industry, whereas in the EU it initially rose and recently fell only slightly below the starting level of 2009.     Oil and petroleum products  Although the share of oil and petroleum products has fallen from almost 55% in the first half of the 1970s to around 35.7% today, they still rank first among the energy sources contributing to 2017, the final energy consumption of petroleum products in Austria decreased from 11.3 million tonnes to 10.2 million tonnes. The transport sector accounted for around 80% of this, while 10% is attributed to private households (heating/hot water). The rest is spread across manufacturing, agriculture and services.  Two companies (OMV Austria Exploration & Production GmbH and RAG Exploration & Production GmbH) extract oil in Austria, while OMV AG is the only importer of crude oil. Petroleum products are imported by approximately 65 companies and exported by around 20. There is one refinery (Schwechat) and around 15 mixed undertakings. Eighty companies are active in the wholesale supply of petroleum products. Small- and large-scale consumers are supplied by around 20 companies in the fuel and lubricants trade. There are around 2,600 public service stations in Austria. Currently, all oil imports reach Austria and the Schwechat refinery from the Port of Trieste via the Transalpine Pipeline (TAL) and the Adria-Wien Pipeline (AWP). Petroleum products are transported by road, rail, ship and pipeline (the West Product Pipeline [Produktenleitung West, PLW] connects the Schwechat refinery and the Lobau product storage facility with the St. Valentin tank farm).  In 2017, 7.2 million tonnes of oil were imported into Austria (around 90% of the annual demand). Imports came from 13 countries from different regions, with Kazakhstan and Libya ranked first and second. The Schwechat refinery is the only refinery in Austria. Its annual processing capacity is 9.6 million tonnes. Its utilisation rate in recent years has ranged between 90% and 95%. Furthermore, in 2017, 7.1 million tonnes of petroleum products were imported into Austria, compared with product exports of 3.1 million tonnes in 2017.  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 42 of 268  totalled 2.76 million tonnes (0.83 million tonnes of crude oil and 1.93 million tonnes of petroleum products). The obligation to hold stocks corresponimports is therefore met. The administration has not drawn up a risk assessment for oil, nor does it have a prevention plan for which it is responsible.     Natural gas  Austria occupies a key position in the European gas grid and is a major gas transit country. The Baumgarten gas transfer facility in Lower Austria is one of the most important gas hubs in Europe. At 41.14 bcm in 2017, the quantity of natural gas transported through Austria is significantly higher than domestic consumption (8.892 bcm in 2017).  Three companies (OMV Austria Exploration & Production GmbH, RAG Austria AG and RAG Exploration & Production GmbH) extract natural gas in Austria.  Since the beginning of the decade, natural gas storage capacity in Austria has risen from 4.6 bcm to the current capacity of 8.2 bcm provided by the five natural gas storage companies operating in Austria.  Imports based on long-term contracts, which Austrian importers have concluded with suppliers in Norway and Russia, form a cornerstone of the supply of gas. In 2017, a total of 8.090 bcm of natural gas was imported into Austria.  Due to the ongoing liberalisation of the natural gas market, the purchase of natural gas at short notice has become much more important to the natural gas exchange. The volume of gas traded by the Central European Gas Hub (CEGH) on the spot market has increased significantly in recent years, from 0.09 bcm in 2010 to 5.47 bcm in 2017.  The risk assessment for natural gas and the creation of the preventive action plan and the emergency plan are carried out under the leadership of the BMNT in close cooperation with E-Control, the market area manager and the distribution area managers. The publicly available preventive action plan includes the results of the risk assessment, the results of the calculation of the infrastructure standard and of the assessment of compliance with the supply standard and the requirements placed on natural gas companies. The emergency plan contains crisis levels in line with the EU Security of Gas Supply Regulation (early warning level, alert level and emergency level), a description of the relationships between actors  including information flow (e.g. alert chains), the allocation of tasks and roadmaps in critical supply situations or during a crisis  and energy intervention measures.  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 43 of 268     Electricity  ticular reference to smart meters Risikoanalyse für die Informationssysteme der Elektrizitätswirtschaft unter besonderer Berücksichtigung von Smart-Metern und des Datenschutzes], which is publicly available, is the result of voluntary cooperation between the Austrian Federal Chancellery, Ministries relevant to security, representatives from the Austrian energy sector and Energie-Control Austria as the competent regulatory authority. Chapter II of the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector and repealing Directive 2005/89/EC, which was negotiated under the Austrian Council Presidency, provides for the performance of risk assessments14.   With regard to a preventive action plan and an emergency plan, there are currently no EU provisions comparable to those for the gas sector. However, the Network Development Plan, which is to be drawn up by Austrian Power Grid AG every year for a ten-year period, can be considered a key prevEnergielenkungskrisenhandbuch Strom[Konzept des nationalen Netzwiederaufbaus] can be considered comparable instruments to an emergency plan.  Network code The legal basis for the network code on electricity emergency and restoration is Regulation (EU) No 714/2009 (conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity). The network code on electricity emergency and restoration provides rules for managing the electricity grid in cases of emergency, total failure (blackout) and restoration.  APCIP  Austrian Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection In 2008, the Austrian Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (2008 APCIP Masterplan) was adopted, and has since been replaced by the 2014 APCIP Masterplan. APCIP coordination is carried out by the Federal Chancellery and the Federal Ministry of the Interior with the involvement of the relevant federal ministries, provinces, interest groups and strategic companies. The Resolution on a new Austrian Security Strategy (ÖSS) adopted by the National Council on 3 July 2013 tasked the Federal Government with developing a state-level strategy to incrcontribution towards implementing the ÖSS.                                                                      14 Regulation (EU) 2019/941, OJ (EU) L 158 of 14.6.2019, p. 1.

Key laws concerning security of supply at federal level  Federal Act on intervention measures for security of energy supply (Energy Intervention Act 2012 [Energielenkungsgesetz 2012  EnLG 2012])  BGBl. I No 41/2013 The Energy Intervention Act 2012 provides for the creation of a system of measures in Austria to maintain the supply of energy to the population in the event of a crisis and to comply with and liquid energy sources, electricity and natural gas.  Federal Act on holding minimum stocks of oil and petroleum products (Oil Stockholding Act 2012 [Erdölbevorratungsgesetz 2012  EBG 2012])  BGBl. I No 78/2012 The Austrian stockholding system is based on the Oil Stockholding Act 2012 as amended by BGBl. I No 163/2015 and requires importers of oil and/or petroleum products to maintain 25% (90 days) of their net imports from the previous year as obligatory emergency reserves.  Federal Act on mineral raw materials (Mineral Raw Materials Act [Mineralrohstoffgesetz  MinRoG])   BGBl. I No 38/1999 The Mineral Raw Materials Act lays down rules for exploring, extracting and processing free-to-mine, state-owned and privately-owned mineral raw materials, for searching for and investigating geological structures to be used to store liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons (i.e. oil and natural gas), for underground container-free storage of hydrocarbons and for processing the stored hydrocarbons, where it is carried out by the storage rights holder in connection with the operation of the storage facility.     Dimension 4: market integration  Electricity  Austria forms part of the Central Western European (CWE) wholesale electricity market and is closely linked with its neighbouring countries. In 2017, the electricity interconnection level in Austria was 15.3%, well above the 2020 target of 10%. The countrychallenges in terms of north-absorb and transport large and increasing levels of electricity generation from solar and wind Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 45 of 268  power.  There are bottlenecks in the transmission network for Hungary, Czechia, Slovenia, Italy, Switzerland and, as a result of regulatory requirements, also for Germany as of 1 October 2018. For the important day-ahead market, these bottlenecks are managed either through implicit auctions as part of the European day-ahead market coupling (AT-IT-SI), or through explicit auctions at all other congested borders. There is no direct grid connection between Austria and Slovakia.  Austria is particularly active in the Central Eastern European (CEE) region. This region comprises the countries of Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Germany and Austria.  Austria is also actively involved in the Central Southern European (CSE) region. This region comprises Germany, France, Slovenia, Italy, Greece and Austria, plus Switzerland as an observer country. A particularly important step in this region was the implementation of the day-ahead market coupling at (most) Italian borders in 2015.  The successful commissioning of the Multiple NEMO Arrangements (MNA) in the CWE region led to a breakthrough in the integration of the European electricity markets in July 2019. Since then, more than one electricity exchange in Austria has been able to offer its traders participation in the joint European day-ahead market coupling. Through its strong links with the CWE region, since 2011 Austria has therefore been active as a full member of the Pentalateral Forum (Benelux, Germany, France, Switzerland and Austria). The aim of this initiative is to provide political support for a process of regional integration towards a European energy market.  Austria is also a member of the CESEC (Central and South-Eastern Europe Connectivity) regional initiative, which aims to speed up the integration of gas and electricity markets in central and south-eastern Europe. It was set up in February 2015 by Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. These countries were later joined by eight Contracting Parties to the Energy Community: Ukraine, Moldova, Serbia, North Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Montenegro.     Network Development Plan (NDP)  The Network Development Plan is a legal obligation for transmission system operators. Both Austrian Power Grid AG (APG) and Vorarlberger Übertragungsnetz GmbH (VÜN) draw up their own Network Development Plan, which must be approved by the regulator E-Control. The NDP contains a list of investments that have already been agreed and projects to be implemented within the next three years. The NDP also sets out network planning for the next ten years, taking into account developments in energy performance.  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 46 of 268  The current Network Development Plan 2019 is based on ENTSO-Development Plan (TYNDP) 2018 and the NDP 2018, and provides information on the key transmission infrastructure to be developed in the APG network. Within the framework of TYNDP, the European transmission system operators plan coordinated network expansion across Europe. In TYNDP 2018, ENTSO-G and ENTSO-E have for the first time published joint scenarios for a future energy system, which show the interactions between electricity and gas systems.     Projects of common interest  electricity  Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 provides a framework for identifying, planning and implementing projects of common interest (PCIs). PCIs are essential to the creation of nine priority strategic geographical energy infrastructure corridors in Europe.  The projects are particularly intended to help create a sustainable energy system in order to address challenges such as increasing energy demand, ensure security of supply, cope with bottlenecks, increase market liquidity and trading opportunities, promote the use of technology such as smart grids and enable the integration of renewable energy.  The list of PCIs is drawn up every two years. In particular, this process involves the Member States, the European Commission, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), the national regulatory authorities and the project promoters. Currently in force is the third PCI list, from 2017; the process of drawing up the fourth list began in autumn 2018.  Due to its central geographic location, Austria is particularly affected by north-south connections and energy flows, and must therefore increasingly balance out volatility in renewable energy generation.  In October, the European Commission presented the draft for a Delegated Regulation on the fourth PCI list. If no objections are raised by the Council or the European Parliament, the Delegated Act will enter into force after the expiry of the objection period of two months (renewable once); this is likely to be in the first quarter of 2020.  Irrespective of the final result on the fourth PCI list, Austria will support the projects proposed by Austrian project promoters for the fourth PCI list.  The draft for the fourth PCI list contains the following Austrian PCIs in the electricity sector:  -  2.18. Capacity increase of hydro-pumped electricity storage in Kaunertal, Tyrol; Project promoter: TIWAG Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 47 of 268      - Cluster Austria  Germany, including the following PCIs:  3.1.1 Interconnection between St Peter (AT) and Isar (DE) (380 kV   3.1.2 Internal line between St Peter and Tauern (AT) (380 kV    3.1.4 Internal line between Westtirol and Zell-Ziller (AT) (380 kV); Project promoter: APG  3.4. Interconnection between Würmlach (AT) and Somplago (IT); Underground lines; 220 kV; Project promoter: Alpe Adria Energia S.r.l.     The project promoters for 3.4 (Somplago-Würmlach) have applied for support from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). These applications, along with the projects themselves, were supported by Austria. A CEF grant was approved at the beginning of 2019.  German-Austrian pricing zone  Since the liberalisation of the electricity markets, Germany and Austria have formed a common market zone in the wholesale electricity market. On 1 October 2018 this German-Austrian market zone was split. As a result, Austria is guaranteed a free long-term capacity of 4,900 MW. This leads to an adjustment of the Austrian electricity price index (ÖSPI). The ÖSPI is derived from prices on the European Energy Exchange (EEX). The relevant prices are those for long-term supply contracts, known as electricity futures. Previously, the corresponding futures for the common German-Austrian electricity market were used to calculate the ÖSPI. This calculation was switched for the first time in September 2018 and since then the electricity futures exclusively for the Austrian market have been taken into account. The calculation system itself remains in the existing form. Tariffs with a fixed price agreement will not be adapted until the date fixed in the contract.     Gas Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 48 of 268   Austria occupies a key position in the European gas grid. The Baumgarten gas transfer facility in transmission and distribution network is around 46,000 km in length (as of 2017). In addition to the gas distribution system (high and low pressure), end consumers are also supplied by way of transit pipelines. These are pipelines of international importance, which cross Austria, but which are also used for transportation within Austria. Natural gas is transported internationally via a dense network of pipelines, stretching from Russia, through former Soviet states, Slovakia, Czechia and Austria, to destinations in western and southern Europe.  Through the Gas Act 2011 [Gaswirtschaftsgesetz 2011, GWG 2011] and the gas market model introduced in 2013, an entry/exit system was implemented, the balancing group system was extended to transmission level and a virtual trading point for the settlement of all gas transactions was introduced. Every customer is either directly or indirectly (through their utility company) a member of a balancing group. In the new gas market model, the three previous control areas have been converted into market areas (Eastern, Tyrol and Vorarlberg). The Eastern market area is the only one that also has transmission pipelines. In this market area, the previous system of capacity bookings has been replaced by an entry/exit system. The entry/exit system allows capacity at entry and exit points to be booked independently of one another and traded.  The natural gas storage operators active in Austria  RAG Energy Storage GmbH, OMV Gas Storage GmbH, Uniper Energy Storage GmbH, Astora GmbH & Co. KG and GSA LLC  have storage facilities with a total working gas volume of approximately 8.2 bcm. Natural gas is stored in partially depleted hydrocarbon-bearing geological structures at a depth of currently about 500 to 2,300 m.     Coordinated Network Development Plan (CNDP)  In its role as market area manager, Austrian Gas Grid Management AG is responsible for drawing up a Coordinated Network Development Plan once a year, in consultation with the transmission system operators (Gas Connect and Trans Austria Gasleitung GmbH), which must then be approved by the regulatory authority E-Control. The objectives of the Coordinated Network Development Plan are, in particular, to meet the demand for line capacity to supply end consumers while taking into account emergency scenarios, to ensure a high degree of availability of line capacity, to cover transport needs and to comply with the obligation to meet the infrastructure standard in the market area. The CNDP will be developed in line with the European planning principles laid down in tby ENTSO-G. In addition to describing the pan-European infrastructure, this plan in particular considers supply potential, market integration and security of supply and thus also covers the overall dynamics of the European gas market. In TYNDP 2018, ENTSO-G and ENTSO-E have for the first Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 49 of 268  time published joint scenarios for a future energy system, which show the interactions between electricity and gas systems.  Long-term Plan (LTP)  Austrian Gas Grid Management AG, as the distribution area manager, is also responsible for drawing up the Long-term Plan for the Austrian distribution area at least once a year. This is approved by the regulatory authority E-Control Austria. The aim of the Long-term Plan is to ensure transport capacities in the distribution area both for the supply of end consumers and for the transport requirements of the storage companies and their customers and the producers of natural gas and biogas.  Projects of common interest  gas  As with the electricity sector, Austrian projects of common interest (PCIs) aim to improve market integration, address bottlenecks at borders and enable cross-border bi-directional gas flows. Issues of security of supply and diversification of energy sources and routes are thus treated as priorities at national and EU level. Due to its central geographic location, and also due to the Baumgarten gas hub, Austria is particularly affected by capacity expansion projects or new pipeline projects. The draft for the fourth PCI list contains the following Austrian PCIs in the gas sector:  -    6.26.  6.26.1 Cluster Croatia  Slovenia  Austria at Rogatec:  GCA 2015/08: Entry/Exit Murfeld (AT); Project promoter: GCA       Key laws concerning market integration at federal level  Electricity Industry and Organisation Act 2010 [Elektrizitätswirtschafts- und Organisationsgesetz 2010,  ElWOG 2010]  BGBl. I No 110/2010 The implementation of the third internal energy market package required regulations in the electricity and gas sector to be comprehensively redesigned. The aim of this Federal Act is to Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 50 of 268  account for these requirements. It contains rules on the production, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity and on the organisation of the electricity industry. It also lays down rules on system use charges, on accounts and on the organisation, unbundling and transparency of the accounting done by electricity companies, as well as their other rights and obligations.  Federal Act laying down new rules for the natural gas sector (Gas Act 2011 [Gaswirtschaftsgesetz 2011  GWG 2011])  BGBl. I No 107/2011 This Federal Act aims to account for the requirements of Directive 2009/73/EC, particularly in relation to unbundling. It lays down rules for effective unbundling of transmission networks, for ensuring free market access for suppliers and for developing capacity for new consumer increasing the liquidity of the gas market by setting up virtual trading points.  Federal Act implementing Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 on guidelines for European infrastructure (Energy Infrastructure Act [Energie-Infrastrukturgesetz  E-InfrastrukturG])  BGBl. I No 4/2016 The purpose of this Federal Act is to account for the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 347/2013. The key elements of this are designating the Federal Minister for Science, Research and Economic Affairs as the competent authority (infrastructure authority), selecting the procedure for the comprehensive decision and securing the development of pipeline installations.  Federal Act on the regulatory authority for the electricity and natural gas industry (Energy Control Act [Energy-Control-Gesetz  E-ControlG])  BGBl. I No 110/2010 -Control Austria for the regulation of the electricity and g-Control for short, [Energie-Control Austria für die Regulierung der Elektrizitäts- und Erdgaswirtschaft] as a public agency with legal personality.  Federal Act imposing a tax on the supply and consumption of electricity (Electricity Tax Act [Elektrizitätsabgabegesetz])  BGBl. I No 201/1996 By largely exempting sustainable electricity production from the obligation to pay electricity tax and simplifying administration for electricity producers, the aim is to support sustainable domestic electricity production through tax measures. In addition to an exemption for electrical energy produced from renewable primary energy sources, e.g. small hydroelectric power stations, wind turbines and similar, in the form of a tax-free allowance of 25,000 kWh, an uncapped tax exemption will be introduced for electrical energy produced by means of photovoltaics.  Federal Act supporting the construction of local and district heating and cooling pipelines (Heating and Cooling Pipeline Development Act [Wärme- und Kälteleitungsausbaugesetz  WKLG])  BGBl. I No 113/2008 This Federal Act generates CO2 savings and increases energy efficiency through support for Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 51 of 268  investment. The creation of cooling grids is designed to curb the increase in electricity consumption for air-conditioning and to make cost-effective use of existing heat and waste heat potential, particularly on an industrial scale.  Federal Act introducing provisions for the combined heat and power sector (Combined Heat and Power Act [KWK-Gesetz])  BGBl. I No /2008 The purpose of this Act is to support new high-efficiency CHP plants through investment grants, provided the plants are not already being supported by means of other State resources.  Measures to overcome energy poverty  As a result of the third internal electricity market package, it has been possible to take the first important steps in improving the conditions for people in payment difficulties: a strict reminder procedure has been introduced before electricity or gas is cut off, which gives people more time to look for solutions. The high ancillary costs of late payment for electricity and gas (reminder costs, disconnection costs, etc.), which were incurred by the very people who were unable to pay their energy bills, have been standardised and limited. Based on this law, ancillary costs collected by the network operators can be regulated taking social criteria into account. An obligation to contract is intended to ensure that people with poor credit ratings or old debts can also purchase electricity and gas, provided they pay a monthly instalment of their electricity costs in advance. Poor credit ratings or old debts are no reason to refuse the basic service. The tariff is not more expensive than the standard tariff for household customers. Large energy suppliers are obliged to set up contact and advice centres, which also cover problems relating to energy poverty. The Green Electricity Act relieved low-income households of additional costs for green electricity production. The Energy Efficiency Act contains incentives for energy suppliers  which are obliged by the EnEffG to provide evidence of energy efficiency measures  to increasingly implement energy efficiency measures also in low-income households.    Dimension 5: research, development and competitiveness  Research and technological development play a key role in global decarbonisation and are central elements in the fundamental conversion of the energy system. Austria still has huge potential to build on past innovation success stories to develop and successfully implement innovative technologies and solutions. The following strategic objectives are in place:   put energy research and innovation at the heart of solving societal challenges Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 52 of 268  (mission orientation);  increase the speed at which the results of research and technological development reach the market through the introduction of targeted measures (impact orientation);  gradually increase funding for energy research and innovation;  increase the presence of Austrian research institutes and innovation companies at global level (transnational RTI collaboration);  thereby establishing Austria as a technology leader in energy-related areas and increasing international competitiveness.   In future, energy research and innovation will be organised around these guidelines, a fact which is characterised by an integrated perspective based on a systemic approach. System integration of the growing range of available technology and solutions, in terms of global approaches, is equally as important as the targeted development and advancement of technology and components. The current Austrian government programme established a corresponding research initiative which is open to all kinds of technology. Under this initiative, mission-oriented research and development for specific challenges in the energy system and large-scale testing of technologies and solutions under real operating conditions will be used to achieve technological leadership and boost development and implementation. In the period 2021-2030, these formats will be further developed, building on the experience previously gained.     iii. Key aspects of cross-border relevance  Due to its geographical situation (mountainous, land-locked central European country), Austria has specific characteristics, some of which have a cross-border impact on the energy and transport system.  Major trans-European transit routes  both north-south and west-east  travel through Austrian territory, putting great pressure on the transport infrastructure. As well as economic opportunities, this also has negative side effects, in particular with regard to air quality and noise. In addition, significant quantities of fuel are put into tanks in Austria by cross-border transport companies and then largely used in neighbouring countries. This effect is, in no small part, also due to the fact that diesel is cheaper in Austria than in most neighbouring countries. This has led to a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions in Austria, as, according to the IPCC, emissions balancing is carried out in accordance with the principle of quantities sold domestically.  Austria occupies a key position in the European gas grid and is a major gas transit country. The Baumgarten gas transfer facility in Lower Austria is one of the most important gas hubs in Europe. In the electricity sector too, Austria has close links with its neighbours. In 2017, the electricity interconnection level in Austria was 15.3%, well above the 2020 target of 10%. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 53 of 268   For further information see point 1.2, sub-     iv. Administrative structures for implementing national energy and climate policy  Austria is a federal state. Via the federal constitution, legislative competence across the various sectors is shared between the Federal Government and the provinces. There are also some mixed competences. Some sectors (including energy law) follow the principle of basic legislation at through which federal tasks are handled by provincial enforcement bodies, also ensures a strong   Climate policy in Austria is a classic cross-sector matter, in particular as regards the distribution of competences for climate policy measures for reducing emissions and adapting to climate change. The Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism (BMNT) plays a national coordinating role with regard to climate policy. Strategic processes are managed in the same sense by the BMNT (together with other ministries where appropriate). The BMNT also assumes responsibility for reporting on climate issues to the UNFCCC Secretariat and to the European Union.  Key competences for implementing measures lie with the federal ministries (federal climate- and energy-related support and incentives in non-ETS sectors), the provinces (particularly buildings, small combustion plants and spatial planning) and the municipalities (particularly public transport and parking space management). In addition, the BMNT also has key competences for implementing measures, particularly in the areas of EU emissions trading, energy, waste management, chemicals policy and agriculture and forestry. In some cases, however, these competences are also shared with the provinces (especially waste management, agriculture and forestry).  Not least as a consequence of the strong diversification of competences in climate policy matters, in 2011 the Federal Government (at the initiative of the then Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, the Environment and Water Management) passed a Federal Climate Protection Act. The purpose of this act is to coordinate Austrian climate policy in line with international and EU law. To this end, a National Committee on Climate Change was established, on which, alongside the  (Nationalrat, i.e. the lower house of the Austrian parliament), economic interest groups and environmental NGOs, among others.  One of the key functions of the Climate Protection Act is to ensure a process for developing climate protection measures and to lay down emission ceilings (target trajectories) in line with Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 54 of 268  European legislation. The emission ceilings for the period 2013-2020 were also allocated to the emitting sectors and laid down in law.  In the energy sector, a regulatory authority for the electricity and natural gas industry was -Control Austria for the regulation of the electricity and -Control). In 2011, it was converted into a public agency with legal personality (E-Control Act).   Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 55 of 268  1.3. Stakeholder consultation at national and EU level  outcomes   Even in the early stages of the Climate and Energy Strategy (#mission2030), national stakeholders and the general public were fully involved by the Federal Government. In April/May 2018, an extensive public consultation was carried out. This was divided into an online public consultation (which received around 500 responses), multiple round table events with broad stakeholder participation to advance the discussion on certain topics, and a parliamentary enquiry (see below). For the mobility sector, the BMVIT and the BMNT, together with the provinces and numerous experts, held a separate stakeholder process, Mobility transition 2030 [Mobilitätswende 2030].  This National Energy and Climate Plan relates directly to the strategic focus and priority areas of #mission2030. In order to draft the plan, federal and provincial working groups were set up starting in July 2018, which drew up proposals for measures at sector level. In November 2018, the National Committee on Climate Change was also consulted in accordance with the Climate Protection Act and was given the opportunity to submit a written opinion. This body comprises representatives of the following institutions and social groups:   the relevant ministries (Sustainability, Transport/Innovation, Finance, Economic Affairs, Science, Health/Social Affairs, Justice) and the Federal Chancellery;  parties represented in the Austrian National Council (lower house of parliament);  all nine provinces;  social partners (Economic Chamber, Chamber of Agriculture, Chamber of Labour, Trade Union Confederation);  industry, energy and consumer information associations;  Association of Towns and Municipalities;  representatives of the scientific community;  Federal Environment Agency;  environmental protection NGOs.     Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 56 of 268  i. Participation of the Austrian Parliament  members of the parties represented in the Austrian Parliament were involved in the round table events (in some cases acting as chair). A parliamentary climate enquiry was also organised specifically for the Climate and Energy Strategy, involving representatives of the scientific community, the provinces and civil society, among others. The political parties took the opportunity to set out their positions on climate change policy.  The National Energy and Climate Plan was drawn up with the repeated involvement of the members of the political parties represented in the National Council by way of the National Committee on Climate Change (November 2018, July 2019).  ii. Participation of local and regional administrations  During the consultation phase for the Climate and Energy Strategy (see above), the Austrian provinces took part in the round table events and were also involved in the build-up to key aspects of the strategy. The provinces took this opportunity to set out their positions on climate change policy, also doing so through the online consultation on the strategy.  The provinces were heavily involved in drawing up the National Energy and Climate Plan through the establishment of a working group between the Federal Government and the provinces and further sub-working groups at sectoral level. All provinces were given the opportunity to actively participate in the (sub-)working groups and to submit concrete proposals for action. The provinces and other city and municipality interest groups (Association of Towns, Association of Municipalities) are also members of the National Committee on Climate Change and were therefore also able to submit final written opinions. Coordination with the provinces takes place, inter alia, through the provincial climate protection officers, with the involvement of the Federal Minister responsible for climate protection.  In addition, the provinces are also involved in drawing up key national strategies relevant to the sectors of energy and climate protection. The heat strategy, bio-economy strategy and hydrogen strategy processes are particularly affected by this. Existing (interim) results from these processes were taken into account when finalising the plan.    Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 57 of 268  iii. Consultation with stakeholders, including social partners, and participation of civil society and citizens  During the consultation phase for the Climate and Energy Strategy (see above), social partners particular NGOs in the environmental and energy sector and companies) were involved in the round table events, and to some extent also took part in the online consultation, in order to communicate their concerns in writing. The general public (citizens) were also given the opportunity to participate in the online consultation (see above).  This draft of the National Energy and Climate Plan was drawn up with the involvement of social partners and NGOs by way of the National Committee on Climate Change (November 2018, July 2019). In November 2019, during finalisation of the plan, a comprehensive public consultation was held in accordance with the requirements of the Governance Regulation. Comments from citizens and stakeholders were thoroughly analysed and taken into account where possible. Around 120 comments were received in total.  In order to discuss mMobilitätswende 2030 stakeholder process, with widespread participation of local and regional administrations. Common guiding principles were adopted by the Federal Government, provinces, towns, cities and municipalities.  iv. Consultation with other Member States  In the course of drafting the NECP, Austria contacted all of its EU neighbouring states to ensure regional consultation within the meaning of the Governance Regulation. During the consultation on regional cooperation with other Member States are given in Chapter 1.4.  v. Iterative consultation process with the European Commission  The Republic of Austria officially submitted its draft National Energy and Climate Plan to the European Commission on 20 December 2018 in accordance with the Regulation on Governance. On 30 January 2019, Austria  like all other Member States  had the opportunity to present key at the invitation of the Commission.  On 18 June 2019, the European Commission published a communication on the results of the examination of the plans as well as recommendations to the Member States. The recommendations addressed to Austria were widely communicated to the national stakeholders and a meeting of the National Committee on Climate Change was held on 8 July 2019.  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 58 of 268  Further working group meetings were subsequently agreed, in particular to develop additional measures in the transport sector. Measures in the agricultural sector have also been further specified through an internal process in the Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism.  Target definitions for the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors have been clarified in more detail with the European Commission. In the renewable energy sector, a bilateral meeting was held in March 2019, during which mainly questions of target definition and gross final energy consumption were discussed.  On 10 or to this workshop, a bilateral meeting was also held with representatives of the European Commission (DG ENER) under the leadership of Claudia Canevari. Detailed questions and the recommendations of the European Commission on the energy efficiency part of the National Energy and Climate Plan were discussed:    7: the aim is to produce a coherent document in which efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and renewables fit together in terms of targets and contributions. The key elements for LTRS should be included in the NECP.  (internal market, security of supply, decarbonisation) must be demonstrated. It must be shown how the principle is implemented and monitored in Austria.  National contribution: a fixed, absolute value must be given, and policies and measures must be detailed at the level of programme (not individual projects).  Other European measures such as ecodesign or reducing CO2 in cars must be taken into account when calculating national contributions.     Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 59 of 268  1.4. Regional cooperation in drawing up the plan   i. Elements of coordinated planning with other Member States  Regional cooperation with neighbouring States  As part of the process of drawing up the draft National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), regional Hungary, Slovenia and Italy, as well as with Poland, Croatia and Belgium. As part of this, the majority of Member States, including Austria, have chosen to invite each other to cooperation meetings. Each of these meetings saw several Member States come together to inform one another of the contents of their respective draft NECPs and to identify possible connecting factors enabling closer cooperation.  Austria participated in the associated conferences held in   Bratislava (November 2018; Slovakia, Czechia, Hungary, Poland),  Berlin (April 2019; Germany, along with Czechia, Slovenia, etc.),  Ljubljana (July 2019; Slovenia, Italy, Croatia, Hungary)  Brussels (September 2019; various Member States)  Austria also invited Germany, Czechia and Slovakia to a conference held in Vienna on 28 June 2019 within the scope of regional cooperation. During this conference, the participating States presented their respective draft plans and subsequent discussions were held to identify topics of cross-border significance, thereby further deepening the cooperation. The conference focused on objectives and policies/measures in all five dimensions of the Energy Union.  Use of existing forums for regional cooperation  Austria is part of the Pentalateral Energy Forum (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland) for regional cooperation in Central and Western Europe to improve electricity market integration and the security of supply. During the PENTA Directors-General meeting held in November 2018 in Vienna, the decision was made to use the PENTA Forum for Declaration of the Pentalateral Energy Forum on Intwhich was signed by the Energy Ministers of all PENTA member states during the Ministerial Meeting held on 4 March 2019. In this declaration, it was stated that the PENTA states would draft a common chapter for the NECP with the intention of laying the foundation for a structured Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 60 of 268  dialogue on the subject of further long-term cooperation. In order to establish this process as an integral part of the cooperation, a separate body was established within the PENTA to ensure long-term NECP cooperation. The common chapter was signed by the Energy Ministers during the PENTA Ministerial Meeting held on 25 June 2019. In September 2019, a subsequent meeting of the NECP representatives took place in Brussels, during which the next steps for the implementation of the common chapter were defined.  ii. Consideration of the results of regional cooperation in the plan  The contents of the national energy and climate plans were exchanged and discussed at the above-mentioned cooperation-related events, and areas of cross-border interest (e.g. transmission networks in the energy sector, projects of common interest, etc.) were examined in greater depth. Within the framework of the Pentalateral Forum (see above), common text elements were developed and taken into account in the present plan. The results of this process are presented in the following section.     Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 61 of 268  Common chapter of the Pentalateral Energy Forum  Introduction  The Pentalateral Energy Forum is a voluntary regional cooperation, since 2005, between Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and, since 2011, Austria, counting for more than one third of EU population and covering more than 40% of the electricity generation in the EU. Switzerland joined as a permanent observer in 2011 and contributes actively to the technical work and decision shaping. In close cooperation with the European Commission (on invitation), the Pentalateral Energy Forum enhances the cooperation between all relevant parties in order to create a regional electricity market as an intermediate step towards one common European electricity market. The cooperation is led by the Ministers responsible for energy policy, who meet on a regular basis. The follow-up of the activities is ensured by the Penta Coordinators and the Penta NECP Committee under the direction of the respective Directors General (Section Heads in Austria) of the Pentalateral countries. The work programme is carried out by Transmission System Operators (TSOs), ministries, regulatory authorities (NRAs), the European Commission and market parties who meet on a regular basis in 3 Support Groups. The major success over the past 15 years is that Penta countries have evolved from a purely national policy perspective on energy markets to the adoption of a regional approach. Concrete regional milestones are put in place in several dimensions which remain relevant today:  Internal electricity market/market integration: The Penta Support Group 1 (SG1) focuses on the coupling of the electricity markets in the region. The SG1 fostered the flow-based market coupling (FBMC) of the day-ahead markets as an objective, and in May 2015 the FBMC was officially launched in the Penta region, as the first of its kind in the European Union. Since then, the FBMC has been continuously improved to further increase its welfare gains and serves now as the basis for a fully EU entrenched FBMC for the day-ahead markets. Moreover, in order to increase the available transmission capacity for cross-border trade on the intraday market, the SG1 fostered a coordinated intraday capacity calculation process after day-ahead flow-based market coupling for all borders in the region which has been implemented in March 2016 as a first step of the coupling of European intraday markets. The Support Group has been a privileged witness of the drastic change in the electricity landscape and the governance of the electricity markets. Whereas in 2005 electricity operators still worked rather separately, the group has actively stimulated over the years the cooperation between stakeholders, which contributed e.g. to the regional grouping of TSOs in their associations, the merger of Power Exchanges or TSOs, and the emergence of new regional actors (TSCNet, Coreso, former CASC-CWE, SSC). Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 62 of 268  With a view to the new implementation plans that have to be prepared according to the Clean Energy Package, Penta countries will closely coordinate and explore joint action.  Internal electricity market/flexibility: The Support Group 3 (SG3) focuses on flexibility issues in the region. The work in the SG3 has until now been concentrated on balancing, intraday and the role of demand side response as three major fields for regional cooperation to improve the flexibility of our electricity markets. Various technical background papers have been delivered summing up the main barriers and obstacles towards an enhanced use of flexibility in the Penta region. The participation of SG3 has been open to traditional participants (NRAs/TSOs) as well as other stakeholders like Distribution System Operators (DSOs), large consumer organisations and renewable producers. Regarding balancing, assessments of current approaches and an exchange on good practices have taken place within the Penta forum. In addition, Penta is playing an important role in the implementation process of the European Union Guidelines on Electricity Balancing. Regarding Demand Side Response (DSR), a separate expert group has worked on a report describing the actual situation in the Penta region with a focus on the rules and responsibilities of new market players in each country of the region. Regarding the further cooperation of Penta countries on hydrogen, a workshop has taken place, in order to define possible cooperation topics on this issue.   Security of supply: The Support Group 2 (SG2) deals with security of supply issues in the region. There has been a Memorandum of Understanding among Penta countries on cooperation as regards security of supply (MOU), signed in June 2017. Based on this and in the light of the organised in 2018 in order to achieve a better mutual understanding of national concerns, identify potential relevant (cross border) crisis situations for the region and assess different measures to mitigate the effects of a crisis. The 1st regional generation adequacy assessment (GAA) performed by the Penta TSOs and published in March 2015 constituted an important milestone. The methodology for the assessment used a probabilistic and chronological approach with an hourly resolution for the years 2015/2016 and 2020/2021 which represented a significant improvement in comparison to the existing deterministic approaches. Furthermore, the Penta TSOs used a common regional dataset based on the same scenarios and assumptions, such as a regional-wide temperature-sensitive load model and harmonised probabilistic hydrological data. The governments of the Penta countries are convinced that these dimensions remain relevant. Next to a continuation on the above-mentioned areas, Penta countries will in the upcoming years use the Pentalateral Energy Forum to work on the following priorities: Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 63 of 268   Decarbonisation of the electricity sector  Common vision on decarbonised electricity in Penta by 2050: Penta countries will exchange their visions for a decarbonised electricity system by 2050 (with intermediate steps for 2030 and 2040) as part of a highly energy efficient and highly renewables-based energy system, a stepwise phasing out of fossil generated power and by an efficient end-use of electricity. As a first step, a comparison of national scenarios on what the electricity system 2050 could look like will be performed as well as the identification of common and diverging aspects across the scenarios and how security of supply would be guaranteed in these scenarios. This will create the basis for a common understanding of the expectations and challenges for building a future electricity system.  Start cross-border cooperation on renewable electricity: Penta countries will work on voluntary basis towards developing a menu of common concepts covering different levels of cooperation, including exploring the possibilities for opening of national tendering schemes/cross-border tendering, common tenders for those Penta-countries which are interested and making increased use of the EU enabling framework for renewable energy and the existing cooperation mechanisms, -countries which are interested. The Penta countries also support the ongoing work of the European Commission and the Member States on developing a European Union Renewables Financing Mechanism.  Integration of electro-mobility options and services without regional restrictions Penta countries will contribute to increasing the share of renewable energy in transport by promoting electromobility (including fuel cell options). They facilitate the integration/implementation of electromobility options and services without restrictions within the Penta region, by identifying and if needed removing barriers for the cross-border deployment of electro-mobility and charging services and by assuring interoperability.  Explore the options for carbon pricing and their cross-border impact on electricity prices: Penta countries that plan or consider to introduce a carbon price will on a voluntary basis exchange views on policy approaches for the introduction of a carbon price, its advantages and disadvantages in terms of CO2 reduction, security of supply, price developments and a level playing field of their industries.  Internal electricity market  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 64 of 268  Market integration Penta countries will further improve the monitoring of FBMC with a view to increase cross-border trade and social welfare and to optimise consumer benefit. Penta countries will make the monitoring more innovative, with a view to translating it into the key common indicators to assess the evolution towards a fully decarbonised Pentalateral electricity market in 2050. Penta countries will work together in the swift implementation of the Clean Energy Package and possible cross-border impacts for the energy market (e.g. further development and improvement of redispatch cooperation in the Penta-region).  Flexibility Penta countries will focus on the impact of the implementation of flexibility options such as the role of demand side management, PtX and hydrogen, the role of storage, electric mobility and analyse concrete electricity related barriers for sector coupling. Regarding the potential future role of increasingly renewables based hydrogen as an energy carrier in their energy system, Penta countries will examine possible common approaches for guarantees of origin, cross-border infrastructure, the respective role of TSOs and DSOs and standards for hydrogen blending, as well as exchange information and best practices on support schemes for hydrogen and innovation projects and the future role of hydrogen in general.  Security of supply  Penta countries will continuously improve the Pentalateral Generation Adequacy Assessment by taking into account improved weather data, the latest figures and targets from the NECPs of Penta countries when determining the future energy mixes and some other sensitivity analysis. The third assessment is currently being elaborated by the Penta TSOs for the horizons 2021 and 2025 taking into account regional (based on national) storylines, improved Flow Based calculations and Demand Side Flexibility sensitivities. In the frame of the Clean Energy Package (CEP), and more specifically in the context of regional cooperation and the risk preparedness regulation, discussions have been started with ENTSO-E, the Commission and other stakeholders to define rules for the cooperation between Member States in view of identifying potential regional crisis scenarios and of preventing, preparing for and handling electricity crises in a spirit of solidarity and transparency and in full regard for the requirements of a competitive internal market for electricity. Penta countries will work together to develop concrete regional measures in crisis situations.  Financing instruments for the energy transition  The Pentalateral Energy Forum will start to exchange on possible regional approaches Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 65 of 268  to increase energy efficiency and the roll out of renewables for example by looking together with financial institutions such as EIB for joint approaches to reduce risks in     iii. Main concerns for closer cooperation at European level  In addition to the considerable efforts being made at Member State level, the implementation of the objectives of the National Energy and Climate Plan requires further European Union initiatives in certain key areas. FEuropean Commission is a welcome move. For example, extensive structural changes in the Mobility and Energy sector require corresponding guidelines in the common internal market.  Under the Austrian Presidency, the Graz Declaration was adopted at the informal Commission to draw up a mobility strategy by 2021.  The existing CO2 fleet agreements should be tightened up on the basis of an early review  in accordance with the decarbonisation pathway required under the Paris Agreement and the EU long-term strategy  with a view to enabling a faster switch to electromobility for passenger cars and light and heavy commercial vehicles, particularly after 2030. Proposals for specific measures include:  Rapid introduction of CO2 limits for buses.  Establishment of predictability for the automotive industry by rapidly establishing reduction paths for the period after 2030.  Pushing for the revision of the Eurovignette Directive in order to bring about cost transparency for road freight transport by internalising external costs (e.g. by taking account of CO2 emissions, removing the maximum limits for charging external costs and obliging all Member States to levy external costs on polluted routes).  Amendment of the VAT Directive, in particular the abolition of exemptions for international transport.  Completion of the Single European Sky: The ever-increasing volumes of air traffic make it necessary to make more efficient use of existing airspace capacity, which can also lead to further reductions in emissions. The additional burden on airlines resulting from the gradual removal of the free allocation of CO2 emission allowances (EU ETS) to airlines should be offset, in so far as is possible, by more efficient air traffic control.  With regard to the recharging infrastructure, the standardisation of standards should be pursued rapidly in order to remove barriers within the common internal market. In Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 66 of 268  addition, recharging services should be included in the list of MOSS (Mini one stop shop) exemptions to facilitate the collection of VAT in other EU countries (VAT registration will no longer be required in the country in which roaming sales take place).  With regard to European driving school training, a new automatic transmission test should be introduced. Following this, drivers will simply be able to take a supplementary manual transmission test (in spite of having learnt to drive in an automatic or electric vehicle), and the driving licence would be issued without an entry prohibiting the holder from driving vehicles with manual t  Based on the evaluation of the European Battery Directive, which is currently under way, it should be assumed that account will be taken of the increasing importance of electromobility in an updated version of the Directive and that even greater attention will be paid to the environmentally sound recycling of batteries from electric vehicles, uniform battery labelling for clear identification at waste collection points and the reuse of batteries.  More also needs to be done to overcome the barriers to smooth cross-border rail transport. Measures must be taken across Europe in order to strengthen the position of the railways as the environmentally friendly backbone of mobility:  Upgrading of infrastructure: Austria is investing heavily in upgrading its national rail However, national measures can only be fully effective if all EU partner countries invest in upgrading the TEN network for passenger and goods transport.  Efficient cross-border operations: In order to strengthen the competitiveness of rail transport, European standards aimed at ensuring cross-border operations of greater efficiency must be implemented beyond the investment phase.  All Member States have been called upon to improve the framework conditions for a modal shift to rail. (see next bullet point)  On an EU-wide basis, it should be ensured that the railway network is financed in a sustainable manner by the Member States in accordance with current laws (in particular Directive 2012/34/EU), with particular attention being paid to the maintenance of the existing infrastructure.  A further boost to night train services could be provided in particular by optimising the economic framework conditions. Tax incentives and exemptions for international rail transport should be expanded at European level.  In addition, attractive high-speed rail connections must be established between the capital cities and major centres of the European Union, and regional rail connections must be safeguarded and expanded. All Member States have been called upon to improve the framework conditions for a modal shift of the transportation of goods and people from the roads to the electrified rails as a top priority. In addition, Europe-wide foundations (standardisation, range of vehicles) must be laid with a view to providing additional technological options for the decarbonisation of the cross-border transportation still being Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 67 of 268  undertaken by road (alternative renewable fuels; electrification systems).  In the aviation sector, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) should be implemented as far as possible within the scope of the existing emissions trading system (ETS) or as a complement thereto. The necessary changes will be made within the scope of the next amendment of the ETS. As part of this amendment, Austria should also adopt a stance that is in line with the climate goals in preparation for the upcoming negotiations at European level. In addition, the blending of alternative fuels should become mandatory in the aviation sector in the medium term.  Likewise, ambitious targets (e.g. towards zero emissions, climate resilient reliable infrastructure) and effective instruments need to be clearly anchored within the Waterway Transport Agenda for Europe (2021-  Further adjustments would also have to be made in connection with the Directive on the energy performance of buildings and the Directive on ecodesign requirements to ensure that the use of fossil fuels in new buildings is completely eliminated as soon as possible and that the climate-friendly refurbishment of existing buildings can be driven forward on the basis of common standards.    A European strategy on hydrogen  The Commission should push for the development of an internationally anchored European strategy on hydrogen that also takes account of the emerging and future global hydrogen trade.  The strategy should also set out increased funding opportunities for hydrogen, both   A funding window for hydrogen should be taken into consideration as part of the   should also focus more heavily on the use of hydrogen vehicles for specific use cases (heavy goods traffic, public transport, buses, trains) in parallel with the work being carried out to establish an Austrian strategy on hydrogen.   Gas package 2020  As an integral part of the Green Deal, the forthcoming proposal for a   Among other things, this should include a clear roadmap for the blending of renewable gases, together with uniform standards and a reliable system of guarantees of origin. The future role of network operators should also be discussed.  In this regard, consideration should be given to allowing network operators to operate electrolysis plants, provided they help to ensure the continued efficient and reliable operation of the network. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 68 of 268   In addition, the establishment of a European quota for the feed-in of renewable gases into the gas grid could also be investigated.  The framework conditions for the effective pricing of CO2 should also be set as uniformly as possible in the interests of competition. With this in mind, the following areas of action are specifically brought into the discussion:  Additional measures aimed at establishing more effective CO2 pricing for the aviation sector or at establishing a tax situation that is not distorted when compared with other modes of transport.  From an environmental and economic point of view, a CO2 price with a corresponding incentivising or steering effect is indispensable to achieving long-term development towards net zero emissions in an economically efficient manner. To this end, framework conditions should also be set at European level as quickly as possible to ensure that a uniform approach is also taken in sectors not covered by the EU emissions trading system. During the discussion on this, both fiscal instruments and an expansion of the existing emissions trading system can be considered.  Under the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement, greater account needs to be taken of the principle of cost transparency and the polluter pays principle, including in connection with EU foreign trade and customs policy. In order to avoid distortions of competition on the one hand and to ensure that CO2 prices are set in accordance with the polluter pays principle in as many areas of consumption as possible on the other hand, work on a WTO-compliant border adjustment mechanism (Carbon Border Adjustments = CO2 border tax on steel and cement, etc.) needs to progress rapidly. Such revenue can be transferred to the EU budget as own funds, as is the case with customs duties.  The regulatory and policy frameworks established in Union law play a central role in ensuring cost-effective compliance with the objectives set out in the NECP. In order to avoid counterproductive and therefore budget-intensive interactions between Union and national law, the Republic of Austria will, in future, endeavour, when drawing up the policy areas or instruments outlined in this Chapter  taking account of their effects on Austria as a business location  to make the most cost-effective contribution possible to the achievement of the objectives set out in the NECP.  In the context of the decisions and debates regarding the design and implementation of the EU's multiannual financial framework (MFF) from 2021 onwards, Austria supports the following priorities:  A decision for at least 25% of MFF spending from 2021 onwards to be used to achieve the climate objectives. In this context, it is also important to examine at national level how to ensure the most cost-effective contribution to the achievement of non-ETS objectives.  A Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) more closely aligned to the European climate targets and in particular greater focus of the CAP on (i) reducing nitrogen surpluses, (ii) Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 69 of 268  reducing emissions from livestock farming, (iii) increasing energy efficiency in agriculture, (iv) maintaining permanent grassland, (v) maintaining humus in arable land and (vi) preserving and managing forests in a sustainable manner.  Greater orientation of the rural development programme towards achieving climate objectives in a cost-effective manner.  Closer focus of EU cohesion policy on the switch to renewables, including the creation of   innovations in the area of low-emission and climate change-resistant technologies.  An EU-wide expansion of the charging infrastructure for electromobility (including by investEU, which will take over from the EFSI).  Promotion of the development of hydrogen-based fuel technology (e.g. within the scope of the corresponding windows under Horizon Europe and investEU).  Promotion of the automation and networking of sustainable mobility by means of the Digital Europe programme.  Introduction of a national contribution to the EU budget, calculated on the basis of the amount of non-recycled plastic packaging waste generated in each Member State Member States to reduce the amount of non-recycled plastic that they use.  CEF 2.0 is adequately funded in the EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027.
