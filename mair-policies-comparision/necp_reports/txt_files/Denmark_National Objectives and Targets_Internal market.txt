        65  2.4 Dimension Internal energy market 2.4.1 Electricity interconnectivity  The level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030 in consideration of the electricity interconnection target for 2030 of at least 15%, with a strategy with the level from 2021 onwards defined in close cooperation with affected Member States, taking into account the 2020 interconnection target of 10% and the following indicators of the urgency of action: 1) Price differential in the wholesale market exceeding an indicative  2) Nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30% of their peak load; 3) Nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30% of installed renewable generation. Each new interconnector shall be subject to a socioeconomic and environmental cost-benefit analysis and implemented only if the potential benefits outweigh the costs % ratio between import interconnection and net generation capacities of the country (i.e. the 2017 value is the ratio between simultaneous import interconnection capacity and net generating capacity in the country at 11 January 2017, 19:00 pm as resulted from ENTSO-E Winter Outlook 2016/2017).  Given the high current interconnectivity level, Denmark has no specific objectives for a certain level of interconnector capacity in 2030 and consequently no strategy for reaching wever, interconnectors are now crucial for the reliability of the Danish power system so potential new interconnectors are considered and evaluated in coordination with other Member States taking into account the overall socioeconomic value and value for the security of power supply. Currently a number of interconnectors or expansions of existing connections will be completed within a near foreseeable future  see section 2.4.2 Energy transmission infrastructure for more information.  The Danish Government has an ambition to reduce the overall national CO2-emission by 70% by 2030. This target is very ambitious and it should be expected that even greater capacity on interconnectors will be feasible in this context. So though Denmark has no official target for interconnector capacity in 2030, emphasis is definitely to make use of further integration with neighbouring countries when feasible.  In the assumptions defined by Government administration to be used by the TSO for analyses on development of the electricity and gas infrastructure numbers for 2030 shows the same level of interconnectivity as today. An import capacity of 10.2 GW compared to installed capacity of 20.0 GW equals an interconnectivity of 51.2%. Denmark thus has an expectation to uphold the high level of interconnectivity.          66  Denmark is involved in the NSEC work on concrete concepts for joint offshore projects or cluster projects (see section 1.4 for more information).  2.4.2 Energy transmission infrastructure (i) Key  electricity and gas transmission infrastructure projects, and where relevant, modernisation projects, that are necessary for the achievement of objectives and targets under the five dimensions of the Energy Union Strategy There are no specific projects necessary for a certain interconnectivity target. However, 5 projects are currently on the list of Projects of Common Interest, based on their positive socio-economic value and are about to be established.   Viking Link  Interconnector between Denmark and UK. Expected completion 2023.  Endrup  Niebüll  Interconnector between Denmark and Germany. Expected completion 2023.  Kassø  Audorf  Upgrading of existing interconnector between Denmark and Germany. Expected completion 2020.  Kriegers Flak Combined Grid Solution  Interconnector between Denmark and Germany which combines an interconnector with the grid connection of offshore wind farms.  Expected completion end of 2019.   Baltic Pipe  Gas interconnector between Denmark and Poland. Expected completion 2022. Four of the listed projects are electricity interconnectors and will increase the level of interconnectivity with neighbouring countries.  With regards to gas infrastructure, the Danish TSO, Energinet, and the Polish TSO, Gaz-System, have in 2018 taken the final investment decision to establish the Baltic Pipe Project. The project will make it possible to transport up to 10 BCM Norwegian gas to Poland through the Danish gas infrastructure and connect the Danish and Polish gas markets.  Significant transit activity is expected to increase gas volume transported via the Danish gas network, which can be used to lower the tariffs for current users of the Danish transmission network.  Tariff reductions are considered to represent the main socioeconomic benfit in the Danish system, eventhough the degree of tariff reductions depends on the methodology of structuring tariffs in the Danish system after  implementation.  In October 2013, The Baltic Pipe was granted the status of Project of Common Interest (PCI) by the European Commission under the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP). The project was also included on the subsequent PCI lists, and the PCI status highlights the significance and regional dimension of the Baltic Pipe Project in the Baltic and CEE region and indicates the importance of its implementation. A key initiative for the implementation of the Baltic Pipe Project was a Feasibility Study concluded in 2016, which included a technical, financial and socio-economic analysis of the project. The study was partly funded by the EU under the CEF scheme.         67  All above electricity and gas infrastructure projects are important in terms of fulfilling the dimensions of the Energy Union such as a fully-integrated internal energy market with security, solidarity and trust. The majority of projects are based upon the need to ensure well-functioning energy markets, while the need for a number of projects is also based upon the need for security of supply.     The contribution to security of supply from biogas has historically been low, as the share in the natural gas grid has been limited, and as there are ample opportunities for natural gas supplies from the North Sea and Germany.  The contribution of biogas to security of supply is becoming more significant. Production of upgraded biogas has increased to above 11% of the  gas consumption,  with an expected increase to about 15% in 2020 and 30 % in 2025. In the first year during the redevelopment of the Tyra complex, biogas will make a significant contribution to security of gas supply on the Danish and Swedish gas markets.  In line with the establishment of more biogas plants connected to the distribution grid, there will be cases in which biogas production exceeds local gas consumption, for example in the summer when gas consumption is generally low. In some cases, this is handled by connecting distribution grids, while, in other cases, there is a need to be able to return gas to the transmission grid to supply a larger area. This means a completely new way of operating the gas system, as excess gas in the distribution system must be compressed into high pressure (from 40 to 80 bar) in order to be transported in the transmission system.  Today, the Danish TSO has established biogas injection points at two M/R stations. It is expected that there will be a need to inject gas back into the transmission grid at another three M/R stations in 2020.  Upgraded biogas injected into the gas system contains a higher level of oxygen relative to natural gas. Oxygen is a byproduct of sulphur removal in the biogas upgrading process. The allowed oxygen content in the gas is regulated primarily in national rules and standards, and as a consequence may vary between countries. In Denmark, the oxygen content in biogas injected into the gas grid must not exceed 0.5%. In Germany, the oxygen content depends on the gas pressure and if there is oxygen sensitive installation connected to the gas grid, such as gas storage facilities, where oxygen potentially can increase the risk of corrosion in gas installations with water. Today, where the amount of biogas injected into the gas system is increasing, different requirements to the oxygen content is a challenge for gas exported to Germany, where the storage facilities in Northern Germany do not accept gas with an oxygen content above 0.001% (10 ppm). Due to the expected injection of biogas into the transmission system, it will be difficult to meet the German requirements for the oxygen content of the exported gas, after commissioning of the Tyra complex in 2022. The Danish TSO is working on a flexible European gas quality solution, together with European partners, which ensures the continued expansion of green gases without compromising the well-functioning internal gas markets in the EU. Concurrently, Energinet is looking into various operational solutions in a close dialogue with Danish stakeholders and the North German TSO, Gasunie Deutschland.          68  (ii) Where applicable, main infrastructure projects envisaged other than Projects of Common Interest (PCIs). The Nordic TSOs published a Nordic Grid Development Plan in august 2019 which includes an early assesment of five  cross-border investments in the Nordics. Corridors between Western Denmark and Norway as well as Eastern Denmark and Sweden are under investigation. In both cases some of the interconnectors are about to reach the end of their expected lifetime and decisions about reinvestments have to be made. Preliminary studies on reinvestment in the Skagerrak connection and the connections to Sweden (Kontiskan and Øresund) are reported in the joint Nordic Grid Development Plan 2019. Uncertainties in the business case remain and should be clarified before any final decision for reinvestment in the interconnectors can be taken.  The North Sea Wind Power Hub (NSWPH) project is currently a development project being -concept which could possibly connect offshore wind power production to a central offshore hub and then linking it to the European mainland using interconnectors. To this purpose the Danish Government have initiated a number of studies to explore the possibility of an energy island with a capacity of 10 GW off shore wind production before 2030. The North Sea Wind Power Hub project is a cooperation between the Danish TSO, Energinet, and the Dutch-German TSO, TenneT, along with its project partners The project promotors have applied for the project to become a PCI candidate. 2.4.3 Market integration (i) National objectives related to other aspects of the internal energy market such as increasing system flexibility in particular related to the promotion of competitively determined electricity prices in line with relevant sectoral law, market integration and coupling, aimed at increasing the tradeable capacity of existing interconnectors, smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, and real-time price signals, including a timeframe for when the objectives shall be met Market coupling in the wholesale day-ahead and intraday timeframe is well-advanced in Denmark. Since June 2018 all bidding zone borders are also coupled through the single intraday market coupling.  There is also a common Nordic market for manual Frequency Restoration Reserves (mFRR). Denmark continuously works on developing markets for ancillary services. These markets are partly integrated with neighbouring countries or are in the process hereof, as part of the implementation of the electricity balancing guideline and the corresponding timeframe.          69  The Nordic TSOs are currently developing a new Nordic Balancing Model. The scope of the model is a common Nordic capacity market for aFRRs and mFRRs, and the implementation of 15 minute imbalance settlement period. 19 Denmark also works on developing an improved regulatory framework for the future electricity market, based on renewable energy sources in a cost-efficient way, a new market model. This is a specific initiative in the Energy Agreement of June 2018 agreed by all political parties in Parliament. Denmark pursues a market-driven approach to utilise the most cost-efficient and innovative solutions to the challenges posed by a system based largely on variable renewable production. In this regard, the new market model should provide for a level playing field that makes it possible to achieve a least-cost solution to maintain a secure system and establish an adequate level of flexibility. The aims of the new market model/framework (amongst others):   Increased competition in the electricity market and clear price signals for investments   identification and removal of possible price limits  definition of rights and responsibilities of new players that may create value and provide flexibility in the electricity market  an efficient market place adequately remunerating flexibility   defining the new role of DSOs acting as neutral market facilitators, i.e. demanding flexibility  ensuring the engagement of consumers to foster active participation in the electricity markets  for instance with local flexibility services. Those changes to the market model related to the implementation of the electricity market directive will be implemented by the end of 2020, while recommendations beyond that are expected to be presented by 2021 and implemented at a later stage.  Interconnector capacities and flows As an indicator for market integration the figures below present the weekly average available interconnection capacities and flow as a percentage of max NTC for the Danish interconnectors. Available capacity is given for all hours while the average flow is only given for hours with flow in the respective direction. The difference between flows and capacities also works as an indicator for congestion. A big difference indicates many hours without congestion, while a small difference indicates more congestion on average.                                                             19 For more information see https://consultations.entsoe.eu/markets/nbm-roadmap-consultation-1/supporting_documents/Report%20Nordic%20Balancing%20Model%20revised%20roadmap.pdf         70  Figure 14. DK1-DE: Weekly day ahead capcities and flows   Figure 15. DK1-NO2: Weekly day ahead capacities and flows           71  Figure 16. DK2-DE: Weekly day ahead capacities and flows  Figure 17. DK2-SE4: Weekly day ahead capacities and flows    From the above figures it can be seen that two interconnectors exhibit available transmission capacity close to or lower than the 70% threshold: DK1-DE, DK2-SE4. Denmark has been in dialogue with both neighbouring countries with the objective to increase capacities and market integration. Below is a description of their situation and outlook. DK1-DE: The export available capacity from DK1 toward DE has been reduced for years due to maintenance and network constraints in the German grid.  In December 2018 the European Commission published the Commission decision (Case AT.40461  DE/DK         72  Interconnector) accepting Tennets proposed commitments of a minimum hourly capacity of 1300MW in the southbound direction. The commitment was to be phased in over a period of six months. Data from July 2019 shows a monthly average of available capacity of 1304 MW or 73% of max NTC.      DK2-SE4: export capacity from Eastern Denmark to SE4 has been reduced in recent years, mainly due to constraints at the West Coast Corridor (WCC) in Sweden. At a workshop in Copenhagen in June 2019 Svenska Kraftnät (SvK)  presented background and mitigating action to address challenges with WCC. SVK indicated that within a few years the problem with WCC will be reduced, due to decommissioning of the Ringhals power plant, flow-based capacity calculation, and infrastructure developments. SvK will also start a countertrading pilot to possibly mitigate the problem starting from 17 June 2019.  SvK will be in discussion with the Commission on WCC commitment expiration.20 (ii) Where applicable, national objectives related to the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets including a timeframe for when the objectives should be met The Danish electricity market is open for participation from renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation. The Danish TSO is by law required to contribute with its activities to the best possible conditions for competition in the electricity market.  Renewable energy producers (except for household-scale plants) are obliged to sell their production into the market via balancing responsible parties. The ancillary services markets are open to participation from renewable energy as well. Many wind power plants, for example, offer downward regulation into the market. Denmark foresees an increasingly important role for demand-side resources in contributing to an integrated, market-based and flexible energy system. A large number of electrical boilers are already installed and may offer their service in all markets from spot to primary reserves. To encourage the participation of aggregated demand response, Denmark is constantly seeking to improve market regulations with the aim to reduce barriers for decentralised market participants. To that end Denmark is currently developing an aggregator model allowing decentralised resources to participate in energy and ancillary services markets alongside large market participants.  With increasing shares of decentralised production and new consumption due to the electrification of heating and transport the Danish grids will become challenged on a more                                                            20 For more information see http://www.nordicenergyregulators.org/wpcontent/uploads/2019/04/Keytakeaways.pdf         73  local scale. It is goal that such local challenges shall be met primarily through market based arrangements in order to achieve the most cost-effective solutions.  In terms of the gas market, Denmark and Sweden have in 2019 merged the two national gas balancing markets to establish one common balancing market/zone for Denmark and Sweden  the so-called Joint Balancing Zone (JBZ).   JBZ means that a shipper who transports gas to Sweden no longer has to balance two systems, but shall only be in balance in one system and will no longer have to book capacity to flow gas between Denmark and Sweden. The project details (in terms of tariff structure, market functioning, contracts etc.) were approved by the two national regulatory authorities of Denmark (DUR) and Sweden (Ei) in March 2019.   It is expected that the joint balancing between Denmark and Sweden will contribute to increased security of supply and more gas traders on the balancing market and Danish gas exchange (balancing trading platform) which could lead to increased competition to end consumers. In addition, there will be system synergies and administration that is more efficient. JBZ is in line with the thinking of the European Gas Target Model (GTM) and overall harmonization objectives. (iii) Where applicable, national objectives with regard to ensuring that consumers participate in the energy system and benefit from self-generation and new technologies, including smart meters Denmark has an overall objective of rolling out smart meters to all consumers by 2020. In the future, this will enable consumers to participate in the energy markets through aggregation. The Energy Agreement of 2018 also underlines the objective to increase the utilisation of data and digital solutions and create a smart and flexible energy system. It is possible for consumers to self-generate electricity under defined rules for net metering. As such, however, self-generation is no particular objective for Denmark, as the goal is to provide consumers with an overall efficient and secure electricity system. The roll-out of smart metering to all consumers including those that self-generate electricity is supposed to add to the transparency of such activities and make the impact on the electricity system visible. In this way it will be possible to identify whether a self-generator produces benefits to the system and appropriate incentives can be put in place. (iv) National objectives with regard to ensuring electricity system adequacy, as well as for the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met  Denmark has one of the highest security of electricity supply levels in Europe. It is a clear ambition for the Government to keep a high level of security of supply also in the future when integrating more renewable energy into the Danish electricity system. As a consequence of the investments allocated to renewables in the Energy Agreement from 2018 the share of renewable energy in the electricity sector is expected to reach 100         74  percent in 2030. The specific targets for ensuring a high level of system adequacy while reaching the renewable energy share of 100 percent are described in section 2.3.  (v) Where applicable, national objectives to protect energy consumers and improve the competitiveness of the retail energy sector  In general, Denmark aims at highly competitive retail markets. The full roll-out of smart meters is expected to change the retail business over the coming years, and Denmark will closely monitor the development. Consumer protection and competitiveness of the retail sector are addressed in many policies and measures. Future developments within the electricity sector will clearly add to the complexity. As in many other sectors digitalisation will play an important role in electricity as well. The Danish Government wants to address f objectives that are highly relevant to electricity as well. Objectives of particular importance to the electricity sector are that it should become easier for consumers to make decisions; they should have easy access to their data enabling them to create value in the market; and consumer information requirements shall be targeted to prevent overloading consumers. retail electricity market and thus support consumers' active choice of an electricity product. The price survey provides an overview of the products offered in the retail and makes it possible to compare the prices of the products. Besides the price survey the Danish Utility Regulator publishes quarterly electricity price statistics providing insights into the average consumer price of electricity. In order to ensure strong competition for the benefit of Danish citizens and businesses, Denmark is conducting an analysis of whether competition in the retail market is well-functioning. A particular focus lies on the separation between monopoly and competetive activities within the vertically integrated companies. It is investigated whether bundled grid companies challenge competition in the retail electricity market and whether appropriate measures can be identified to strengthen competition in the retail market and to enhance the separation of monopoly and competitive activities.  The level of competition in recent years has been relatively stable. The rate of customers changing to a new supplier typically lies at around 5% for small customers and 7% for large customers. At the same time, margins especially in the small customer segment lie at a low level indicating competitive pressure on retail prices. An overall evaluation of the retail market is planned for 2022. 2.4.4 Energy Poverty Denmark generally considers energy poverty as a social issue and consequently addresses energy poverty through social policy. Therefore, in the Danish energy policy no specific national objectives exist for the limitation of energy poverty. However, see section 3.4.3(iv) for social policy instruments related to energy consumption.         75  Hence, referring to Article 3.3., second subparagraph of (d) of the Governance Regulation, Denmark does not possess verifiable data supporting that a significant number of households live in energy poverty. Eurostat, however, using data from the EU-SILC survey, assesses how many people express . For Denmark, 3% of respondents express this (in 2018). This number is considerably lower than the EU-28 average of 7.4% and similar to numbers for neighbouring countries Sweden and Germany. In the context of the Electricity Directive Denmark intends to consider vulnerable customers further.
