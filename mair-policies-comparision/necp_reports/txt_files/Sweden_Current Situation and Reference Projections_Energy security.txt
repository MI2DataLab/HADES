4.4 Energy Security dimension  4.4.1 Current energy mix, domestic energy sources, import dependency, including relevant risks The energy mix in Sweden is dominated by biofuels, crude oil and petroleum products, nuclear fuel and hydroelectric power. Significant domestic energy carriers are hydroelectric power, biofuels, wind power and absorbed heat from heat pumps244. Biofuels accounted for 24% of input energy in 2017245. Trends in total energy input between 2005 and 2017 are shown in Figure 30.  However, a large proportion of energy input is dependent on imports, for example nuclear fuel and fossil fuels, such as natural gas and oil, with the latter energy carrier being widely used in the transport sector. In total, fossil fuels accounted for 27% of input energy in 2017. The energy self-sufficiency ratio, defined as the ratio between domestic energy and total input energy, has increased slightly in recent years, reaching 44% in 2017.                                                                  244  245 Excludes net imports. 145 (199) Figure 30 Total energy input per energy carrier, TWh, 2005-2017.

Electricity production in Sweden is primarily based on hydroelectric power and nuclear power, which accounted for 40% and 39%, respectively, of total electricity production in 2017. The wind power expansion continues, accounting for 11% of total electricity production in 2017. The consumption of biofuels for electricity and heat production is also increasing.  4.4.2 Development forecasts based on existing instruments and measures until at least 2040 (including 2030) Figure 31 shows total input, broken down by energy carrier, for the period 2016 to 2040 in the EU baseline scenario. Input energy decreases from 2035. This is based on the assumption that the process to phaseout the remaining nuclear power reactors will begin and nuclear fuel use thus decreases over time.

Note: Net imports of electricity are excluded.  The scenario involves an expansion of renewable electricity production and a phasing-out of existing nuclear power. The scenario is based on the closure of reactors 1 and 2 of the Ringhals nuclear power plant in 2020 and 2019, on information provided by the owners, that the remaining six reactors will be phased-out after 60 years of operation. However, nuclear power plants will continue to operate for as long as they are profitable and safety requirements are met, which may be either shorter or longer than the expected 60 years. It is expected that approx. 60% of nuclear power will have been phased-out by around 2040, with 25 TWh remaining in the electricity system. The wind power expansion is driven by higher electricity prices from 2030 onwards, amounting to 54 TWh in 2040. Electricity production from solar cells amounts to almost 8 TWh in 2040.  The consumption of biofuels increases over time. The largest increase in biofuels in absolute terms occurs in relation to electricity and heat production in district heating networks, although there are also significant increases in domestic transport and industry. The consumption of oil decreases over time and is primarily driven by developments within the transport sector, where increased electrification and efficiency measures 147 (199) reduce the demand for vehicles and ships powered by fossil fuels. The electricity balance is strengthened continuously up to 2035, when net exports account for 35 TWh. This is primarily due to an increase in wind power generation accompanied by relatively weak growth in electricity demand. During the period 2035-2040, however, the electricity balance weakens and net exports fall to 33 TWh in 2040. This is mainly attributable to the fact that the expansion of wind power and, to a certain extent, solar power cannot compensate for the loss of electricity production resulting from a partial phasing-out of nuclear capacity.  The phasing-out of nuclear power, with additional electricity production being primarily generated by wind and solar power, poses a challenge for the stability of the electricity system and thus increases the risk of disruption if no action is taken. This is due to the fact that system inertia246 decreases as a result of the phasing-out of nuclear power, while additional electricity production, primarily from wind and solar power, does not naturally contribute to system inertia.  Reduced reactive power247 as a consequence of the phasing-out of nuclear power has additional significance when it comes to the possibility of transferring electricity between different electricity price areas. The aforementioned change to the power system also poses the risk that the power balance will weaken over time, resulting in an increased risk of rising costs and higher prices. This is due to the fact that wind power is unpredictable and there is an increased need for balancing resources in the system.  Analyses of future power adequacy Svenska kraftnät (the government agency responsible for the national grid) - and long-term future power adequacy. There are two different methods for evaluating power adequacy.  The statistical method compares expected available domestic production against expected electricity consumption during winter periods with the highest electricity consumption. This is known as a power balance and is carried out in respect of a normal one-year winter, a 10-year winter (a cold winter that recurs, on average, once every ten years) and a 20-year winter.  If power adequacy is evaluated using the dynamic method (also known as                                                       246 The nominal frequency in the Nordic synchronous power system is 50 Hz. Imbalances occur momentarily and cause the frequency to deviate from 50 Hz. Active power balancing, which is able to counteract such imbalances, is subject to a short delay. Therefore, a certain degree of spinning mass in the system is required to be able to counteract rapid changes in frequency. The spinning mass of the rotating parts (generators) creates inertia and gives n extra time in which to act. The more system inertia, the slower the frequency change of a given disruption. 247 Reactive power is generated when there is a phase shift between current and voltage. Reactive power reduces the possibilities to transmit active power into the grid, which is considered to be the type of power that carries out useful work when consumed by the load. 148 (199) the probabilistic method), the entire electricity system is simulated as part of an electricity market model with connections between electricity price areas (and countries) and consumption and production units. The model simulates a large number of years of weather, during which wind, water and consumption levels, etc., vary. This method thus takes account of the import/export capacity between electricity price areas, both domestic and international production resources, and forced outages in terms of both production and interconnectors.  Using the statistical method, Svenska kraftnät considers that the 2020 power balance amounts to -2 100 MW during a normal one-year winter and -3 700 MW during a 20-year winter248. A negative power balance means that electricity consumption during winter periods with the highest electricity consumption exceeds expected available domestic production. Therefore, this illustrates the need for imports during periods with the highest electricity consumption. A short-term weakening of the power balance is primarily due to the fact that Ringhals reactor 2 was decommissioned in 2019 and Ringhals reactor 1 is scheduled to be decommissioned during 2020.  Svenska kraftnät also evaluated power adequacy using the dynamic method249. When production and imports do not adequately cover the load, a power shortage occurs. This is referred to as Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE) and Expected Energy Not Served (EENS). LOLE is measured in number of hours per year, while EENS is measured in number of MWh per year. Overall, the simulations show a higher risk of power shortages after 2030. However, it should be noted that the risk is assessed as remaining at a low level. In the reference scenario for 2040 used by Svenska kraftnät, LOLE amounts to 0.19 hours per year on average, while EENS amounts to 69.3 MWh per year. It should be noted, however, that there is a great deal of variation.Some winter periods see no problems at all, while the risk of power shortages may be significantly higher during years with cold winters and during years in which an unusually large number of problems arise with regard to interconnectors or production. However, it should be noted in this respect that the model has included a great deal of consumption flexibility and storage on the continent. If this flexibility should fail to be realised, the simulated power shortages would increase.  In the event that nuclear power is phased-out and replaced with weather-dependent, unpredictable electricity production, for example from wind and solar power, it will be necessary to implement measures in the form of increased demand flexibility, energy storage and fast-balancing electricity production capacity in order for such an electricity system to                                                       248 Svenska kraftnät  Long-term market analysis 2018 (Ref.
