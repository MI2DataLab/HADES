 and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 37   2.2. Energy efficiency dimension Regarding compatibility with the GHG reduction target mentioned in Section 2.1.1, Luxembourg is aiming for a reduction of final energy demand of between 40% and 44% by 2030 compared to the EU PRIMES baseline (2007).  With regard to achieving the goal, which in the illustration below is 44%, a distinction is made in particular between the following areas, based on the assumed intensification of existing policy instruments and the introduction of new ones:  level of ambition in the building stock, both for new construction and energy renovation  renovation rate and depth of renovations implemented,  efficiency in industry and SMEs,  the extent to which transit and cross-border commuting are addressed,  the development of electromobility in existing vehicles. The key target figures of the target scenario, based on the upper range value of 44%, are presented in Table 3.  The sum of the annual final energy savings of all sectors (private households, trade, commerce and services, industry and transport) compared to the corresponding final energy demand in the reference scenario in the period 2021 to 2030 is shown in Figure 1. In 2030, the final energy savings achieved by all sectors through the implemented measures amount to approximately 14.5 TWh, resulting in a final energy consumption of 35,568 GWh compared to the final energy consumption of 50.5 TWh in the reference scenario. The final energy demand of 35,568 GWh in 2030 (see Table 3), corresponds to a 44% reduction in final energy demand according to EU PRIMES 2007.     and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 38   Table 3 : Key target figures of the target scenario in the area of energy efficiency based on the upper range value of 44% Target scenario 44% efficiency (EFF44) Efficiency target 2030 (versus EU PRIMES in 2030) -44% Final energy demand [GWh] 35,568 Total -30% Households -40% Tertiary -24% Industry -17% Road transport  -38% Road fuels (excluding electricity for e-mobility) -41% Renovation rate 2020-20308 2.7% Depth of renovation  (average reduction in heat requirement after full renovation) 72% E-mobility: Share of electric cars/plug-in hybrids in existing vehicles 2030 (residents) 49% Source: own calculations 2019                                                             8 Based on the additional renovations compared to the baseline scenario. The renovation rate expresses the proportion of buildings renovated per year in relation to the old building stock (buildings built before 1991).  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 39    Source:  own calculations 2019 Figure 1: Annual final energy savings in GWh in private households, the trade, commerce and services sector, industry and the transport sector in Luxembourg (based on an energy efficiency target of 44%)  The cumulative final energy savings of all sectors (private households, trade, commerce and services, industry and transport) in the period 2021 to 2030 amount to a good 97.3 TWh if the planned energy efficiency measures are implemented (see Figure 2).  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 40    Source:  own calculations 2019 Figure 2 :  Cumulative final energy savings over the period 2021 to 2030 in GWh in private households, the trade, commerce and services sector, industry and the transport sector in Luxembourg (based on an energy efficiency target of 44%)  The sum of the annual final energy savings of residential and non-residential buildings in Luxembourg compared to the corresponding final energy demand in the reference scenario in the period 2021 to 2030 is shown in Figure 3. In 2030, the final energy savings achieved by the planned measures in residential and non-residential buildings amount to approximately 4 TWh (see Figure 3).  The cumulative energy efficiency renovation of residential and non-residential buildings in Luxembourg over the period from 2021 to 2030, at just under 28.6 TWh, contributes to the final energy savings in all sectors (see Figure 4). The biggest final energy savings are achieved by the renovation of private dwellings, followed by the renovation of office and public buildings and the renovation of other buildings (see Figure 4). This is explained by the fact that even in Luxembourg, despite the importance of the financial centre, there are considerably more square metres of residential than office buildings.   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 41    GWh GWh Wohngebäude Residential buildings Bürogebäude Office buildings Öffentliche Gebäude Public buildings Sonstige Gebäude Other buildings Source: own calculations 2019 Figure 3 :  Annual final energy savings in GWh from the renovation of all residential and non-residential buildings in Luxembourg (based on an energy efficiency target of 44%)  GWh GWh Wohngebäude Residential buildings Bürogebäude Office buildings Öffentliche Gebäude Public buildings Sonstige Gebäude Other buildings  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 42   Source:  own calculations 2019 Figure 4 :  Cumulative final energy savings over the period 2021 to 2030 in GWh from the renovation of all residential and non-residential buildings in Luxembourg (based on an energy efficiency target of 44%) In Figure 5, the development of the final energy savings that will be achieved through the renovation of public buildings in Luxembourg by 2030 is once more presented separately by way of example. The public sector will serve as an example and will be the starting point for the development of a large energy efficiency market in Luxembourg. Over this period, the annual final energy savings will grow gradually from 169 GWh (2021) to 274 GWh (2030), corresponding to a total increase in annual final energy savings of 105 GWh. The renovation of public buildings accounts for approximately 8% of the total final energy savings through energy efficiency renovations of buildings.

Over this period, the cumulative final energy savings from the renovation of public buildings will grow gradually from just under 169 GWh (2021) to just under 2.2 TWh (2030), corresponding to an increase in cumulative final energy savings of around 2 TWh.   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 43     Source:  own calculations 2019 Figure 6 :  Cumulative final energy savings over the period 2021 to 2030 in GWh from the renovation of public buildings in Luxembourg (based on an energy efficiency target of 44%)  As a result of the dynamic economy and population growth, new construction is more important than in other EU countries, in terms of both residential and purpose-built buildings. Therefore, in 2017, Luxembourg introduced a statutory energy standard for new buildings, roughly corresponding to the level required by the Passivhaus Standard. The interplay between building efficiency (roof, walls, windows, basement) and the phasing-out of fossil-fuel heating systems should help to make the building renovation strategy a success. This will be complemented by a fuel oil substitution programme and the establishment of low-temperature heating networks fed by waste heat from industry and renewable energy sources (deep geothermal energy, heat pumps, sustainable wood). The national building renovation strategy will be developed in cooperation with -will be discussed in detail and specific measures implemented. Due to the dynamic development of the housing market that is characteristic of Luxembourg, driven by high demographic growth and strong price increases, it should be mentioned at this point that the proportion of new buildings resulting from the demolition of existing buildings is not insignificant, as this  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 44   also makes it possible to steadily reduce the number of unrenovated existing buildings and achieve significant efficiency improvements.  Further national long-term targets regarding the further development of energy efficiency in Luxembourg with Article 3(1) of the Energy Efficiency Directive, Luxembourg has set an energy efficiency target of 49,292 GWh for 2020 (NEEAP 2017). In order to achieve this energy efficiency target, measures will inevitably be needed in all sectors.
