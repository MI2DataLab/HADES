 III. Policies and measures - Dimension Energy efficiency 83  3.2. Energy efficiency Planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency target for 2030 as well as other objectives presented in 2.2, including planned measures and instruments (also of financial nature) to promote the energy performance of buildings, in particular as regards the following: a) Energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative measures in accordance with Articles 7a and 7b of Directive 2012/27/EU, as amended by Directive 2018/2002 Responsible/involved parties*: MAP, URE * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. 1. Energy efficiency obligation scheme referred to in Article 7a of Directive 2012/27/EU: Article 7a of Directive 2012/27/EU provides that Member States may decide to fulfill their obligations to achieve the amount of energy savings required under Article 7(1) of the Directive by means of an energy efficiency obligation scheme. Under the energy efficiency obligation scheme, Member States are required to ensure that the obligation to achieve end-use energy savings by obliged entities, i.e. energy distributors or retail energy sales companies operating on their territory, is met. The Scheme is expected to remain in effect until 2030, i.e. over the next 10 years, with the annual energy savings it produces averaging 445 ktoe over the timespan. The cumulative final energy savings will be around 55 x 445 = 24 500 ktoe, which represents 80% of the total energy savings required, namely 30 635 ktoe. In Poland, the energy efficiency obligation scheme was created by the statutory imposition of an obligation on obliged entities from 1 January 2013. Currently, the scheme is governed by the Energy Efficiency Act of 20 May 2016. A mechanism stimulating pro-savings behaviour is expected to be in place in the period 2021-2030. Its shape and form will depend on decisions concerning energy efficiency regulations, in particular in the context of the implementation of the new Energy Efficiency Directive adopted in 2018. following entities:  energy companies which carry out economic activity in the field of generation or trade in electricity, heat or natural gas, and which sell electricity, heat or natural gas to final consumers connected to the network,  connected end consumers which are members of an exchange within the meaning of the Commodity Exchanges Act of 26 October 2000 or members of a regulated market by virtue of transactions they make on a commodity exchange or a regulated market on their own behalf,  commodity brokerage houses or brokerage houses, for transactions made on a commodity exchange or on a regulated market at the request of final consumers connected to the network. Pursuant to Article 30(1) of the Energy Efficiency Act, energy efficiency certificates incorporate alienable property rights which represent a tradable commodity within the meaning of the Commodity Exchanges Act of 26 October 2000, which means that they can be traded in. Entities which are required by the Act to acquire energy efficiency certificates, but fail to do so and do not redeem or do not complete energy efficiency projects at a final consumer, as documented by an energy audit, must pay a substitition fee as per the Act. Under the energy efficiency obligation scheme, obliged entities are required to obtain and submit for redemption for each subsequent          III. Policies and measures - Dimension Energy efficiency 84  year specific amounts of final energy, as defined by the Act. Energy efficiency certificates can only be obtained for the types of projects specified in Article 19(1) of the Act. Pursuant to the Energy Efficiency Act, the President of the Energy Regulatory Office issues certificates at the request from the entity where the energy efficiency project is to be delivered; or from an entity it has authorised. A list of all activities/projects eligible under the energy efficiency obligation scheme notified by Poland has been published by the minister competent for energy by a notice, which is available in the Monitor Polski Official Gazette of the Republic of Poland. An energy efficiency certificate issued under the Scheme confirms the declared energy savings derived from the implementation of the respective energy efficiency project. An energy efficiency certificate may be obtained for an action resulting in annual final energy saving of no less than 10 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) or for a set of actions of the same type whose aggregate effect exceeds 10 toe. The white certificate scheme supports the implementation of investment projects such as: insulation of industrial installations; redevelopment or renovation of a building along with technical systems and equipment; modernisation or replacement of lighting systems, equipment and systems used in industrial processes or in energy, telecommunications or information technology processes, local heating networks and local heat sources. Completing an energy efficiency audit for a given project is a condition for obtaining a certificate. The audit document is submitted to the President of the Energy Regulatory Office by the entity notifying the energy efficiency improvement project. The energy efficiency obligation scheme does not include measures addressed to households affected by energy poverty, nor does it take into account the share of energy savings to be achieved by households pursuant to Article 7(11). It has been decided that the need to mitigate energy poverty should be addressed through alternative policy measures by incorporating social issues in thermomodernisation and renovation support schemes. With regard to the possibility provided for by Article 7a(6)(a), it should be highlighted that obliged entities may count certified energy savings achieved by third parties towards their obligations, but this does not mean that the latter are required to achieve energy savings on behalf of obliged entities. Energy efficiency certificates are issued at the request from the entity where the energy efficiency project is to be delivered or from an entity it has authorised. The entities operate on an entities to fulfill their commitment through other state-accredited parties. In accordance with the Energy Efficiency Act, the property rights arising under the certificates are alienable and are considered commodities tradable on a commodity exchange or a regulated market. Therefore, obliged entities may buy these property rights on the market and submit them for redemption to the President of the Energy Regulatory Office in order to credit them against their obligations. In accordance with section 4.1 of Commission guidelines, under Article7a(6)(b) of Directive obligated parties to count savings obtained in a given year as if they had been obtained in any of the four previous or three following years. It should be noted that this flexibility:  applies only for energy savings stemming from EEOSs implemented since 1 January 2014 and not for alternative policy measures; and   III. Policies and measures - Dimension Energy efficiency 85  within an obligation period, as referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 7(1)(a). The energy efficiency obligation scheme operating in Poland meets all the conditions for resorting to this derogation set out in Article 7(8) of Directive 2012/27/EU. Therefore banking and borrowing can be used in Poland, but subject to a time restriction, i.e., for the purposes of the first subparagraph of Article 7(1)(a) of Directive 2012/27/EU  in particular, energy savings obtained after 2010, but before 1 January 2014, will be counted towards the 2014-2020 obligation. 2. Alternative measures referred to in Article 7b and Article 20(6) of Directive 2012/27/EU Directive 2012/27/EU no longer contains a list of alternative policy measures, but the definition of policy measure in Article 2(18) sets out a non-exhaustive list of the possible types of such measures, i.e. regulatory, financial, fiscal, voluntary or information provision instruments formally established and implemented in a Member State to create a supportive framework, requirement or incentive for market actors to provide and purchase energy services and to undertake other energy efficiency improvement measures. Following an analysis of the energy efficiency improvement instruments and measures in place in Poland, a selection of priority measures for the second obligation period was made to ensure that the final energy savings required by Article 7(1) of Directive 2012/27/EU are achieved by 2030. Accordingly, the following alternative policy measures are envisaged for the period 2021-2030: 1) Thermomodernisation and Renovation Fund; 2) Tax relief for expenditure on thermomodernisation of single-dwelling residential buildings; 3) Development of public transport in cities. THERMOMODERNISATION AND RENOVATION FUND  supports investments for improving energy efficiency of existing residential buildings. The key objective is to provide financial assistance to investors carrying out thermomodernisation or renovation projects of existing single-dwelling residential buildings using loans from commercial banks. Amendments are planned to the Act on supporting thermomodernisation and renovation to enable inclusion of local governments at the municipality level in the implementation of low-emission projects targeted at the energy poor in their territory, financed in part from the Thermomodernisation and Renovation Fund. The introduction of the above changes will make the Thermomodernisation and Renovation Fund a policy measure which takes into account actions targeted at households affected by energy poverty. Beneficiaries of State aid will include, in particular, persons who meet certain income and/or property criteria, i.e. State aid for thermomodernisation and renovation projects will also take into account social aspects, such as energy poverty. Name of measure Thermomodernisation and Renovation Fund Purpose The main objective of the Fund is to provide financial assistance to investors carrying out thermomodernisation and renovation projects.   Final energy savings Expected energy savings: 70 ktoe/year, a 10-year total of: 10 x 70 = 700 ktoe Implementation period 2021-2030 Implementing/supervisory authorities and bodies Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego/Minister for Development  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Energy efficiency 86  Beneficiaries A thermomodernisation bonus is available to owners and administrators of:  residential buildings;  collective accommodation buildings;  public buildings owned by local governments and occupied by them for public tasks;  local district heating networks;  local heat sources. The bonus is available to investors regardless of their legal status, i.e. legal persons (e.g. housing cooperatives and commercial companies), local governments, housing associations, and natural persons, including owners of single-dwelling houses. Budgetary entities and budgetary establishments are not eligible for the bonus. Description/eligible activities The specific rules on bonus-based co-funding are laid down by the Act of 21 November 2008 on supporting thermomodernisation and renovation. A thermomodernisation bonus is available for projects aimed at:  reducing the consumption of energy for heating and warm service water preparation in residential buildings, collective accommodation buildings, and buildings owned by local governments and occupied by them for the fulfilment of public tasks;  reducing the cost of obtaining heat delivered to the above buildings by connecting them to a centralised heat source in connection with the elimination of a local heat source;  reducing primary energy losses in local district heating networks and the local heat sources which supply them;  partial or full replacement of energy sources with renewable sources or using high-efficiency cogeneration, subject to energy consumption reduction requirements referred to in the Act.   THE THERMOMODERNISATION BONUS FOR SINGLE-DWELLING RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS takes the form of a tax relief aimed at creating an incentive for the thermal modernisation of single-dwelling residential buildings through the personal income tax. The current State budget support for thermomodernisation of residential buildings, consisting, amongst others, in granting a thermomodernisation bonus amounting to 20% of the loan taken out for a thermomodernisation project, has been insufficient to achieve the required effects in terms of energy efficiency improvements. For this reasons, State measures have been stepped up in Poland to improve air quality and energy efficiency of single-dwelling residential buildings through their thermomodernisation, i.e. a reduction of demand for thermal energy and the resulting reduction of  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Energy efficiency 87  pollution emissions from the process of burning fuels for heating. Name of measure Thermomodernisation bonus Purpose The main purpose is to create an incentive for the thermal modernisation of single-dwelling residential buildings through the personal income tax.   Final energy savings Expected average energy savings: 200 ktoe/year, a 10-year total of: 10 x 200 = 2,000 ktoe Implementation period 2021-2030 Implementing/supervisory authorities and bodies Minister for Finance/Minister for Development Beneficiaries The beneficiaries of the thermomodernisation bonus are personal income taxpayers paying the tax according to the tax scale, at a rate of 19% and as a lump-sum on recorded income, who are owners or co-owners of single-dwelling residential buildings, incurring expenses on thermomodernisation projects; however, taxpayers benefiting from other State aid for thermomodernisation projects, e.g. those who the expenditure financed by that subsidy (only the surplus is deducted). Description/eligible activities A detailed list of types of building materials, equipment and services related to the supported thermomodernisation projects is set out in the Regulation of the Minister for Investment and Development of 21 December 2018. The thermomodernisation bonus is granted in particular for the following building materials, equipment and services:  window and door joinery, including windows, roof windows with assembly systems, balcony doors, garage doors, non-opening transparent surfaces,  building materials comprised in heating, domestic hot water and electric heating systems,  heat pumps, solar collectors or photovoltaic cells with accessories,  installation of the above-listed materials and equipment,  start up and control of the heat source, flue gas analysis, hydraulic control and balancing of the system, removal of the solid fuel-fired heat source.   DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN CITIES  support for low-emission public transport in cities from the EU Cohesion Fund will be continued under the Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment 2021-2027.  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Energy efficiency 88  Name of measure Development of public transport in cities Purpose The main purpose of the Programme will be to develop and enhance the use of low-functional areas. Final energy savings Expected energy savings: 130 ktoe/year, a total of: 10 x 135 = 1,350 ktoe Implementation period 2021-2030 Implementing/supervisory authorities and bodies Centre for European Union Transport Projects (CUPT) / Minister for Funds and Regional Policy Beneficiaries The participation in the programme is open to:  local governments and their unions  province capital cities and their functional areas, as well as organisational entities and special purpose vehicles acting on their behalf;  managers of infrastructure used by urban transport;  public transport operators. Description/eligible activities The Programme covers infrastructure investments: adaptation, construction, reconstruction, extension of urban transport networks, including: - construction, reconstruction, and development of the track system along routes, and at terminuses, sidings, and depots; - construction of a metro line, - construction, reconstruction, and extension of tramway and trolleybus overhead line networks and traction substations; - reconstruction and development of roads for the purpose of introducing privileged traffic or privileging existing traffic of public transport vehicles, - providing roads, streets, and tracks with engineering structures and necessary road facilities/ purchase of necessary equipment to ensure traffic safety of public transport vehicles; - providing roads and streets with infrastructure serving public transport (e.g. lay-byes, ramps, exit roads) and passengers (e.g. stops, islands); - construction, reconstruction and development of transport  - construction of Personal Rapid Transport (PRT) systems. Rolling stock investments: purchase, upgrading of rolling stock (trams, metro) and trolleybus and bus fleets, including infrastructure necessary for their maintenance (e.g. technical facilities for rolling stock and fleet servicing and maintenance, including the necessary    III. Policies and measures - Dimension Energy efficiency 89  specialist equipment, and refuelling stations and equipment for alternative fuel). b) Long-term renovation strategy to support the renovation of the national stock of residential and commercial buildings (public and private)17, including policies, measures and actions to stimulate thorough and cost-effective renovations, as well as policies and actions targeting the national building stock with the poorest energy performance, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU; Responsible/involved parties*: MI, MR, MFiPR * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. 1. Improvement of housing conditions, technical condition of housing stock and enhancement of energy efficiency This measure will comprise support for thermal upgrading and renovation investment projects, including broader ones undertaken as part of revitalisation of degraded areas. These instruments envisage in particular financial support for renovation and thermal upgrading investment projects, both using national and European Union funds, the implementation of instruments supporting the processes of revitalisation of degraded areas and a review of regulations concerning technical parameters affecting energy efficiency in residential buildings. The long-term renovation targets for the national stock of residential buildings have been specified by the Government of the Republic of Poland in the National Housing Plan. Activities related to the renovation of the national stock of residential and commercial buildings (public and private), including policies, measures and actions to stimulate thorough and cost-effective renovations, as well as policies and actions targeting the national building stock with the poorest energy performance, will be specified in the building renovation strategy, which is currently being developed and which, in accordance with the amended Directive 2010/31/EU, is to be submitted to the Commission in 2020.  2. Promoting low-energy buildings, including at the design, construction and redevelopment stages, in a manner ensuring their energy efficiency, and improvement of the availability of renewable energy in new and existing buildings The national plan to increase the number of low-energy buildings defines measures to be undertaken by the government administration authorities to promote low-energy buildings, including at the design, construction and redevelopment stages, in a manner ensuring their energy efficiency, and to improve availability of renewable energy in new and existing buildings, as well as specifies the time schedule for achieving the targets. Pursuant to Article 9(3)b of Directive 2010/31/EU, the National Plan sets out, among others, indirect targets aimed at improving the energy performance of new buildings for 2015, as a way forward towards the achievement of the following assumptions: - all new buildings are to be nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2020, and - new buildings occupied and owned by public authorities are to be nearly zero-energy buildings after 31 December 2018. c) Description of policy and measures to promote energy services in the public sector and measures to remove regulatory and non-regulatory barriers that impede the increase in the number of energy efficiency contracts and other energy efficiency service models18; Responsible/involved parties*: 1. The Act on energy efficiency of 20 May 2016 (Journal of Laws 2016, item 831, as amended) defines the energy efficiency duties of public sector units. Public sector units are to carry out their duties by applying at least one of the following measures to improve energy efficiency: - implementing and funding projects aimed at improving energy efficiency; - purchasing devices, installations or vehicles with low energy use or low operating costs; - replacing or upgrading the used devices, installations or vehicles; - implementing thermal upgrading projects within the meaning of the Act on supporting  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Energy efficiency 90  MAP, MI, MFiPR, MR * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. thermomodernisation and renovation of 21 November 2008 (Journal of Laws 2014, item 712; 2016, item 615); - implementing the eco-management system referred to in Article 2(13) of the Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), repealing Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 and Commission Decisions 2001/681/EC and 2006/193/EC (OJ EU L 342 22.12.2009, p. 1, as amended), confirmed by an entry in the EMAS register referred to in Article 5.1 of the Act on the national eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) of 15 July 2011 (Journal of Laws, item 1060). Additionally, at the national government level, the minister responsible for energy, the minister responsible for transport and the minister responsible for construction, spatial planning and development and housing are to: 1) organise campaigns promoting the use of measures to improve energy efficiency, including the introduction of innovative technologies; 2) conduct information and educational campaigns to raise awareness of the available energy efficiency improvement measures. Furthermore, Article 7 of the Act on energy efficiency expressly allows energy efficiency contracting by public sector units. The act stipulates that an energy efficiency contract is a contract that specifies, in particular, possible energy savings to be achieved as a result of carrying out a project or projects of the same type aimed at improving energy efficiency with the use of an energy efficiency improvement measure, as well as defines the method of determining the fee, the amount of which is to depend on the energy savings achieved as a result of carrying out those projects.   d) Other planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contribution targets for 2030, as well as other objectives presented in 2.2 (for example measures to promote the exemplary role of energy-efficient public buildings and public procurement, measures to promote energy audits and energy management systems19, consumer information and training measures20 and other measures to promote energy efficiency21); Responsible/involved parties*: MAP, MI, MFiPR, MR, MRiRW * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. 1. Introduction of a new support mechanism for high-efficiency cogeneration and systemic changes in the heating sector The Act of 14 December 2018 on the promotion of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration (Journal of Laws 2019, items 42 and 412), together with its implementing acts, introduced a new support mechanism for electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration, the aim of which is both to stimulate the construction of new cogeneration units (it is expected that units with a total capacity of 5.1 GWe will receive support by 2028) and to continue the generation of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration in existing units which would not be able to operate without support due to a financial gap in operating costs. The implementation of the new mechanism is mainly motivated by the necessity to improve air quality in cities, which can be achieved through the development of district heating from the least carbon-intensive sources. In view of the above, support for all electricity generated in high-efficiency cogeneration that has been fed into the grid and sold will concern cogeneration units that supply, at a minimum, 70% of useful heat from cogeneration to the public district heating network. Where less than 70% of generated heat is fed into the grid, support will be granted proportionally to the share of heat fed to the grid in the total amount of heat generated. Moreover, support will only be available to units whose carbon dioxide emission factor (EPS) is not higher than 450 kg/MWh of energy generated (electricity and heat combined). The proposed support system will be largely dedicated to the construction of cogeneration units   III. Policies and measures - Dimension Energy efficiency 91  with an installed capacity of up to 50 MWe. However, support for larger units (above 50 MWe) is also envisaged under the mechanism, including due to the need to replace older sources supplying large heating systems (to be decommissioned, e.g. upon cessation of the district heating derogation under the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED)) with newer ones with lower emission levels of CO2, SOx, NOx, dust and other substances. 2. Promotion of the use of high-efficiency alternative energy and heat supply systems for buildings Pursuant to the Regulation of the Minister for Transport, Construction and Maritime Economy of 25 April 2012 regarding the detailed scope and form of a building permit design (Journal of Laws, item 462, as amended), the technical description of an architectural and construction design should contain an analysis of the possibilities of using high-efficiency alternative energy and heat supply systems. They include renewable energy-based decentralised energy supply systems, cogeneration, local or block heating or cooling, in particular if it is based, whether entirely or partly, on renewable energy sources, and heat pumps. The use of these systems should be considered at the stage of preparing a building permit design. The above-mentioned regulations are aimed at promoting alternative solutions where economically, technically and environmentally justified. The above requirement corresponds to the technical and construction requirements concerning energy efficiency of newly designed buildings, specified in the Regulation of the Minister for Infrastructure of 12 April 2002 regarding the technical conditions to be met by buildings and their location (Journal of Laws 2015, item 1422, as amended). The requirements have been formulated using the indicator specifying the annual calculated demand for non-renewable primary energy in a manner that should stimulate the use of renewable energy sources where technically justified. The aforementioned regulation and related National Plan aimed at increasing the number of low-energy buildings provide for a time schedule for meeting targets concerning the promotion of low-energy buildings, including at the design, construction and redevelopment stages, in a manner ensuring their energy efficiency and the improvement of the availability of renewable energy in new and existing buildings.   3. Improving energy efficiency in the transport sector  measures in this area are consistent with those related to reducing emissions from the transport sector, as described in chapter 3.1.3.c) e) Description of measures to utilise energy efficiency potential of gas and electricity infrastructure22 Responsible/involved parties*: MAP, electricity distribution system operators, electricity transmission system operator (PSE S.A.), MFiPR, MR, gas distribution system operators and gas transmission system operator (GAZ-SYSTEM S.A.) * subject to potential changes resulting from 1. Development of smart electricity grids With respect to smart metering, a legal framework will be created concerning the technical, legal and economic aspects of bringing smart meters into universal use. It is expected that 80% of consumers will be equipped with smart meters by 2028. Specific measures are described in 3.4.3(e). 2. Financial support for measures to improve energy efficiency in gas transmission and distribution and in underground gas storage (UGS) facilities The following measures are envisaged: Gas transmission system: - modernisation of old and end-of-life gas transmission pipelines; - minimisation of gas losses;  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Energy efficiency 92  amendments to the Act on government administration departments. - pumping stations  application of energy recovery technologies and effective control of the operation of the transmission system; Gas distribution system: - expansion and modernisation of low- and high-pressure distribution pipelines; - minimisation of gas losses;  use of smart metering systems; - use of smart pressure regulators; Underground gas storage facilities: - installation of expanders in process systems; - energy recovery from exhaust gases; Use of underground gas storage (UGS) facilities under the SMART GRID concept: - cooperation of the Storage System Operator (SSO) with the operators of other networks; - use of cavern underground storage facilities to store hydrogen generated from P2G (Power to Gas) processes; Gas infrastructure in mines: - use of expanders in process systems; - use of high-efficiency cogeneration facilities; - use of energy recovery technologies; SMART GRID concept for gas networks: - smart grid metering (SM)  cooperation with end consumers; - interoperability  cooperation with power systems; - use of the network for transmission of unconventional gases; - management of energy efficiency at all stages of the investment process. Given the commitments made with regard to the European Union-wide 2030 targets for energy efficiency and the share of RES in the gross final energy consumption, the support for the above-described area must be maintained in the upcoming financial perspective, i.e. 2021-2027.   f) Financing measures, including EU support and the use of EU funds, in this area at national level. Responsible/involved parties*: MAP, MFiPR, MR * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. 1. Co-financing of energy efficiency measures in gas transmission and distribution and in underground gas storage (UGS) facilities Approximately EUR 1.4 billion has been allocated to support energy efficiency measures as part of the Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment 2014-2020 (OPI&E), and ca. EUR 2 billion as part of the Regional Operational Programmes (ROP). Out of the amount mentioned above, approximately EUR 320 million has been allocated through the ROP as repayable assistance. The assistance concerns investments in such areas as energy efficiency of buildings, energy efficiency of enterprises, high-efficiency cogeneration and energy-efficient heating and until 2023. As part of the Smart Growth Operational Programme 2014-2020 (SM OP), ca. 150 smart and energy-efficient construction projects received assistance of approximately PLN 677 million. Given the commitments made with regard to the European Union-wide 2030 targets for energy efficiency and the share of RES in the gross final energy consumption, the support for the above-described area must be maintained in the upcoming financial perspective, i.e. 2021-2027.    III. Policies and measures - Dimension Energy efficiency 93  2. Support for companies operating in the energy efficiency and RES sectors, with priority being given to the suppliers of energy services (under the ESCO scheme) The amended directive on energy efficiency stipulates that a Member State is to support the energy services market and the access of small and medium-sized companies to this market, and is also to support the public sector in the acceptance of offers of energy services, in particular with regard to the modernisation of buildings. Despite the fact that the provisions of Directive 2012/27/EU have been incorporated into the Polish legislation, the energy services market is not yet mature and companies operating under the ESCO scheme tend to struggle on the market. Therefore, measures will be undertaken in the period 2021-2030 to extend support onto small and medium-sized companies, including start-ups, especially those serving the public administration sector, i.e. both government or local government administration authorities. 3. Support for the development of energy management efficiency solutions by linking building energy management systems (BEMS) with the demand side response (DSR) tool The above-mentioned solutions should contribute to the flattening of the energy demand curve and to more effective energy management, which will allow to provide consumers with access to energy without having to excessively expand generation capacity or transmission and distribution networks. The above specified measures will have positive economic and environmental effects  reducing the needs of end consumers will translate into reductions throughout the energy chain, as a result of which emissions from the energy sector and the entire economy will decrease. It should be stressed that the potential for linking BEMS with DSR is particularly high in the case of industrial consumers due to the characteristics of their consumption, high degree of predictability, the economies of scale owing to considerable volumes of consumed energy, as well as its importance for the system.   4. Development of heat consumption rationalisation technology Heat consumption rationalisation technologies which may potentially be supported from public funds include: - insulation and dewatering of steam systems; - renewable energy sources, including geothermal systems, solar collectors, heat pumps, - thermal upgrading of industrial and office buildings; - recuperation and heat recovery from processes and devices; - modernisation of internal heating networks; - using energy from waste generated in industrial processes; - construction/modernisation of own (internal) energy sources, including high-efficiency cogeneration.
