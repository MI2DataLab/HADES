INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 103   2.4 Dimension internal energy market  2.4.1 Electrical interconnectivity i. The level of electrical interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030 in consideration of the electrical interconnection target for 2030 of at least 15%, with a strategy with the level from 2021 onwards defined in close cooperation with affected Member States, taking into account the 2020 interconnection target of 10% and the following indicators of the urgency of action: 1) price differential in the wholesale market exceeding an indicative threshold of 2/MWh between Member States, Regions or bidding zones;  2) nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30% of peak load;  3) nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30% of installed renewable generation. Each new interconnector shall be subject to a socioeconomic and environmental cost-benefit analysis and implemented only if the potential benefits outweigh the costs. At national level, the development of cross-border electrical lines primarily refers to the projects for new public networks included supplemented by new interconnections financed in whole or in part by third parties pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2019/943. As a result of a specific clause in its mandate from the TSO and the concession issued by the Ministry of Economic Development, Terna is obligated to manage and develop the interconnection capacity with the electrical systems of other countries, in order to ensure greater security and reduce supply costs for electricity. The development of interconnectors financed by end customers, a policy implemented in the past decade, may also lead to a significant increase in the overall available transport capacity (programmed at 2 500 MW in Italy). The concession agreement requires the TSO to take these projects into consideration when defining the lines of development, with a particular focus on identifying the requirements for upgrading the network of interconnections with foreign countries. For the purposes of improving the capacity for long-term planning, it is worth stating that there are a large number of what are known as merchant initiatives still in effect in Italy, including with regard to authorisations granted. The evaluation of the signals originating from foreign markets and the evolution scenarios of the electrical systems in Europe and in neighbouring countries indicates that the  - the northern border (France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia); - the border with south-east Europe, where there is a diversified and competitive production capacity that is growing in the mid-long term, as an alternative to gas and oil, on the basis of the resources present and thanks to the potential synergies with the electrical systems in the area. The development of the interconnection capacity with north Africa may also be of strategic relevance, from a standpoint of the growing integration of Mediterranean countries with the INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 104   European market. Within this context, the Italy-Tunisia interconnection (ELMED project) represents an additional tool for optimising the use of energy resources. The project is included on the list of Projects Of Common Interest (PCI), having demonstrated positive effects in the mid- and long-term scenarios for Italy, Tunisia and other Member States of the European Union. However, in order for it to have strategic value and be economically feasible, the project needs substantial EU financing, primarily from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), as the cost of infrastructure of benefit to the Union cannot be borne only by those countries that are physically connected to it (Italy and Tunisia). With regard to the 2030 target of 15%, it is noted that this target is currently calculated as the ratio between the Net Transfer Capacity (NTC) of the interconnections and the net installed generation capacity. In this respect, the increased output from non-programmable  GW for photovoltaics alone) sources that are, moreover, characterised by comparatively low productivity  makes it particularly difficult for Italy to attain the above target. The large number of non-programmable renewable sources also means that a significant share of thermoelectric generation capacity will have to be kept available, in order to ensure the necessary reserve margins to enable the system to operate securely. Added to this problem is the fact that, geographically speaking, Italy is an outlying country of the Union, and therefore has less physical options to increase its cross-border interconnections, meaning that these need to be implemented in morphologically complex conditions (through Alpine mountain ranges or in underwater sections), with the resulting significant cost increases. In any event, in Communication COM(2017) 718 final, the Commission proposes to operationalise the 15% target by drawing specifically on the three indicators suggested by the Expert Group on electricity interconnection targets, and on the respective thresholds in respect of which the need for new interconnections will be assessed, namely: 1. the price differential in the wholesale market exceeding an indicative threshold of 2/MWh between Member States, Regions or bidding zones; 2. nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30% of peak load; 3. nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30% of installed renewable generation. In order to enhance these indicators for 2030, consideration was given to the interconnection5 plans for the national transmission network.                                                              5 Only those interconnections with Member States of the Union and with Switzerland (as a country that only has interconnections with EU Member States) were taken into consideration for the calculation of the targets, as recommended by the Expert Group on electricity interconnection targets. The calculation thus did not include the interconnection projects with Montenegro and Tunisia.

In any event, as stated by the Expert Group and endorsed by the Commission, the sine qua non for the creation of a new interconnector is that it be subjected to a socio-economical and environmental cost-benefit analysis capable of guaranteeing that the benefits outweigh the costs. It is not currently possible to provide an estimate for indicator 1) in the absence of detailed information on the configuration of the electricity/energy systems of the other Member States of the Union planned for 2030, which will only be made available once the respective Integrated National Energy and Climate Plans have been published. Moreover, a reduced cross-border price differential would discourage the development of merchant initiatives, the economic justification of which is precisely that differential. With regard to indicator 2), the estimated value for 2030 in the scenario with targets is 35%, which does not highlight any need for the development of further interconnections. With regard to indicator 3), the estimated value for 2030 in the scenario with targets is 25%, which does not highlight any need for the development of further interconnections. As already stated above, however, although this value is not far removed from the threshold value of 30%, it is depressed by the considerable photovoltaics share (50 GW) projected for  2.4.2 Energy transmission infrastructure i. Key electricity and gas transmission and distribution infrastructure projects, and, where relevant, modernisation projects, that are necessary for the achievement of objectives and targets under the five dimensions of the Energy Union Strategy Electricity sector With reference to developments in the electrical transmission network, all of the measures involving strong growth in renewables 2018 Development Plans) must be implemented, as well as further network upgrades  with respect to those already scheduled in the 2017 Development Plan  between the areas of north, central-north and central-southern Italy, designed to reduce the hours of congestion between these sections.  In particular, the network analyses performed by Terna led to the identification of areas in need of action on both the primary transmission network 400-220 kV and the high-voltage network 150-132 kV. The following cross-zonal measures are scheduled to be implemented by 2023:  380 kV Colunga-Calenzano electricity line  380 kV Foggia-Villanova electricity line  380 kV Bisaccia-Deliceto electricity line The 380 kV Montecorvino-Avellino Nord-Benevento electricity line will be completed after this, as well as the redevelopment of the North Calabria network and the AAT/AT Middle Adriatic network. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 107   urther development of the RTN for a 1000 MW increase along the Adriatic coast, as already provided for in the 2018 Development Plan, will also be promoted in order to reduce congestion.  Other categories of measure, including, for example, the Sardinia-Sicily-South HVDC connection proposed in the 2018 Development Plan, are also being evaluated.  The above measures will be supplemented by further investments in the distribution networks, which are increasingly affected by the spread of small and medium-sized installations. Alongside flexibility infrastructure, it is also important for the network to have devices to increase the controllability and stability of the RTN, including reactors, synchronous condensers and FACTS  Flexible AC transmission systems  able to regulate voltage and control loads in order to ensure high quality standards of the service and system security.  With regard to the electricity distribution network, the matter of estimating the overall extent of the modernisation measures needed to achieve the objectives is an extremely complex one, given the varied geographical placement of distributed generation (predominantly from photovoltaic conversion) and the electrification of end uses. For the latter, in particular, the most substantial effects are expected in areas having a high population density, whereas the effect of distributed generation is more recognisable in rural areas having a small load. In any event, the spatial coherence between generation and load does not guarantee a temporal coincidence between production and off-takes, with injections that are not consumed locally (by a single utility or by neighbouring utilities) possibly returning at higher levels of the network.  In the scenario involving an evolution trend, the estimated investment costs in the distribution network stand at 21.4 billion, which includes planned measures to increase resilience (at least 500 million in the period 2018-2022) and the roll-out of 2G meters (4.8 billion).  Finally, for PCI projects on the electricity distribution network, reference is made to the ALPGRID project (PCI Connecting Europe Facility) at a cost of 5.85 million.  Gas sector north-west market and cross- the flexibility and security of supply to the market in the north-west of the country and the creation of export capacity at the interconnection points at Tarvisio and Passo Gries (up to 40 MSm3/g overall), were completed.  The Snam gas pipeline connecting the TAP to the national transport network is currently under construction and is a continuation of the process to upgrade the transport network, including in relation to the solutions aimed at overcoming the difficulties associated with maintaining those sections of the network that cross highly urbanised areas. Both the national and the European natural gas transport infrastructure, as part of a network that was developed more than 40 years ago, are ageing. In this light, it is necessary to follow the planned interventions on the network in order to ensure continuity of the service to end INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 108   customers and to plan for adjustments to it as a result of the activation of new interconnections or supply routes.  In the gas sector, assessment and authorisation procedures are under way at the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport for a number of small-scale liquefied natural gas (SSLNG) coastal storage facilities. These would be used to unload LNG from small tanker ships, store it and then transfer it to lighters (bunkering) and cryogenic tanker trucks to supply civil and industrial customers and fuel supply stations. In Sardinia, two of the three initiatives submitted envisage the coupling of SSLNG and mini-regassification facilities. This would be timely and cost-effective with a view to: (i) supplying natural gas to Sardinian industry, the existing urban distribution networks (to replace propane) that are already compatible with natural gas, and those under construction; (ii) replacing fuels used for heavy goods traffic; (iii) replacing traditional marine fuels with LNG by gradually introducing a 0.1% sulphur limit for port vessels and ferries; and (iv) using natural gas to fuel the thermoelectric power stations envisaged for the phase-out of coal-fired stations. Following the cost-benefit analysis initiated by Ricerca sul Sistema Energetico S.p.A. (RSE) on behalf of ARERA, which should be available in spring 2020, the most appropriate measures for the transportation of natural gas will be implemented.   To offer Sardinian users connected to the distribution networks prices that are in line with those applied in the rest of Italy, technical/regulatory solutions will need to be adopted that make it possible to equalise system costs and correlate the raw material price at the Virtual Trading Point (VTP).  ii.

National objectives related to other aspects of the internal energy market such as increasing system flexibility, in particular related to the promotion of competitively determined electricity prices in line with relevant sectoral law, market integration and coupling, aimed at increasing the tradeable capacity of existing interconnectors, smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching,                                                             6Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2013 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and repealing Decision No 1364/2006/EC and amending Regulations (EC) No 713/2009, (EC) No 714/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 (OJ L 115, 25.4.2013, p. 39) INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 109   re-dispatching and curtailment, and real-time price signals, including a timeframe for when the objectives shall be met An increased flexibility of the system is undoubtedly one of the national objectives relating to the internal energy market. This objective will be achieved through increased flexibility of existing thermoelectric production facilities and, above all, by increased market participation of new flexible resources. These new flexible resources include aggregation and demand response, a greater participation of distributed generation and non-programmable renewables in services markets, and the development of new storage systems.  The objectives to be pursued are coherent with the transition towards a market structure that is integrated and coordinated at European level, that focuses on active and aware consumers, and in which the participation of distributed resources will take on increasing significance. These objectives relate, in particular, to the following. a) strengthening the process of market integration drive to harmonise the national regulatory frameworks for the functioning of electricity markets towards an integrated electricity market have intensified. The European network codes adopted between 2015 and 2017 and, in particular, those relating to capacity allocation and congestion management (Regulation (EU) 2015/1222) and balancing (Regulation (EU) 2017/2195) outline a detailed market model, in terms of both electricity trading and the supply of dispatching services. In this context, the Integrated Electricity Dispatching Text, which is nearing completion following the consultation (Consultation Document 322/2019/R/eel), establishes the overall guidelines. In addition, the full implementation of the Clean Energy Package will provide a new impetus to the processes currently under way to harmonise the functioning of the markets. The following measures are involved. - -ahead market (DAM) has already been integrated through market coupling with France, Austria and Slovenia; this will also be implemented in the future on the borders with Greece and Switzerland (the latter being subject to the outcome of negotiations between Switzerland and the EU on the subject of energy markets); - the timeframes for implementing the European model for the intraday market (IM) appear to be longer. Trading as close as possible to real-time will make it possible to promote greater integration of renewables and active market demand. The European project CrossBorder IntraDay (XBID), supported by the network and market operators of various Member States, including Terna and GME, recently entered its operational phase. Italy will adhere to this project at a later date (2020) once coordination measures between the IM and the dispatching services market (DSM) have been implemented; - with reference to the integration of balancing markets, the aim of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electricity is to develop common platforms for trading flexible resources and services between the network operators of EU countries. In this way, the cross-border offsetting of imbalances and the acquisition of capacity and energy in another market area will be encouraged and, more generally speaking, common methodologies for the coordinated calculation of national reserve requirements will be adopted. The process for harmonising the rules on balancing appears to be more sensitive, as it impacts on the operations of network operators on deadlines close to real-time and, therefore, on INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 110   system security in the short-term. A number of pilot projects have already been launched in this respect, including the TERRE project, in which Terna has an interest, for designing, developing, implementing and managing a platform for exchanging replacement reserves between the various participating countries (currently Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Switzerland). It should also be noted that Regulation (EU) 2019/943 introduced an obligation to make available to the market at least 70% of available capacity on each border (calculated taking into account the meshing of the grid and secure network operation (N-1)). It envisages, once the methodology has been approved by all regulatory authorities, a review of the configuration of the bidding zones at the European level. As regards the first point, following the analyses currently under way the option of a temporary derogation, as envisaged by the Regulation, will be evaluated. b) promoting the active role of demand and the integration of renewable sources and distributed generation. With regard to the roll-out of distributed generation and self-consumption, Italy is well placed in the future market trends outlined by Europe. In 2017, the amount of electricity self-consumed was approximately 28 TWh, more than 9% of total consumption (data provided by Terna), whereas distributed generation (considering all installations connected to the distribution networks) accounted for more than 20% of overall electricity generation in 2016 (data provided by ARERA). This is a growing phenomenon that needs to be regulated on the basis of efficiency and security criteria with the following priorities: - to consolidate the awareness of and active role played by the consumer, who becomes a key figure in the transition towards an increasingly decentralised system; the role of the consumer is shifting from a passive onlooker to an active participant, capable of modifying their consumption in response to price changes on the market and, under certain conditions, to self-produce and offer network services; - the active role of the consumer may take three forms: - choosing a supplier and properly evaluating sales offers and associated services; - self-production and adoption of storage systems and efficient management of consumption; - modifying load in response to price signals (demand response). With regard to the first point, in the coming year the Italian authorities will, in coordination with the regulator, carry out initiatives to raise awareness, improve transparency of communications sent to consumers, and define qualification requirements for operators on the retail market, including with regard to the reliability and accuracy of contractual obligations and compliance with competition rules and the sectoral regulations currently in force. These are necessary steps towards greater consumer awareness and protection, prerequisites for the abolition of price protection schemes, which the Italian authorities recently established should take place on 1 January 2022 (Article 12 of Decree-Law No 162/2019). They are thus taking the necessary time to ensure that complete price liberalisation benefits consumers and preserves consumer protection mechanisms under fair and sustainable conditions.  The development of widespread self-generation may express itself through various configurations, both individual and collective, in an industrial/commercial context or as an INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 111   expression of civil initiatives aimed at social and environmental issues: existing self-consumption structures may work alongside new forms of aggregation (such as, for example, the - communit established by the Clean Energy Package and specifically by RED II), which will require the definition of government instruments to ensure system security, consumer protection and the fair allocation of network and system charges. The spread of self-consumption will naturally be facilitated by technological developments (for example the possibilities posed by new smart meters, the roll-out of digital technologies, together with the internet of things) able to deliver small and medium-sized production and storage systems, above all using renewable sources and high-efficiency cogeneration, and entail smaller and smaller costs for users. This is a phenomenon that must be supported through public policies enabling market actors to organise themselves on the basis of efficiency criteria. To this end, the regulation of the new structures must be accelerated.  In the long-term, the dispatching model itself will be aligned with market developments, tending towards models that are better tailored to a distributed resource system, with the -y prevails in Europe, differing from the dispatching arrangements in Italy, which are based on -bindingly determined by the network operator, but is instead referred to the agents responsible for scheduling in-puts and off-takes, who are encouraged to balance their positions on the basis of a system of incentives/penalties.  With the increasing participation of distributed generation, the current central dispatch model might not be fully appropriate in the future; the most suitable model for the national context will therefore have to be assessed on the basis of efficiency and security criteria, with strongly standardised models being avoided. In terms of the shift towards a more decentralised system, sufficient time must be allowed for its organisation and for preventive measures, both organisational and structural, relating to the regulation and management of the distribution networks and the methods of cooperation between the DSOs and TSOs. A gradual approach that promotes a more active role being played by DSOs, to whose networks the distributed resources are connected, is therefore advisable.  With regard to the gas market, liquidity must be increased and the price spread with respect to other European markets reduced: full integration with the markets of north Europe should eliminate/greatly reduce the differential between the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) and VTP, thus allowing Italy to compete with the markets of north Europe in attracting LNG which, in market conditions of oversupply, should generate positive competition and lower absolute prices.  The Ten-Year Network Development Plans (TYNDP) of the Italian TSO (Snam) and German TSO (TENP) for the partial or total reactivation of the out-of-service TENP gas pipeline, in cooperation with the Swiss TSOs and German and Italian regulators, will also be addressed, by optionally introducing methods to implement the measure, including on the part of the Italian system, following a cost/benefit analysis demonstrating that, in order to cover such a cost, the differential would be reduced (structurally equal to approximately 2/GWh on all volumes of gas consumed in Italy).  ii. Where applicable, national objectives related to the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 112   Within this context, the following measures should be taken: - complete the procedure authorising distributed renewables generation to participate in the services market and the full exploitation of demand and other flexible resources (including storage systems), in accordance with principles of technology neutrality and cost minimisation, through new organisational structures. The following steps should therefore be taken: - eliminate the barriers that continue to restrict participation by all available resources in the various electricity and services markets; - promote a level playing field between the different types of resources, including in terms of responsibility (for example in relation to the application of imbalance costs and exceeding the dispatching priority for renewable sources). In this respect, it is necessary to accelerate the reform process for the dispatching services market, starting with the trials currently in progress as part of the pilot projects developed by Terna, implementing Legislative Decree No 102/2014 and ARERA Resolution 300/2017. These provisions regulate participation in the services market and distributed energy generation, renewable sources, HEC and demand, including by means of aggregators, in the  Integrated Text on Electricity Dispatching. This will take the results of the consultation (Consultation 322/2019/R/eel) into account and will be consistent with the European balancing code (Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/2195).  The development of the rules governing imbalances should also be set in this context. They will be based on setting a value that is as close as possible to that of the energy used for balancing in real time. The aim is to provide operators with all of the information they need to make efficient decisions on buying or selling electricity and on network use, and to allocate the costs of any imbalances more accurately. This development will initially take into account the specificities of the current centralised dispatching model, as used in Italy. In particular, and in implementation of the provisions of Article 8(4) of Regulation 2019/943 on the internal market for electricity, a settlement period of 15 minutes will be established, including for non-approved units, in the light of a more comprehensive review of the difference between approved and non-approved units that takes into account the possibility of maximising the market participation of the available resources.   In addition to promoting fuller integration with the other European markets, the reform process implemented by ARERA will help achieve the following objectives. - Sustainability, as the increased opening up of the dispatching services market allows more efficient integration of renewable sources into the market and electrical system. - Competitiveness, insofar as the increased availability of resources and technologies capable of providing the requested service enhances competition between operators, with potential positive effects on service cost dynamics and the risk of abuse of dominant positions. - activities and the physical programming of resources, thus enabling the fullest possible freedom and flexibility in electricity market participation. - The development of storage capacity. This objective primarily aims for efficient integration of renewable sources into the electrical system, in order to reduce over-generation, in line with network developments and according to the regulation requirements of the network operator. A sufficient storage capacity (both distributed and concentrated) is of significance in view of the growing importance of non-programmable renewable sources and the resulting increased demand for INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 113   flexibility, as well as the planned phase-out of coal-fired thermoelectric capacity by 2025. In addition to reducing over-generation of renewable sources, the roll-out of storage systems will also influence zone price differences between the south and north caused by network congestion. Nowadays, hydroelectric storage systems represent the most mature option of the various storage technologies, although they are not sufficiently exploited and, therefore, not replicable.  Other possible storage solutions that envisage the use of alternative means of delivering energy, such as hydrogen, could also be investigated. With regard to batteries, Terna has developed a number of applications, on a trial basis, for 75 MW of capacity intended to provide vital services (primarily power-driven applications). In the future, due consideration must be given to the new EU provisions that provide for the development of storage systems in line with market principles, limiting the role of distribution and transmission network operators to instances involving market failure. The definitive choice of storage capacity to be achieved, storage technologies, and the mixture between network measures and the of the services that will be offered by each option (power-driven, energy-driven or multi-service) and the need to optimise the use of pre-existing hydroelectric storage facilities. The roll-out of storage systems may also be driven by developments in the automotive sector; to this end, it will be important to enhance the role of electric cars and associated infrastructure when providing network services. Still on the theme of increased participation of demand, the objectives include the provision of off-take and electricity consumption data to the end customer and third parties identified by that customer, in order to increase energy efficiency, including through greater customer awareness with regard to their consumption patterns. By way of Resolution No 87/16, the ARERA established the functional requirements for low-voltage smart meters and performance requirements for associated second-generation smart electricity metering  No 669/2018/R/gas recently defined the obligations for commissioning smart gas meters in classes G4-G6, which represent 97.8% of the total number of redelivery points for distributors with more than 50,000 end customers. iii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to ensuring that consumers participate in the energy system and benefit from self-generation and new technologies, including smart meters See sections 3.1.2 i and 3.4.3 ii for a detailed description of the objectives in terms of promoting self-consumption and developing and supporting renewable energy communities, to be achieved primarily through regulatory instruments.  iv. National objectives with regard to ensuring electricity system adequacy, as well as for the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met The adequacy of the electrical system is a central objective of energy policy and is also the reason why Italy, which experienced a period of overcapacity, but is now, by contrast, going through a phase of gradual reduction in its conventional capacity, has prepared an instrument capable of promoting new investments in generation, storage systems and demand response (capacity market). Adequacy is subject to periodical analysis and review by Terna, both in the INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 114   mid-long term and in the short-term, with a particular focus on periods of increased seasonal demand and specific external challenges. On the other hand, the rapid evolution of the energy system necessitates systematic and continuous monitoring and assessment activities. A first analysis of the adequacy of the system for 2030 was carried out in 2017, which also included the phase-out of coal-fired production. It will be updated annually to take into account the changes introduced by this Plan and the methodologies that will be established in implementing Regulation 943/2019. According to the analysis available, in order to maintain adequate security margins for the system, new substitute resources, primarily in terms of renewable generation, will need to be developed, together with new conventional power sources and storage devices, in coordination with the projected developments in network infrastructure (the results of the analysis and the list of infrastructure to be built are attached to the 2017 National Energy Strategy).  In particular, flexibility requires a strong push for new storage systems that give benefits not just in terms of shifting production from the peak of non-programmable renewables (photovoltaics and wind power in particular) towards hours of increased consumption, but also in terms of providing the system with the actual services needed for security, including as a replacement for thermoelectric production units. Still on the issue of flexibility, the active participation of demand on the markets makes a significant contribution; this kind of contribution will be encouraged by building on the experience gained from the pilot projects launched by Terna, which can undoubtedly be of benefit to technological development by enabling the spread of demand response configurations, as well as the evolution of new players, such as aggregators and energy communities.  In addition to storage facilities and the active participation of the demand side in the markets, in view of the expected changes in demand for electricity and the decommissioning of coal-fired power stations and the remaining fuel-oil installations, it will be necessary to create additional gas-fuelled generating capacity. This will lead to a temporary increase in gas consumption, for which no infrastructure development is currently envisaged. Gas-fuelled capacity will therefore make a strategic contribution to covering requirements.   v. Where applicable, national objectives to protect energy consumers and improve the competitiveness of the retail energy sector Generally speaking, the price gap in the electricity sector with respect to the European average remains, although it is decreasing. This difference is the result of: - a higher wholesale energy price, resulting from: - European average; - an energy mix strongly shifted towards gas-fired combined-cycle plants which, although more efficient, have higher variable costs than coal-fired and nuclear power plants and are actually present at an even higher level in European energy mixes; - increasing costs for network services, as a result of the greater complexity entailed in operating a network in a country with its own particular mountain terrain, and of Italy production mix having one of the highest shares of renewables in Europe;  - high system charges, primarily as a result of support policies for renewables and energy efficiency that have a higher impact than those of other EU countries. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 115   The objective of limiting all those aspects that contribute to this price disadvantage and the impact of consumer charges for the development of renewable sources is therefore f SMEs and energy-intensive industrial sectors, and thereby preventing relocation risks and safeguarding employment.  Promoting the active role of consumers is closely connected to improving transparency and competitiveness on the retail market. In this respect, it is essential that this objective be attained as soon as possible, in coordination with the completion of the process to liberalise the retail market outlined by Competition Law No 124/2017, which will result in the current price regulation regime (known as the Enhanced Protection scheme) for domestic consumers and small enterprises being brought to a definitive end. The measures which the government intends to promote, in coordination with ARERA, are targeted, on the one hand, at providing consumers with more knowledge and an awareness of the opportunities and benefits presented by the market, and, on the other hand, at ensuring effective competition between suppliers. Notwithstanding the measures that still need to be implemented, it is emphasised that the starting point is an overall context that in recent years has seen improvements in the information and protection instruments offered to consumers to develop greater awareness and properly guide their choice of supply.   These include, to mention just the most important ones, the energy consumer help desk, the mediation service, the supplier comparison portal, the integrated information system (IIS), and the consumption portal managed by Acquirente Unico Spa. This portal, which began operating in 2019, also meets a need that was underscored in the consultation on the Plan, i.e. the need to make all of the metering data held by distributors available to end-customers. In addition, ARERA has introduced new rules in relation to invoicing and the associated timeframes and has reformed switching processes. The aim is to ensure greater transparency and standardisation by revising deadlines and procedures and providing stronger consumer guarantees. For further details, see Section 3.4.3., which describes the measures mentioned here in greater depth.  2.4.4 Energy poverty Where applicable, national objectives with regard to energy poverty, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met The share of household expenditure set aside for the purchase of electricity and heating has gradually increased over the course of the first decade of the 2000s, in particular with regard to increasing expenditure on electricity consumption. This trend was consolidated, and exacerbated, in the years immediately thereafter, including as a result of the economic crisis that hit Italy and brought with it a decrease in the overall average level of household expenditure (which fell by more than 5% between 2008 and 2013). The effect on energy expenditure was not uniform across the various sections of the population, insofar as it weighed more heavily on the most deprived households. Indeed, in 2016 the 10% of households with the lowest levels of consumption spent 4.5% of their overall expenditure on electricity, while for the 10% with the highest levels of consumption electricity expenditure accounted for 1% of total spending (the shares for heating are 4.5% and 2%, respectively). Comparing the trend in the volume of expenditure taken up by energy products between 2007 and 2016, it is noted that the largest increases were recorded by the most deprived households. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 116   A gradual increase in household resources earmarked for energy expenditure might exacerbate the phenomenon of energy poverty (EP), understood to mean the inability to purchase a minimum energy basket of goods and services or a situation where access to energy services entails a diversion of resources (in terms of expenditure or income) higher than the socially acceptable level.  This issue is increasingly in the spotlight of European and Italian institutions. The European Energy Poverty Observatory was established in 2017 at the initiative of the European Commission, tasked with producing reliable and comparable statistics, establishing good practices and tackling the issue through the involvement of stakeholders.   Italy has no official definition of energy poverty. In the SEN approved in November 2017, an ad hoc indicator7 was adopted to measure its extent. According to that indicator, in the period 2005-2016 the proportion of households in energy poverty was, on average, approximately 8% of all households. However, the percentage has grown in recent years, to about 8.6%, which equated to 2.2 million households, in 2016, a figure that was more or less unchanged in 2017. The trend is essentially the same as for the proportion of households in relative poverty, according to estimates provided by Istat.  To identify targets for reducing EP, an understanding of its main determinants must be gained. Four determinants may be identified in this respect: 1. trends in residential energy consumption and the mix thereof used: in the INECP scenario, residential consumption in 2030 should fall by 15.5% (-1.4% each year) compared with 2016, with a growth in the electricity component (of 7.2%) against a reduction in gas (by almost a quarter) and a slump in oil products, which are increasingly marginal; 2. expected price trends for energy products: prices for energy products (including tax and system components) should increase  projections for Italy (EU Reference Scenario 2016)8, the final price of electricity should increase by 0.6% each year, with no information being available on the price of gas or other energy products. Overall, energy expenditure could increase by 1.3% each year -rel. and other  3. trends in overall household expenditure: household expenditure could increase to an annualised rate of 0.8% if it follows the trends projected for real GDP in the aforesaid EU Reference Scenario; 4. demographic changes: the number of households in EP will also be determined by demographic trends. Households with an elderly member or with only one member are less likely to be in EP, and the number of households with these characteristics will increase in the future. The projections formulated by Istat with regard to population evolution to 20309 suggest that the number of people over the age of 65 should account for a quarter of the total in that year, an increase of three percentage points compared with 2017, and that the number of households should increase due to the continuing trends towards fewer average members10.                                                             7 Faiella I. e L.

Assuming that the average number of members will fall from 2.4 in the INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 117   Figure 21  Households in energy poverty in 2016 by geographical area, age and size of household (Source: calculations on the basis of data from the survey on household expenditure carried out by Istat)  Nord North Centro Central Mezzogiorno South 1 componente One member Eta >65 anni Age > 65 years 2 componenti Two members 3 componenti Three members 4 componenti Four members Eta <65 anni Age < 65 years Totale Total  Taking these and other factors into account, it can be assumed that the incidence of energy poverty could decrease in the coming years, to remain at between 7% and 8%, with a reduction of about 1 percentage point with respect to the 2016 figure (which would correspond to a reduction of about 230,000 households in energy poverty, again with respect to 2016).                                                             period 2014-2016 to 2.3 in 2030, the number of households should increase by almost 4%. 30.0% 20.0% 10.0% 0.0% INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 118    All this having been said, in order to tackle energy poverty, the efficiency of existing measures in support of energy expenditure must be increased and, in the mid-term, solutions to increase the energy efficiency of buildings must be prioritised.  With regard to enhancing electricity and gas bonuses, measures must be implemented to scale the size of the benefit on the basis of poverty conditions and to improve access to the measure for households living in conditions of financial/physical hardship. In this respect, ARERA estimates that, to date, only about a third of potential beneficiaries has requested access to the benefit; the low levels of use can be attributed to various different factors, including a lack of awareness of the measure itself and the administrative complexity of the requirements established. The objective, therefore, is to reach all of the potential beneficiaries by removing administrative barriers and introducing, as far as possible, automated tools for granting financial support. In this context, account will also need to be taken of any specific needs, including those relating to households that use alternatives to methane for heating purposes or households that do not have heating systems.  There is also room for policy measures which, in the mid-term, promote a reduction in energy demand for those properties inhabited by deprived sections of the population, through measures to enhance efficiency and complete renovation of public residential buildings (social housing). These types of measures require investments which households living in poverty, which cannot easily access normal energy efficiency incentives, are not able to make. The above measures will pursue various different objectives simultaneously, namely enabling more efficient use of energy resources taken up by the residential sector (with positive effects on comfort and emissions), reducing the burden of energy bills for the most vulnerable households, and adding value to public housing stock.  The instruments available in Italy today  electricity and gas bonuses, tax deductions for E(Conto Termico)  can, if appropriately modified and coordinated, tackle the phenomenon of minimum energy basket of goods and services, or, alternatively, in the sense of energy vulnerability, when the access to energy services entails a diversion of resources (in terms of expenditure or income)
