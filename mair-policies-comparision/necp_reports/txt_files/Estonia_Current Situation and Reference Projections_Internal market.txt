Figure 34. Fulfilment of electricity interconnection criteria in 2030 under the EUCO 2030 scenario59, 190 Although Estonia and other Baltic States fulfil three electricity interconnection criteria, the networks of the Baltic States have not yet been fully interconnected to the EU electricity grids. In other words, the Baltic States are not located in the synchronous area subject to EU law. Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian electricity systems operate synchronously with the Russian Unified Energy System (IPS/UPS). Synchronisation of the electricity system of the Baltic States with the synchronous area subject to EU law around 2025 is one of the most important energy policy targets for Estonia and the other Baltic States and will significantly affect the long-term development of the electricity network.  The Prime Ministers of the Baltic States, the President of the European Commission and the Prime Minister of Poland affirmed in the roadmap191 signed in the summer of 2018 the importance of the synchronisation project and recognised the wish of the Baltic States to synchronise with the mains frequency of continental Europe. The interconnections between the Baltic States will also be strengthened under the synchronisation project and the project will contribute towards the increased electricity interconnection of Poland192.                                                            189 ENTSO-Ehttps://tyndp.entsoe.eu/tyndp2018/ 190 The EUCO 2030 scenario is the scenario for meeting the EU-wide energy and climate objectives agreed in 2014. 191 Political Roadmap on the synchronisation of the Baltic States' electricity networks with the Continental European Network via Poland. https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/c_2018_4050_en_annexe_acte_autonome_nl w2_p_v2.docx 192 ENTSO-E.

Key characteristics of the existing transmission infrastructure for electricity and gas193 In Estonia there is one company providing transmission system services (Elering AS); it is also the system operator. There are 5,202 km of transmission lines (110 kV330 kV) belonging to the TSO.194 for the Co-ordination of Transmission of Electricity (Figure 35) which comprises hbours, Latvia and Russia (which are interconnected to it by AC lines), and their neighbours  Lithuania and Belarus. Estonia is interconnected to Russia by three 330 kV lines (two lines from Narva to St. Petersburg and Kingisepp and one line from Tartu to Pskov), two 330 kV lines interconnect Estonia with the Latvian electricity system (one lies between Tartu and Valmiera, the other between Tsirguliina and Valmiera). Two DC cable lines interconnect Finland and Estonia (EstLink 1 and EstLink 2) (Figure 36).194    Figure 35.

Elering's investments are targeted at the following: 1) supporting the security of supply;                                                            198 Source - Elering AS 199 Cf. the national network development plans and regional investment plans of TSOs. 2) supporting electricity market development (external interconnections); 3) supporting transmission capacities to enable new interconnections and the growth of loads; 4) stopping the deterioration of the network; 5) improving reliability (voltage quality and preventing interruptions); 6) cy, reducing losses; 7) connecting new customers (consumers, producers).  Investments are generally approved up to five years in advance (except for the projects of common interest). 33% of the volume of investment for 2018-2022 is going towards renovation of the amortised network and 67% towards development of the domestic network. Around 22% of investments are being made in sub-stations and around 78% in power lines. Investments related to synchronisation of the electricity system of the Baltic States are scheduled until 2025 (Figure 40).145 ANNEX 6.

When budgeting for the investment plans reflected in the development plan, various investment projects are validated and a justified choice of investment projects is made. The choice is based on the principle that under conditions of resource scarcity, priority should be given to projects from which society derives the greatest socio-economic benefit. This benefit may be expressed as:  security of energy supply;  better functioning energy markets;    better customer service. The following inputs, analyses and studies are taken into account when investing in regulated assets: (a) for developing the network:  network development plans, ENTSO-G 10-year development plans, development development plans, and other studies. Investment qualifies if a new network element is built with the investment (e.g. a pipeline, a gas distribution station, gas metering stations, and so on) owing to insufficient transmission capacity or the need to ensure reliability in accordance with the quality requirement regulation. Among the more important investments to be made over the next 10 years are construction of the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Estonia and Finland and its spin-off projects, such as construction of a metering point and a compressor station on the Estonia-Latvia border.   Electricity and gas markets, energy prices i. Current situation of electricity and gas markets, including energy prices The power exchange Nord Pool AS (NP) started its activities in Estonia in April 2010. The electricity market was opened to the extent of 28.4% in 2010. Since 1 January 2013, the electricity market has been open to everyone, and all electricity consumers with a valid network contract can choose the electricity provider and price package most suitable for them.194 Thanks to the EstLink 1 and EstLink 2 interconnections between Estonia and Finland and NordBalt between Lithuania and Sweden, the electrical system of the Baltic States is closely integrated with the electrical system of the Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark), where the Nord Pool power exchange also operates.194 Estonia produced electricity in the amount of 10.58 TWh (net production) in 2018, a decrease of 5.8% compared to 2017 (Table 28). In 2018, 3.48 TWh of electricity was imported to Estonia, an increase of 65% compared to 2017. Electricity consumption in 2018 was 7.98 TWh, which was 1.5% higher than in 2017. Estonia exported 5.35 TWh of electricity in 2018, 12.3% more than in 2017. Network losses in the Estonian transmission system in 2017 and 2018 were substantially the same (0.7 TWh).194 Table 28.

Comparison of prices in the NP Estonia and NP Finland price areas227 The figure above (Figure 41) shows that Estonian and Finnish electricity prices were quite similar following the launch of EstLink 2 in December 2013. Differences in prices between Estonia and Finland were caused mainly by interruptions to EstLink 1 and EstLink 2, when the transmission capacity between Estonia and Finland decreased. In 2017 there were no significant interruptions in the operation of EstLink 1 and EstLink 2. 194 Table 29.

The rate of switching electricity trader by consumers was 3% in 2017. 84% of consumers had electricity contracts and 16% of consumers used a general service (consumers who did not have a valid electricity contract). The average balancing portfolio share of the biggest wholesale electricity trader (Eesti Energia AS) in 2017 was 59.5%, followed by Elektrum Eesti OÜ with 10.6% and Scener OÜ with 9.6%. The average balancing portfolio share of Eesti Energia in 2013 was 71.9%, meaning that in 2017 the market share of the biggest Estonian electricity trader (Eesti Energia AS) had decreased. Hence it can be concluded that competition in the electricity market among electricity traders had increased.194 The Estonian gas market has been open since 2007. Since 2015, the independent system manager of the Estonian gas system has been Elering AS. In essence, the Estonian gas system is a closed system, receiving natural gas from Russia and Lithuania (regasified LNG). Figure 42 gives an overview of the origin of imported natural gas. The share of natural gas imported from Russia in 2018 was 93%.

Origin of imported gas in 2018 At the start of July 2017 the Estonian gas exchange came into operation, and it became possible to trade in natural gas between the Baltic States independently of the country in which the selling or purchasing undertaking is located. UAB GET Baltic manages the gas market covering the Baltic States. The establishing of the single gas market was made possible by an agreement between the system operators of the three countries to apply the implicit auction method to distribution of cross-border transmission capacities, where the gas price in cross-border transactions also covers transmission capacity. For example, an Estonian market participant can buy gas from Lithuania without organising the transport of gas from Lithuania to Latvia and from there to Estonia. While 1.36 GWh of gas was purchased via the gas exchange in 2017, its use is increasing. The sales volume and daily peak load of the Estonian gas market has been continuously decreasing over the last 10 years (see Figure 43). Figure 43. Gas consumption quantities and peak load, TWh/yr, GWh/day (2007-2017)   TWh/year  GWh/day  Estonian consumption  Peak load Depending on the sales volume, the final gas price for household consumers in 2017 -  Table 34), while for business -  Table 33).

The rate of changing electricity trader by consumers averaged 12%. Five operators had a gas import licence, of which two actually imported gas in 2017. There were a total of 24 distribution system operators (the total length of the network was 2,131 km), and the market share of the biggest system operator was 82% (for 1,483 km of the distribution system). A total of 41 operators acted as gas sellers. The majority sold gas in their own network area. Seven persons operated actively as sellers, and the market share of the largest was 92%. In Estonia, six undertakings acted as balance responsible parties. ii. Projections of development with existing policies and measures until at least 2040 (including for the year 2030). The prices of electricity and gas as electricity carriers are formed on the respective markets (e.g. the Nord Pool power exchange for electricity). Measures applied in Estonia do not impact the prices of electricity and gas as energy carriers
