4.2. Decarbonisation dimension  4.2.1. GHG emissions and removals 4.2.1.1. Total greenhouse gas emissions in Portugal  After the rapid growth seen in GHG emissions in the 90s, Portugal reached its peak emission point in 2005, after which there was a significant and sustained fall. Since then, a trajectory of decarbonisation of the national economy has been consolidated. In fact, in 2005 an increase in emissions of around 44% was seen when compared to 1990 levels. According to the most recent updating of the National Emissions Inventory 2019 (for 2017), GHG emissions, excluding emissions from land use change and forestry (LULUCF), are estimated at approximately 70.7 Mt CO 2eq, representing an increase of 19.5% over figures for 1990 and growth of 7.0% over 2016. For the LULUCF sector, total emissions in 2017 are estimated at 78.0 Mt CO2eq, corresponding to an increase of 29.2% in relation to 1990 and a rise of 28.5% over 2016. This steep growth relates to the tragic forest fires which occurred in 2017, a situation influenced by a particularly dry year, the high temperatures seen outside the normal summer period (the largest forest fires occurred in June and October), and to unusually strong winds, such as hurricane Ophelia which swept the Iberian Peninsula coast in October 2017.                                                                       30 Source: European Commission, EU Reference Scenario 2016  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4.

Portugal complied with this objective mainly by limiting GHG emissions in all sectors of the economy and by capturing carbon in land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). The trajectory since 2005 has thus allowed compliance with the Kyoto Protocol. For the 2013-2020 period, the EU set a Community goal of a reduction of a minimum of 20% in GHG emissions in relation to 1990. In this regard, the sectors covered by EU ELT are expected to reduce emissions by 21% in relation to 2005 and remaining sectors by 10% in relation to 2005. Targets were also set to achieve 20% of energy from renewable sources in final consumption and an increase in energy efficiency (EE) of 20%. With regard to effort sharing, Portugal committed to limiting growth in GHG emissions to +1% up to 2020 (in relation to 2005) for sectors not covered by ELT. Annual limits were also set for non-ELT emissions in this period. Under the 2020 energy-climate package, Portugal also committed to a target of 31% of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption (RES), 10% of which was in transport, an EE general objective of 25% and a specific EE objective for Public Administration of 30%. Ii is important to note that these emission reduction targets are integrated into joint compliance by the EU, its Member States and Iceland in the second Kyoto Protocol commitment period. The following figure shows the evolution of national emissions from 1990 to 2017 and identifies, as of 2005, the contribution from EU ELT and non-ELT sectors.

Current Policy Situation and Existing Measures and Projections 120          Key PT EN Emissões CELE ETS emissions Emissões Não-CELE Non-ETS emissions Emissões Totais Total emissions   An analysis of GHG emissions per GDP unit shows that a process was started in 2005 to decouple GDP from emissions, as a result of the decarbonisation of the economy, in other words, an economy with less carbon emitted per unit of wealth produced. This trend started before the current economic crisis. Several factors are driving this trend including the growth in the use of less polluting energy sources such as natural gas, the construction of combined cycle power plants and more efficient co-generation units. Other reasons include the significant growth in renewable energy (mainly wind and hydro), and the implementation of energy efficiency measures. The improvement in efficiency in transport (through fleet renewal) and in housing (through building certification) may also explain such trends. Public policies on climate change are today an integral part of a series of sector policies in Portugal. In areas such as energy aconsiderations of companies. In agriculture and forestry, there is also growth in awareness of the important contribution the sector can make with regard to mitigating GHG emissions. In areas with specific challenges such as the transport sector, important steps have been taken to decarbonise vehicle fleets. Moreover, an electric mobility network has been created and support schemes have been introduced for electric vehicles with the aim of reinforcing incentives for the use of such vehicles.

In this sector, energy production and transport contribute most, representing around 29% and 24%, respectively, of all national emissions. NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4.

Industriais e Uso de Produtos Industrial processes and product use Agricultura Agriculture Resíduos Waste Energia Energy Outros Other Transportes Transport Combustão na Indústria Combustion in Industry Produção e Transformação de Energia Production and Transformation of Energy  Combustion in Industry, responsible for around 11% of national emissions, saw growth of 1.2% in 2017 over 2016. Fugitive emissions, representing 2% of all emissions, saw growth of 6.9% over 2016. The sectors of industrial processes and product use (IPPU), agriculture and waste have an approximate weighting, representing 11.0%, 9.8% and 6.6%, respectively. The IPPU and Agricultural sectors show positive variations if 6.5% and 1.7%, respectively, over 2016, while Waste has a negative trend of 1.3% with respect to 2016. With respect to agriculture, growth in emissions from 2016 to 2017 can be mostly explained by the increase of cattle for fattening (+38 330 animals), sheep (+63 700) and poultry (+1 652 740), as well as by the greater productivity of rice growing (+340 kg/ha). The growth in emissions from industrial processes essentially relates to the increase in clinker and nitric acid production in 2017 when compared to 2016. The use of steel scrap (less pollutant) at steel foundries, instead of pig iron, also contributed to the reduction of emissions in this sector in 2017. The increase in emissions from industrial processes with respect to 1990 (32%) is due to the growth in emissions of fluorinated gases, particularly in the sub-sectors of stationary air conditioning and commercial refrigeration. The reduction in emissions in the waste sector in recent years is due to the use of biogas in wastewater treatment systems, as well as the focus on Mechanical and Biological Treatments which seek to reduce urban waste (RUB) in landfills and the increase in recovered recyclable waste.  4.2.1.2. Projections of sectorial developments with existing national and EU policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)  As part of work under RCN2050, projections were made for the activity trajectories and the respective GHG emissions of the corresponding sectors of activity, the energy system (including the production, transmission and consumption of energy sectors), agriculture, forestry and other land uses and waste and wastewater. This exercise further included an equally detailed assessment for 2030 and 2040 which allowed new emissions trajectories to be delineated compatible with the national objective to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. A new development in relation to similar exercises conducted in the past, is the fact that some of the expectable NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4. Current Policy Situation and Existing Measures and Projections 122   climate changes for the horizon 2050 were included in the modelling.  These changes included alterations in the efficiency of technologies, demand for services and the availability of resources (such as a reduction in hydro availability or an increase in cooling requirements). Results from these projections have allowed potential national emission reduction to be reanalysed, confirming the technical and economic viability of pursuing a low-carbon trajectory for 2020/2030, on the road to carbon neutrality in 2050. A sector analysis of emissions trajectories confirms that all sectors have significant potential to reduce GHG emissions, although the speeds of reduction may differ. Analysis of the behaviour of the different sectors in the conditions established for the existing policies scenario, as well as for the additional policies (or neutrality scenarios) helps identify key factors, trends and behaviours for the same timeframe considered. The methodologies used to estimate GHG emissions is that set out in the National Inventory Report (NIR). A specific projection methodology for the respective activity variables was adopted for each of the sectors of activity. However, it was based on the same socio-economic framework to ensure consistency in the projections obtained. It should be further noted that, for the purposes of the projections presented in the existing policies scenario, the policies and measures instruments approved and published up to 31 December 2017 were taken into account, as were a number of commitments undertaken by Portugal, such as the termination of power production from coal. Shown below is a results summary of modelling carried out on GHG emissions per sector for the 2030 and 2040 horizons, in a scenario of existing policies.

Current Policy Situation and Existing Measures and Projections 123   As can be seen, even in an existing policies scenario, a sharp reduction in GHG emissions is expected in coming decades, and cost-effective potential exists for Portugal to reduce total emissions by 2030 of around 51% in relation to 2005. This figure will rise to 60% by 2040 (without LULUCF). In 2030, this reduction will be largely the result of the closure of coal-fired power plants and focus on the role of renewable energies in the national energy mix, particularly solar. By 2030, the electricity production sector has the potential to reduce GHG emissions by around 93% with respect to 2005 (and around a 97% reduction by 2040). The transport and mobility sector is also expected to see far-reaching changes with much increased use of electric vehicles and potential emissions reduction of around 41% by 2030 with respect to 2005 and around 60% by 2040. The services and wastes sectors also have solid potential to reduce GHG emissions, contributing with 62% and 49%, respectively by 2030 (and 73% and 64%, respectively, by 2040). This will be due to increased energy efficiency and compliance with the Landfill Directive restricting deposits to just 10% by 2035. In relation to the waste sector, the existing policies scenario already assumes compliance with the target set out in the Landfill Directive, and as such, the projection for this sector are identical in both in the existing policies as well as in the additional policies scenarios. In the same timeframe, the residential, industrial and agriculture sectors have lower decarbonisation potential. Even so, the residential sector could contribute with a reduction of 23% by 2030 (around 27% by 2040) and the industrial sector with 42% (around 47% in 2040). For the agricultural sector, figures show a reduction of 3% by 2030. Taking into account the effect of agricultural land and pasture, reductions could reach 22% by this time. With regard to F-gases, the relevance of which terms of emissions has increased in recent years, reductions are expected of around 20% by 2030 and 52% by 2040. As was the case in the waste sector, compliance with the targets set out in the Kigali Amendment are also assumed in the F-gases sector, and as such, the projections for this sector are identical in both in the existing policies as well as in the additional policies scenarios. However, additional policy measures need to be considered for the majority of sectors, so as to achieve a more ambitious low-carbon trajectory, allowing carbon neutrality to be reached by 2050.  4.2.2. Energy from renewable sources  ii. Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in each of these sectors Further to Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April introducing the requirement for EU members to submit a plan to promote the use of energy from renewable sources, Portugal prepared and submitted its first National Action Plan for Renewable Energy (PNAER) in 2010. The commitment in this plan was to achieve the objectives set in the Directive and to reach the overall target of 31.0% of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption, the fifth most ambitious target in the EU-28, and 10.0% of renewable energy sources in final energy consumption in transport. Portugal has seen good progress in compliance with objectives for 2020. In 2018, the incorporation of renewable energy sources into gross final energy consumption is expected to be around 30.3%. This is a reduction of 0.3 p.p. with respect to figures for 2017 and 3.0 p.p. above the indicative trajectory, meaning that Portugal has already achieved around 98% of its target for 2020. The following figure shows the evolution in the share of renewable energy sources in gross final energy consumption in 2005 and 2018.      NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4.
