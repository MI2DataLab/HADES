The projects concern the construction of an island in the North Sea which will serve as a hub for offshore wind power production in the North Sea and the island could be connected to the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany and possibly other countries as well. The project is still in the initial stage where feasibility studies on a wide range of topics are being conducted to determine whether to take the project to the next stage. The project is part of ENTSO--Year Network Development Plan 2018. If final decision on investment is made, the project will probably be constructed in steps. Moreover, the Government is investigating the potential for Denmark to construct the first energy island by 2030, with a minimum of 10 GW connected.   A number of other interconnectors are approaching their end-of-life, and consequently a decision whether to reinvest, build a brand new interconnector or invest in something else should be taken  4.5.2 Energy transmission infrastructure (i) Key characteristics of the existing transmission infrastructure for electricity and gas61 Electricity Denmark is divided into two price areas, Western Denmark (DK1) and Eastern Denmark (DK2) separated by Storebælt. Western Denmark is connected and is operated in synchrony with the continental European grid and Eastern Denmark runs in synchrony with the Nordic grid. Western and Eastern Denmark are only connected through the Storebælt-interconnector. Table 13 and Table 14 show detailed information.  Table 13.

The gas grid is connected to natural gas fields in the North Sea and the international gas market through three entry/exit points (Nybro, Ellund and Dragør) where all natural gas enters Denmark.   Natural gas can be supplied to domestic consumers using the transmission and distribution grid. The transmission tariff varies depending on where shippers book entry and/or exit capacity.   Energinet has fully implemented the network code on harmonised transmission tariff structures for gas (TAR NC) with the approval of the methods by the Danish Utility Regulator in May 2019, and as of October 2019, the tariffs will be in accordance with the TAR NC. Henceforth, regular method approvals by the Danish Utility Regulator of the tariff structures will be carried out.   Characteristics of the Danish gas system   Transmission grid, length: approx. 900 km  The transmission grid is connected to the distribution network via 42 M/R stations, systems  4 metering stations  (ii) Projections of network expansion requirements at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)62 Onshore wind along with solar power are constituting a more and more substantial part of the energy mix so the growing need for the integration of these energy sources is also reflected in the need for expansion of the transmission grid.  In terms of domestic heating, the expected large-scale implementation of heat pumps is also expected to have a major impact on the requirements of the future transmission grid.                                                            62 With reference to national network development plans and regional investment plans of TSOs.         162  The maps below show some of the possible future transmission grids as expected by Energinet, however these possible grid structures have not received approval, they only represents how the Danish TSO expects the transmission grid to develop.  Figure 38. Possible electricity transmission grid structure by 2027 drafted by the Danish TSO, Energinet (Energinet, 2018)               163  Figure 39. Electricity transmission grid structure by 2040 (Danish TSO, Energinet) (Energinet, 2018)  The Danish gas pipeline network is well developed and there are currently no plans for further network expansion besides the ongoing Baltic Pipe Project. Baltic Pipe (BP) is a project between the Polish TSO  GazSystem  and the Danish TSO  Energinet  with the objective to transport gas from Norway to Poland via Denmark. In order to ensure sufficient transport capacity, the Danish transmission system needs to be expanded as part of the project.   Baltic Pipe will include the following technical systems and installations:  A 105--pipe II in the North Sea to a receiving terminal located on shore in Denmark.  Expansion of the Danish transmission system with a new gas pipeline, approximately 210-230 km long.   A compressor station in the south-east part of Zealand.          164   A 260-310 km long offshore gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Poland. The Polish TSO - GAZ-SYSTEM - is in charge of establishing and operate the gas pipeline across the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Poland.     The final investment decision was made in 2018, and the pipeline is scheduled to come on stream by October 2022. 4.5.3 Electricity and gas markets, energy prices (i) Current situation of electricity and gas markets, including energy prices  Electricity in Denmark is divided into two zones, DK1 (Western DK), DK2 (Eastern DK). For the winter period 2017/2018 (October 2017  March 2018), the average price for the whole of Denmark was 32.8 EUR/MWh  DK1 31.4 EUR/MWh   DK2 was 34.2 EUR/MWh (Energitilsynet, 2017)  Electricity in 2017 was:    electricity production 29 Twh   electricity import 5 Twh   electricity production including grid losses 34 Twh  Gas prices in 2017 showed that:   average gas prices for households consumers excluding taxes and levies accounted for 0,456 MEUR/ktoe  average gas prices for industrial users excluding taxes and levies accounted for 0,278 MEUR/ktoe   Gas production in 2017 including bio natural gas was 2,65 bio Nm3            165  (ii) Projections of development with existing policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)  Figure 40 2019 to 2040.
