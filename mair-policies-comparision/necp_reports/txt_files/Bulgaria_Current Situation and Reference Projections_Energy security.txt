4.4 Energy security dimension i. Current energy mix, domestic energy resources, import dependency, including relevant risks  Current energy mix According to 2018 data of the National Statistical Institute (published in January 2020), the production of primary energy in Bulgaria in 2018 was 11 910 ktoe and met 63 % of the gross inland consumption; its structure remained comparatively unchanged in recent years and its dynamics was driven by domestic energy consumption. In the structure of primary energy production by type of fuel and energy, solid fuels (indigenous lignite and brown coal) have the highest share of 43.1 %, followed by nuclear energy with a share of 35.0 %. The breakdown of the other fuels and energy is as follows: renewable energy at 21.5 %, natural gas at 0.2 % and liquid fuels at 0.2 %.

The import of electricity also decreased by 40.0 % and the import of liquid fuels (oil and petroleum products) and natural gas also decreasing by 15.5 % and 4.9 %, respectively. An increase was registered in the import of solid fuels and fuels from renewable sources and biofuels by 1.1 % and 34.7 %, respectively. In 2018, imports of fuels and energy in Bulgaria stood at 4 662 ktoe. Liquid fuels and electricity had the largest shared of 76.9 % and 18.5 %, respectively. The breakdown of the remaining fuels is as follows: fuels from renewable sources and biofuels, solid fuels, and natural had a share of 4.0 %, 0.4 % and 0.2 %, respectively.

Liquid fuels had the highest share in the structure of final energy consumption (36.3 %), followed by electricity (26.4 %). The breakdown of the other fuels and energy is as follows: renewable energy from renewable sources  14.4 %; natural gas  13.3 %; energy for heating  5.5 %; and solid fuels and non-renewable waste  4.1 %.

An increase was registered in the sectors of Services, Agriculture and Transport by 5.5 %, 4.5 % and 1.4 %, respectively.  In 2018, the Transport sector had a share of 34.6 % in final energy consumption and retained its 10-year position of a leading sector in final energy consumption, followed by  the Industry sector with a share of 28.0 %. The shares in final energy consumption of the Household, Services and Agriculture sectors were 22.9 %, 12.6 % and 1.9 % respectively. The structure of final energy consumption by sector in 2018 was identical to that in 2017.   208  Figure 53: Structure of final energy consumption by sector, %  Industry 28.0 % Transport 34.6 % Services 12.6 % Households 22.9 % Agriculture 1.9 % Source: NSI data for 2018  With a 36.3 % share in 2018, liquid fuels which are mainly used in road transport (83 %) were the most common energy carrier in final energy consumption. In 2018, electricity consumption stood at 2 570 ktoe, with a share of 26.4 % in final energy consumption. In 2018, renewable energy use increased by 1.6 %. The main renewable energy source in Bulgaria, primarily used in the heating and cooling sector, is biomass. In 2018, the share of liquid fuels in final energy consumption increased by 5.0 % and the share of energy for heating decreased by 18.0 % on account of, among other things, the warmer winter. The shares of solid fuels, non-renewable waste and natural gas decreased by 4.4 %, 2.7 % and 3.9 %.

According to Ministry of Energy data for 2018, gross electricity generation stood at 46.7  Thermal power plants (TPPs) had the highest share of 40 %in electricity generation in 2018, followed by the Nuclear power plant (NPP) with a share of 35 %, renewable energy plants with a share of 16 %, district heating plants with a share of t 5 %, factory thermal power plants with a share of 2 % and pumped-storage hydropower plants with a share of 2 %.

The main energy sources of energy generation are solid fuels and nuclear energy.  The power plants using indigenous coal account for approximately 48 % of total of the Bulgarian economy. Indigenous coal can provide resources for electricity generation in the next 60 years.  Nuclear energy is a key energy carrier that ensures base electricity generation at predictable and competitive prices. The Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plan generates more than 33    210  Renewable energy is the third most important local energy resource and its use has been increasing in recent years. The main reason is associated with the higher deployment of biomass and solar and wind energy in electricity generation.  import dependency According to Eurostat data, in 2gross final consumption stood at 39.5 % and was much lower than the average figure for the EU Member States (55.1 %). This is due to the methodology adopted by Eurostat, according to which nuclear energy is reported as indigenous energy source.   relevant risks source of supply. In connection with this, Bulgaria has taken steps to diversify the sources and routes for supply of natural gas.  ii. Development projections with existing policies and measures until at least 2040 (including the year 2030) In accordance with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 two scenarios  WAM (with additional policy measures) and WEM (with existing policy measures)  have been developed. The projections set out in this section are solely based on existing national and EU policy measures. The targets set in the INECP will not be achieved with existing measures. The WEM scenario has been developed as a basis for comparison to the WAM scenario (in which the national targets will be achieved). The latter is described in detail in points 2 and 3 and in Annex I to this Plan. rts increases from 37.37 % to 39.65 % in the period 2020-2030. This is largely due to an increase in natural gas imports as a result of higher primary energy generation using natural gas, particularly after 2025. However, this is partially offset by the fact that Bulgaria remains a net dependence on imports is it is a net importer of liquid fuels, with the share of imports projected at approximately 60 % for the period 2020-203dependence on energy import is still lower in comparison to other Member States. From 2030 onwards, dependence on imports will begin to improve on account of lower gross consumption, lowering the trend and reaching 36.52 % in 2040, which will have a positive impact on dependence on import.   211  Figure 56: Energy dependence )%), WEM  Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling  Figure 57: Net import by type of fuel (%), WEM  Solid fuels Natural gas Biomass Oil and petroleum products Electricity  Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling  Energy generation from local fuels Electricity generation under the WEM scenario is projected to decrease by 8 562 GWh. This is largely attributable to the projected continual decrease of energy production from solid fuels over the period 2020-2040 and the fact that no new lignite coal plants will be commissioned, meaning that in 2040 their capacity will be only 3 315 GWh. In 2040, nuclear power is also expected to play an important part in energy production, with a share of nearly 70 %. The share of biomass has been continually increasing on account of a growing number of power plants using biomass in fuel blends.  The shares of wind power and geothermal power will remain the same while natural gas is projected to increase from 1.1 % in 2020 to 2.3 % in 2040. The share of solar power is also projected to increase from 1.2 % in 2020 to 4 % in 2040.    212  Figure 58: Primary energy production, WEM  Solid fuels Nuclear fuel Wind power Oil and petroleum products Hydropower Solar and other types of energy Natural gas Biomass Geothermal power Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling  Electricity generation by plant type Electricity generation will increase from 43 949 GWh in 2020 to 50 957 GWh in 2040, with the share of electricity generated by gas-powered plants projected to increase more than twofold between 2025 and 2030. The share of solar power is also projected to increase nearly twofold over the same period. There has been a significant decrease in electricity generation by waste incineration plants in keeping with the downward trend in the production of fossil fuels and the increase in energy generated from renewable sources. Nuclear power will continue to play an important part in electricity generation, particularly after 2035 when a new nuclear power plant is expected to be commissioned.
