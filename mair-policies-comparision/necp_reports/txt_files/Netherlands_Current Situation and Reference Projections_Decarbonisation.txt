In 2018, emissions based on preliminary statistics amounted to over 189 megatons of CO2 equivalents (excluding LULUCF), 15% below the 1990 level. This decrease is largely due to a decrease in non-CO2 greenhouse gases, to a large extent in industry and to a lesser extent in agriculture. CO2 emissions decreased between 1990 and 2018 by circa 2 megatons. Where the total emissions of greenhouse gases increased in 2015 and 2016 compared to previous years, a decrease was observed in 2017 and 2018. Compared to 2016, emissions in 2017 were approximately 1% lower, and more than 3% lower in 2018. This decrease is mainly due to a reduction in CO2 emissions in the electricity sector. In recent years, more natural gas has been used at the expense of coal and more renewable energy generated. Emissions of LULUCF decreased slightly between 1990 and 2017, from 6.1 in 1990 to 5.6 megatons of CO2 equivalents in 2016 (see below for a more detailed explanation). These figures were not included in Figures 4.5 and 4.6. Forecast of national emissions of greenhouse gases (excluding LULUCF) Greenhouse gases to decrease up to and including 2020 In the policy variant of "adopted policies" national greenhouse gas emissions decrease to 171 [165-180] megatons of CO2 equivalents in 2020 (see Figure 4.6). This means a decrease of over 22 megatons of CO2 equivalents between 2017 and 2020. Of this expected decrease, almost 19 megatons of CO2 equivalents are due to developments in the electricity sector (see Table 4.3). Electricity generation using coal and gas in the Netherlands is expected to decrease sharply between 2017 and 2020 due to four factors: 1. The growth of renewable electricity generation in the Netherlands; 2. Increasing electricity imports due to greater interconnection capacity with Germany and Denmark (see section 4.5.1); 3. A declining generation capacity due to closure of the coal-fired power plants on the Maasvlakte (mid-2017) and the Hemweg power plant (before 2020); 4. The use of coal and/or gas-fired power plants affected by falling coal and gas prices between 2017 and 2020 and an increasing CO2 price during this period. Greenhouse gas emissions from industry are expected to fall between 2017 and 2020 by less than 1 megaton of CO2 equivalents. There are various trends within industry. Emissions from refineries are expected to rise slightly up to and including 2020, partly due to an increase in the desulphurisation of marine fuels. In industry, emissions are expected to fall until 2020 due to the effects of energy savings and the use of biomass. In the built-up environment (households and services), emissions are expected to fall by almost 2 megatons of CO2 equivalents between 2017 and 2020. The largest decrease is expected to occur within households. This is actually the effect of the additional savings policy such as the "10 petajoule task-setting agreement", the ISDE and measures in the owner-occupier and rental sector. Emissions are falling in the services sector too, due to the effect of a number of saving measures. In the mobility sector, emission reductions between 2017 and 2020 are limited on balance due to a combination of different developments. Emissions in agriculture also hardly change between 2017 and 2020 (a reduction of <1 Mton CO2 equivalents during this period applies to both sectors). Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    Figure 4.6 Historical and expected greenhouse gas emissions for the period 1990-2030 per sector (excl. LULUCF) (Sources: CBS et al 2019a (situation) and KEV (forecasts with adopted policies)) Megaton CO2 equivalents  1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 - Forecast of greenhouse gas emissions between 2020 and 2030 During the period after 2020, national greenhouse gas emissions are expected to fall even further, with adopted policies. Between 2020 and 2030, emissions are expected to decrease by almost 26 megatons of CO2 equivalents, to 145 [136-159] megatons. This results in emission reductions for 2030 of 35% compared to 1990. The decrease in emissions after 2020 is mainly explained by the expected developments in the electricity sector. Emissions in this sector will decrease from 30 to 14 megatons of CO2 equivalents between 2020 and 2030 (see Table 4.3). Until 2029, emissions from the electricity sector are expected to decrease relatively modestly, mainly due to an increase in renewable electricity generation, but also an increase in electricity exports. In 2030, emissions will subsequently fall sharply due to the closure of the last three remaining coal-fired power plants in the Netherlands. Greenhouse gas emissions from all other sectors are also expected to fall until 2030 with the adopted policies. The biggest decrease is anticipated in the built-up environment with almost 4 megatons of CO2 equivalents due to energy-saving measures. Emissions in industry will fall by almost 3 megatons of CO2 equivalents during this period. This is due to a limited decrease at refineries and the extraction of oil and natural gas. Industry emissions are expected to remain more or less unchanged because an increase in the chemical sector is offset by a decrease in the food, paper and construction sectors. Furthermore, the expected emissions from agriculture and mobility will each decrease by around 2 megatons of CO2 equivalents between 2020 and 2030. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    Table 4.3 Achieved and expected greenhouse gas emissions per climate platform (in Mton CO2 equivalents) (Sources: Emission registration (situation) and KEV (forecasts with adopted policies)   Emissions forecast uncertain, mainly due to variability in electricity generation The bandwidth of a 19 to 26% reduction in 2020 and a 28 to 39% reduction in 2030 indicates that there is considerable uncertainty. The biggest uncertainties are in the field of national electricity generation in coal and gas-fired power plants. Developments abroad also have a major impact on the Netherlands and involve considerable uncertainties. Another relevant uncertainty is energy demand trends in end-use sectors. This is partly related to economic growth and the rate of energy savings. The degree to which there may be a relatively cold or indeed warm heating year is also a significant uncertainty impacting emissions in a given year. Trends and forecast for greenhouse gas emissions in EU ETS sectors ETS emissions trend Between 2005 and 2012, emissions produced by Dutch businesses participating in the European emissions trading system fluctuated around 80 megatons of CO2 equivalents. In 2013, ETS emissions increased sharply, due mainly to an administrative reallocation of activities (with emissions) from non-ETS to ETS. In 2015 and 2016, total ETS emissions increased to around 94 megatons of CO2 equivalents due to high emissions in the electricity sector. In 2017 and 2018, total ETS emissions subsequently decreased to 91 and 87 megatons of CO2 equivalents, respectively. This decrease was due to a reduction in emissions from the electricity sector resulting from less electricity generated by coal and more from natural gas. Since 2015, ETS emissions from industry have risen to a limited extent, partly due to favourable economic conditions. ETS emissions are expected to decrease leading up to 2020 and 2030 It is expected that ETS emissions will fall by 18 megatons of CO2 equivalents from the 2017 level, to 73 [69-80] megatons in 2020 (see Figure 4.7). This fall is being caused by the reduction in electricity generated using coal and gas (see the explanation provided above). After 2020, ETS emissions are set to continue to fall to 56 [51-66] megatons of CO2 equivalents by 2030. This considerable reduction will mainly be due to a decrease of 16 megatons in electricity generation in the 2020-2030 period (closure of coal-fired power plants and a larger share of renewable energy). ETS emissions from industry are expected to fall by one megaton of CO2 equivalents between 2020 and 2030 (from 43 to 42 megatons).

This includes emissions from mobility, almost all emissions from the built-up environment, the largest share from agriculture and a limited share from industry (emissions from land use are not covered by the N-ETS targets). For the 2013-2020 period, the N-ETS targets and regulation have been established in the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD). For the Netherlands the ESD emission reduction target is 16% in 2020 compared to 2005. For the period 2021-2030, the Dutch N-ETS challenge is included in the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR). In the ESR, the Netherlands' emission reduction target is 36% in 2030 compared to 2005. Based on these two reduction challenges, two series (2013-2020 and 2021-2030) were derived with annual ceilings of permitted quantities of emissions. These annual ceilings must then be added up per period, which produces a cumulative target per period. The objective in the ESD relates to a series of annual ceilings of the permitted amount of emissions between 2013 and 2020, which collectively make up the cumulative target for the whole period. The maximum permitted cumulative emissions for the Netherlands under the ESD for the 2013-2020 period amount to 921 megatons in CO2 equivalents. For the 2021-2030 period, new targets have been agreed upon within the framework of the new ESR. For the Netherlands, this is 36%, which is expected to lead to permitted cumulative emissions of 879 megatons. Downward trend of non-ETS emissions Non-ETS emissions have fallen from 134 megatons of CO2 equivalents in 2005 to 108 megatons in 2013 (see Figure 4.8). The decrease in the period 2005-2013 is mainly due to the fact that N-ETS emissions from industry have fallen by around 20 megatons of CO2 equivalents. Reductions were also achieved in the electricity generation (3 megatons) and mobility (4 megatons) sectors during that period. In 2013, ETS emissions fell sharply due, for example, to an administrative reallocation of activities (with emissions) from non-ETS to ETS. Between 2015 and 2018, N-ETS emissions stabilised at around 102 megatons of CO2 equivalents. Emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases also significantly decreased during this period, namely by 8 megatons, primarily due to reduction measures in relation to the production of nitric acid. EU obligation for non-ETS for 2013-2020 well within reach A further decrease to 98 megatons of CO2 equivalents is expected in the 2018-2020 period. This decrease is mainly due to a reduction in the built-up environment (7 megatons) and industry and mobility (both less than 2 megatons) (see Table 4.4). The maximum permitted cumulative emissions for the Netherlands for the 2013-2020 period amount to 921 megatons of CO2 equivalents. Based on adopted policies, the cumulative estimated emissions for this period amount to 814 megatons of CO2 equivalents. This means the estimate is well below the mandatory cumulative emission ceiling (Figure 4.8). 100  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    Table 4.4 Emissions of non-ETS greenhouse gases 2005 to 2030 inclusive based on adopted policies (in megatons of CO2 equivalents; excluding LULUCF; scope according to the third ETS trading period from 2013 to 2020 inclusive) (Sources: Emission registration (situation) and KEV (forecasts))   EU obligation for non-ETS for 2021-2030 The maximum permitted cumulative emissions for the Netherlands for the 2021-2030 period are expected to amount to 891 megatons of CO2 equivalents. Assuming that as a result of adopted policies, the cumulative estimated N-ETS emissions for 2021-2030 amount to 931 megatons of CO2 equivalents, with a deficit remaining (which poses a policy challenge) for the established period of 39 megatons of CO2 equivalents. The calculation for the cumulative target above already implicitly takes into account the possibility of compensating deficits with surpluses between the years (banking and borrowing).

It is expected that CO2 emissions will fall to 23 megatons by 2020 and to almost 19 megatons by 2030 (of which 0.3 megatons fall under the ETS).

This differs from the CRF classification. In this table, emissions from mobile equipment all fall under mobility. In the Appendix, emissions are presented according to the CRF classification. ** Based on preliminary statistics   Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    The decrease among households is the result of a reduction in the consumption of natural gas as a result of insulation measures and the use of more efficient boilers in existing buildings, demolition of existing buildings and the construction of energy-efficient new buildings. The decrease in the services industry is the result of energy savings in existing buildings, demolition, energy-efficient new buildings, reduction in space heating due to global warming, an increase in the use of electric heat pumps instead of boilers fired by natural gas and less use of cogeneration. Industry A limited percentage of greenhouse gas emissions from industry does not fall under the ETS (circa 15 megatons of CO2 equivalents in 2017). The previously cited developments that are significant with regard to the ETS emissions produced by industry are also relevant to the non-ETS emissions. It is expected that the non-ETS CO2 emissions will decrease to approximately 12 megatons in the period up to 2030. This is primarily the result of declining emissions from methane from landfill sites and F-gases, as a result of the implementation of the European regulation on fluorinated greenhouses gases. Mobility Between 1990 and 2008, CO2 emissions increased by roughly 8 megatons due to an increase in domestic traffic and transport as a result of economic growth. Following the economic crisis of 2008, emissions rapidly fell. Despite the economic recovery, emissions have remained more or less stable at around 35 megatons of CO2 equivalents since 2015. The relatively strong growth in transport volumes in 2018 was compensated by a more efficient fleet and the increasing use of biofuels for mobility. Greenhouse gas emissions are expected to fall to 33 megatons of CO2 equivalents in 2030. This decrease is largely due to the more stringent European source policy for CO2 emissions from new vehicles, despite growing traffic volumes. Emissions of greenhouse gases from the combustion of bunker fuels from international aviation and shipping are not included in the national emission totals. Between 2000 and 2006, these emissions increased from 53 to 67 megatons of CO2 equivalents. After that, emissions fell to around 50 megatons in 2016 and 2017. Provisional figures for 2018 show a further decrease to 48 megatons. With adopted policies, this item is expected to grow to 52 megatons of CO2 equivalents in 2030. Sales of bunker fuels to international shipping are expected to remain stable in the coming years. In 2030, greenhouse gas emissions are estimated at 34 megatons [27-40 megatons] and are therefore at the same level as in 2018. A slight increase is expected for sales of bunker fuels to inland waterways shipping. In 2030, emissions of greenhouse gases are estimated at 2.7 megatons of CO2 equivalents [2.1-3.2 megatons]. Total sales of bunker fuels to aviation in 2030 are estimated at 215 petajoules [177-231 petajoules] and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions amount to 15 megatons [13-16 megatons]. Agriculture and horticulture Most of the CO2 emissions from the agricultural sector are produced by the greenhouse horticulture sector. The latter consumes a large amount of energy to heat and light the greenhouses and fertilise them with CO2. Due to an increase in the acreage covered by greenhouses, CO2 emissions increased from less than 8 megatons in 1990 to almost 10 megatons in 2010 (of which 1.8 megatons fell under the ETS at the time). The acreage occupied by greenhouses subsequently decreased by 12%, and CO2 emissions are currently around 7-8 megatons (of which approximately 0.4 megatons fall under the ETS). The CO2 emissions in agriculture and horticulture are expected to remain the same up to 2020, after which they will decrease further to 6 megatons in 2030 (of which 0.3 megatons ETS) due to increasingly more efficient and innovative greenhouses. During the 1990-2018 period, emissions of other greenhouse gases from agriculture and horticulture decreased by almost 6 megatons of CO2 equivalents to 19 megatons of CO2 equivalents. In 2017, emissions of other greenhouse gases  from the agriculture sector were still 0.8 megatons of CO2 equivalents higher than in 2010. This increase was primarily related to the growth of the dairy herd following the abolition of milk quotas at the beginning of 2015 and, to a lesser extent, due to the increased use of fertiliser. This increase is expected to halt once livestock herds shrink as a result of policies from 2017. Provisional figures for 2018 now show a decrease of 0.6 Mton of CO2 equivalents compared with 2017. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030     Trends and forecasts for emissions of greenhouse gases in LULUCF sectors LULUCF emissions are stable In the Netherlands, grasslands, agricultural land and developed land are the principal sources of the so-called Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) emissions. Forests capture net CO2. Net emissions of all land use categories together show a downward trend from 2000 to 2017 from 6.1 to 5.6 megatons of CO2 equivalents per year (Figure 4.12). These emissions consist, in addition to a small contribution of nitrous oxide (0.06 megatons of CO2 equivalents in 2000, increasing to 0.1 megatons of CO2 equivalents in 2017) almost entirely of CO2. A gradual decrease in emissions was observed between 2000 and 2010. From 2010 they have remained stable at an annual level of approximately 5.6 megatons of CO2. The achieved decrease in net emissions in 2000-2017 is the result of decreasing emissions due to changed agricultural land use (smaller acreage, less peatland), an increase as a result of the expansion of the built-up acreage, and a lower net uptake by forests. The uptake by forests gradually decreased in the period 2000-2017, from 2.0 to 1.8 megatons of CO2 equivalents. This decrease is related to increased deforestation and the gradual ageing of the Dutch forest, which means less carbon is captured in existing forests. Emissions from agricultural land use (arable land and grassland) over the period 2000-2017 show a downward trend, from 6.7 to 5.5 megatons of CO2 equivalents. This trend is the result of a decrease in the agricultural acreage and the acreage of peatland. Emissions due to an increase in urban acreage (buildings) have increased during this period from 1.2 to 1.5 megatons of CO2 equivalents. Expected LULUCF emissions Total LULUCF emissions are expected to decrease from 5.6 megatons of CO2 equivalents in 2017 to 5.3 Megatons of CO2 equivalents in 2020. This is due to multiple minor changes. The decrease is mainly caused by: slightly lower emissions from buildings, an increase in carbon capture as a result of afforestation and a decrease in emissions from arable land. Expected total net land use emissions will increase after 2020 to 5.6 megatons of CO2 equivalents in 2030. This increase is the balance of various developments. The KEV expects that emissions from buildings will gradually increase between 2020 and 2030: from 1.5 to 1.7 megatons of CO2 equivalents. This trend is determined by a gradual decrease in the acreage of agricultural land18, a shift from arable land to grassland, and an increase in urban (built-up) acreage. During this period it is also expected that on balance forests will capture 0.1 megatons of CO2 equivalents fewer of greenhouse gases. Emissions from arable land will increase slightly between 2020 and 2030 from 1.7 to 1.8 megatons of CO2 equivalents. Emissions from grassland will decrease by almost 0.2 megatons of CO2 equivalents during this period, and will amount to 3.5 megatons of CO2 equivalents in 2030. Total net emissions from agricultural land use (arable land, grassland and harvested forest products) will decrease by between 5.5 and 5.4 megatons of CO2 equivalents between 2020 and 2030. The analysis of emissions (debits) and removals (credits) of the current estimate until 2030 shows that at the end of both performance periods under the LULUCF Directive, 2025 and 2030 there is an annual net debit of an average of 0.30 Megatons of CO2 equivalents (2025) and 0.25 Megatons of CO2 equivalents (2030). Therefore, during the first performance period (2021-2025), the net debit is 1.5 Megatons of CO2 equivalents. In the second performance period (2026-2030) 24, this is 1.2 Megatons of CO2 equivalents. It is mainly the "deforested land" category that causes emissions, due to loss of carbon from biomass and humus. The categories "wooded land", "arable land" and "grassland" produce credits.  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030           Figure 4.8 CO2 emissions and capture by LULUCF sectors (Source: PBL, 2019)   4.2.2 Trends and forecasts for renewable energy Historic trend of the share of renewable energy Since 2000, the share of renewable energy, according to the European Renewable Energy Directive (Directive 2009/28/EC) has gradually risen from 1.6% to 7.4% in 2018 (see Figure 4.9). The principal causes for this increase were the introduction of the subsidy schemes for renewable energy (MEP in 2003 and SDE in 2008) and the blending requirement for renewable fuels in transport as of 2007. In 2018, total gross final consumption was 2,100 petajoules, of which 157 petajoules come from renewable energy sources (CBS, 2019b).116 Energy consumption from biomass amounted to 96 petajoules in 2018: 61% of total renewable energy. The contribution of wind energy to the total final consumption of renewable energy in the Netherlands was 23% in 2018 and the contribution of solar power was more than 8%. Geothermal energy and soil energy have demonstrated relatively significant growth in recent years and accounted for more than 5% of final energy consumption from renewable sources in 2018. Outdoor heat accounted for almost 3% of final consumption in 2018. The consumption of renewable electricity has also increased, with renewable electricity from biomass having stabilised in recent years, while electricity generated from wind and solar power sources has rapidly increased. In 2018, gross normalised domestic generation of renewable electricity was 14.9 percent of electricity consumption (CBS, 2019b). The share of renewable heat in total final consumption of energy for heat has gradually increased since 2000 to 6% in 2018 (Statistics Netherlands, 2019b). Since 2005, the share of renewable energy for transport based on the physical consumption of renewable energy gradually increased to 9.5% in 2018 (Statistics Netherlands, 2019b), particularly in the form of biofuels. The achieved share of renewable energy for transport as a result of differences in definition does not run concurrent to the national obligation for companies that supply biofuels. Fuel suppliers, for example, are able to hold administrative stocks. According to the Dutch Emissions Authority (NEa), fuel suppliers have met their national blending obligation for renewable energy (NEa, 2019).  Forecast of the development in the share of renewable energy The share of renewable energy will grow substantially in the period up to and including 2030 In the policy variant of exclusively adopted policies the share of renewable energy is set to increase from 6.6% in 2017 to 11.4 [10.4-12.1]% by 2020 (see Figure 4.13). As a result the European target of 14.0% will not be achieved. The target in the Energy Agreement of 16.0% by 2023 will just be achieved: the forecast is 16.1% [14.3-17.0%]. The forecast for 2030 is 24.7% [20.7-26.4%]. On the one hand, additional measures have been put in place within the framework of the 2013 Energy Agreement, such as a higher budget and an ascending target in the transport sector moving toward 2020, but on the other hand, there are setbacks, such as the resistance to wind energy on land, which is difficult to resolve. In addition,                                                  116 These figures are preliminary Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    gross final energy consumption is expected to be higher than estimated in the NEV 2017, while gross renewable energy consumption remains roughly the same. As a result, achieving the targets, which are defined as a ratio between the consumption of renewable energy and the total energy consumption, becomes more difficult.

Consumption of energy from biomass will continue to grow in the coming years, for example as a result of co-fuelling and co-firing in coal-fired power plants rising from 3 petajoules in 2018 to 25 petajoules in 2020. Between 2020 and 2030, biomass consumption is expected to remain fairly constant, although a shift is visible in which the use of biomass in boilers at companies compensates for the loss of co-firing and co-fuelling in coal-fired power plants in due course. The established capacity of wind turbines increased from 4,200 megawatts at the end of 2017 to 4,400 megawatts at the end of 2018. In 2020, the established capacity of onshore wind energy is expected to rise to 4,700 megawatts. By 2023, capacity is expected to increase further to 5,600 megawatts to reach 6,100 megawatts by 2030. The established capacity of offshore wind energy will remain around 1,000 megawatts from 2018 to mid-2020, to subsequently increase tenfold to an expected 10,000 megawatts by 2030. Solar energy consumption (mainly electricity) grew by 40 percent to 13 petajoules in 2018. The established capacity of solar panels for solar power increased in 2018 with a record quantity of more than 1,500 megawatts to a total of 4,400 megawatts. The established capacity is expected to continue to grow to 9,000 megawatts by 2020, 15,000 megawatts by 2023 and 27,000 megawatts by 2030. Solar power is stimulated through several policies that focus on different target groups. A major uncertainty for the continued growth of solar power (up to 2020) is the degree of realisation of SDE+ projects. Based on the degree of realisation for solar-PV projects in the past, it is assumed that approximately two-thirds of the SDE+ grants will actually lead to a solar energy project. It will lead to a bandwidth in established capacity by 2030 between 18,000 megawatts and 36,000 megawatts. This growth also assumes continued, uncapped net-metering until 2030 and the availability of the SDE+ subsidy for large solar power projects. The last of the subsidy obligations arising under the SDE+ grant scheme up to 2020 is not set to expire until 2040. After 2023, solar power will grow from 27.8 to 56.2 petajoules during the period up to and including 2035, and heat pumps, from 16.7 to 35.7 petajoules, with each technique more than doubling. These technologies are largely promoted outside of the SDE+ grant scheme, including through the ISDE. In addition, the increase of heat pumps beyond 2020 will also be supported by stricter requirements for new residential properties aiming for nearly zero-energy homes. See Figure 4.14 for a distribution per technology (2000-2030). Further growth of the share  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    of renewable energy beyond 2023 depends on new policies such as the expansion of the SDE+ grant scheme (see Chapter 3). The expected share of renewable energy in gross electricity consumption is expected to almost double from 14.9% in 2018 to over 29.8% by 2020 due to these developments. By 2030, the share of renewable energy in electricity generation is expected to rise to around 73%. Renewable energy consumption in the built-up environment is expected to rise significantly in the years to come. This is due to the increased use of heat pumps in new buildings as a result of building regulations and more stringent energy performance requirements. In addition, more heat pumps are being installed in existing buildings as a result of the Sustainable Energy Investment Subsidy scheme (ISDE) and the rolling out of "zero on the meter" renovations in rental properties. Outdoor heat and soil energy are expected to double from 12 petajoules in 2020 to 24 petajoules by 2030. Deep geothermal energy from 7 petajoules in 2020 to 24 petajoules in 2030. The least growth is expected to be seen in fermentation techniques, where consumption will rise from 12 petajoules in 2020 to 16 petajoules by 2030. Renewable heat accounted for 6.3% of the heat supply in 2018. According to the KEV, this share will double and rise to 13 percent by 2030. The production of renewable gas which is fed into the gas network, and used exclusively in the transport sector, is expected to increase from 107 million m³ in 2018 to 190 million m³ by 2020 and 325 million m³ by 2030. This amounts to 1.1% of total gas consumption.Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    Figure 4.10 Development of renewable energy technologies with adopted policies (Source: PBL, 2019a). Petajoules  -------------------------------------   2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030  Bio transport fuels  Soil energy, outdoor heat and geothermal energy  Incineration and fermentation of biomass  Solar power and solar heat  Offshore wind energy  Onshore wind energy  Hydropower and osmosis Renewable energy in mobility The use of biofuels in transport will increase due to the increasingly strict annual obligation for renewable energy for transport up to 2020. The use of biofuels for domestic mobility is expected to grow from 23 petajoules in 2018 to 37 petajoules [30-42 petajoules] in 2020. The use of biofuels between 2021 and 2030 is estimated at around 35 petajoules per year. The growing use of biofuels for transport is partly due to the introduction of E10 on the Dutch market. From October 2019, petrol stations will be obliged to supply E10 if they have at least two petrol refuelling points. E10 is a fuel mixture that contains up to ten percent ethanol. As a result, the use of petrol substitute biofuels should be considerably higher in 2020 than in previous years. However, the use of diesel substitutes must also be considerably higher in order to meet the mandatory 16.4 annual percentage.  Total electricity consumption by mobility amounted to 6.6 petajoules in 2017 and is expected to grow to 8.1 petajoules in 2020 [7.9 to 8.4 petajoules] and 14.3 petajoules [11.3 to 16.2 petajoules] by 2030. Total renewable energy consumption by mobility will grow from 9.5% in 2018 to 13.6% in 2020. No forecast is available for 2030.
