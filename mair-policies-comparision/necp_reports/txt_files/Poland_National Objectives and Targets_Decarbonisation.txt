 II. National objectives and targets - Dimension Decarbonisation 22  2.1. Decarbonisation The objectives and priority lines related to the decarbonisation dimension are set out by sectoral development strategies, primarily by:  State Environmental Policy 2030  strategy for development in the area of environment and water management of 16 July 2019  Sustainable Transport Development Strategy 2030 of 24 September 2019  2030 Strategy for Sustainable Development of Agriculture, Rural Areas and Fisheries of 15 October 2019  Draft Polish Energy Policy  strategy for the development of the fuel and energy sector (November 2019). 2.1.1. Greenhouse gas emissions and removals a) emissions in the non-ETS sectors, the annual binding national limits in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/8422 and the commitments under Regulation (EU) 2018/8413; 1. Non-ETS (greenhouse gas emissions from the non-ETS sectors): On the basis of Regulation (EU) 2018/842, the greenhouse gas emission reduction target in the non-ETS sectors has been set at a level of -7% in 2030 as compared with its level in 2005. The non-EU ETS sectors (mainly transport, agriculture, municipal and domestic sector, waste management, as well as non-ETS industrial emissions) are a source of ca. 50% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Poland. For 2020, the Climate and Energy Package sets, inter alia, the EU-wide 20% GHG emission reduction target (compared with 1990), including the target for the non-ETS sectors of -10% as compared with 2005. The ESD (Effort Sharing Decision, or the non-ETS Decision) has set national targets for Member States for 2020, as their contributions to the EU-wide ambition. In accordance with the above regulation, Poland may increase emissions in non-ETS sectors to +14% until 2020 relative to 2005. By adopting the new EU Climate and Energy Policy framework, the EU set a 2030 reduction target for greenhouse gas emissions of 40% relative to 1990, including a target of 30% for non-ETS above target in non-ETS sectors is set out in Annex I to the ESR Regulation4. The proposed 2030 reduction target of - 7% should be considered an ambitious commitment. 2. Share of the LULUCF sector in meeting the 2030 reduction targets in the EU. The LULUCF Regulation sets out the accounting rules (the rules for generating carbon credits to be possibly used to account for national emissions of greenhouse gases in the non-ETS sector) based on the net balances of emissions and removals of greenhouse gases for utilised forest land, cropland, grassland and afforested and deforested land from 2021 to 2030. In the LULUCF Regulation, the Member States have been proposed the maximum values of the generated credits (accounting allocations) from the managed forest land category. These allocations have been limited to 3.5% of the national emission of a given Member State in the base year. As part of the mechanism of credit generation  II. National objectives and targets - Dimension Decarbonisation 23  the reference levels must be taken into account as the minimum removal value for managed forest land. Reaching these minimum values will be a condition for generating credits, if any. The reference levels will be set in line with the forest stock development scenarios prepared on the basis of the effect of forest practices observed in the period 2000-2009, which are being developed at the national level. The National Forestry Accounting Plan, developed by the Ministry of the Environment in 2018, is the relevant document in this respect. The National Forestry Accounting Plan lists the detailed actions to be taken to implement Article 4 of the LULUCF Regulation. The LULUCF Regulation has also introduced a mechanism for compensating possible emissions from managed forest land in case the country does not reach a removal value equivalent to the reference level. Nevertheless, its operation has been based only on a single limited parameter, namely the afforestation rate of the Member State (the average afforestation rate for the reference period 2000-2009). Poland has been allocated a compensation limit for 10 years (2021-2030) amounting to -22.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (this is the total maximum limit that can be used over a period of 10 years). Poland does not rule out the use of the ESR/LULUCF flexibility mechanism. For cropland and grassland, the proposed base level for accounting purposes is the average value from the years 2005-2009. On average, it will total ca. 1500 kt of CO2 equivalent for the entire accounting period  this is a preliminary value (consistent with the National Inventory Reports submitted to the UNFCCC Secretariat). Only the accounts of afforesting/deforesting balances and harvested wood products (with the exclusion of paper) will not be limited, either by the allocation or by the reference level. b) If applicable, other national objectives and targets consistent with existing long-term low emission strategies. If applicable, other objectives and targets, including sector targets and adaptation goals. 1. Efforts to mitigate national greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2 The effects of climate change observable in the last few decades are deepening, especially as regards the increase in frequency and severity of extreme weather phenomena. Thus, they pose a threat to social and economic development and to natural resources. It is therefore necessary to take further measures to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and, in parallel, to exercise efforts to adapt to the anticipated impacts of climate change. As regards measures to reduce GHG emissions, the State Environmental Policy 2030 acknowledges the reasonableness of  Among the indicators of the delivery of the State Environmental Policy 2030, the Policy points to reducing the nationwide dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions to 77.1% compared to the reference year 1990. The draft Energy Policy of Poland until 2040 envisages a 30% reduction of domestic CO2 emissions by 2030 (compared to 1990). 2. Reduction of the negative impact of transport on the environment, as envisaged by the Sustainable Transport Development Strategy 2030: - 2025 intermediate target  reduction of average CO2 emissions from new  II. National objectives and targets - Dimension Decarbonisation 24  passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 15% compared to 2021; - main target  from 2030, reduction of average CO2 emissions from new passenger cars by 37.5% and light commercial vehicles by 31% compared to 2021; These targets strengthen pressure to move away from vehicles with conventional combustion engines and to switch to clean vehicles (and to minimise the effects of the development of the transport sector on the environment, including among other things to slow down the increase in greenhouse gas emissions). The task of reducing emissions in the transport sector will be even more challenging given the fact that further significant growth in transport volumes, especially freight transport, is envisaged both in Poland and throughout the EU as an unavoidable effect of continued economic growth. The expected emission reduction will require both the optimisation of transport needs, and the use of the potential of the transport system and an increase in the use of alternative fuels. 3. Improving the quality of the environment and environmental safety, with account taken of the principles of sustainable development until 2030, by implementing the State Environmental Policy 2030, which will produce, inter alia, the following effects: increasing the Environmental Performance Index8 to > 70 points compared to 64.11 points in 2018, improved status of surface and underground water bodies, the percentage of population using a sewerage system relative to the total population increased to 85% from 70.5% (in 2017). the percentage of population using a sewage treatment plant increased to 86% from 73.6% (in 2017), achieving the limit and target values for substances defined in Directives 2008/50/EC and 2004/107/EC, and maintaining them in the areas in which they have been met, and in the case of PM2.5, also the exposure concentration limit and the National Exposure Reduction Target, achieving, by 2030, the levels of substance concentrations in the air specified by the WHO and meeting new requirements under legal regulations proposed in EU laws. total reduction of the number of zones with exceedances of the limit value for PM10, increasing the number of agglomerations and cities with more than 100,000 residents where the average exposure indicator does not exceed the PM2.5 exposure 3 to 30 compared to the base level of 11 cities, reducing the share of degraded areas in the total area of the country. 4. Adaptation to climate change by ensuring sustainable management of                                             8 Environmental Performance Index, https://epi.envirocenter.yale.edu/. The Environmental Performance Index consists of a series of measures of environmental health (e.g. air quality, water status, environmental impact on human health) and the health and vitality of ecosystems (e.g. wastewater treatment, nitrate pollution, changes to afforestation, fish stocks, species protection, level of GHG emissions).  II. National objectives and targets - Dimension Decarbonisation 25  environmental resources and the effective functioning of the economy and society in climate change conditions through the implementation of the State Environmental Policy 2030, which will produce, inter alia, the following effects: - the percentage of inhabitants of Polish cities covered by urban adaptation plans increased to 60% (compared to the base value of 0% in 2015); - the capacity of small retention reservoirs increased to approx. 844 836 dam3 (compared to the base level of 826 034.2 dam3 in 2016), - increasing the afforestation rate in Poland to 31% from the current 29.6%; - progress towards sustainable forest management, by increasing from 95.7% to 99% the share of forest areas subject to approved forest management documentation relative to the total forest area, - covering 100% of Natura 2000 areas with conservation task plans and protection plans, - level of municipal waste prepared for reuse and recycling at 60% by weight.   5. Reducing emissions of anthropogenic pollutants into the atmosphere: sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), ammonia (NH3), and fine particular matter (PM2.5) by 2030. Directive 2016/2284 of 14 December 2016 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants, amending Directive 2003/35/EC and repealing Directive 2001/81/EC (NEC Directive) obliges Poland to achieve its pollution reduction targets in two periods, namely 2020-2029 and from 2030 (relative to the reference year 2005). The targets are as follows: - 59% and 70% for SO2, - 30% and 39% for NOx, - 25% and 26% for NMVOC, - 1% and 17% for NH3, - 16% and 58% for PM2.5, 6. Reduction of the share of coal and lignite in electricity production to 56-60% in 2030 and further decreasing trend until 2040 At present, the share of coal and lignite in electricity generation is ca. 77%. The share of coal-fired generation units will gradually decrease as a result of the decommissioning of old end-of-life conventional generation units which do not meet the environmental requirements in terms of pollution emissions (BAT conclusions), and the deployment of high-efficiency conventional technologies. The implementation of technologies that are characterised by high efficiency of energy generation and reduce losses (e.g. in transmission) will add considerably to sustainable use of energy resources and reduction of pollutant emissions. The need to replace production technologies will gradually increase the share of low- and zero-emission technologies, in particular RES and nuclear power. Given the Polish conditions, gas will be a crucial transformational fuel in the transition period, with its importance growing not only in power generation (reserve power units for RES), but also in heating (district and individual heating) and  II. National objectives and targets - Dimension Decarbonisation 26  transport (as an alternative fuel). As an effect of changes in the electricity generation sector, CO2 emissions will decrease. In the energy transition process, a key point is to ensure that investments are financed in line with the principle of technological neutrality, without limiting the possibility of obtaining financing for any zero-emission technologies, and in the transitional period, low-emission technologies.   7. Just energy transition towards decarbonisation In Poland, the medium- and long-term energy transition will proceed in an evolutionary manner, such as to guarantee energy security, and at an acceptable pace from the social, economic and regional perspective. Care will be exercised to carry out this process in the most equitable way and at the lowest possible cost. Poland is in a specific situation compared to other EU countries due to a different starting point, economic, energy and technological conditions, reduction potential and financial capabilities. In the case of Poland, the costs of energy transition will be among the highest of all EU Member States. The decarbonisation strategies in individual sectors will rely on a balanced approach, taking into account the need to protect the competitiveness of the Polish economy and its individual sectors, as well as the social dimension, by reducing disproportionate costs of the transition, especially among low-income earners. The above activities will affect the labour supply in related sectors, the welfare of Polish regions, and the wealth of the whole society. Energy transition is a major challenge in Polish conditions, but also an economic opportunity for investment, economic growth and employment, producing concrete benefits such as diversification of the energy mix, cleaner air, local economic development, and jobs. The success of this process depends on a suitable adaptation policy, supported by domestic and European funds. 2.1.2. Renewable energy (2030 Framework Target) a) Planned share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption in 2030 as a contribution to the binding EU target being at least 32% in 2030. As part of meeting the EU-wide 2030 target, Poland declares to achieve a 21%-23% share of RES in gross final energy consumption (aggregate consumption in the electricity sector, heating and cooling sector, as well as for transport purposes) by 2030, with a proviso that attaining the 23% will be possible if Poland is granted additional EU funds, inter alia for just transition. The scale of use of RES will largely depend on technological progress  both in the area of existing energy generation methods and entirely new technologies, but also in the area of energy storage technologies. By 2030, the share of RES in the heating and cooling sector is estimated to grow on average by 1.1 percentage points annually, i.e. to 28.4%. In transport, a 14% share of renewable energy is expected to be achieved by 2030, while that in the energy sector is bound to grow to around 32% by the same  II. National objectives and targets - Dimension Decarbonisation 27  year. Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of renewable energy obliges Poland to achieve a minimum 15% share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption by 2020. In 2018, the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption in Poland was 11%. Having regard to the progress in the development of RES to date, the national commitment concerning 2030 should be regarded as ambitious. b) Linear trajectory of the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption in the period 2021-2030. Provided that additional financial support from EU funds is available, the trajectory for achieving the 23% renewable energy share in gross final energy consumption may be as follows:  Base year 2015: 15%  2022 16.4%  2025: 18.4%  2027: 20.2% c) Trajectories of the sectorial share of renewable energy in final energy consumption in the electricity, heating and cooling and transport sectors in the period 2021-2030. Given the detailed nature of the data, it is presented in the analytical material: Annex 2 to the NECP  2, Chapter 5.1.2.2. Renewable energy). d) Trajectories by renewable energy technology that are projected to be used to achieve the overall and sectorial trajectories for renewable energy from 2021 to 2030, including expected total gross final energy consumption per technology and sector in Mtoe and total planned installed capacity (divided by new capacity and repowering) per technology and sector in MW. e) Trajectories on bioenergy demand, disaggregated between heat, electricity and transport, and on biomass supply, by feedstocks and origin (distinguishing between domestic production and imports). For forest biomass, an assessment of its source and impact on the LULUCF sink Given the detailed nature of the data, it is presented in the analytical material: Annex 2 to the NECP - 2, Chapter 5.1.2.2. Renewable energy). 1. As regards forest biomass, the main energy sources include round or cleft wood, rootwood and wood residues from forests and tree stands, as well as wood processing industry by-products. In the context of accounting for and reporting greenhouse gas emissions from forest biomass used for energy purposes, it should be noted that it is included when accounting for and reporting the balance of removals and emissions of those gases as part of the forest land category. Emissions relating to forest biomass utilised for energy purposes are reported and accounted for as an effect of woodland biomass loss. 2. Potential of biomass used for energy purposes Approximately 13% of the5 domestic biomass potential can be allocated for energy purposes without causing adverse effects in the form of soil degradation and a decrease in the supply of food while complying with the environmental protection requirements under the Common Agricultural Policy. The energy potential of agricultural biomass in Poland, which includes both special purpose crops and  II. National objectives and targets - Dimension Decarbonisation 28  agricultural and agri-food-processing industry by-products, is ca. 900 PJ annually6. The most commonly available raw material to be used for energy purposes is straw. On average, the surplus of straw in Poland amounts to approximately 3.1 million tonnes, ranging from 2 to 4.5 million tonnes, depending on cereal yields in a given year7. Biomass stocks from energy crops are estimated to range from 120,000 to 130,000 tonnes of dry matter, and orchard wood stocks are estimated to amount to ca. 88,700 tonnes annually8. Along with the development of the agricultural biogas production sector, the importance of the use of agricultural by-products and agri-food industry residual products has been increasing. The energy potential of the agri-food processing industry as regards the production of agricultural biogas is estimated to exceed 7.8 billion m3 annually. f) If applicable, other national trajectories and objectives, including long-term or sectorial ones (e.g. share of advanced biofuels, share of renewable energy in district heating, renewable energy use in buildings, renewable energy produced by cities, energy cooperatives and self-consumers). 1. Increase in the use of advanced biofuels to 0.1% by energy content in 2020 According to the RED (Renewable Energy Directive), Member States have been obliged to define the share of advanced biofuels (generated from the raw materials specified in Part A of Annex IX d to the Directive) for 2020. The recommended share of those biocomponents by energy content is to be 0.5%. According to the analyses conducted, this target cannot be met in Poland due to limited access to ligno-cellulosic material and algae processing technologies and the limited supply of waste raw materials. In view of the above, the level of this obligation is set at 0.1% in the Act on biocomponents and liquid biofuels. At the same time, given the need to promote such biocomponents, their share is expected to grow radically in the period 2021-2030, as required by RED II.   2. Increased dynamics of development of RES-based microinstallations in the period 2020-2030 As at 30 September 2019, over 106,000 RES-based microinstallations with an aggregate installed capacity of over 684 MW were connected to the networks of the 5 largest Distribution System Operators (DSO). Further development of RES-based microinstallations (notably prosumer installations) constitutes a natural direction of development for the electricity sector, which ensues from the changing legislative environment (at the EU level) and decreasing technological costs. The dynamics of the development of RES-based microinstallations are expected to increase throughout the 2020-2030 period.
