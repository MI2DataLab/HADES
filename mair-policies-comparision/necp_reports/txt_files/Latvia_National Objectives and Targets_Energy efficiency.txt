3.2. Energy efficiency  3.2.1.  The table below includes energy consumption volumes calculated in accordance with definitions of Directive 2012/27/EU (and Directive 2018/2002):  primary energy consumption means gross domestic consumption of energy sources, excluding non-energy uses;  final energy consumption is all the energy supplied to industry, transport, households, services and agriculture excluding deliveries to the energy transformation sector and the energy industries themselves.  energy savings mean an amount of saved energy determined by measuring and/or estimating consumption before and after implementation of an energy efficiency improvement measure, whilst ensuring normalisation for external conditions that affect energy consumption Table 17142 Policy outcome in the energy efficiency dimension Actual value143 Target value 2017 2020 2030 optional target  primary energy consumption  PJ 187.41 225 165  170 GWh 52,056.9 62,500 45,833  47,222 ktoe 4,331 5374.03 3,940.96  4,060.38 optional target  final energy consumption PJ 168.01 187 145  149 GWh 46,668.06 51,944.44 40,277.8  41,388.9 ktoe 4,012.73 4,466.4 3,463.27  3,558.8 mandatory national target  cumulative end-use energy savings144 PJ 18.8 35.6 73.7 GWh 5,227.0 9,898.89 20,472.02 ktoe 449.44 850.9 1760.28 In accordance with Article 6(2) of Regulation 2018/1999, Latvia has taken into account the following significant aspects in developing its contribution:  Latvia has to ensure permanent capacity to provide energy security and balancing of electricity systems, and because of its geographic location Latvia may require a significant amount of additional capacities during the colder months of the year;  Latvia has to ensure the interconnection capacity of Latvia and take into consideration the demand for more electricity of the neighbouring countries with which the interconnections are established.

Directive 2012/27/EU provides that Latvia has to ensure new savings of 0.8 % of the annual final energy consumption annually by calculating these savings as the average over the three years before 1 January 2019.  Figure 39. Theoretical calculations of the mandatory target of cumulative final energy consumption savings 20212030 (PJ)145 3.2.2. Long-term renovation strategy, optional milestone As things stand, pursuant to Directive 2012/27/EU, the Latvian target for 2020 is the annual 3 % target for renovation of floor area of central government buildings, and Latvia is proposing to continue meeting this target up until 2030. Latvia has still not calculated the maximum projection for the total renovated floor area. In the period up to 2030, Latvia is proposing to reduce average specific heat consumption in buildings for heating up to 120 kWh/m2/year.

There is however a derogation from this first long-term building renovation strategy that can be submitted to the EC by 10 March 2020. Therefore the Latvian Long-Term Strategy for Renovation of Buildings is not included in this plan and will be submitted within the deadline limit laid down by Directive 2010/31/EU. 3.2.3. Other national objectives  NIPG2020 defines the purpose of the Latvian Guidelines on National Industrial Policy as to promote structural changes in the economy for the benefit of producing goods and services with higher added value, including increasing the role of industry, modernising industry and services, and developing exports of more complex goods with higher added value, which may therefore be promoted by a successful energy efficiency improvement policy, which may promote the achievement of energy efficiency targets, ensuring reorientation of energy-intensive sectors.
