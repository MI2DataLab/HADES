4.2. Decarbonisation dimension 4.2.1. GHG emissions and removals 4.2.1.i. Trends in current GHG emissions and removals in the EU ETS, effort sharing and LULUCF sectors and different energy sectors  Annual greenhouse gas emissions for the period 2010-2018 are shown in Table B6. The values and sectoral demarcations are taken from the GHG inventory (Federal Environment Agency 2019). In line with international 131  conventions, LULUCF emissions and international transport emissions are not included in the total. A total of 858 million tonnes CO2eq was emitted in 2018. This represents a reduction of 31% compared to the baseline year of 1990.

The level of emissions is currently approximately the same for both sectors (ETS and non-ETS). Emissions from European air transport are also covered by the emissions trading scheme. They are shown separately since they are not relevant to the achievement of national targets. Only domestic air transport is included in calculations for this purpose.

Projections of sectoral developments with existing national and Union policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)  The results by sector for the projections for the baseline are described in Table B8. Total GHG emissions without international transport and LULUCF emissions decrease by 2030 to 731 million tonnes CO2eq. Compared to 1990, this corresponds to a reduction of approx. 41%. The largest reductions in the period 2015 to 2030 are in the energy sector (-25%) and private households sector (-28%). The reduction in the transport sector and agriculture sector is comparatively small (-9%).

Renewable energy 4.2.2.i. Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in each of these sectors   The share of renewables in energy consumption is shown in Table B10. Between 2010 and 2018, the share of renewables in gross final energy consumption rose by around five percentage points to 16.5%. Substantial differences can, however, be identified between the various sectors and applications during this period. The main driver for the rising share of renewables in total gross final energy consumption was the electricity sector. The increase in this sector was much more rapid than in the heating and cooling sector. The share of renewables in total fuel consumption dropped in the transport sector (on a national statistics basis). Although fuel consumption rose slightly, the use of biogenic fuels fell from 2012 onwards. The amount of renewable electricity used in the transport sector is still negligible.

Minor discrepancies are the result of rounding differences. Source: Federal Environment Agency (2020)  4.2.2.ii. Indicative projections of development with existing policies for the year 2030 (with an outlook to the year 2040)  The baseline scenario is predicated on the assumption that certain political instruments which have differing effects on the use of renewables will remain in force, and so the individual sectors show different trends for the period from 2020 onwards. For example, the baseline scenario assumes that the Renewable Energy Sources Act and the Energy Conservation Regulation will continue to apply in their present form. Continued application of the Renewable Energy Sources Act will have a significant impact on the share of renewables in the electricity sector. The assumed future growth of renewables in the baseline scenario is based on the expansion corridor targets outlined in the 2017 version of the Renewable Energy Sources Act. On the basis of the expansion corridor targets, the annual gross increase for onshore wind is expected to be 2 800 MW between now and 2020 and 2 900 MW from 2020 onwards. The annual increase for offshore wind is expected to be 500 MW in 2021 and 2022 and 700 MW between 2023 and 2025. The increase will accelerate to 840 MW a year from 2026 onwards. The Renewable Energy Sources Act 2017 assumes an annual gross increase in photovoltaics of 2 500 MW.  The share of renewables in gross electricity consumption rises in the baseline scenario to 53.7% (53.3% according to national statistics) by 2030. The Federal Government is pursuing the goal of increasing the share in gross electricity consumption to around 65% by 2030. The challenge in this respect is to achieve better 135  synchronisation of renewables and grid capacities. The measures which need to be implemented within the transmission system in order to ensure that the electricity grids have the necessary capacities in this respect will be investigated when the Network Development Plan 2019-2030 is produced. In autumn 2019, the Federal Government reiterated the 65% target in the Climate Action Programme 2030 and set technology-specific goals for growth, subject to the condition that the planning and approval procedures for onshore wind and grid expansion be accelerated. The Renewable Energy Sources Act will be amended in 2020. For this, the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy will put forward a draft and plans to make the necessary adjustments to goals and trajectories within this framework.  Decisive factors affecting actual installed renewable energy capacity include not only the gross expansion referred to above, but also the dismantling of existing plants. Onshore and offshore wind farms are assumed to have a service life of 20 years. The baseline scenario is predicated on the assumption that these plants will not continue to be operated when the guaranteed feed-in tariff is no longer paid. An average service life of 25 years is assumed for photovoltaic systems, with decommissioning operations being distributed evenly over the 10-year period after the end of the 20-year guaranteed feed-in tariff period. In concrete terms, this means that all installed plants will have been decommissioned after 30 years, but the first will be decommissioned after 20 years and the average will be 25 years.4  According to the baseline scenario, the share of renewables in the transport sector will gradually increase until 2030 to 15.2% (EU statistics with multiple recognition; national statistics 7.5%). This is due in particular to the increasing use of renewable electricity for e-mobility, which will double in comparison to 2020. Beyond 2030, the share of renewables in the transport sector will rise to 11.1% in 2040 (without multiple recognition). Once again, this is due primarily to the increase in the share of renewable electricity, which will rise significantly by 2040 compared to 2030 as a consequence of the mainstreaming of e-mobility. By way of contrast, the consumption of biogenic fuels will not change significantly during this period. Since energy consumption in the transport sector will drop overall, however, the share of this figure accounted for by biogenic fuels will rise slightly. It should be pointed out, though, that adjustments will have to be made in particular for the period after 2030.  The heating and cooling sector covers space heating, hot water, process heating, process cooling and district heating. The baseline scenario assumes that there will be a moderate increase in the share of renewables in this area of energy consumption, from 15.5% in 2021 to 18,9,2% in 2030 (EU statistics; 19.2% according to national statistics). This share increases to 22.6% by 2040 under the baseline scenario (according to national statistics).  The individual subareas display different trends. There will only be minor changes over this period in the use of renewables for district heating purposes. Biomass (including biogenic waste) will continue to represent the most important source of renewable energy for the generation of piped heat, even though the baseline shows a slight drop in district heat generated using biomass. The drop in the use of biomass to generate heat will be compensated for by an increase in the use of waste heat and geothermal energy. There will also be a slight increase in the generation of heat from solar thermal sources in the longer term. The consumption of renewables to generate decentralised space heating and hot water will increase by 15% between 2020 and 2030. This increase will be chiefly accounted for by biogas, solar thermal and ambient heat, leveraged by means of electric heat pumps. The baseline scenario assumes that biomass is the only renewable source of energy that will be used to generate process heating. Electricity will be the only source of energy used to generate process cooling.  Table B11: Share of renewable energies 2021 to 2040, as a percentage of total sectoral consumption   2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2040 Electricity (Eurostat) 43.1 43.8 44.6 45.7 46.8 48.3 49.6 51.0 52.6 53.7 56.4 Electricity (national statistics)  42.7  43.7  44.4  45.4  46.6  48.0  49.3  50.8  52.3  53.3  56.0 Onshore wind 16.8 17.0 17.0 17.1 17.4 17.9 18.2 18.7 19.3 19.7 22.9                                                            4 The contribution of geothermal energy to the generation of electricity from renewables is currently negligible, with a share of approx. 0.1% (Eurostat 2018). According to model calculations, this generation technology will barely gain importance in this period, due to the high costs in comparison to alternative renewable energy sources and will remain at a negligible level. The share of geothermal energy in the gross final energy consumption of electricity is therefore not listed separately. The share of geothermally generated district heating in the gross final energy consumption of heat is subsumed under other renewables together with solar thermal, ambient heat and waste heat from industrial processes. 136  Offshore wind 5.5 5.8 6.3 6.8 7.3 7.8 8.5 9.1 9.7 10.3 10.9 Photovoltaics 8.3 8.7 9.2 9.6 10.0 10.4 10.8 11.2 11.6 11.9 13.6 Hydropower 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.6 3.6 3.6 3.6 3.6 3.6 Biomass 7.6 7.5 7.4 7.4 7.4 7.3 7.2 7.1 7.0 6.7 3.8 Biogenic fraction of waste  1.0  1.1  1.1  1.1  1.1  1.1  1.1  1.1  1.1  1.1  1.2 Transport (RED II) 8.2 8.8 9.4 10.0 10.7 11.4 12.3 13.2 14.2 15.2 26.9 Transport (national statistics)  5.7  5.8  5.9  6.1  6.3  6.5  6.7  7.0  7.3  7.5  11.1 Biodiesel (including HVO and vegetable oil)  3.2  3.1  3.1  3.1  3.1  3.1  3.0  3.0  3.0  3.0  3.5 Biogenic petrol 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.6 1.6 1.9 Biogas 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.6 Renewables  electricity 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 1.9 2.2 2.4 2.6 5.1 PtX 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Heating and cooling* (Eurostat)  15.3  15.7  16.1  16.5  16.9  17.4  17.7  18.2  18.5  18.9  22.3 Heating and cooling* (national statistics)  15.5  15.9  16.3  16.7  17.2  17.6  18.0  18.4  18.8  19.2  22.6 Biomass and renewable waste  12.9  13.1  13.3  13.5  13.7  13.9  14.1  14.3  14.4  14.5  15.4 Other renewable energies  2.6  2.8  3.0  3.2  3.4  3.7  3.9  4.1  4.4  4.6  7.2 * Space heating and hot water, cooling and ventilation and process heating and cooling  Note: Discrepancies in totals are the result of rounding differences Sources: Prognos, Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, Institute of Economic Structures Research, International Institute for Sustainability Analysis and Strategy (2020)
