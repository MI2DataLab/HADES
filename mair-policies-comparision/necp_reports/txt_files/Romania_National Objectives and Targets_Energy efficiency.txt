Specific details  As regards the option of energetic recovery of used sludge, which consists in the dedicated incineration of sludge and recovery of related energy, according to the National Strategy for the Management of Wastewater Sludge, the operation entails large investments and high operating costs, which are feasible only in certain regions in Romania (Bucharest-Ilfov).  2.2. Dimension Energy efficiency i. The elements set out in point (b) of Article 4 The Energy Efficiency dimension has a significant importance in the 2021-2030 INECP because transition towards clean energy.  By the relevant target commitments, Romania must contribute to the achievement of the EU energy efficiency target (maximum consumption of primary energy of 1 273 Mtoe and of final energy of 956 Mtoe).19 The global target is thus at least 32.5 % in 2030 at EU level, as indicated in Article 1(1) and in Article 3(5) of Directive 2012/27/EU, and it may be revised upwards in 2023. Having regard to the calculation assumptions and projections used, which take into account the increase in industrial production and in the standard of living, which is reflected in the increase in energy consumption, primary energy consumption is projected to reach 32.3 Mtoe in 2030 compared to 32.1 Mtoe in 2020.                                                 18 The Progress Report of Romania on the promotion and use of renewable energy in accordance with Article 22 of Directive 2009/28/EC 19 Article 3(4) of Directive 2012/27/UE, see the proposal to amend the Directive The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         With reference to the projection for primary energy consumption for 2030, as calculated in the PRIMES 2007 scenario for Romania, i.e. 58.7 Mtoe, the WAM scenario indicates a 45.1 % decrease for 2030. In the context of additional measures and policies, Romania aims at achieving primary energy consumption of 32.3 Mtoe and final energy consumption of 25.7 Mtoe by 2030. Chart 9 - Primary and final energy consumption for 2030 [Mtoe]  Source: PRIMES 2007; Deloitte calculation based on the information submitted by the INECP  RO EN  Primary energy consumption  Final energy consumption Actual  WAM Current  WAM  Trajectories of primary and final energy consumption indicate a slower decrease in the period 2020-2025, with a 2.4 % decrease for primary consumption and a 2.9 % decrease for final consumption recorded. The policies and measures which Romania plans to adopt in order to achieve the consumption targets have a wide scope and require, where applicable, a longer period of confirmation of effects produced. This is the reason why most of the consistent effects, in the sense of reduction of energy consumption, will be felt from 2025 onward, when the reduction trend is increasing, being influenced by the effects of the investments made in the period 2020-2025. The trajectory thus indicates a savings increase from 38.4 % in 2025 to 45.1 % in 2030 for primary consumption and from 34.0 % to 40.4 % for final consumption in the same period in relation to the PRIMES 2007 baseline scenario.

The measures designed to achieve these savings will also be focused on combating energy poverty (see Chapter 2.4.4.) The calculation of the savings target entails identifying the amount of domestic final energy consumption in the abovementioned years. The table below lists data about the situation of Romania Table 8  Final energy consumption and average energy consumption in the period 2016-2018 [Mtoe] Indicator 2016 2017 2018 Final Energy Consumption   22.2 23.2 23.5 Average final energy consumption in the period 2016-2018  22.9 New annual energy savings (according to the annual minimum target of 0.8 %)  0.18 Source: Eurostat, Deloitte calculations  The cumulated target of energy savings in accordance with Article 7(1)(b) is achieved through a gradual increase in the annual rate, as follows: 0.5 % in 2021 and 2022, 0.7 % in 2023, 0.8 % in 2024, 2025 and 2026, 1.375 % in 2027 and then 1.5 % by 2030.

The indicative milestones for 2030, 2040 and 2050, the domestic measurable progress indicators and their contributions to the Union's energy efficiency targets as included in the roadmaps set out in the long-term renovation strategies for the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU  The draft Long-Term Renovation Strategy (LTRS) proposes measures to improve energy efficiency, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to increase the renewable energy share in the total energy consumption through renovation of the national stock of buildings. The national stock of buildings has a share of 41.64 % in the final consumption of 22.86 Mtoe, as estimated for 2019, and estimated consumption of 9.52 Mtoe.  The strategy proposes three (minimal, medium, maximum) renovation packages for the buildings located in three climatic zones in Romania:                                                 20 The total values, as listed, may not coincide with the sum of components because of the rounding The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          Package 1 (minimum) - entails renovation up to a level which ensures compliance with the national law, which is close to class C corresponding to an Energy Performance Certificate;  Package 2 (medium) - entails structural renovation of the building in order to avoid the lock-in effects or the implementation of inadequate measures, which requires subsequent replacement in order to achieve future targets of nearly zero energy buildings (NZEB) and to use renewable energy solutions at a minimum.  Package 3 (maximum) - entails renovation of the building up to a level that it may be deemed a nearly zero energy building (NZEB) through the extensive use of solutions to improve energy efficiency and of solutions to obtain renewable energy (photovoltaic panels, solar panels for hot water, geothermal pumps). The selection of renovation packages is based on a multicriteria assessment with the purpose of achieving an energy class A for all types of buildings, with the exception of single-family residences (SFR), for which energy class B is considered to be acceptable.   The strategy contains three scenarios with different assumptions, each of them facing various financial and social challenges. Moreover, the strategy also includes a baseline scenario, under which the assumption is to continue renovations at the current pace and which is used for scenario benchmarking.  The detailed assessment conducted in the framework of the strategy revealed that the MLPDA decision was, on the date when this document was prepared, consistent with the outcome of Scenario 2. Its underpinning assumption consists in a significant increase in the pace of renovations for 2021-2030 compared to the first scenario. Scenario 2 concerns renovation of a larger portion of buildings with the lowest performances in order to achieve higher energy efficiency by 2030 compared to Scenario 1. Therefore, scenario 2 entails an increased share of residential condominiums, as they have the highest potential for enhanced energy efficiency. Moreover, scenario 2 is feasible compared to scenario 3, which is less feasible considering the characteristics of the construction sector in Romania. Moreover, scenario 2 is also optimal in terms of renovated area, number of beneficiaries, and of the estimated reduction in CO2 emissions.

All of the three scenarios lead to final energy consumption of 3.38 Mtoe in buildings in 2050, which is a 66 % reduction compared to the same year in the baseline scenario. Moreover, Scenario 2 leads to a reduction in CO2 emissions of 2.34 million tonnes compared to the baseline scenario, with an estimated value of 7.50 million tonnes of CO2 emissions generated by the stock of buildings in Romania in 2030. For the implementation of the recommended scenario, LTRS states an amount of EUR 12.8 billion for necessary investments.  Moreover, an estimated amount of EUR 1 billion should be committed to cover the technical assistance costs. The recommendations regarding the sources of the abovementioned investments are the following:  EUR 3 billion should come from non-reimbursable funds from the State budget or from funds offered by the EU;  EUR 6 to 9 billion should be allocated as funds through reimbursable financial mechanisms, including reimbursable grants;  EUR 1.8 billion should be provided by the owners of the buildings to be renovated under a co-financing regime. iii. Where applicable, other national objectives, including long-term targets or strategies and sectoral targets, and national objectives in areas such as energy efficiency in the transport sector and with regard to heating and cooling The industry, transports and the residential sector could contribute in approximately equal shares (each with a rate of 29 %) to the achievement of the energy efficiency target in the period 2021-2030 (new annual savings of ~1.83 Mtoe).  The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Considering the contribution brought by the draft Long-term Renovation Strategy (presented in the table below), INECP reflects a continuation of the actions set out in the NEEAP IV in regard to the policies and measures required in other sectors, in particular in the industry and transport sectors, which record the highest share of final energy consumption after the residential sector.

Similarly, new annual savings of approximately 0.6 Mtoe are required in the transport sector in the period 2021-2030 considering that the NEEAP IV estimations indicate potential savings of 0.4 Mtoe in the sector in 2020, which are mainly due to the renewal of the vehicle stock (passenger cars and cargo vehicles), i.e. 0.2 Mtoe. In order to achieve the annual targets, sustained measures will be required to upgrade urban public and rail transport. Last but not least, fostering alternative mobility (estimated to bring about energy savings of 0.16 Mtoe only in 2020) may significantly contribute to a reduction in final energy consumption in transport
