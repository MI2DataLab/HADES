4.3 Energy Efficiency dimension  4.3.1 Current primary and final energy consumption in the economy and by sector (including industry, households, services and transport). Table 29 shows total and final energy consumption in the whole economy and by sector.                                                          238 A cautious estimate of 40% of waste heat has been included in the renewable energy calculations for the sector in the scenarios. 141 (199) Table 29 Energy consumption 2017 [TWh],  2017 Total energy consumption239 including non-energy uses 573 Total energy consumption excluding non-energy uses, including international aviation 545 Total final energy consumption, excluding international aviation and shipping 378 Total final energy consumption, including international aviation and shipping 389 Industry 143 Housing 87 Services, etc. 59 Transport (domestic) 88 International aviation 11  4.3.2 Current potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling The information under this heading is taken from the report provided for under Article 14(1) of the Energy Efficiency Directive240, entitled n of high-efficiency cogeneration, district heating and cooling  Promotion of report differs from the long-term scenarios241 from 2018 used as a basis for this plan. The next comprehensive assessment report in accordance with Article 14 is due on 31 December 2020.  According to the report on the potential for high-efficiency cogeneration, district heating and cooling, new district heating connections in both existing and new developments are not expected to compensate for the reduction caused by energy efficiency measures and the conversion to heat pumps in buildings that have already been connected. In 2011, 54.7 TWh of district heating was generated, which is expected to fall to 51 TWh by 2030, despite the fact that new connections to existing and new buildings are expected to amount to 8 TWh in 2030. The net reduction is thus expected to be 4 TWh, or 12 TWh without new connections, as shown in Figure 28.                                                          239 Total energy consumption corresponds to total input energy and includes all domestic energy consumption, including transformation and transmission losses and fuels for non-energy uses. International transport is not included. 240 Swedish Energy Agency  Comprehensive assessment of the potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration, district heating and cooling (ER2013:24). 241 Swedish Energy Agency   142 (199) Figure 28.

The potential for district cooling has been estimated at a further 2 TWh by 2030.  The total cogeneration potential consists of cogeneration in district heating systems and industrial cogeneration, also known as industrial back pressure. The additional potential for electricity production from cogeneration amounts to approx. 5 TWh by 2030. This is based on the assumption that deliveries of district heating will decrease slightly in the long term.  Electricity production from industrial cogeneration is currently approx. 6 TWh per year. The potential from industrial cogeneration is estimated to be approx. 9 TWh by 2030.  4.3.3 Projections on the basis of existing instruments, measures and programmes on energy efficiency in accordance with point 1.2, paragraph ii, for primary and final energy consumption for each sector until at least 2040 (including 2030) Figure consumption to 2040, broken down by sector. The scenario is based on instruments and measures adopted on 1 July 2018.                                                         242 Swedish Energy Agency  Comprehensive assessment of the potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration, district heating and cooling (ER2013:24). 143 (199) Figure 29 Scenario for energy consumption 2016-2040 for industry, transport, and housing and services, etc., TWh.   Source Target Industri Industry Bostäder, service mm Housing, services, etc. Transport inkl utrikes flyg Transport, including international aviation  Energy consumption in the housing and services sector is expected to decrease slightly towards 2040. This is the result of energy efficiency measures in buildings and the fact that buildings with a direct supply of electricity are being converted to heat pumps.  Energy consumption in the transport sector also decreases towards 2040, which is due to the fact that vehicles, aircraft and ships are becoming more energy efficient, as well as an increase in the use of electric vehicles and ships.  Energy consumption in industry is expected to increase slightly, however. A number of production processes powered by fossil fuels are being replaced with electricity, which will bring about an increase in energy consumption.  4.3.4 Cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements resulting from national projections, in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU. Table 30 shows the cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements resulting from national projections, in accordance with Article 5 of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive243. The results are shown as a range, with the applicable minimum requirements in brackets.                                                         243 Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings. 144 (199)  Table 30 Cost-optimal levels and minimum energy performance requirements.
