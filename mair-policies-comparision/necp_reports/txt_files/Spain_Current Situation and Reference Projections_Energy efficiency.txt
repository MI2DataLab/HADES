ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  243 A.3 ENERGY EFFICIENCY DIMENSION  This heading refers to the effects of the energy efficiency policies and measures of the different sectors of the economy. It has been mentioned before that one of the vectors that has guided the development of the Plan is to reduce GHG emissions, while two main directions can be distinguished within the proposed measures to do this:   The replacement of fossil fuels with other energy sources that are less polluting or more energy efficient.  Reducing energy consumption to satisfy the same demands or, in other words, increasing energy efficiency, which is the subject of this section.  A.3.1 Primary energy consumption  The tables below set out the aggregate primary energy for all sectors both for the Baseline Scenario and for the Target Scenario.  Table A.24.

CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  244 These are the main conclusions with regard to the tables above:   The consumption of petroleum products and natural gas in 2015 exceeds 60% of the total. The policies and measures included in the Plan succeeded in reducing this dependency on   In the Baseline Scenario, primary energy consumption in 2030 increases by approximately 3% starting from 2015.  In the Target Scenario: o The impact of the policies and measures to decarbonise the economy is reflected, as well as the significant introduction of renewables in the primary energy mix. The reduction in primary energy consumption in 2030 compared to 2015 is 15%, which contrasts with the increase recorded in the Baseline Scenario for the same period mentioned previously. o Consumption from renewables doubles in 2030 compared to 2015. o Coal consumption decreases to practically one-tenth of the 2015 consumption, due mainly to the gradual closure of coal-fired power plants. o Petroleum product consumption drops by 23% compared to 2015, while natural gas remains at similar levels. o The consumption of energy from nuclear technology is decreasing, accompanying the scheduled, phased and organised closure of power plants.  A.3.2 Final energy consumption The total final energy consumption projections for each of the sectors included in the model are shown below: industry, residential, service and transport.  Table A.26.

CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  245 The main comments on final energy consumption are presented below:   The main difference between the Baseline and Target Scenarios is that final energy consumption increases in the former and decreases in the latter. The Target Scenario shows a very significant decrease, around 30%, in petroleum product consumption. Owing to all the proposed measures, the Spanish economy will be more efficient in 2030 and less dependent on oil.  Regarding the Target Scenario: o Final energy consumption decreases by around 7% between 2015 and 2030, despite the fact that the economic path is always growing. This means that, with the proposed measures, progress will be made in decoupling economic growth and energy consumption. o Electricity consumption increases by around 7%. o The estimated final petroleum product consumption for 2030 decreases by 28% compared to the actual 2015 data. However, natural gas consumption increases by around 5%. o Renewable energy consumption increases by around 40%.  In conclusion, the needs of the Spanish economy in 2030 will be satisfied in a more efficient manner in energy terms.

CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  246 As regards industry in the Target Scenario, the following can be highlighted:   Decrease in final energy consumption compared to the Baseline Scenario, as a consequence of energy efficiency policies and measures.  This decrease in final consumption translates directly into coal and petroleum products,   Residential The following tables set out final energy consumption in the residential sector. Table A.30.

Firstly, final energy consumption decreases in the Target Scenario compared to the Baseline. Similarly, there is a reduction in fossil fuel consumption and coal is eliminated, while, on the other hand, the contribution of renewable energy increases.   ANNEX A.

This all results in the reduction of petroleum product and natural gas consumption in the Target Scenario compared to the Baseline Scenario.   ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  248 Transport  The following tables set out final energy consumption in the transport sector. Table A.34.

Similarly, there is a significant decrease in the consumption of petroleum products, which are replaced with electricity.  Finally, gas consumption is lower in the Target Scenario than in the Baseline Scenario. This is due to the fact that the final consumption of the whole sector is considerably lower, and therefore compliance with the decarbonisation targets is achieved by using electrified vehicles, as well as through the decrease in the demand for fossil fuel vehicles due to the different modal shifts proposed.  Electrification of the economy  There are several measures implemented in this Plan that contribute to the electrification of the economy. In a context where electricity generation has a high renewable contribution, the electrification of the economy contributes to decarbonisation.  Electrification of final energy consumption (excluding non-energy uses and international aviation) undergoes a strong increase in the Target Scenario as a result of the measures implemented in this ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  249 Plan. In the Target Scenario, in 2030, electrification increases by 17.5% compared to the Baseline. Taking the year 2015 as a reference, the increase in electrification is 21.5%.  Sectorally, the largest contribution to electrification in the Target Scenario compared to 2015 is in transport, with a relative increase of 335% between the two years. In the residential sector, the increase is 10%, while there is also an improvement in electrification in the other sectors.  A.3.3 Energy intensity The following table shows the energy intensity values for primary energy as well as final energy for both scenarios.  It can be seen that in the Baseline Scenario, there is already an improvement in energy intensities. Nevertheless, the additional efficiency policies and measures have a prominent effect in the Target Scenario.  In this case, energy intensity values are achieved that entail a decrease of approximately 30% in final energy and 36% in primary energy compared to the 2015 values. The energy intensity in 2015 was 115 toe/EUR m in primary energy, and 79 toe/EUR m in final energy.  Table A.36.
