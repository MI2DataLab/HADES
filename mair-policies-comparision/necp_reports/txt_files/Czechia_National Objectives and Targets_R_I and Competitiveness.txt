2.5  i. National objectives and funding targets for public and, where available, private research and innovation relating to the Energy Union, including, where appropriate, a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met  The Czech Republic has not set any specific quantifiable targets in public research, development and innovation specifically related to the Energy Union. The difficulty of setting energy and climate targets is due, inter alia, to the structure of public funding for research, development and innovation, which is not sector-focused, but is provided under national and ministerial support programmes. The strategic objectives are then described in more detail in the relevant strategy papers. These documents include in particular the National Research and Innovation Strategy for Smart Specialisation50 and National Priorities of Oriented Research, Experimental Development and Innovation51.                                                            50  The document is available at: https://www.mpo.cz/cz/podnikani/ris3-strategie/ 51  The document is available at: https://www.vyzkum.cz/FrontClanek.aspx?idsekce=653383  -72-  The document National Priorities of Oriented Research, Experimental Development and Innovation identifies a total of six main priority areas, of which the priority area Sustainability of Energy and Material Resources best corresponds to the focus of the Energy Union. This area is further divided into three sub-areas: (i) sustainable energy; (ii) reducing the energy performance of the economy; and (iii) material base. For more information, see Chapter 3.5. National priorities for oriented research, experimental development and innovation include indicative share of funds by priority area, which should be allocated for implementation within the overall R&D&I budget. On the basis of this strategic document, approximately 18 % of the total research, development and innovation budget should be allocated to the priority Sustainable Energy and Material Resources (see Table 40). Table 40: Indicative distribution of funds among the different priority areas Priority area title Share of funds Competitive knowledge-based economy 20 % Sustainability of energy and material resources 18 % Environment for quality life 18 % Social and cultural challenges 10 % Healthy population 20 % Secure society 14 % Source: National priorities for oriented research, experimental development and innovation The area of research, development and innovation is also addressed specifically in the State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic. Table 41 identifies priority areas of research, development and innovation on the basis of this strategic document. The research, development and innovation areas are also partially addressed by other strategic energy documents such as the National Action Plan for the Development of Nuclear Energy in the Czech Republic, the National Action Plan for Smart Grids, or the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility. Table 41: Priority areas of research, development and innovation under the State Energy Policy Priority area Detailed description Renewable (alternative) energy sources More efficient use of biomass, development of advanced biofuels made from non-food biomass and waste, development of new photovoltaic systems including control elements, geothermal sources in geological conditions of the Czech Republic, energy use of hydrogen including fuel cells, heat pumps of all categories with high efficiency.

Transport systems Increasing the efficiency of systems and means of public transport including electric traction vehicles and their drives; fuel cell development and battery development for the development of electric cars; the development of infrastructure for electric cars and hydrogen economy; the development of telematic traffic control systems aimed at automating and optimising individual transport; projects to reduce losses in supply systems and electrical traction equipment in transport. Source: State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic (2015) On the basis of the measures in the State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic, the sectoral programme of public support for research, development and innovations in the field of energy was also approved, which is administered by the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic. The programme is called THÉTA. The programme is approved for the period 20182025. For more information on THÉTA, see Chapter 3.5.1.4. ii. Where available, national 2050 objectives related to the promotion of clean energy technologies and, where appropriate, national objectives, including long-term targets (2050) for deployment of low-carbon technologies, including for decarbonising energy and carbon-intensive industrial sectors and, where applicable, for related carbon transport and storage infrastructure The Czech Republic has no specific national 2050 objectives for deployment of low-carbon technologies beyond those set out in other parts of this document. Also, the introduction of specific technologies should be primarily market-driven. The State may create conditions in research, development and innovation, possibly to partially support specific technologies in accordance with the State aid rules, but it is arguable whether the State should specify targets for the introduction of certain technologies and thereby distort the market environment. iii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to competitiveness The national objectives / the strategy of the Czech Republic in this area are contained in specific strategy documents. In this regard, we should mention especially the National Research and Innovation Strategy for Smart Specialisation of the Czech Republic, the aim of which is to effectively target European, national, regional and private funds on priority innovation specialisations, thereby making full use of the knowledge potential of the Czech Republic. This way, the strategy also significantly contributes to increased competitiveness of the economy. Furthermore, we can mention the National Initiative Industry  -74-  main objectives in the Czech economy by 2030. In this respect, it will be a key plan for the Czech economy based on ten pillars, such as industry and energy, innovation, raw materials policy, transport tly under preparation, which should map in detail the necessary investments, inter alia, in the energy sector, for at least the next ten years. Then there is the Innovation Strategy of the Czech Republic 20192030, which was approved by Government Resolution No 104 of 4 February 2019. It is a strategic framework plan that predetermines government policy in the area of research, development and innovation and it is elve years. The innovation strategy consists of nine interconnected pillars, which contain the starting points, the basic strategic objectives and the instruments leading to their fulfilment. These pillars represent the following areas: Research and development funding and evaluation, Innovation and research centres, National start-up and spin-off environment, Polytechnic education, Digitisation, Mobility and construction environment, Intellectual property protection, Smart investment and Smart marketing. In this respect, the Czech Republic also acknowledges the importance of the EU Competitiveness Council, in which it is actively involved.  Top national competitiveness targets resulting from the approved State Energy Policy. These are the following goals (see also Table 6):   Maintain transmission capacity for export and import at a level of at least 30 % of the electricity system load;  Optimise discounted energy costs;  Keep the energy prices at no more than 120 % of the OECD level;  Achieve and maintain the levels of final electricity and gas prices below EU-28 level;  Achieve and maintain the share of energy expenditure in total household spending as low as possible below 10 %;  Optimise the share of the energy sector in gross value added;  Reduce the share of energy imports in gross value added below 2010 levels;  Maintain positive total economic value added of the energy sector;  stabilise the effect of energy imports on the balance of payments
