 50  2.3  DIMENSION ENERGY SECURITY  The elements set out in Article 4(c)  The Energy Security dimension needs to be looked at within the unique context of a geographically isolated island Member State with a high import dependency due to the lack of domestic energy sources, with the exception of renewables the deployment of which is in itself largely constrained by market, such as its small nature, the existence of a single electricity supplier, the absence of natural  require more energy, which in turn will require higher deployment of RES, more reliance on electricity imports over the interconnector and possibly additional conventional local generation capacity40. It will also require a more flexible energy system which amongst others incorporates storage and takes advantage of opportunities for demand side management. The Energy and Water Agency commissioned a study which will assess how Malta can ensure a secure power system whilst remain aligned with its international commitments on decarbonisation. Malof energy sources and contingency planning in the case of supply disruption, in order to achieve greater security of supply. The emphasis on diversification seeks to ensure diversification in terms of energy sources, procurement sources, exporting country and supplier. Since the adoption of the undergone multiple changes, such as the commissioning of a 200MWelectricity interconnector with Sicily in 2015 and the restructuring of the local power generation capacity to run on natural gas (LNG) while decommissioning inefficient units fired by heavy fuel oil and the old Marsa Power Station. This has significantly reduced the carbon footprint of the electricity generation mix, which is now based primarily on natural gas, electricity imported via the interconnector and the increasing share of electricity produced by photovoltaic installations, while also maintaining standby gasoil generation capacity (including dual fired diesel engines) available as back-up in the event of an emergency, a  The objectives set out in the 2012 policy remain, to a large extent, still valid today and even post-2020, whilst the measures necessary to achieve these objectives have to be adapted to new realities and  as local developments, such as the expected substantial increase in population, increased demand in the labour market and growth of tourism and energy demand. Energy security must also be tackled in conjunction with the long-term objectives of decarbonisation of the energy system and the economy as a whole.  -level objectives in the area of energy security as set out in the NECP can be summarized into the following:  - Continued diversification of energy sources and suppliers;                                                            40 consider peak energy demand situations caused   51  - Reduction of import dependency through the deployment of indigenous sources of renewable  - Increasing the flexibility of the national energy system, including through the roll-out of cost-effective, innovative solutions such as storage;  - Periodic contingency planning in the case of supply disruption for the electricity, gas and oil sectors; - Energy security in the context of the long-term objective of decarbonisation of the energy system and increased deployment of RES;  National objectives with regard to increasing the diversification of energy sources and supply from third countries  Natural gas, which is used as fuel in the power generation sector is currently imported in the form of LNG. There are currently no gas pipeline interconnections, however a Final Investment Decision on the construction of the Melita Trans Gas Pipeline project (MTGP) between Malta and Sicily is expected to be taken by 2020 subject to financing. LNG is imported via marine carriers and held in a Floating Storage Unit (FSU) supplying LNG to a regasification plant and to Delimara 341  and Delimara 442 power plants. LNG is procured on the international market, which provides flexibility in terms of sources of origin. In 2017 and 2018 LNG was delivered from 8 different countries of origin.  A physical connection to the European gas network would result in a more reliable, secure and energy efficient form of transport of natural gas as it will replace the LNG supply chain, which has both a limit in its technical capacity and its susceptibility to adverse weather conditions. MTGP is being designed with bi-directional flow capability, and hence may provide for future reverse flow from Malta to Italy (European gas grid) in case of emergency gas disruption situations. This would facilitate the formulation and implementation of preventive, emergency and solidarity action plans at both national and EU regional levels as required by the Security of Gas Supply Regulation. The gas pipeline project is described in more detail in Section 3.3.i.   National objectives with regard to reducing energy import dependency from third countries energy sources (energy system, make it extremely challenging to reduce energy import dependency in general,  to reducing import dependency are interlinked with national objectives focusing on the continued deployment of domestic renewable energy sources and the over-arching long-term goal of decarbonizing the energy system. Should the Melita TransGas Pipeline come into operation, Malta would strengthen its interdependency with other EU Member States by being connected to the Trans-European Natural countries.                                                             41 Delimara 3 (D3): 8 gas-fired turbines with a maximum rated capacity of 152 MW. 4 of the 8 engines are dual fuel and can also run on gas-oil, supporting security of supply.  42 Delimara 4 (D4): 205 MW gas-fired high-efficiency combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) commissioned in 2017.   52  To objective in the area of renewable energy is to fully exploit all cost-effective indigenous renewable energy sources whilst also contributing to the long-term goal of decarbonisation of the energy system. Nevertheless, given the limited options for cost-effective indigenous sources due to reasons explained remain high in the projected period.   National objectives with regard to increasing the flexibility of the national energy system, in particular by means of deploying domestic energy sources, demand response and storage Increased flexibility of the national energy system will be tackled by the Government and energy system operators through multiple actions:  - Increased deployment of domestic renewable energy sources and their safe integration in the energy system;  - The Government will continue to assess innovative, viable and cost-effective solutions tailored , such as the deployment of energy storage solutions, which would incorporate aspects related to increased RES generation;  - The Government will continue to assess solutions for ensuring system stability with respect to grid integration constraints inherent in small and peripheral electricity systems;  The ongoing study commissioned by the Government will assess the economic and technical viability of flexibility solutions for the power system for the upcoming decade and beyond.
