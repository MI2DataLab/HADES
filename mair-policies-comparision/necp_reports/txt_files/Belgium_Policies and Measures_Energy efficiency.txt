207 3.2. Dimension energy efficiency i. Energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative policy measures under Articles 7a and 7b of Directive 2012/27/EU, to be prepared in accordance with Annex III to this Regulation  within the framework of its own powers, will   Flemish Region Planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030 as well as other objectives referred to in point 2.2, including planned measures and instruments (also of a financial nature) to promote the energy performance of buildings, in particular with regard to the following: Energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative policy measures under Articles 7a and 7b and Article 20(6) of Directive 2012/27/EU and to be prepared in accordance with Annex III to this Regulation With regard to achieving the target in Article 7 for 2021-2030, the Flemish Region has for now decided not to implement an obligation scheme for distribution system operators or suppliers, but to initially continue along the path of alternative measures. As a result, the measures already notified to the European Commission during the period 2014-2020 will be continued in the WEM scenario (scenario with existing measures), with all existing  The following table indicates the measures under Article 7 and an initial estimate of the cumulative energy savings for the period 2021-2030: Description Cumulative savings  (21-30) [TWh] Rational energy use/public service obligations incentive for:    roof insulation 7.925  glazing 1.891  wall 1.921  insulation of floors and basements 0.5810  solar water heater 0.029  heat pump 1.350  boiler with heat pump 0.422 Energy performance contract (including EPC extension with increase + reduction in the threshold in accordance with the energy plan declared at 0.1 PJ) 50.941 Environmental incentive + mini-EPC 3.685 Connection of SMEs to district heating systems 2.910 Optimisation of the settings of existing natural gas and heating oil boilers  3.641 E-Level < E30 (reduction on property tax) 0.358 Nudging via info on bills 0.532 Tax per kilometre for lorries (104) 7.876 Total 84.062                                                            104 The effect of the tax per kilometre for lorries has been calculated on an indicative basis. Further research is needed in collaboration with the two other regions and the Federal Government. 208   TWh.  7 of the EED for the period 2021-2030 is 60%.  Brussels Capital Region SELECTION OF MEASURES Bruxelles Environnement is responsible for monitoring and controlling the various measures implemented and energy savings delivered. The government has to adopt any corrective measures needed to achieve the energy savings target under Article 7 of the EED. The savings generated by the measures taken by the relevant parties are allowing the savings under Article 7 to be made. This would not have been possible without the final consumer measures having been taken. The required volume of energy savings is expressed in terms of final energy consumption, in gigawatt hours (GWh). The energy savings have been calculated using the methods and principles set out in Annex V to the EED. Additionality and materiality have been verified. Given the area covered by the Brussels Capital Region, there is no need to apply a climatic variation, as suggested by point 5(i) of Annex V to the EED.  MEASURES Regular inspection of heating systems This regulatory measure consists of an obligation to regularly inspect boilers in accordance with the Brussels Air, Climate and Energy Management Code (COBRACE) (Articles 2.2.15 to 2.2.17 and 2.5.1 to 2.5.5) and the Decree of the Government of the Brussels Capital Region of 21 June 2018 on the inspection and servicing of heating and air-conditioning systems and on the approval of persons carrying out this work. It applies to the residential and tertiary sectors. More specifically, the regular inspection of boilers involves cleaning all components of the boiler and smoke exhaust system, adjusting the burner and checking compliance with the EPB requirements. Heating oil boilers must be inspected annually and natural gas boilers every two years. The parties responsible for implementing this measure are as follows:  the Government of the Brussels Capital Region adopts regulations on the EPB requirements applicable to heating systems of buildings at the time of their installation and during their operation;  Bruxelles Environnement approves inspection engineers (COBRACE  Articles 2.5.1 to 2.5.5) and appoints quality control bodies;  the EPB boiler engineer carries out the regular inspection;  the quality control body checks the undertakings and obligations of EPB boiler engineers, issues reports on quality checks carried out and send these reports to Bruxelles Environnement.  Approval of heating systems This regulatory measure applies to the residential and tertiary sectors. Whenever a new boiler is approved, the heating system must be fully inspected to optimise its operation. The aim is to check that the heating system is properly installed in terms of its settings, insulation of pipework, ventilation of the boiler room, quality of the combustion and gases emitted, and draw of the chimney. 209 According to Article 2.1.1 of the Decree of the Government of the Brussels Capital Region of 21 June 2018 on the inspection and servicing of heating and air-conditioning systems and on the approval of persons carrying out this work, the heating system must be approved after a boiler is installed or replaced. The parties responsible for implementing this measure are as follows:  the Government of the Brussels Capital Region adopts regulations on the EPB requirements applicable to heating systems of buildings at the time of their installation and during their operation;  Bruxelles Environnement approves engineers (COBRACE  Articles 2.5.1 to 2.5.5) and appoints quality control bodies;  the EPB heating adviser carries out the approval;  the quality control body checks the undertakings and obligations of EPB heating advisers, issues reports on quality checks carried out and send these reports to Bruxelles Environnement.  Local Action Plan for Energy Management ( PLAGE) This regulatory measure was imposed by Articles 2.2.21 to 2.2.24 and 2.4.3 (105) of the Brussels Air, Climate and Energy Management Code (COBRACE  adopted on 2 May 2013). Its aim is to ensure that managers of extensive property holdings, whether public or private, optimise the energy management of their property by: - carrying out an energy survey of the buildings owned or occupied by the body; - implementing energy accounting for those buildings; - developing and implementing an action programme in order to achieve an energy consumption reduction target: This plan will include actions connected with the management and maintenance of building installations and investments. The methods for implementing the PLAGE are defined in several decrees (106). This measure came into force on 1 July 2019. The first energy surveys are expected in 2021. The parties responsible for implementing this measure are as follows.  The Government of the Brussels Capital Region determines the methods for preparing and implementing the PLAGE (Article 2.2.23(7) of the COBRACE).  Bruxelles Environnement sets the energy savings target to be achieved and checks the end-of-PLAGE report to see whether the target has been met. If the target has not been met, Bruxelles Environnement penalises the body as provided for by the COBRACE.  The body subject to the PLAGE requirement appoints a PLAGE coordinator, undertakes to achieve a PLAGE target and, at the end of the second phase, produces a report assessing whether the target has been met.  The PLAGE coordinator appointed by the body carries out the energy survey, identifies the priority buildings for the body concerned, and produces an action programme that the coordinator implements in order to achieve the energy savings target (Article 2.2.23 of the COBRACE).  The PLAGE auditor is independent of the body. The auditor assesses the credibility and relevance of the action programme and, where necessary, makes recommendations (Article 2.2.23(3) of the COBRACE). The auditor subsequently checks the data and information in the report assessing whether                                                            105 http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/mopdf/2013/05/21_1.pdf  pp. 28357-28420. 106 7 November 2018.- Ministerial Decree laying down the scales of effort for determining the target of the PLAGE, p. 90663. 7 November 2018.- Ministerial Decree laying down the methods and procedural conditions for implementing a system equivalent to the PLAGE, p. 90668. 14 June 2018.- Decree of the Government of the Brussels Capital Region on the Local Action Plan for Energy Management, p. 53307. 210 the target has been met. If the target has not been met, the auditor assesses the relevance and veracity of the specific circumstances that the body may have cited to justify this failure (Article 2.2.23(4) of the COBRACE). The PLAGE is mandatory for all the following (Articles 2.2.22 and 2.4.3 of the COBRACE):  any company that owns and/or occupies buildings located within the region that have a combined total surface area in excess of 100,000 m²;  any association covered by the Law of 27 June 1921 on non-profit associations, international non-profit associations and foundations that owns and/or occupies buildings located within the region that have a combined total surface area in excess of 100,000 m²;  public authorities that own and/or occupy buildings located within the region that have a combined total surface area in excess of 50,000 m²;  federal, regional and community authorities that own and/or occupy buildings located within the region.  Energy audits This regulatory measure, laid down in Article 6 of the Decree of the Government of the Brussels Capital Region of 8 December 2016 on the energy audit of large businesses and on the energy audit of the environmental permit, requires applications to renew environmental permits to be accompanied by an energy audit, where they relate to an establishment consisting of one or more buildings with a total surface area not allocated to housing in excess of 3,500 m². Holders of environmental permits are also required to implement any measures identified that have a return time of less than five years. The parties responsible for implementing this measure are as follows:  the Government of the Brussels Capital Region adopts regulations on the energy audit for energy-intensive establishments;  the independent auditor is approved (Chapter III of the Decree of 8 December 2016);  Bruxelles Environnement approves the auditor and carries out or delegates the quality control of energy audits (Article 18(9) of the Decree of 8 December 2016).  Energy incentives Energy incentives are regional subsidies for work to reduce energy consumption that are available to any natural or legal person who owns, leases or manages property located in the Brussels Capital Region. These incentives are means-tested and are particularly aimed at insulation work, investments in energy efficient thermal regulation systems, etc. The parties responsible for implementing this measure are as follows:  the Government of the Brussels Capital Region decides on the annual budget allocated to energy incentives within the energy fund (Article 24(2), third paragraph, of the Order of 19 July 2001 on the organisation of the electricity market in the Brussels Capital Region, and Article 18bis(2), second paragraph, of the Order of 1 April 2004 on the organisation of the gas market in the Brussels Capital Region, on highway occupation fees for gas and electricity, and amending the Order of 19 July 2001 on the organisation of the electricity market in the Brussels Capital Region) and on the annual implementation programme;  Bruxelles Environnement is responsible for the public service obligations of promoting the rational use of energy through information, demonstrations and provision of equipment, services and financial aid to all categories of final customer (Article 24(2), first paragraph, of the Order of 19 July 2001 on the organisation of the electricity market in the Brussels Capital Region, and Article 18bis(2), first paragraph, of the Order of 1 April 2004 on the organisation of the gas market in the Brussels Capital Region, on highway occupation 211 fees for gas and electricity, and amending the Order of 19 July 2001 on the organisation of the electricity market in the Brussels Capital Region).  NRClick NRClick is a regional support programme providing technical and financial support to reduce energy consumption within the buildings of local and regional public authorities in the Brussels Capital Region. This project is a reflection of the gimplementing energy saving measures. The NRClick project was included in the public service tasks of the distribution system operator by Article 24bis(1) of the Order on the electricity market:  Article 24bis. 1. The distribution system operator shall also be responsible for the following public service tasks:  10. in accordance with the arrangements in paragraph 2, supporting local and regional public authorities within the framework of the regional project to promote energy efficiency in the buildings of those public authorities, through advice, help with identifying opportunities, and administrative and technical support. The project is based on three pillars: energy accounting using the NRClick Scan tool; central purchasing body; energy efficiency. The energy saving measures will continue to have an effect after the project ends.  Improvement of the energy performance of public lighting Under Article 24bis(1)(2) of the Order of 19 July 2001 on the organisation of the electricity market in the Brussels Capital Region, the distribution system operator (Sibelga) has a public service task with regard to the construction, maintenance and renewal of public lighting installations on the highway and in communal public spaces. This task encompasses:  the construction and renewal of lights (and the low-voltage network specifically intended for the public lighting);  the preventive and curative maintenance of the installations;  the consumption of the public lighting. This task also involves targets to improve energy efficiency. The parties responsible for implementing this measure are as follows:  the Government of the Brussels Capital Region adopts the Order on the electricity market and decides on the allocation of resources from the climate fund;  Bruxelles Environnement is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the NRClick programme;  Sibelga is responsible for implementing the NRClick programme;  the local and regional authorities decide whether to participate in the NRClick programme.  Good Move regional mobility plan 2020-2030 As an innovative and coherent response to the issue of mobility, the Brussels Capital Region decided to aim the preparations for its mobility plan at users so that they could be offered easy, integrated and tailored mobility solutions allowing them to opt for the most efficient mode of transport for their travel. 212 The Order of 26 July 2013 (107) made the Regional Mobility Plan (Plan Régional de Mobilité  PRM) a regulatory measure. The Good Move plan (Regional Mobility Plan 2020-2030) is a strategic and operational instrument for guiding and applying mobility policy. The implementation of the PRM is to be assessed every 30 months. Based on this report, the government determines the corrective actions to be applied (Article 10). The ambitions of the mobility policy have been categorised according to various urban issues, three of which impact on energy efficiency:  reducing the impact of mobility on the environment (GREEN);  developing mobility that is favourable to the socioeconomic development and supply of the region (EFFECTIVE);  developing mobility that optimises resources (EFFICIENT). The parties responsible for implementing this measure are as follows:  the Government of the Brussels Capital Region adopts the Good Move plan (adopted at first reading in April 2019 and then submitted for public consultation) and defines the broad outlines and objectives of the PRM;  Bruxelles Mobilité is responsible for implementing the Good Move plan;  other Brussels public organisations and administrations are involved in implementing the measures according to their responsibilities (Bruxelles Environnement, the STIB, municipalities, etc.).  Energy savings in public transport (Société de transports intercommunaux bruxellois  STIB) The STIB has faced the dual challenge of increasing its transport offer while reducing its CO2 emissions and energy consumption. After four years of collaborative work, the STIB has developed a carbon and energy strategy to 2030. This strategy is based on a framework established in accordance with current international standards and covering both direct emissions and some indirect emissions. Using an initial diagnosis made for 2010 and having identified certain influencing parameters and a series of actions, the STIB has studied various scenarios for reducing its emissions from a baseline scenario. The STIB has identified numerous actions for improving its energy efficiency, which mainly concern its vehicle fleet and buildings: 1. renewal of the fleet; 2. recovery of braking energy; 3. Secure/Eco Drive; 4. optimisation of the heating and ventilation of vehicles; 5. renovation of heating installations; 6. lighting of metro stations; 7. awareness-raising; 8. improvement of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems in infrastructure; 9. improved integration of rational energy use clauses for maintenance.                                                             107 Order of 26 July 2013 establishing a mobility planning framework and amending various provisions impacting on mobility. 213 Energy Pack The Energy Pack is a four-year programme (2018-2021) resulting from a call for projects among four business federations (Bruxeo, Comeos, Santhea and UCM). The successful federations have received a subsidy to offer free energy coaching to their members, and also to non-members who apply. By assisting the energy advisers of these four bodies, the Energy Pack aims to support the implementation of specific energy measures as part of the adaptation or renovation of buildings. The services available include awareness-raising among energy managers, general management and staff of establishments, group training and individual coaching (energy diagnosis of buildings, heating check-ups, work assistance, etc.). contracted to draw up a communication plan, provide individual support to the partner federations (technical, communications, methods), lead group sessions and help with reporting. Together with the coaching service provided with its partners, Bruxelles Environnement has created a support mechanism for further investment in addition to the existing incentive and tax relief offers. A proportional amount can be granted under a number of conditions. The parties responsible for implementing this measure are as follows:  the four business federations: Bruxeo, Comeos, Santhea and UCM;  the coordination provider is 21 Solutions, which has the task of drawing up a communication plan, providing individual support to the partner federations (technical, communications, methods), leading group sessions and helping with reporting;  Bruxelles Environnement is responsible for operating the Energy Pack, establishing appropriate processes and managing subsidies (four federations and investment support) and the coordination contract.  Walloon Region Existing scheme  Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive (Directive 2012/27/EU) obliged the Walloon Region to introduce a scheme for annually reducing energy sales (i.e. final consumption) by 1.5% over the period 2014-2020.  Calculation method (Annex V) Target = By 31 December 2020, achieve a cumulative new energy savings target (the trajectory can be broken down as desired):   Durée de vie Lifetime 214 Additionalité (au-delà des normes EU + pas double comptage) Additionality (over and above EU standards + no double counting) EE matérielles et démontrables Tangible and demonstrable energy savings Système indépendant de mesure, vérification et contrôle Independent measurement, verification and control system 2 périodes + rapportage annuel 2 periods + annual reporting This is an obligation of both means and outcome, which translates into a cumulative energy savings target for Wallonia in the first period (2014-2020) of 25,675 GWh, i.e. an additional 917 GWh of new savings per year. Member States can choose one of two options in this respect (or a combination of both): o an obligation scheme; o a set of alternative measures. In 2013, the Walloon Government decided to use alternative measures only, rather than to introduce an obligation such as an energy efficiency certificate scheme. In view of the difficulty of achieving the target for the first period (2014-2020) through alternative measures, Wallonia must take steps to implement an additional scheme alongside the alternative measures for 2021-2030.  To 2030 The revision of the Energy Efficiency Directive extended and reinforced the obligation for the period 2021-2030. Wallonia must introduce a scheme guaranteeing a further 970 GWh of new end-use energy savings per year. The energy savings made to meet this obligation must be counted in accordance with very strict criteria: - robust, consistent and documented measurement or assessment methodology; - account taken of the lifetime of the impact of each measure individually; - eligibility of the measure taken into account (based on the reduction in final consumption, and not on the cancelling out of consumption by renewable generation); - additionality of the measure in relation to European rules and standards and also spontaneous development; - materiality (representative contribution of the measure to the transition to action) of each selected measure; - minimum quality requirements for implementation; - no double counting of impacts where several measures lead to the same action. Monitoring, verification and reporting of annual energy savings therefore play a vital role in the Article 7 obligation. It is planned to set up an Article 7 multidisciplinary committee to ensure the consistency of measures and compliance with eligibility criteria, identify and verify the impacts of the scheme, monitor and report on the results, and propose new measures where applicable. Furthermore, the measures selected to achieve the Walloon target are as follows: - implementation of the long-term renovation strategy for Walloon buildings, with all measures being eligible for the Article 7 scheme, both in the residential sector and in the public and private tertiary sector, including the exemplary role of public buildings in achieving energy neutrality well before 2050; - easier recourse to energy performance contracts, with the guaranteed result meeting the impact demonstrability requirements of the Article 7 scheme; - implementation of the FAST plan, with all modal shift measures (soft modes, public transport, shared vehicles, etc.) being eligible for the Article 7 scheme; - new generation of sectoral agreements with industry and business; - continued financial support for businesses transitioning to sustainable energy, with particular focus on SMEs. 215 ii. Long-term renovation strategy to support the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, including policies, measures and actions to stimulate cost-effective deep renovation and policies and actions to target the worst performing segments of the national building stock, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU The energy performance and energy efficiency of buildings are the responsibility of the federated entities. Consequently, each entity has developed its own long-term renovation strategy for the buildings in its region:  (Renovation Pact) and (Action plan for tertiary buildings) in  (Long-buildings) in Wallonia, and  (Strategy to reduce the environmental impact of existing buildings) in the Brussels Capital Region. These strategies are detailed below. While these strategies inevitably differ on some points, they present a common vision and share numerous measures. Each entity has the following objectives: dramatically increase the rate of energy renovation of its building stock; work towards a defined average performance level by 2050; focus on decarbonising the supply of heat, and involve civil society and stakeholders in the development of these policies. To achieve these objectives, legislative measures (e.g. introducing a housing passport and a building passport), tax measures and financial incentives (e.g. subsidies and access to low-interest loans for renovation works, as well as support measures) have been introduced. Emphasis has also been placed on developing data to gain a better understanding of the building stock. Demonstration projects within the European LIFE BE REEL project may serve as good examples and also help to provide data. General awareness is being raised through targeted communication campaigns. Without question, governments always have a very important exemplary role to play, and the respective strategies are increasing the speed at which the entities are having to renovate their own buildings. Lastly, to successfully implement these strategies, there needs to be sufficient capacity in the construction sector, among others, and quality training needs to be guaranteed. Each region is therefore also working on these aspects.  Federal State  The scope of the reduced VAT rate of 6% on the demolition and rebuilding of private dwellings, which currently applies in 32 towns, could be extended if the European Commission were to regard this measure as making a significant contribution to the Belgian energy efficiency target.  Entry into force on 1 January 2019 of an optional scheme for charging VAT on new buildings leased for commercial purposes where the lessee is a Belgian taxpayer. This measure will spur on the renovation associated with these new buildings.  A plan for an environmental energy tax will be drawn up in consultation with the federal and regional governments by 2021.  Flemish Region RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS Flanders has a population density of 487 inhabitants per km², which makes it one of the most densely populated regions in Europe. At the start of 2019, the Flemish Region had 6,589,069 inhabitants. Between 2007 and 2019, the number of private households in the region increased from 2.55 million to 2.8 million, which was an increase of over 10%. 216 The average family size was 2.32 in 2017, but will be 2.29 in 2027. Since 1995, the size of households has shrunk considerably. Between 1995 and 2017, the number of single-person households increased by half. By 2030, it will have almost doubled compared with 1995. Statistiek Vlaanderen predicts that, by 2030, the number of households will have risen by over 150,000 to 2.95 million (+5%). Single-person households are expected to rise by 11% between 2017 and 2030 to 954,000 (+94,000, or 32% of all households), and two-person households by 10% to 1,060,000 (+100,000, or 36% of all households). In both categories, the proportion of elderly people will increase significantpeople or more) has been falling for years, and this trend will continue in the future. This demographic change is accompanied by a growing need for small homes that are appropriate, affordable, high-quality and easily accessible. In the longer term, the population of the Flemish Region is expected to rise to 7.1 million inhabitants by 2040 and 7.4 million by 2060 (20.4% additional households) (source: Statbel). Number of households by size 1995 (observation) 2017 (forecast) 2030 (forecast) % increase 1995-2017 % increase 2017-2030 single-person household 588,542 (26%) 860,252 (31%) 954,362 (32%) 46 11 two-person household 731,905 (32%) 963,203 (35%) 1,061,533 (36%) 32 10 three-person household 431,981 (19%) 406,854 (15%) 397,920 (13%) -6 -2 four-person household 370,843 (16%) 361,032 (13%) 357,781 (12%) -3 -1 household with 5 or more members 178,126 (8%) 175,955 (6%) 179,108 (6%) -1 2 Total 2,301,397 2,767,295 2,950,704 20 7 Figure: Change in number of households by size and growth forecasts to 2030 (Statistiek Vlaanderen, 2017)  Current policy Achieving a much more energy-efficient housing stock poses considerable challenges. The government can support and facilitate this transformation, but other stakeholders, such as the construction sector, must also get involved. At the end of 2014, through a Renovation Pact, the Flemish Government started a process of mobilising investment to systematically improve the energy performance of the rhousing stock. This not only required a support policy, but in particular a positive message mainly based on the social importance of this transformation for the r-neutral society. Thirty-four organisations undertook to help actively and constructively to develop a Renovation Pact. With regard to the energy performance of existing housing, a long-term target was set for 2050, consisting of two equivalent parts: a series of measures and an energy performance indicator, which was set at an energy score of 100 kWh/m². This long-term target will be adjusted according to the type of dwelling. Owners face many obstacles to the deep renovation of their homes. Together with a lack of funds or access to funds, one of the most commonly cited issues is a lack of knowledge: what to do, where to start and what measures to take first to renovate housing so that it is high quality and energy-efficient.  1. Woningpas With the Woningpas (housing passport), the Flemish Government has developed a centrally managed instrument that, based on a specific vision and advice, helps owners to plan renovation works and their interactions with authorities in this respect (e.g. to obtain incentives and certificates). By removing barriers and offering streamlined and customised information, the Woningpas will encourage high-quality renovations and help to boost the renovation market. 217 The Woningpas is a free digital passport that was launched at the end of 2018 and that will eventually be available to all homes in Flanders. Owners can access relevant information on buildings, land and the environment, and also the certificates and incentives that the government already offers.  Insulation scores (roof, walls, floors, etc.) from the energy performance certificate (EPC) are displayed in the form of coloured bars (red, yellow, green) in the Woningpas so that owners can quickly and easily see how their home currently performs and the long-term target for 2050.  By the end of 2019/start of 2020, renovation advice from the EPC will be presented in graphic form in the Woningpas and will be supplemented by interactive encouragement aimed at owners. Owners will be able to use the Woningpas to monitor renovation work as it is carried out.  If an EPC for the dwelling is available, the owner can already obtain detailed information from the Woningpas on the age or performance of a boiler, which may encourage investment in a replacement and which could eventually be used to provide targeted information on the servicing obligation. This function will eventually be extended to all homes. The Woningpas allows owners to become more involved in the general condition of their homes in terms of comfort, energy performance, regulatory compliance, etc. This greater involvement may help to increase their desire to invest in improving the energy performance and quality of their homes. This is a new and innovative policy instrument in Flanders, which lies at the heart of the efforts to implement the long-term renovation strategy for buildings. As a partner in the European Horizon 2020 iBRoad project, the Flemish Government is sharing its experience and expertise to help other EU Member States to develop similar instruments.  2. Energy performance certificate (EPC) The EPC is also used as an important policy instrument for informing the public and raising their awareness about the energy performance of the house or apartment that they want to buy or rent. A new version of the EPC was launched in early 2019. The standard recommendations have been replaced by a package of measures, including an estimate of energy savings and costs (only for single-family houses), in accordance with the 2050 long-term target. A label has been added to this new EPC, ranging from F to A+. An A label currently corresponds to the long-term target. This will differ depending on the type of building. Outside the selling or renting context, the new EPC is also useful for anyone not necessarily wanting to sell or rent, but wanting label and what energy renovation work may be needed to achieve an A label. Even for those who have already completed a renovation, the EPC may be useful for knowing what label the renovated house has achieved. From 2022, every apartment block must have an EPC for the common parts. This will involve a different approach to selling and renting as this EPC will include information on the communal facilities, building envelope, and internal dividing floors and walls. The EPC for the common parts will aim to guide owners and the building renovation. This EPC will also assist with producing effective EPCs for the individual apartments. The information of the communal facilities, will only need to be identified and checked once. This will represent a time saving for both the building manager and the energy expert, meaning that the apartment EPC can be produced at a lower cost. This method will also ensure that the apartment EPCs are uniform from the outset.  3. Financial support System operators support energy saving by granting incentives for certain measures: insulation of walls, insulation of roofs and lofts, insulation of floors and cellars, high-performance glazing, heat pumps, solar water heaters. 218 When the incentives were reformed by the Flemish Government on 15 June 2016, some new energy saving incentives (e.g. for the insulation of internal walls and the comprehensive renovation incentive) were introduced and collective renovation projfinancial support for their management. To achieve the long-term target, the content requirements of various individual incentives were tightened. The new comprehensive renovation incentive came into effect on 1 February 2019. The improvement incentive disappeared and was fully absorbed into the renovation incentive. However, the adaptation incentive for work on housing for the over-65s will continue to exist separately. The renovation incentive is exclusively intended for individuals (natural person). It is particularly aimed at people who have carried out work on their own main culated for each category of work and amounts to 20% or 30% of the accepted cost price of the work (excluding VAT, with a maximum per category).  4. Tax measures The reduced rate of VAT of 6% (instead of 21%) for the renovation of houses that are more than 10 years old has been an important tax incentive for many years. In addition, a reduced rate of VAT of 6% has been applied since 2007 for rebuilding after demolition in 13 central towns in Flanders. In 2009 and 2010 the measure was temporarily extended to the entire country in order to give the construction sector a helping hand following the financial crisis. When gift taxes were reformed on 1 July 2015, the first initiative adopted used these tax instruments to provide targeted support to investments aimed at improving the energy performance of our housing stock. When the gift is made, the normal rate of gift tax must be paid. When the gift recipient proves that additional conditions have been met, the difference between the normal rate and the special rate for energy renovation is refunded. The gift recipient must carry out the renovation work within five years of the date of the deed of gift. The total cost of the work must be at least EUR 10,000 (excluding VAT) and the conditions applicable to energy incentives must be met. Brackets  Rates from 1/7/2015 Direct line  (Grand)parents - (grand)children  Between partners Direct line  Energy renovation Indirect line Direct line  Energy renovation 0 -  3% 3% 10% 9% -  9% 6% 20% 17% -  18% 12% 30% 24%  27% 18% 40% 31%  On 9 May 2018 the Flemish Parliament approved changes to the registration tax on property purchases for sale contracts concluded from 1 June 2018. Since then, when purchasing a family home (not including second homes), the rate has been 7%. If a major energy renovation is carried out, the rate is reduced to 6%, which gives the purchaser an additional budget for renovation. For major energy renovations of residential buildings where the planning permission application dates from 1 October 2016, property tax is reduced for five years: - if the E-level is not higher than E90, the reduction is 50%; - if the E-level is not higher than E60, the reduction is 100%. A major energy renovation involves completely replacing the technical installations (heating, cooling, ventilation, etc.) and (post-)insulating at least 75% of the existing and new external envelope. 219 For the renovation of inhabitable buildings, there will be an exemption from property tax from the 2019 tax year. Owners of properties listed in the regional inventory as being inhabitable or unavailable can benefit from a property tax exemption for five years if the building or housing concerned is demolished in order to build one or more new/replacement buildings. For housing, the tax benefit is limited to maximum of EUR 1,000 per year. This benefit can be combined with the property tax relief for a new ultra-energy-efficient building.  5. Standards There are already some standards, such as the roof insulation standard and the glass standard under the Flemish Housing Code. By 2020 all roofs of individual homes (single-family houses, studios and apartments, therefore not rooms) must be insulated (108). By 2023 all homes must have double glazing. The environment policy includes the obligation to inspect and service the central heating. The electrical installation must also be inspected when the property is sold and also every 25 years. An EPC must be produced on sale or rental of the property. EPC requirements apply to both new buildings and major energy renovations, and also to renovation work requiring permission. From 2021 construction in accordance with NZEB principles will be the standard for new homes in Flanders, which must therefore achieve an E-level of E30 or below.  6. Energy loans On 19 May 2017 the Flemish Government decided to reform and optimise the policy instrument. From 2019 energy loans for individuals will be reserved solely for the priority target group. Through an energy loan, vulnerable families can borrow and repay interest free up to EUR 15,000 over a period of 10 years for work intended to save energy. Beneficiaries can also obtain free advice and support (quotations, selection of contractors, follow-up of work, applications for incentives). In addition to individuals in the vulnerable target groups, some non-market legal persons and some cooperatives (schools, hospitals, non-profit associations, etc.) can also borrow up to EUR 15,000 at 1% (over 10 years) until at least 2020.  7. Extension of the tasks of energy centres In addition to granting energy loans, the 19 energy centres have been given additional tasks and will therefore, from 1 January 2019, act as one-stop shops with the emphasis being on help and guidance. Assessments aimed at helping vulnerable families to carry out energy saving work (roof insulation, double glazing, boiler) have been included in the tasks of energy centres since 2019. The centres will also act as local coordinators, for example by harmonising the services of local partners and housing information points.  8. Housing policy initiatives The Flemish Decree on the rental of housing stipulates that, from 2019, landlords and tenants can agree that the rent will be adjusted following energy renovation work and that, in the event of disagreement, the courts can decide on the adjustment if the normal rental value resulting from the investment is more than 10% higher than the rent applicable at the time. Several initiatives have recently been adopted to make existing social housing more energy efficient. - Social housing framework decree: o An energy correction can be applied when calculating the rent if the projected use is less than the reference use. o Regulation on the method of calculating how social housing tenants can offset the investment costs associated with installing solar panels.                                                            108 From 2020, a maximum EPC value will be set in the regulation on the quality of housing. EPC values higher than this figure may offset the lack of roof insulation or double glazing. 220 - In 2018 social housing associations produced an inventory of their assets using a limited measurement of their condition. On that basis, they drew up a renovation plan for the next five years. At the end of 2011, a budget of EUR 28.5 million was made available for individual energy measures in rented social housing in the context of rational use of green heat and energy. This amount will almost entirely have been paid out by the end of 2019. - When the Flemish Climate Policy Plan 2013-2020 was approved, a budget of EUR 7.8 million was earmarked for co-financing a comprehensive renovation incentive for social housing associations. This has since been  - Over the 2016-2019 period, the Flemish Climate Fund provided EUR 20 million per year for additional investments in the energy renovation of rented social housing. In its September 2018 statement, the Flemish Climate Fund indicated that a further EUR 16 million would be made available, with an advance of EUR 3 million being paid in 2018. This left a budget of EUR 13 million for 2019. The funds have been used to subsidise extensive energy measures in the renovation and replacement of existing housing, in particular the installation of high-performance glazing, an insulating external envelope and technical installations such as heat pumps, high-performance boilers or solar water heaters.  Additional measures The WAM scenario (or policy scenario) includes the following (energy saving) measures:  1. Develop the EPC Through an EPC containing energy renovation recommendations, we will help owners to renovate their homes in a sustainable and high-quality manner. An EPC will be essential in order to obtain a large renovation incentive (minimum of EUR 5,000) or an energy loan (minimum of EUR 7,500). Through communication and awareness-raising, we also aim to increase the number of voluntary EPCs. In this way, we will be able to of their house or apartment. Depending on how the measures are developed and assessed, this will also provide a clearer and more complete view of the (energy) performance of the housing stock. In collaboration with the financial sector, we will determine how EPC data can be shared so that lenders can decide, on the basis of simulations, scenarios, construction plans, etc., on additional borrowing capacity or which benefits may be associated with the loan for owners who significantly improve energy savings during the renovation. In order to systematically improve the EPC score of rental housing, the Housing Minister will gradually tighten the maximum EPC score in terms of the minimum quality requirements of housing. This will be done by taking account of the 2050 long-term target and introducing reference criteria in accordance with the Flemish Energy and Climate Plan. This measure will result in energy savings of 341 GWh by 2030.  2. Develop assistance initiatives Through innovative assistance and financing initiatives, we will encourage a higher rate of renovation. We will promote integration of the services currently provided by energy centres, housing information points (IGS [inter-municipal partnership] projects) and provincial support points for sustainable construction. Greater coordination should result in the creation of a local one-stop shop for energy and housing, which will offer a permanent high-quality service and form the first point of contact for local target groups (public, businesses, associations, etc.). We will form a pool of trained renovation coaches, with the following tasks for example: 221 - provide initial renovation advice from the energy and housing one-stop shop; for tailor-made advice, it would be better to have a pool of architects who are experienced in energy efficient renovation; - assist specific target groups (plan of approach, request and assessment of quotations, monitoring work, help with the acceptance of work, applications for incentives, etc.); - develop a financing proposal suited to the needs of the owner/housing. Many owners are not yet sufficiently engaged with the long-term renovation goal. They feel that their homes -term goal needs to be personalised so that they are motivated to act. The results of a number of projects that have already been implemented suggest that thermography is a prime motivation tool. The combination of thermographic photographs with a series of explanations and subsequent advice during the energy saving renovation work seems to be an attractive, cost-effective and far-reaching approach. The use of roof and façade scans makes the thermal losses clear and understandable and is a simple measure that could encourage many owners to take the decision to renovate. Given their significant awareness-raising effect, we will gradually produce a finely meshed series of thermographic photographs of roofs and façades, which will be used in the services provided by the energy and housing one-stop shop. We will start with pilot projects in regions where there is already a good supply of local energy renovation services. Correct interpretation of the thermographic images by these service-providers will be guaranteed (training, manuals, etc.). If the pilot projects are assessed as having a positive effect, they will be rolled out more widely. This measure will result in energy savings of 78 GWh by 2030.  3. Local round tables on the climate Being in the frontline in terms of the consequences of climate change on the ground, it is unsurprising that most local authorities want to positively tackle this issue. It is not by chance that the vast majority have signed the Covenant of Mayors on the climate and energy and are committed to actively implementing that agreement. Objections or practical issues sometimes prevent good intentions from being converted into action on the ground. Like the Netherlands, we will organise round tables on the climate for this purpose. Through this initiative, we will bring all local stakeholders and key players around the table. This will particularly involve authorities, individuals, associations, businesses, etc., as well as all those who want to or can get involved in local policy or who can help to overcome practical objections. Without domust have a seat at the renovation table are the local authorities for the mapping of needs, citizens and businesses living and located in the district to be renovated, the local energy and housing one-stop shop, the financial sector, and local suppliers and installers of sustainable products. The information gathered through these local round tables on the climate will also be crucial for participating in the implementation and monitoring of the long-term renovation strategy 2050. The Flemish Government will also ensure that the best practices resulting from these round tables will be communicated to other round tables so that they can be disseminated as widely as possible in the short term. In relation to the local Energy and Climate Pact, the Flemish Minister for Internal Administration will continue the discussions on these round tables with the local authorities. We estimate an effect in terms of additional energy savings of around 284 GWh by 2030.  4. Align housing and energy incentives To ensure user-friendliness and transparency, the greatest possible number of incentives targeted at energy savings, improvement of quality and adaptation of housing will be brought within a one-stop shop with a view to developing a comprehensive housing renovation incentive. 222 There is currently a wide range of incentives in the area of housing and energy policy. Housing incentives are strictly limited to certain income categories, whereas energy incentives (roof, walls, floor insulation, glazing, etc.) are open to everyone, but their basic amount is limited. Our aim is to eventually offer a single incentive for the renovation of housing. To start with, a one-stop shop will be set up in the form of a common front office for the public. This requires a high level of coordination in terms of content, with the focus being on existing target groups as far as possible in order to encourage improvements in quality and energy savings. Subsidised work will be clearly defined so that any overlaps or contradictions are avoided. Cooperation between the VEA, the Flanders Housing Agency and its legal successor, and distribution system operators will also be needed in order to organise the data flows between the front office and the back office.  5. Reduce registration taxes In terms of housing taxation, we will shift the tax benefit from possession of a property to its purchase. At the same time as gradually abolishing the housing bonus, we will reduce the rate of sales tax on the purchase of a sole private single-family home from 7% to 6%. In the case of a major energy renovation and following a demolition, we will further reduce the rate to 5%.  6. Encourage the replacement of electric water heaters with heat pump water heaters A heat pump water heater is a heat pump equipped with a tank. As heat is extracted more uniformly for domestic hot water than for space heating, heat pumps are perfectly suited to this function and ensure good energy efficiency. The heat source can be smaller, but there is always domestic hot water on tap. The fan draws in ambient heat that is used by the air-to-water heat pump to heat the water. This results in a 70% saving on electricity compared with an electric water heater. In 2018, 2,726 heat pump water heaters were installed in existing residential buildings. In 2019 and 2020, it is predicted that 2,200 heat pump water heaters will be installed in existing residential buildings. Over the period 2021-2030, it is assumed that an average of 4,500 heat pump water heaters will be installed every year, of which 4,050 (90% of 4,500) will be installed in existing residential buildings. In 2019, a declining incentive was introduced for heat pump water heaters: EUR 400 in 2019, EUR 300 in 2020 and EUR 200 in 2021, 2022 and 2023. From 2024, no incentive will be paid for installing heat pump water heaters. We will revise the incentive scheme in 2020 with a view to adding a condition on active direction. If it is assumed that the average domestic hot water consumption per family is 3,000 kWh and that the average seasonal performance factor (SPF) is 3 for heat pump water heaters, this gives a saving of 2,000 kWh per heat pump water heater. This measure will result in energy savings of 90 GWh by 2030.  7. Speed up the rate of renewal and setting optimisation of existing natural gas and heating oil boilers In 2017, nearly 1.5 million homes in Flanders still had an old heating system (more than 15 years old). Every year, 90,000 to 95,000 appliances will be replaced with new fossil fuel boilers (which must comply with the Ecodesign Directive from September 2015) and 1,000 to 1,500 appliances will be replaced with a heat pump. In order to make the heating of buildings more sustainable, we must firstly speed up the rate of renewal of heating systems. At European level, the transposition of Directive 2018/844/EU, also known as the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive or EPBD, will encourage the tightening of existing measures and possibly the development of new measures to increase the energy efficiency of the European building stock. This is particularly the case with the energy-related operation of technical building systems in such buildings. 223 The Flemish Government Decree of 8 December 2006 on the servicing and inspection of central heating appliances for the heating of buildings or for the production of utility hot water is the most appropriate tool for this purpose. The Decree imposes a servicing obligation: natural gas (natural gas, butane or propane) central heating appliances must be serviced every two years by a qualified engineer who is familiar with heating oil and solid fuel appliances. The Decree also contains performance requirements. Where the inspection of an appliance reveals that it does not meet the energy efficiency requirements, it must be replaced, at the very least by a condensing boiler, but preferably by a heat pump or other form of environmentally friendly energy production. Where there is an available district heating system, preference must be given to connection to that system. In order to check that the servicing obligation is being met and to make the heating of buildings more sustainable, we will firstly digitise the inspection and servicing documents and, in 2020, we will start to develop a database containing this information on the main heating system used in each building. The database will be populated over the period 2021-2022. It will also be accessible via the Woningpas so that owners are informed when a service of their central heating system must be scheduled. A well-maintained central heating system allows significant energy savings to be made, is good for the climate and reduces energy bills. At the same time as developing the database, we will amend the regulations. The items in the heating audit that relate to the calculation of energy performance will be included in the inspection and servicing documents, together with information on the correct sizing of such heating systems. The required power calculations will be relatively simple. Whenever a scheduled service is carried out, the energy efficiency of the boiler will be optimised by correctly setting the installation (setting optimisation). After all, many existing appliances (and also newly installed appliances) are over-sized, with the water temperature often being set (by the installer) higher than it needs to be. The combination of maximum efficiency of the heating system (reduced water temperature and longer operating hours) and careful use of a programmable thermostat (which can control several heating zones) will ensure a potential for savings in 1.5 million homes without compromising on comfort. From 2021 onwards, we will start to raise the awareness of owners through various methods. To help owners in their choice of sustainable heating, we will prepare a decision tree in 2020. We will conduct communication and awareness-raising campaigns on the energy efficiency of heating and air-conditioning installations through, for example, www.veiligverwarmen.be), which targets individuals and engineers as well as local authorities and intermediary organisations (e.g. housing associations), Cool yourself wellwww.koeljegoed.be). From 2021, we will no longer grant incentives for the replacement of a heating oil boiler by a protected customer if natural gas is present in the street. To encourage more sustainable heating, we will grant higher incentives to protected customers only for natural gas condensing boilers and heat pumps. Digital electricity and natural gas meters will be installed in Flanders in the next few years for all low-voltage connections up to 56 kVA. When the digital natural gas meter is installed, the boiler must be switched off. To ensure quick installation, users will be asked, in the letter sent prior to installation, to ensure that their boiler has been serviced and inspected in accordance with the applicable regulations (109). If the boiler has been correctly inspected and complications arise following installation, the boiler restart or reprogramming costs will be covered by the distribution system operators. If the boiler has not been inspected, users will be responsible for the costs. This measure will ensure widespread communication with the corresponding financial incentive to promote the inspection of boilers. A solid framework for applying the servicing obligation is also important for this measure, which has a significant impact on energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Effective application of the law will improve compliance with the servicing obligation and with the performance requirement, resulting in a higher rate of replacement. Local authorities are responsible for monitoring compliance with the Decree, which is hardly being applied at the                                                            109 Article 8 of the Flemish Government Decree of 8 December 2006 on the servicing and inspection of central heating appliances for the heating of buildings or for the production of utility hot water. 224 moment. Decentralised heating appliances are not covered by these regulations. In collaboration with local authorities, we will look at how to improve the application of this measure and how to accompany it with appropriate awareness-raising, communication and information flows so that an effective application framework can be in place from 2025. This measure will result in energy savings of 2,163 GWh by 2030.  8. Connection to natural gas of homes in new large housing developments and apartment buildings From 2021, homes in new large housing developments and apartment buildings can be connected to natural gas only for district heating by cogeneration or in combination with a renewable energy system as the main heating system. From that date, the E30 level will apply to new-builds and the limited residual energy demand can therefore be easily met by sources other than fossil fuels. EPB certificates reveal that 80% of new homes are connected to natural gas, which represents around 8,000 natural gas boilers every year. It can be assumed that 2,750 homes will opt for a heat pump and 1,000 for connection to a district heating system. Assuming that the average heating and domestic hot water consumption in a new home is 3,785 kWh for fossil fuels and 1,708 kWh for a heat pump, the saving is 2,077 kWh per additional heat pump installed. With regard to district heating systems, it can be assumed that the residual heat comes from industry in half of the cases (500 homes), therefore producing a 100% saving. The other 500 homes will be connected to a green district heating system. This measure will result in energy savings of 76 GWh by 2030.  9. No heating oil boilers in new homes and in the case of major energy renovations from 2021 or in the case of replacement of an existing heating oil boiler From 2021, we will impose a ban on heating oil boilers in new-builds and in the case of major energy renovations. It will not be possible to replace existing heating oil boilers with other heating oil boilers if there is a possibility of connecting to the natural gas system in the street, except where it is proven that the heating oil boilers have an equivalent performance to the latest natural gas condensing boilers. Heating oil boilers are rarely used in new-builds. Since 2012, only 0.15% of EPB certificates have indicated heating oil as the energy carrier. The potential for savings in new-builds is therefore limited. The potential from 2021 will therefore lie almost entirely with major energy renovations, which should involve 500 homes per year based on predicted growth. Installing a gas boiler instead of a heating oil boiler has a positive effect only on CO2 emissions, as it does not result in much energy saving. Only installing a heat pump allows energy savings to be made (around 4,847 kWh in savings per heat pump). It is assumed that a heat pump will be installed in half of the cases. This measure will result in energy savings of 10 GWh by 2030.  10. Measures to encourage demolition and rebuilding  Post-demolition new-builds replace old houses with mediocre energy performance and insufficient comfort and help to increase the density of our town centres and villages and make them more attractive As part of preparations for the final NECP, we will ask the Federal Government to extend the reduced rate of VAT of 6% for renovations to all towns and municipalities in Belgium as soon as possible, as this is an effective instrument for speeding up the implementation of regional renovation strategies. In the meantime, the Flemish demolition and rebuilding incentive, introduced in October 2018, will be extended to the end of 2020. It is predicted that 2,300 applications will be made and 620 demolition incentives will be paid in 2019 and that, in 2020 when the system is in full swing, 3,000 applications will be made and 2,000 incentives will be paid. 225 In 2018, post-demolition rebuilding resulted in 4,079 new residential units (EPB database). In the Flemish Region, given that 350,000 homes are structurally inadequate (mainly dating from pre-1960), the potential is huge. We assume that the reduced rate of VAT will apply from 2021. In consultation with local authorities, the Flemish Minister for Internal Administration will also discuss local demolition plans and local demolition funds. Lastly, post-demolition registration taxes will be reduced from 6% to 5%, as with the registration taxes for major renovations. This measure will result in energy savings of 557 GWh by 2030.  11. Rolling fund for the energy renovation of housing purchased out of necessity The rolling fund for the energy renovation of housing purchased out of necessity is active. It aims to reduce energy poverty by granting interest-a low-quality home partly out of necessity, without having the financial resources to improve the quality of the home, resulting in high energy bills among other issues. The number of homes purchased out of necessity in Flanders is estimated at 4% (i.e. around 119,000 homes) of the Flemish housing stock. The interest-free loans will be used to fund measures designed to ensure that the housing meets the basic safety, health and quality requirements set out in Article 5 of the Decree of 15 July 1997 on the Flemish Housing Code, and to make it more energy efficient. It is planned that the loan (and part of any capital gain) will be repaid when the property is sold or gifted, or after 20 years at the latest. The interest-free loan must not exceed EUR 25,000. The resources available in the rolling fund (EUR 15.5 million) will therefore allow around 620 homes to be renovated. A call for projects will therefore be launched in early 2020, aimed at the CPASs. The effectiveness of the fund will be assessed through the selected projects. This measure will result in energy savings of 96 GWh by 2030.  12. Change behaviour through information in energy bills Including behavioural information in energy bills is a powerful tool. People are heavily influenced by what others are doing, particularly in their immediate surroundings. Where there is a benchmark (even if only implied), people are intrinsically motivated to conform. In other countries, such information has already had significant positive effects in terms of energy savings for the public. The energy bilconsumption of between 1.5% and 3.5%. This cheap non-financial measure  sending a bill containing this information  can therefore significantly change consumer behaviour. Assuming that this technique leads to a 2.5% saving on electricity consumption and a 1% saving on natural gas consumption, a total theoretical saving of 523 GWh can be achieved by Flemish households (basis: Vito energy balance). To avoid any overlap with other measures, such as the setting of heating installations, a saving of 52 GWh will be taken into account.  13. E-level requirement for major energy renovations of E70 in 2020 and E60 in 2025 Since 2015, there have been specific requirements for major energy renovations (MERs). These are renovations (with planning permission) where at least the heating and/or cooling generator is completely replaced and at least 75% of the external envelope is (re)insulated. To ensure additional and faster savings from MERs, the required E-level will change from E90 to E70 in 2020, and to E60 in 2025. The 50% reduction in property tax due to an E-level of E90 will disappear in 2020, with the 100% exemption due to an E-level of E60 being maintained from the same year. The methods of calculating the energy performance of new-builds and major energy renovations have frequently changed and become more complex in recent years. Numerous construction partners have therefore 226 lost touch with the EPB regulations. In consultation with stakeholders, we will transform the current methods into one transparent and simplified method in which innovative construction techniques receive sufficient attention. The aim of the method will be to ensure that buildings can be objectively compared with each other and can be steered towards energy efficiency measures. In collaboration with stakeholders, we will also work to further improve the user-friendliness of the software tools. Simplifying the software and making it more user-friendly will remove a number of obstacles to MERs, which will therefore increase in number. Based on current applications for planning permission for MERs, it is assumed that there will be 1,000 applications per year. An E90 home uses an average of 10,108 kWh for heating and domestic hot water. Tightening the requirement from E90 to E70 will save 2,246 kWh (an E70 home consumes an average of 7,861 kWh). Introducing the E60 requirement from 2027 (in actual fact from 2025 as the average period of time between the application for planning permission and the EPB certificate is 2 years) will result in the following saving compared with the baseline scenario: 3,369 kWh (an E60 home consumes an average of 6,738 kWh). This measure will result in energy savings of 25 GWh by 2030.  14. Encourage the renovation of housing within five years of the notarial transfer By 2050 at the latest, the entire Flemish housing stock must have been fully improved in energy terms in line with the long-term target, meaning that every year an average of 3% of housing must undergo a full energy renovation. An appropriate support policy is needed to achieve the interim targets in accordance with the Flemish Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030 and the 2050 long-term target. On average, over 75,000 homes have been sold every year in Flanders in recent years, which represents 2.5% of the housing market. Over 1% of homes change hands every year as a result of gifts and inheritances. Given that the Flemish Building Confederation (Vlaamse Confederatie Bouw  VCB) has found that 50% of new owners renovate (to a certain extent) in the first year following purchase and 75% within three years, a change of owner is the ideal moment in the life of a home to start renovating with the aim of meeting the long-term target. On average, this opportunity will arise only once for each home during the 2019-2050 period. Taking systematic advantage of the potential offered by a change of owner is an excellent way of encouraging owners to give greater consideration to energy renovation work in their overall renovation project. Given that, at the current rate of 3.5% per year, most non-compliant homes will change hands (sold, gifted, contributed to a company or inherited) by 2050, financial incentives should be developed so that major energy renovations can be carried out at these natural moments for extensive renovation work, such as a sale, although market price distortions and affordability must be monitored. In order to control the energy consumption and energy bills of new owners, while achieving our climate objective, we will ensure, in particular by relaxing the terms of an energy loan, that non-energy efficient homes are fully renovated in terms of energy consumption within a maximum of five years of the notarial transfer of full ownership in order to achieve a maximum EPC score by type of building from 2021. We will also examine the following options by September 2020 at the latest: - reduction in property tax on non-energy efficient homes following a major energy renovation; - increase in energy incentives for new owners to improve the EPC label; - assistance with preparing an energy efficient renovation master plan, which will help the association of co-owners and the building manager with the renovation of large apartment buildings; - public-private rolling fund for the renovation of apartments so that the term of VME loans can be extended from 10 years to 30 years. Granting a public guarantee can help to mobilise private capital. Pending further research, it is assumed that homes will be renovated to achieve at least the C label within five years of their transfer. This measure will result in energy savings of 3,406 GWh by 2030. 227  15. Social housing  The simulation table for the construction of social housing 2017 anticipates that subsidised funding will be granted for renewable energy sources, the NZEB level will be achieved and special district heating installations will be used in social housing. Before the end of 2019, the guidance document on the design of social housing will be amended so that it sets an E-Level of E60 as standard for major renovations. We will also ensure that social housing associations are correctly informed in good time of the fact that new social housing must be built in accordance with the NZEB E-30 standard from 2021. This will also apply to the construction of replacement housing, which is generally the best possible option in energy terms. By 2050 all rental social housing must have a maximum EPC rating of 100 kWh/m². In cooperation with social housing associations and using the Woningkenmerken (property features) tool and the GeefEpc (Give EPC) tool, the Flemish Social Housing Association (Vlaamse Maatschappij voor Sociaal Wonen  VMSW) will draw up an action plan for achieving this target by 2050 and will indicate the effort needed in this respect. In the short term, the VMSW will launch the Design and Insulate procedure to facilitate the energy renovation of social housing association properties. In the first instance, the sector has asked for this procedure to be applied to roof insulation, following which procedures will be launched for other energy work.  16. Speed up elimination of the asbestos risk in residential roofs  In order to speed up renovation of residential roofs containing asbestos, an incentive is granted as an additional measure for renovating such roofs. This incentive represents a contribution by the Flemish Government to the additional costs incurred by owners in renovating a roof containing asbestos and is intended to ensure rapid and safe/responsible demolition of such roofs. According to figures from the OVAM and the VEA, the number of residential roofs containing asbestos is estimated at 270,000. The asbestos plan aims to eliminate the asbestos risk in Flanders by 2034. Renovating 270,000 roofs over a 15-year period corresponds to 18,000 roofs per year and requires an annual incentive budget of EUR 18 million. Through this incentive, a larger number of roofs will be renovated each year compared with the current situation of the existing rational energy use incentive and the additional incentive policy in the event of a notarial transfer. The current rational energy use incentive allows the annual renovation of 46,384 roofs. Assuming that all roofs date from pre-2000, 15% contain asbestos, which corresponds to 6,958 roofs. Through the incentive policy in the event of a notarial transfer, the roofs of 4,758 homes will be renovated each year. Once again, it is assumed that the roofs date from pre-2000 and therefore that 15% of them contain asbestos. Out of the 18,000 roofs containing asbestos that need to be renovated each year, 11,716 will already be covered by the rational energy use incentive and the incentive policy in the event of a notarial transfer. The renovation of 6,381 roofs will therefore be speeded up. If the calculation is based on an energy saving of 7 MWh per roof, this gives an additional annual energy saving of 44.67 GWh. We will focus on communication and assistance to encourage individuals to renovate their roofs containing asbestos. This measure will result in energy savings of 447 GWh by 2030.  17. Increase the inflow of labour into the construction sector The capacity of the construction sector represents a major challenge for achieving the renovation strategy by 2050. In cooperation with the construction sector, the ministers responsible for education, energy and employment will draw up an action plan through the Flemish Advisory Committee on Construction (Vlaams 228 Bouwoverlegcomité  VBOC) in order to devise systematic solutions for structurally increasing the inflow of labour into the construction sector and to develop more efficient and less labour-intensive techniques of energy renovation.   NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS Among non-residential buildings, there are six main subsectors: offices, retail, hotel and catering, health, education, and other community and social services (water and waste, goods handling, laundries, sport and culture, etc.). The office sectors (excluding public authorities, retail, hotel and catering, and some of the other community and social services) can be grouped within the business sectors. Health and education are community sectors. Offices (28%) and retail (21%) together accounted for around half of the total final energy consumption in the consumption, with hotel and catering, health and education respectively accounting for around 12%, 10% and 4% of final energy consumption in the tertiary sector. Given the large number of subsectors, there is also a wide variation within the stock of non-residential buildings in terms of energy consumption and market characteristics. In addition, the ownership structure is more complex than for residential buildings. Properties are more often leased, or managed by a third party. There are also buildings that belong to, and are used by, the public. In terms of the Flemish Government, this accounts for 2,861 buildings with a primary energy consumption of 1,340 GWh in 2018. In this case, the final energy consumption is 330 GWh for electricity, 504 GWh for gas and 10 GWh for heating oil. The total useful floor area of these buildings is 3.1 million m². If we look at the Flemish Government in the broad sense (including local authorities and all healthcare and educational establishments), primary energy consumption is around 15,000 GWh. The main reasons why offices, public authorities, etc. are not achieving the potential energy savings are as follows: - energy costs represent only a small part of operating costs (less than 5% on average for office buildings); - knowledge of energy saving measures is limited in office/business buildings; - funding, as available investment resources are primarily used for the basic activities; - many businesses also lease their buildings, which makes them less inclined to invest in them.  Current policy The current range of policy instruments can be divided into two categories: regulations and financial support. A number of assistance initiatives have also been developed for the target group.  1. EPC An energy performance certificate (EPC) must be issued for public buildings, which are buildings occupied by public bodies that provide public services to a large number of people. A public building EPC must be issued for public buildings with a useful floor area of 250 m² or more. This requirement therefore covers not only the buildings of the Flemish authorities (both federal and local), but also those of healthcare and educational establishments. From 2020, the EPC will become compulsory on the sale or lease of small non-residential buildings. In order to be regarded as a small non-residential unit, the building must meet the following conditions: - be functionally independent (the unit operates independently); - be accessible through a lockable private access from the public highway, a courtyard or a shared circulation area; 229 - be a small unit: useful floor area  500 m²; - not form part of a large non-residential unit: useful floor area of the uninterrupted set of non-residential units  1,000 m².  2. Compulsory energy audit for large businesses Under Article 8 of the Energy Efficiency Directive, large businesses are required to undergo an audit. Large businesses are defined as those employing over 250 persons or which have an annual turnover exceeding EUR 50 million and which have an annual balance sheet total exceeding EUR 43 million. Establishments that have a public building EPC including an energy plan complying with VLAREM II (Flemish Government Decree of 1 June 1995 laying down general and sectoral requirements in terms of environmental health), that have signed an energy policy agreement or that meet standards EN 16001 or ISO 50001 are not subject to this obligation. This compulsory energy audit covers both the energy consumption of the building and the energy consumption of the process and transport. The audit is carried out by an in-house or external energy expert and the VEA checks the quality of audits. The audit must be updated every four years. Among the specific examples of non-residential buildings covered by the scope of the Directive are bank buildings such as those of BNP Paribas Fortis and KBC, the Jessa hospital in Hasselt, residential care centres, stores such as IKEA, etc. In the non-residential sectors, it is mainly office buildings, healthcare establishments and, to a lesser extent, retail establishments that are subject to the compulsory energy audit for large businesses.  3. Energy performance level (EPL) regulations The EPL regulations imposes energy performance requirements on non-residential buildings. For example, there are standards for insulation, ventilation and energy performance. The requirements differ depending on whether the building is new or is undergoing a major energy renovation or a normal renovation.  4. Compulsory inspection of heating and air-conditioning systems Articles 14 and 15 of the EPBD lay down obligations for the inspection of heating and air-conditioning systems. With regard to heating installations, the requirements are met through the heating audit (Article 9 of the Decree on heating appliances). The heating audit consists of a comprehensive assessment of the size and efficiency of the heating appliance and also an assessment of the energy performance of the entire heating installation, requirements. The owner receives a heating audit report containing recommendations on the possible replacement of the installation and other energy saving measures. A copy of the report must also be provided by the owner to the user (lessee). The frequency of the heating audit depends on the rated output and type of fuel and ranges from every two years to every five years. With regard to air-conditioning installations, an energy inspection must be carried out. In accordance with Article 15 of the EPBD, air-conditioning systems with a rated output of more than 12 kW must be regularly inspected. This obligation is set out in Article 5.16.3.3 of VLAREM II. The inspection consists of an assessment of the efficiency and sizing of the air-conditioning system, taking into account the buildan examination of the available documentation, a visual inspection of the air-conditioning system, an assessment of the correct use of the air-conditioning system, and an examination of some of the operating parameters of this system. The frequency of inspection of air-conditioning systems depends on the rated output and ranges from every two years to every five years. In addition, a new air-conditioning system must be inspected for the first time within 12 months of being commissioned. All air-conditioning units must also undergo an energy inspection within 12 months of being installed or replaced.  230 5. Energy incentives Electricity distribution system operators (DSOs) must promote the rational use of energy (RUE) by their customers under their public service obligations (PSOs). The main measure implemented by DSOs under their PSOs is the payment of energy incentives for both residential and non-residential buildings. More specifically, for non-residential buildings, incentives can be obtained for the insulation of roofs, lofts, external walls, cellars and floors, for the installation of high-performance glazing, a solar water heater, a heat pump or a heat pump water heater, and for relighting. The above incentives can be combined.  6. Energy incentive following an energy audit If an energy audit reveals that making an energy investment in a building would result in significant energy savings and where this investment has actually been made, Fluvius also grants an energy incentive under its PSOs. The incentive amount is EUR 0.035 per kWh of primary energy saved, with a maximum of EUR 25,000 per project and per year. The depreciation period of the measure must exceed two years and the buildings concerned must be at least five years old on the date of the application for the incentive. This incentive applies only to measures for which there is no specific energy incentive as defined in point 3.1.5. Elia also grants an energy incentive in the form of investment aid following an energy audit. Energy saving measures that result in significant energy savings and that have a depreciation period of more than two years are eligible for this investment aid. A maximum of EUR 200,000 of investment aid can be granted per year, per final customer and per site.  7. Increased investment deduction Businesses can reduce their taxable profits through an increased investment deduction for investments in energy savings. Investments allowing energy savings to be made that are eligible for an increased investment deduction are, for example, insulation of roofs, external walls and floors, double-glazing, relighting and heat pumps. The applicable provision is set out in Article 69 of the Income Tax Code and can be combined with energy incentives granted by DSOs. For the tax year 2019, an investment deduction of 13.5% applies, regardless of the size of the business. Sole trader businesses and SMEs are eligible for a 20% deduction for investments made in 2018 and 2019. The increased investment deduction is ultimately granted by the Federal Government (Federal Public Service for Finance), but a certificate must be obtained to confirm eligibility. This certificate must be requested from the Flemish Energy Agency for investments in the Flemish Region.  8.  environmental incentive The environmental incentive is a measure intended to support the sustainability of businesses and is managed by the Flemish Agency for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (VLAIO). The aid covers between 15% and 55% of the additional cost of the investment, and only measures included in a defined list are eligible. This list is issued every year by ministerial decree. The following are examples of energy saving measures in the current list: connection to existing district heating systems, heat pump powered by residual heat, active and intelligent natural lighting system, etc.  231 9. Tax benefits In order to encourage major energy renovations and new energy efficient installations in non-residential buildings, a number of tax benefits are available. These tax benefits involve a reduction in property tax for a -level. For major energy renovations involving an application for planning permission between 1 October 2016 and 31 December 2019, the reduction is 50% for a maximum E-level of E90 and 100% for a maximum E-level of E60. For new buildings for which the planning permission application was submitted after 1 January 2016, the reduction is 50% for a maximum E-level of E30 and 100% for a maximum E-level of E20.  10. Mini-energy agreements (Mini-EPCs) To encourage SMEs to adopt energy saving measures, sectoral assistance programmes have been developed for the SME target group: mini-EPCs. As the SME target group is very diverse in terms of size, processes and energy saving measures, it was decided to implement energy saving programmes at sectoral level. As part of the mini-EPC procedure, the sectoral federation appoints an energy coach, funded by the Flemish Government, to help SMEs adopt energy saving measures. The energy coach is there to help SMEs to: - carry out an energy scan; - compare offers; - monitor the installation process; - request existing incentives and subsidies. The sectoral federation is responsible for promoting and disseminating the mini-EPC procedure. As far as possible, framework contracts for certain investments are also concluded with suppliers in relation to measures that are very common in the sector. With regard to the SME target group, pilot projects have been set up with the sectoral federations Fevia, Agoria, Horeca Vlaanderen, Boerenbond and Comeos. At the end of these pilot projects, the results will be assessed.  11. Terra As part of its task of promoting energy efficiency in public buildings (in the broad sense), the Flemish Agency for Energy Saving in the Public Sector (Vlaams EnergieBedrijf  VEB) . This database will allow entities to easily monitor their energy consumption without having to set up their own system. The fundamental aim of this database is to encourage institutions using the data platform to adopt energy saving measures. This will be achieved by producing reports for institutions that contain specific proposals for measures and by making the platform public so that other energy service-providers can also develop a range of services based on an analysis of the published data. Due to the importance of collecting data for the energy transition, the Flemish Government decided on 5 April 2019 to allocate a further EUR 1.575 million to the development of Terra. The aim of this investment is to continue the software development of Terra so that there can be fluid reporting on the energy and climate targets within the Flemish Government.  12. Climate commitments in the health sector On 12 January 2017 a declaration containing 13 climate commitments was made by the health sector. This declaration was written and signed by the umbrella organisations, the competent minister, the VEB and the VIPA (Flemish Infrastructure Fund for Personal Matters). To help meet these commitments, EUR 23 million were made available by the Climate Fund. A number of the commitments concern energy efficiency. 232 1. The aim is for annual energy savings of 2.09% (per healthcare establishment), with a total saving of 27% by 2030. 2. Resources have been made available to fund personalised energy performance diagnoses. These should result in an action plan setting out various possible investments and a feasibility study on ESCO contracts. 3. In return for these free services, institutions undertake to adopt measures with a depreciation period of less than five years. Otherwise, payment must be made for the energy performance diagnosis. 4. For measures with a longer depreciation period, a subsidy instrument has been developed using funds from the Climate Fund in order to financially encourage these investments. However, adopting such measures remains optional. 5. From 2018, all new buildings in the sector will be NZEB (defined as cost-optimal in the EPL methodology) and sustainable. 6. Monitoring and comparative analysis tools are being developed in cooperation with Vlaams EnergieBedrijf. The Flemish Government Decree of 30 March 2018 organises the implementation of the first four commitments. The Decree stipulates that energy performance diagnoses will be free if measures with a depreciation period of less than five years are adopted within three years. In order to meet the fourth commitment, two subsidy measures have been introduced: the subsidy for energy performance contracts and the subsidy for climate investments in long-term projects. The first subsidy is granted where a series of energy saving measures is adopted as part of an energy performance contract. The subsidy is 10% of the cost price of facilitating an EPC, with a maximum of EUR 8,000. Energy saving measures can therefore be adopted more quickly. The second subsidy aims to reduce the depreciation period of investments to five years. The subsidy is granted for energy saving measures that have a significant impact in terms of reducing CO2 emissions and is 60% of the estimated investment cost. Energy savings made through the declaration will be monitored via Terra. However, under the Energy Decree, usage data of system operators can be forwarded only to the Flemish Energy Agency (110). That is why there is an agreement with the VEB, under which the VEA can transfer usage data to the VEB. The latter will use these data to populate Terra. In addition, measures proposed following energy performance diagnoses will also be inputted into Terra. This database can also indicate the potential savings and depreciation periods for each measure, which will allow users to plan the appropriate time for implementing each measure. All the necessary data will also be collated within Terra in order to provide a reference measurement for the installations concerned, which will be used for further comparative analyses and for monitoring the energy saving targets. Every effort will be made to assist establishments, with emphasis on the following aspects: - management of the invitation to tender for energy scans and quality control; - prior examination of the energy performance contract after each energy scan and support in the process of drawing up a facilitation contract and in the subsequent development of the energy performance contract; - establishment of framework contracts and performance contracts with funding solutions (cooperatives); - cooperation with external partners (e.g. Fluvius) so that existing energy incentives and energy audits are seamlessly integrated; - centralised collection of data in Terra on: potential measures, measures adopted, consumption and savings; - administrative simplification;                                                            110 Article 12.2.2 of the Energy Decree. 233 - transparency of the offer through targeted communication with best practices. Under the standard VIPA subsidy, extensive renovations in the context treated like a new-build and are also now subsidised at 100% of the base amount of the investment subsidy, rather than 75% of that amount as in the case of renovations.  13. Climate commitments in education The Education Minister has announced 11 climate commitments in this policy area, with EUR 54 million having been provided by the Climate Fund for the period 2016-2019. In 2019, a further tranche of EUR 20.7 million was added. A number of the commitments concern energy efficiency. Out of the 11 commitments, 5 were approved and implemented by the Flemish Government in the first phase (31 March 2017). 1. A call for investments in energy savings (the list of possible measures was established in advance) was launched in 2016 for higher education. Institutions could therefore obtain a subsidy of 50% of the amount invested (limited to EUR 500,000 per project). The subsidies were awarded by a panel according to a ranking based on the CO2 saving per euro invested. In 2016 subsidies totalling around EUR 5.1 million were granted to projects. A further call for proposals was launched in 2017, this time without the EUR 500,000 ceiling per project. EUR 12 million were therefore invested in higher education in 2017. For the period 2016-2019, a total amount of EUR 20 million has been allocated to universities. Following the 2016 and 2017 calls, there is just under EUR 3 million remaining. 2. Subsidy for improving the settings of boilers (heating installations). Schools (all levels) and universities were invited to have their heating systems adjusted during the winter of 2017-2018, regardless of the legal requirements for the regular inspection and servicing of heating systems. A one-off subsidy was therefore paid to support the implementation of this project by a private company based on a predetermined checklist (which went beyond the legal requirements). The application had to be made before 31 October 2017 and  boilers in around 500 schools and universities were adjusted to their optimum settings. 3. Using additional resources from the Climate Fund, efforts were made to implement energy saving measures in compulsory education. 4. Climate projects at school level. A call for projects was launched in 2017 to identify opportunities for investment in energy efficiency and to develop a school renovation plan. To support the measure, a budget of up to EUR 100,000 per province was granted, with a maximum of two projects to be approved in each province. The total budget of this call for projects is EUR 500,000. All the projects are currently being implemented. 5. STEM-Climate call for projects for primary, secondary and adult education. In 2017 educational establishments were given the opportunity to develop an innovative project in which the topics of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and climate were linked. They were free to decide on the approach, but projects resulting in demonstrable direct or indirect CO2 savings were regarded as having added value. The maximum subsidy was EUR 5,000 per project and there was a total budget of EUR 375,000. In the end, 92 projects benefited from this subsidy. 6. Since September 2017, AGIOn (Agency for School Infrastructure) has been offering low-cost loans for the installation of solar panels. By 16 September 2019, the Agency had already approved 83 solar loan applications. The scope has also been extended, as these loans can now be granted for various investments in renewable energy and energy savings. In 2018 the Flemish Government focusand awareness- December 2017). 1. To ensure good energy management in schools, a partnership has been established between AGIOn and the VEB. Due to its expertise, the latter can offer advice and assistance to schools; it already has access to school 234 consumption data, which it can transfer free of charge to schools. AGIOn also receives this information from the VEB, which it uses to carry out awareness-raising actions among school authorities. The main aim of the partnership between the VEB and AGIOn is to raise the awareness of school authorities about the measures that they can take to achieve greater energy efficiency. This measure has resulted in five energy performance contracts being concluded under the control of the VEB. These projects are ongoing (see also point 6.3.7). 2. Building of climate-related knowledge and skills through the following measures.  rking group in order to ensure that correct information on the climate is available to all stakeholders and is used in teaching practice. The measure involves a text on the climate, produced in the environmental policy area, which clearly sets out the main aspects of the climate issue. The taskforce will also identify best practices and obstacles in the area of climate education. It brings together representatives of the main stakeholders in education.  The taskforce will also be responsible for the following specific tasks.  Providing tools to schools.  Designing a lifelong training course on the climate for teachers.  education. Certain subjects will be studied in this respect and the climate-related levers will be examined. 3. Promote the climate issue within Flemish higher education establishments.  examine how their function and start a process of improvement in consultation with researchers, teachers, students and managers. The knowledge needed for this purpose exists within the institutions themselves.  Conduct of practical research into climate-related educational issues. There seems to be a lack of clarity about how higher education can best respond to a number of specific climate-related issues. The aim is to show how teachers in various disciplines can make room for meaningful teaching on the climate.  14. Klimaatscholen 2050 Klimaatscholen 2050 (Climate Schools 2050) is a Catholic educational initiative in Flanders. Framework EnerGent, PajoPower, Stroomvloed and ZuidtrAnt) and five consulting firms (BAS Bouwen, Efika, Bureau 9000, Zero Emission Solutions and EnergieID). Klimaatscholen 2050 focuses on assisting schools with sustainability investments. The project revolves around energy savings and energy measurement, as well as renewable energy. In terms of energy savings, BAS Bouwen, Efika, Bureau 9000 and Zero Emission Solutions have developed a common approach to make the energy consumption of schools more sustainable. The focus is primarily on the correct measurement of consumption, efficient use of existing installations and development of an action plan for saving energy in the school. Energy is measured in collaboration with EnergieID. Klimaatscholen 2050 allows schools to monitor their energy consumption free of charge through the EnergieID service, with consumption data being monitored through an online platform. (PV installations).  235 15. Cultural sector In the cultural sector, the Flemish Government has approved a decree under which investments in cultural facilities are used as a priority for energy saving measures. For example, cultural associations can apply for subsidies for a whole range of energy saving measures: conduct of an energy audit, set-up of smart energy metering, general relighting, roof insulation, external wall insulation, floor insulation, replacement of a heating oil system with a gas-fired system, installation of a heat pump, installation of a solar water heater, etc. When subsidies are approved, the applicant undertakes to annually monitor its energy consumption for a period of 10 years. In 2018 the Flemish Government launched the energy loan for culture- and youth-related facilities. Cultural and youth associations working in the culture and youth policy areas at local, provincial or regional level are eligible for this low-cost energy loan.  16. Youth activities sector Raising awareness of the climate is a key issue for our young people and we want the places where they meet to set an example. The subsidies available in the cultural sector for energy saving measures are also available for youth-related facilities. We will improve the approach and study other options so that those responsible can get to work and take advantage of any available subsidies and loans. We are particularly determined to lower the threshold for assistance and to provide more intensive support for work undertaken spontaneously. We are progressing with the masterplan for bivouac sites, and we are continuing our efforts to give every child the chance to go on camp and to provide sufficient funds for homes, centres and accommodation for young people. The focus will be on sustainability in the broad sense, i.e. on heating and electricity requirements in buildings and on local renewable energy sources.  17. Sports facilities With regard to sports facilities, the focus will be on sustainability in accordance with the Decree of 5 May 2017 supporting supralocal sports facilities and high-level sports facilities. In its 14 centres, Sport Vlaanderen (Flemish Sports Agency) will continue cooperating with the VEB on energy efficiency and will endeavour to ensure that sports centres lead the way in their capacity as centres of excellence in numerous areas including the environment (energy efficiency, water recovery, waste policy, etc.).  18. Energy efficiency action plan for Flemish public buildings In order to comply with Article 5 of the Energy Efficiency Directive, at least 3% of the floor area of existing public buildings must be extensively renovated every year, or equivalent energy savings must be made using another approach. The Flemish Government has chosen to take an alternative approach. In 2016, in addition to this alternative approach, the Energy efficiency action plan was produced for the Flemish Government. The aim of the action plan is to reduce the CO2 emissions of government entities by 40% by 2030. A 27% reduction in primary energy consumption is also expected. This represents an annual energy saving of 2.09% for each entity. To achieve this goal, two key players have been identified. Firstly, there is Het Facilitair Bedrijf (HFB), which centrally manages all the property of the Flemish Government, with priority being given to the office buildings. HFB has proposed a long-term strategy in which the bar is set high for new buildings in terms of energy consumption in particular, major energy renovations are carried out and the most energy-intensive buildings are abandoned. Secondly, government entities can regularly participate in calls for energy efficiency projects launched by the VEB. These entities can also call on the usual assistance services provided by the VEB, such as potential scans, insulation, relighting and boiler renovation advice, etc. 236 For the largest energy users, an annual reduction in the energy budget of 2.09% is intended to further encourage them to consume less energy and to focus on energy efficiency measures. The largest energy users can also have SCO model). Agreements have been reached between HFB and the VEB regarding the division of tasks. SURE2050 is an initiative of the Flemish provinces, Factor4, Fluvius, HFB and the VEB, with the latter as project coordinator. This initiative is designed to help the Flemish central and local authorities formulate a strategic property plan, based on climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest. The participating authorities receive support with cost-effective investment projects. The initiative is also a knowledge development programme in the area of sustainable property management and policy. The expertise of its initiators is combined with that of participating municipalities and entities.  Additional policy The WAM scenario involves measures similar to those for housing, including planning permission, non-residential EPCs, incentives and tax measures, Flemish strategy and action plans for making the heating of our buildings more sustainable, etc., and semi-specific measures such as integrating the investment incentive for energy saving measures adopted by system operators in the , expanding the Terra information platform, etc. We are currently developing an energy performance certificate for large non-residential buildings (EPC-NR). The EPC for public buildings will be included in the EPC policy framework for non-residential buildings. In order to better understand the current energy performance of non-residential buildings, all large non-residential buildings (that have the option of heating or air-conditioning) must have an EPC-NR by 2050 at the latest. From 2030, these buildings will need to have a minimum energy performance label. Public buildings in the Flemish Region must set a good example by obtaining this label before 2028. We are therefore in the process of setting up specific collaboration with the VEB and HFB. From 2021, non-energy-efficient tertiary buildings must undergo a complete energy renovation within five years of a notarial transfer of full ownership. Further to the Woningpas launched at the end of 2018, we will develop a Gebouwenpas (Building passport), which will enable owners or users to save, access and exchange digital information on buildings, land and the environment, and also recommendations to improve energy performance. In developing the Gebouwenpas, we will ensure that the business information point and the Terra database for public authorities, schools and healthcare establishments are complementary. In addition, a data platform for non-residential buildings will be developed in order to provide an overview of energy data and technical and construction properties of buildings. It will therefore be possible to obtain a precise picture of the number of buildings in each sector, their floor area and their energy performance. This data platform will be made available to the public for comparative analysis purposes, while respecting confidentiality, so that building owners and managers can also compare the energy performance of their building with other (similar) buildings. The 1% energy loan for the current target groups, i.e. non-market legal persons and cooperatives, will be extended to 31 December 2020. Given that the government agreement stipulates that the conditions of energy loans will be relaxed, the extension (and possible adjustment) of the 1% loan beyond 2020 will form part of this exercise. From 2021, we will also impose a ban on heating oil boilers in non-residential buildings in the case of new-builds and major energy renovations. It will not be possible to replace existing heating oil boilers with other heating oil boilers if there is a possibility of connecting to the natural gas system in the street, except where it is proven that the heating oil boilers have an equivalent performance to the latest natural gas condensing boilers. Buildings situated in new large housing developments and apartment buildings can be connected to natural gas 237 only for district heating by cogeneration or in combination with a renewable energy system as the main heating system.  To help owners in their choice of sustainable heating, we will prepare a decision tree. It is important that the various public authorities set an example, which will ensure greater support among the other social players. Article 5 of the Energy Efficiency Directive requires public authorities to annually renovate 3% of the floor area of their air-conditioned or heated buildings, or to make similar energy savings through a combination of measures. We will ask the municipalities, cities, towns, local authority associations, public social welfare centres, provinces and autonomous municipal agencies to make additional efforts to achieve an average annual primary energy saving of 2.09% in their buildings (including technical infrastructure, but excluding housing stock) by 2020. We will initially discuss this approach with the Association of Flemish Cities, Towns and Municipalities (Vereniging van Vlaamse Steden en Gemeenten  VVSG). It is estimated that local authorities manage a total of 15,000 buildings. The technical infrastructure includes public lighting, bridges, etc. These efforts will particularly involve converting to LED around 1.2 million public lights managed by the local authorities. By 2030 at the latest, all public lighting on municipal roads will be LED. We will therefore conclude the necessary agreements between all those involved, with particular emphasis on reducing timescales and costs. Public lighting maintenance costs will no longer be passed on through the distribution system tariffs. that we truly set an example and make a primary energy saving of 2.5% every year. All public authorities can call on the services and expertise of the VEB as a central purchasing body for the supply of energy and energy services. The VEB must also develop energy performance contracts with funding solutions in accordance with the charter produced with the Flemish Building Confederation. In this way, it will be possible to connect public supply and demand with private supply. It is vital that public authorities make targeted investments in energy efficiency through masterplans. With regard to the Flemish Government, the HFB Building action plan and the Energy Efficiency action plan will be progressed and optimised. The Terra platform (the Flemish database on property and energy) will also be used for reporting and for the comparative analysis of energy consumption data in the public sector. The methods of calculating the energy performance of new-builds have frequently changed and become more complex in recent years. Numerous construction partners have therefore lost touch with the EPB regulations. In consultation with stakeholders, we will transform the current methods into one transparent and simplified method in which innovative construction techniques receive sufficient attention. The aim of the method will be to ensure that buildings can be objectively compared with each other and can be steered towards energy efficiency measures. In collaboration with stakeholders, we will also work to further improve the user-friendliness of the software tools. Simplifying the software and making it more user-friendly will remove a number of obstacles to major energy renovations, which will therefore increase in number.  Walloon Region Exemplary role of public buildings In order to achieve its 2030 and 2050 targets, Wallonia will reinforce and extend the exemplary role of its public buildings. An energy neutrality target will be set for all public buildings, with a timescale depending on the level of government concerned. The aim of this timescale will be to guarantee carbon neutrality by 2050 at the latest. This approach will apply to the following buildings: - the administrative buildings of the central governments (Walloon Region, French Community and German-Speaking Community); - the administrative buildings of the local governments (municipalities and provinces), and also schools. 238 Energy neutrality is defined as reducing requirements (heating, DHW, cooling and lighting) to the level of an equivalent new building (111), keeping other electricity consumption at the current level, and meeting those requirements through renewable energy, whether purchased or self-generated. The following tools are proposed for achieving this target.  Updating sound management manuals and procedures for public building infrastructure (lighting, heating control, electrical equipment, telephone and IT infrastructure, etc.).  Requiring an accurate register of public buildings (linked with the certification of public buildings) by using a methodology that ensures reliability and consistency of the data collected.  Producing a roadmap aimed at improving the energy performance of buildings.  Establishing a targeted renovation strategy based on the roadmap in order to reduce total energy consumption and therefore achieve energy neutrality, with a prioritised action plan.  When any work is carried out on a building, studying all the associated measures that could increase compatible with the planned work being implemented.  Requiring monitoring and reporting of the impact of the measures adopted.  Making it easier to use energy performance contracts.  Walloon long-term strategy for the energy renovation of buildings In order to significantly increase the rate of renovation (>3%/year), the Walloon long-term strategy for the energy renovation of buildings proposes a range of actions and measures, for both the residential and tertiary sectors, which are based on three priorities: - priority 1 aims to create a transparent framework favourable to energy efficient investments; - priority 2 aims to structure and reinforce the market supplying goods and services associated with renovation; - priority 3 aims to boost demand for energy efficient buildings. These three priorities are broken down into objectives, which are themselves broken down into actions and measures, over half of which are planned for the short term. Several of the actions and measures approved in other texts, particularly through the -e included in these short-term actions and measures. Specific implementing measures are described in the Walloon renovation strategy (https://energie.wallonie.be/servlet/Repository/strategie-wallonne-a-long-terme-pour-la-renovation-energetique-des-batiment.pdf?ID=47301), which is currently being updated. These measures will therefore also be updated and even reinforced. The Walloon Government will focus on setting a precise implementation timetable for the actions and will ensure that the measures are implemented. A mechanism for assessing the achievement of the targets will also be established. Existing measures The following table lists some of the existing measures included in the long-term renovation strategy (excluding financial incentives) (112). These measures must be continued between 2020 and 2030.                                                            111 According to the Cost-Optimal 2 study. 112 In particular, the table does not include the scheme involving renovation incentives for private individuals or the incentives for the tertiary sector, such as the UREBA (energy renovation of buildings) programme. 239 Type of measure Existing measures Description  Regulatory EPB requirements The EPB regulations adopted by the Walloon Government came into force on 1 May 2010. In terms of building renovation, the EPB requirements cover the performance level of renovated walls and state that the level achieved must be the same as that for the walls of new structures (113).  From 1 January 2017, the minimum overall performance level for buildings (Espec  115 kWh/m²/year) must be achieved by new housing and major renovations (defined as involving over 75% of the surface area of the building envelope and the replacement of systems). This level will be reduced to 85 kWh/m²/year (114) from 1 January 2021.  In terms of renovations, the requirements have been tightened for certain modified walls (windows, floors).  The calculation method also changed on 1 January 2017. The changes include, firstly, a new NEP (non-residential energy performance) method for calculating the performance of NEP units (non-residential units and multi-family buildings), and, secondly, amendments to the REP (residential energy performance) method for individual housing, structural nodes and transmission losses. System-related requirements Since 1 May 2016, requirements (efficiency, lagging, energy metering, etc.) have also applied to systems (heating and domestic hot water, air-conditioning, ventilation) that are installed, replaced or modernised. Although these requirements mainly apply to existing buildings, some of them (energy metering) also apply to new buildings. Coherence of the various regulations The Walloon Sustainable Housing Code has been revised stock and its energy performance. The Code now sets out criteria for hygiene and minimum energy performance based on airtightness ed into force on 1 June 2017, contains a number of provisions aimed at administrative streamlining. By allowing the general use of indicative values for urban planning permissions and schemes and by abolishing certain standards, urban planning requirements are now more flexible and energy concerns are more effectively integrated in the management of administrative authorisations. Information, awareness-raising Information for citizens Wallonia has developed a series of information and awareness-raising tools that are available on the energie.wallonie.be portal, including practical guides, advertising campaigns to promote energy audits, and energy information points (16 across Wallonia), which citizens can visit for free advice on issues relating to domestic energy use.                                                            113 For new buildings, the requirements cover the overall performance of the building. 114 Value of the NZEB (nearly zero energy building) standard in the Walloon Region. 240 Type of measure Existing measures Description  Information for professionals Exemplary practices in terms of sustainable construction and renovation are also showcased in training centres set up specifically for this sector, in particular the two Construform skills centres (Hainaut and Liège) and the Greenwal centre of excellence in the province of Namur. Since 2014, the Sustainable Construction portal has provided professionals, contractors, architects, consulting firms, manufacturers and traders with internet-based access to validated information on innovative and sustainable techniques, materials and products; it also links to the Energy portal. Voluntary agreements Exemplary buildings In order to disseminate best practices allowing the sector to gradually meet the energy performance requirements for buildings, between 2004 and 2011 the Walloon Region conducted Build with Energy), intended to promote the construction of new low-energy housing meeting higher standards than those imposed by the applicable regulations. This was followed by a campaign entitled Bâtiments Exemplaires WallonieExemplary Buildings in Wallonia), designed to promote the construction and renovation of exemplary sustainable buildings in both the residential and tertiary sectors. This measure has served as a real-life laboratory for sustainable construction and energy performance of buildings. Tools   Energy audits The energy audit has been in place since 2006, but was significantly expanded and adapted in 2014 (PAE 2 [Energy Audit Procedure]) and housing arepresents an opportunity not only to comprehensively assess the performance of existing housing, but also to determine the weaknesses of housing and identify the work to be prioritised in order to improve the comfort and health of occupants and reduce energy consumption.   It is currently an essential step in order to access housing incentives. The energy audit, as required under the current incentive and loan granting scheme, will be improved in order to simplify and speed up the renovation of buildings. It will remain compulsory, except for roof insulation and work costing less than EUR 3,000. 241 Additional measures Among the additional measures, three specific tools will be used as part of the renovation strategy. These tools reflect the wish, repeatedly expressed by the sector during consultations, for renovation projects to be comprehensively assessed in line with the long-term objectives of Wallonia in order to ensure that the renovation work is properly framed. These tools are indicated below.  The roadmap: forming part of the housing audit, the roadmap suggests the renovation route to be  label (primary consumption of 85 kWh/m²/year), while offering an estimate of the associated renovation costs.  The building passport: an interactive and evolving tool designed to accompany the building throughout its life. It will gather in one place all the information on the building that is held by various administrative entities (location, type of housing, permission) and technical entities (plans, stability studies, HVAC, soil testing, water, energy, etc.).  The one-stop shop: this will provide all the necessary support services for households in terms of energy/housing. It can steer households towards the type of energy renovation needed, help them to passport, assist households in identifying contractors who can carry out the work, and guide them in funding the work. The one-stop shop will use existing tools and network existing operators. Although it is currently planned for these tools to be used for residential buildings only, they may be extended in the future to the renovation of tertiary buildings. As regards financing, the incentive scheme will be maintained and improved, although it will be necessary to conduct an audit (except for roof insulation work and renovation work costing less than EUR 3,000) in order to benefit from the incentives. The following improvements in particular will be made: o reinforcement of the incentive scheme so that the least energy efficient housing is prioritised; o means-tested increase in the incentive amount for people in poverty; o prioritisation of work, particularly improvement of the building envelope. Other additional measures are currently being discussed and will form part of the new renovation strategy planned for March 2020, including:  identifying and implementing the most effective incentive measures in order to reduce the split incentive (115);  identifying and implementing measures designed to reduce energy poverty;  introducing a renovation incentive at key moments in the life of a building, for example: o From 2025, all rental housing with an energy performance level of F or G will be renovated (according to the roadmap) within a set period of time, although it can still be rented in the meantime in accordance with the terms to be determined at a later date. Those terms must be developed in accordance with the conditions of access to housing and in the interests of owners. o No earlier than 2025, incentive to renovate housing at the time of its purchase, according to the roadmap (payback time of less than 10 years).                                                            115 Certain obstacles arise where the interests of the various participants are not aligned (split incentive). This is often the case between owners and tenants: for the tenant, the payback period is often far longer than the period of occupation. This divergence of interests and of the information held by owners and tenants, together with the difference in time between the payback period and the period of occupation of the housing, form an important barrier to widespread renovation. This lack of alignment can also occur between different types of owner (e.g. bare owner and beneficiary; owner-occupier and owner-landlord in a jointly owned property, or, lastly, joint owners and building manager in a jointly owned property). 242  implementing measures to facilitate the division of housing;  enhancing the status of trades through the labelling/certification of professionals, without this increasing the cost of the work carried out;  clarifying the renovation strategy for public buildings (including housing);  further developing the funding strategy. The following table sets out all the existing and additional measures envisaged to 2050 as a result of the renovation strategy. They apply to both supply and demand. 243 Priorities Objectives Measures Strengthen the framework to ensure the necessary transparency, stability and credibility for energy efficiency investments Further develop the incentive system 1.

Implement a strategy aimed at mitigating the rebound effect  245 The action plan for these measures is available in the renovation strategy approved in 2017 (116). Description of the phasing at regional level The phasing of the renovation stages at regional level results in a change to the annual rate of renovation, broken down by measure and by segment of the housing stock. The following aspects determine the phasing:  the desire for energy renovation to go hand-in-hand with a significant reduction in energy poverty and an improvement in the quality of Walloon housing;  the need to stagger the public funding required to stimulate investment in renovation projects;  consumption reduction targets. The figure below maps out these changes, which are quantitatively presented in the tables below. The main aspects of the proposed phasing are as follows:  2020: Rise in the annual rate of renovation (dark orange) of roof insulation for all housing in order to achieve a cruising speed (blue). This rise should be facilitated by removing the obligation for a compulsory audit for this type of work.  2025: Prioritisation of efforts to renovate the rest of the building envelope: rise in the rate of renovation for buildings with G and F labels. 2030: Prioritisation of efforts to renovate the rest of the building envelope for other buildings. 2030: Efforts will be made to renovate systems and use renewable energy sources in buildings with a G label. 2035: Efforts will be made to renovate systems and use renewable energy sources in buildings with an F label and other buildings. 2040: The entire building envelope will be renovated for all buildings with a G label. 2045: The entire building envelope will be renovated for all buildings with an F label in 2045. Renovations will continue at the current rate (beige) where efforts are not made to increase the rate. This is the case for renovations at key moments in the life of a building (sale, rental, etc.). However, the current rate will rise due to renovations undertaken as part of one-off major renovations (117).

Cost of the strategy to the public authorities: this cost depends on a series of variable that the public authority can influence. It is not therefore a question of a fixed figure to be accepted or rejected. The funding effort is more a question of aligning available budgets than meeting net requirements. 2. Priority measure for buildings belonging to public authorities: consolidating demand so that energy performance contracts can be used (action under preparation). 3. Priority measure for private housing: the decision to renovate depends on many other criteria than just the availability of funds. The one-stop shop (see point 3.3.2) will take charge of all the necessary formalities and will provide solutions to all the technical, financial and administrative constraints facing the renovation applicant. 4. Priority measure for private tertiary buildings: the assumption is that the private sector will undertake the necessary work once it becomes more expensive to do nothing than to start renovating. The various options allowing action to be taken in this sector without creating a significant burden for the sector will be assessed. 5. Mobilisation of private savings: given that 75% of the building stock consists of private housing, with most owners likely to take out a mortgage or instalment loan to fund their work, it would seem that working to develop suitable financial products in collaboration with the retail banks is a priority. These funds could also be mobilised through specific ESCOs or energy performance contracts. 6. Mobilisation of European funds: there are many European programmes and projects. In terms of energy, we would underline the growing importance of the LIFE programme. 7. Mobilisation of regional funds: considerable budgets have been mobilised in recent years with energy efficiency as the theme. Measures will be adopted to achieve the most effective results through relatively limited public funds. The table below sets out the instruments listed in the renovation strategy approved in 2017. Those instruments will be re-examined as part of the update planned for March 2020, particularly taking account of the obstacles to renovation for certain target groups (landlords, joint owners, etc.) and in accordance with the European guidelines. 247 Type of instrument Measures Target group Actions Horizon Contractual Grant incentives and subsidies Residential Energy incentives; renovation incentives; MEBAR incentive (for low-income households); PIVERT (energy investment plan for the renovation of public housing) Existing  Link the system of incentives to the renovation roadmap; incentive mechanisms and pilot schemes will be introduced, particularly for the simultaneous renovation of entire districts or for the demolition/rebuilding of old housing that is difficult to efficiently insulate or for the renovation of key public buildings; analyse the possibility of granting demolition/building incentives. 2030 UREBA (energy renovation work in public buildings); school building funds; Infrasport (sports facilities); swimming pool plan; AMURE energy audits, SEU (sustainable energy use) grants; energy audits in the industrial sector (through branch agreements) Existing Tertiary Continue the UREBA+ ne (118); optimise the investment aid system; subsidies for audits through incentives 2020 consolidate demand and therefore obtain third-party investment and energy performance contracts Under preparation   Ecopack/Rénopack/Accesspack loans Existing, undergoing changes Encourage low-interest loans and offer loan guarantees Residential Pilot scheme involving a framework agreement between the Walloon Public Service and a bank for low-interest loans, combined with renovation subsidies Under study Extend the low-interest loan pilot scheme; offer loan guarantees for low-income households 2030                                                            118 Since 1 ported work intended to improve the building envelope or the installation or improvement of the ventilation system through a 75% subsidy (80% under certain conditions) of the eligible amounts. 248 Type of instrument Measures Target group Actions Horizon Introduce a zero-interest loan instrument, to complement the UREBA programme, for buildings in the public and non-market sectors 2020 Tertiary VAT rate of 6% on buildings occupied for at least 10 years  Existing Tax  Reduce VAT on energy renovations Residential Together with other national authorities, study the possibility of introducing a reduced VAT rate of 6% on renovations involving demolition/rebuilding where this seems more cost-effective than major renovation.

So far the main ambitions have involved new construction and energy management within buildings, although renovation has not been ignored. However, reducing the environmental impact of the Brussels building stock has not been the subject of a stand-alone strategy. In view of the objectives to be achieved, we must now apply the principle that, in the long term, there can no longer be any poor performing buildings in Brussels. It is irrelevant whether properties are owned or rented: put quite simply, occupying a real energy drain will no longer be tolerated. However, not all hope can be placed on the building envelope or systems: the behaviour within the building is decisive and energy sobriety is a must. In order to drastically reduce the environmental impact of buildings, three main angles of attack must therefore be fully pursued: - increasing the rate of renovation: the target of achieving a rate of 3% has been set; - improving the quality of renovations; and - making rational use of energy within buildings. The entire arsenal of public policies must be deployed: documentation, communication, regulation, support, incentives, financial assistance, innovation, etc. However, achieving these objectives will only be truly feasible if the following two elements exist: clear and firm requirements that can raise the performance of the entire building stock to a high level, and an unprecedented mobilisation of public and private finances.  Establish clear requirements with set deadlines Increase and realise ambitions The residential and tertiary sectors are currently subject to a number of obligations designed to improve their performance: issuing an EPB certificate at the time of a property transaction; requirements to be met in the event of work, and requirements concerning technical installations. Certain segments of the tertiary sector are also subject to other constraints: producing a local plan for energy management; carrying out an energy audit, and obligation to display the EPB certificate. An overview of these obligations and their scope can be found in the following table. Main energy obligations imposed on the residential and tertiary sectors Current obligations Residential sector Tertiary sector EPB Certificate Provide the EPB certificate if a housing unit or office space in excess of 500 m² is sold or rented  Public authorities: display the consumption) every year EPB work - renovations Major renovations treated as new-builds: limit the energy requirement for heating and the primary energy consumption, insulate walls, limit thermal bridges and the risk of overheating, install meters for technical installations  251 Renovation of part of the building envelope: insulate the walls in question and ventilate Technical installations Regular inspection and acceptance of new heating installations by approved professionals  Requirements concerning sizing, lagging, metering, partitioning, etc. and obligations to service and inspect air-conditioning installations Environmental permit audit  Energy-intensive consumers within the meaning of the environmental permit regulations: conduct an energy audit and implement the recommendations with a payback time of less than five years PLAGE  Owners or occupiers of large property complexes (100,000 m²): produce an action plan to reduce consumption by 10%  By 2050 all Brussels buildings must be energy efficient. Fiche No 1 on energy performance requirements and obligations for buildings sets out the regulatory framework for ensuring that the building stock meets this objective.  Binding targets for the residential sector  The general objective for the residential sector is ambitious, realistic and rational in terms of both cost and sustainability: an average of 100 kWh/m²/year by 2050, as recommended by the Interfederal Energy Pact (Pacte énergétique interfédéral) for the residential sector, seems to be a fair and -study of residential buildings, which assesses the economic impact of various energy objectives, also confirms the relevance of this objective (119).  There are sound arguments for not having a tougher objective: (1) the current state of buildings and the impossibility, for a significant part of the stock, of achieving the performance of a passive building; (2) the amount of investment needed to achieve this type of performance, balanced against the often underestimated impact of the behaviour within the building; (3) the material reality and environmental impact of this investment and any sophisticated technological solutions, which must also be balanced against the importance of changes in behaviour in terms of how buildings are occupied.  The introduction made it clear that the general objective can be achieved only if a minimum level of performance is required for all buildings. The residential sector will be driven towards the appropriate level of performance by imposing obligations at regular intervals to carry out energy-saving work in order to achieve the level required for the type of building concerned by 2050.  Five deadlines have been set, although, quite clearly, buildings that achieve their objective before the final deadline will be exempt from carrying out work by the interim deadlines. This system requires an EPB certificate to be issued for every building, whether or not it is the subject of a transaction. This system also requires certificates of impeccable quality; the work currently being carried out on the approval of certifiers aims to achieve this objective.  The EPB certificate will be tailored to show all the recommendations needed so that all potential energy savings within the building can be made. Furthermore, if, despite all the recommendations made in the EPB certificate,                                                            119 The key messages of the study are set out in the annex to the renovation strategy.  252 the objective set for the type of building cannot be achieved, the objective of implementing all the recommendations will be set for the building (see Fiche No 14 on the roadmap).  While initially focusing on energy, the EPB certificate will include sustainability criteria in the medium term, and its recommendations will also be adapted in line with the gradual phasing out of fossil fuels to heat buildings; this is an objective fully covered by Fiche No 10 on renewable heat.  Jointly owned buildings will be subject to a two-part obligation: one covering the building, for which the joint owners will be responsible, and the other covering the private parts, for which their individual owners will be responsible.  Rules to be met by category in the tertiary sector  The Interfederal Energy Pact has set the bar very high: by 2050 the tertiary sector must aim to achieve an energy-neutral building stock in terms of heating, production of domestic hot water, cooling and lighting.  However, from small shops situated on the ground floor of houses to office blocks, and from sports facilities to hospitals, the tertiary sector covers some very different situations and must therefore be approached using an appropriate sectoral breakdown.  Given the chosen segmentation, the following are therefore envisaged: imposing a system of obligations similar to the residential sector; extending the scope or reinforcing the objective of the local action plan for energy management imposed on large property complexes if they are considered relevant following evaluation of the measure; extending the payback time on investments required as a result of the energy audit recommendations imposed on energy-intensive consumers as part of their environmental permit.  Reducing the overall environmental impact of the building stock  the energy performance of buildings: they must form part of a framework allowing all the environmental impacts of the building sector to be reduced. The energy performance requirements must therefore be mirrored by sustainability requirements, with methods and deadlines to be determined as resources are developed. This is the subject of Fiche No 2.  Key role of public authorities in speeding up renovation work  As shown in Fiche No 3, public authorities can play an important role by setting an example: the Brussels Air, Climate and Energy Management Code requires them to drive the property market towards excellent environmental and energy performance, by meeting a minimum performance level in the property purchases and rentals of regional authorities or by taking account of the occupation cost in the choices made by local authorities during property transactions.  The case for all public authorities to be subject to energy performance and sustainability requirements by 2040 will be examined. Sustainability clauses may be proposed in this respect, which authorities can insert in their specifications for design or work contracts. Certain specific measures are already planned to support regional and local public authorities in this effort: the NRClick and SolarClick programmes, which are covered in more has lower energy consumption and uses local energy production where possible. Public housing, which will be covered by the system of obligations referred to above, will also be required to achieve excellent energy performance during major renovation work; the management contract of the SLRB (Brussels Capital Region Housing Association) will be revised along these lines. Whether in the residential sector or in the tertiary sector, the acceptability of such rules and requirements depends on the establishment of specific and reliable funding and support measures at all the decision-making stages of a renovation project, and on simplifying the applicable regulatory and administrative framework. This is the subject of the following chapters.  253 A transition accessible to vulnerable households  Fuel poverty affects all three regions of the country. In Brussels, measured fuel poverty was 13.4% in 2015.  Improving the energy and environmental performance of the building stock may arouse fears of significant rent increases. One of the key measures for guaranteeing access to decent housing for all is to control these potential increases. As explained in Fiche No 4, this risk and the ways of overcoming it will therefore be carefully examined.  A recent report by the Fondation Roi Baudouin analysed the social housing situation and concluded as follows with regard to the Brussels Region: 44% of social housing units must be regarded as high energy consumers (120). -performance level to every major renovation of social housing.  The housing stock managed by social housing agencies will in any event be driven towards a high performance level in line with the system of obligations introduced for the residential sector.  The acceptability of the performance requirements imposed by this strategy naturally depends on the establishment of funding and support measures that have, at their very core, the specific financial assistance that must be provided to vulnerable households.  Fund the transition of existing buildings to sustainability Huge investment will be required to achieve this transition. The state of the building stock, as mentioned above, and the cost of extensive work mean that tens of billions of euro will be needed to achieve a stock of sustainable buildings.  Many households quite simply do not have the funds needed to carry out such work and, more generally, a renovation strategy cannot have the effect of impoverishing the Brussels population. The financial assistance must therefore be in line with the ambitions pursued by this strategy.  Clearly, there are already financial assistance mechanisms designed to encourage energy-saving work to be carried out: the Prêt Vert Bruxellois (Brussels Green Loan) and energy incentives are prime examples of these. However, these mechanisms must be adapted to the new ambitions. As the Prêt Vert Bruxellois currently has a relatively low take-up rate, its attractiveness and accessibility will be reinforced: in the short term, this will involve opening up the mechanism to everyone and allowing the loan to be extended to investments ancillary to energy-saving work; in the medium term, other more significant adaptations are envisaged, such as extending the term of the loan and including incentives in the calculation of the amount to be repaid (Fiche No 8).  The energy incentive system will be revised in the light of the system of obligations that is being introduced. It will also be extended to support the production of heat and electricity through renewable sources. In the longer term, all the incentives for (local and regional) buildings will be examined to ensure that they are complementary and consistent, and that they correspond with the requirements imposed in terms of other aspects of sustainability (Fiche No  In the short term, work will continue to be funded in the main through an incentive mechanism, which should give way, at least in part, to other mechanisms in the longer term.  It would be unrealistic to imagine that the public budget alone could support this financial effort. All funding levers must therefore be used: mobilisation of community savings, attractive banking products, tax incentives, third-party investments, participatory funding, activation of European funds, etc. These levers are mentioned in Fiche No 5 on innovative funding mechanisms, Fiche No 6 on taxation and Fiche No 9 on European funding.                                                             120 Agnès Mathieu; Isis Consult (2017) Coûts et avantages sociétaux de la lutte contre la précarité énergétique au sein du parc de logements sociaux (étude réalisée à la demande de la Plateforme de lutte contre la précarité énergétique).  254 Mobilisation of community savings: a vital resource in funding renovation  This idea has already been highlighted by the Regional Air, Climate and Energy Plan, as a considerable amount of money is sitting in bank accounts earning little interest. According to the latest available data, this resource stands at EUR 260 billion in Belgium.  These savings can be used in a variety of ways for renovation projects: issue of green bonds, coupled with public intervention to limit the risks; establishment of community cooperatives with regional participation and participatory funding, where necessary. All these options will be explored in the near future.  Taxation: a very powerful lever  As a highly effective incentive for encouraging virtuous decisions, the option of tax deductions must be analysed without delay. This can take a number of very different forms.  As highlighted by the Air, Climate and Energy Plan, adjusting property taxation is an interesting idea. The Finance Ministry Circular of 22 February 2010 quite rightly suspended the increase in cadastral income following energy-saving work.  further step could be to release part of the sum used to pay property tax for carrying out renovation work. Likewise, reducing registration taxes in the event of energy renovations would no doubt form a valuable incentive.  In addition to property taxation, other options could be fruitfully explored, such as reducing inheritance tax provided that energy renovations are begun.  Establishment of funding mechanisms based on energy performance  In association with a community cooperative and in order to support public authorities or, more generally, help any entity starting a renovation project, third-party investments or energy performance contracts may prove interesting. Such mechanisms have not so far revealed their full potential. The conditions assisting their roll-out must be examined without delay, such as the clustering of projects or the establishment of contacts able to provide appropriate legal, accounting and tax advice. The objective pursued through such facilitation measures is to drive the market towards taking responsibility for work with a longer return on investment.  Involvement of the banking sector in urban renovation  The banking sector must become a fully-fledged partner in urban renovation. It is in a position to offer vital solutions to the funding needs of households, in particular through low-interest loans, which would usefully complement the Prêt Vert Bruxellois. Use of regional or European funds Currently underutilised in the Brussels sustainable renovation sector, European programmes offer numerous funding opportunities to support projects to decarbonise the building stock. It is time to use the necessary resources in terms of skills and time to fully exploit these significant honey pots. Support before, during and after the renovation process Support is the key to a successful transition to sustainable buildings.  Individuals and developers, designers and contractors, joint owners and municipalities, everyone has a part to play, and everyone must be able to receive personalised assistance, at all stages of a renovation process, for each of its aspects: technical, administrative and financial.  Developed by the Region over a number of years  as shown by the following table  this multidimensional support will be considerably reinforced at all levels.  255   What support? For whom? HOMEGRADE  This is a support structure for individuals, which provides information on acoustics, energy, housing and renovation. One of its key objectives is to encourage Brussels households to reduce their energy consumption, in terms of both their homes and their behaviour, through the following actions:   a permanent offer of information and advice to individuals on rational use of energy, bio-construction (environmentally friendly materials, green roofs, etc.), renewable energy, regulations and work to improve energy and environmental performance;   technical, administrative and financial support for households, which particularly covers the following aspects:  - behaviour and management of installations (heating, domestic hot water, standby consumption, ventilation, etc.);  - through a simplified diagnosis (quick scan), identification of renovation work that is easy to carry out (roof, windows, heating, ventilation);  - small jobs (installation of thermostatic valves, insulation of pipes, etc.) that can be carried out and checked, where necessary, with information on their impact on consumption;  - production of a technical and economic report assessing the cost-effectiveness of the work envisaged, as well as help with accessing funding through the various credit and financial advice mechanisms, in particular the Prêt Vert Bruxellois for which the non-profit association is the front office;  - help with defining specifications and finding a contractor;  - information on gas and electricity bills.  Individuals  RÉSEAU HABITAT (HOUSING NETWORK)  This is a network of nine Brussels associations subsidised by the Region, which are active in urban renovation and support aimed at engaging inhabitants in the work to revitalise their districts. The aim of this network is to encourage renovation through actions such as the following:   distribution of information on the various rules applicable to housing in the Brussels Capital Region (Brussels Housing Code (Code Bruxellois du Logement), RRU (Regional Planning Regulations), EPB, etc.) and on municipal and regional aid (incentives, green loan, taxation) and the estimation of their amounts;   technical and administrative advice, and raising awareness of the rational use of energy;   diagnosis of priority work;   analysis of quotations and technical documents;   training of target audiences in renovation techniques.  These services are provided through hotlines, home visits, community events and other awareness-raising events. Individuals  ANIMATIONS ÉNERGIE (ENERGY INFORMATION EVENTS)  These are information events that raise awareness about energy-saving actions not requiring any major investment or loss of comfort, with particular focus on those who are vulnerable.  Individuals  NRCLICK/ SOLARCLICK  These two regional support programmes (technical and financial support) involve reducing energy consumption within buildings (NRClick) and producing energy from photovoltaic panels (SolarClick).  Regional and local public authorities  256 LOCAL EPB AGENTS  These are agents appointed to ensure compliance with the EPB procedure in simple renovation work carried out under a subsidy granted by the Region.  Municipalities  FACILITATORS  These are free advice services provided by experts in energy and bio-construction, recognised for their expertise gained in numerous projects both in Brussels and abroad. These Facilitators have the task of helping developers and building managers with the management of energy consumption, rational use of energy and promotion of renewable energy, at any stage of a project. To ensure full coverage of the issues of energy and bio-construction, in both renovation and new construction, the unique service of the Facilitateur Bâtiment Durable (121) (Sustainable Building Facilitator) has been set up.  Developers, designers, building managers  EPB HELPDESKS  These offer technical support to those involved in EPB (certifiers, heating professionals and EPB advisers).  EPB professionals  PACK ÉNERGIE (ENERGY PACK)  This is coaching designed to support the use of specific energy measures when developing or renovating buildings in the business and non-market sectors. It is currently being provided by the BRUXEO, UCM, Santhea and Comeos organisations to their target audiences.  SMEs, businesses, non-market organisations  LABEL ENTREPRISE ÉCODYNAMIQUE (ECODYNAMIC ENTERPRISE LABEL)  This is free official recognition granted by the Region to public and private organisations that implement environmental management. Private, public and voluntary sectors  FORMATIONS « BÂTIMENT » et « ÉNERGIE » (TRAINING)   This firstly involves statutory training that teaches professionals in the construction sector who are active on the Brussels market about the statutory requirements. This training is a mandatory prerequisite for the granting of approval to carry out certain trades (tertiary sector certifier, approved boiler engineers, energy auditors involved with the environmental permit, etc.) (122).  Secondly, this involves voluntary training in the concepts and techniques of high performing buildings, for which the energy and environmental requirements go beyond what is required by the regulations. For most professionals, this voluntary training can be accessed without any specialist knowledge in the subject concerned, so that as wide a range of professionals as possible can be reached.  In addition to the training, seminars are organised to provide information on the subjects of sustainable building and to allow the networking of professionals.  Developers and designers    GUIDE BÂTIMENT DURABLE (SUSTAINABLE BUILDING GUIDE)  This is a dynamic technical reference framework (123) on sustainable building, which is intended to support the design and construction of buildings with high energy efficiency and environmental performance, while also taking account of the quality of life of occupants and economic feasibility.  Developers and designers  PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR  These are partnerships developed with certain stakeholders in the construction sector in order to encourage the move towards circular economy and sustainable building practices (CCBC, Cluster Écobuild, CDR-Construction, EFP, CSTC, etc.) in various areas such as innovation, training, business support, etc.  Designers, contractors, jobseekers                                                              121 www.bruxellesenvironnement.be/Facilitateur  122 www.bruxellesenvironnement.be/formations  123 www.bruxellesenvironnement.be/guide_batiment_durable  257 Segmentations and tools to be re-examined  Individuals, professionals: these generic terms cover a variety of situations.  From an apartment in a large jointly owned building to a detached house, and from the family wanting to grow to older people, there is a very wide range of situations. From the developer to the designer, and from the building manager to the contractor, needs vary considerably.  The needs of individuals and professionals are currently segmented. However, these target audiences and their needs should be analysed in more detail so that the decision-making processes involved in a major renovation project can be more accurately identified. Fiche No 12 covers this measure as it concerns studying the approaches and behaviour of Brussels individuals and professionals in order to further encourage renovation. Individuals, guided at every stage  A single contact  Which work for which performance? In which order should this work be tackled? Which financial aid for which work? Which administrative procedures are necessary for a major renovation? How can the quality of work be ensured?  There are so many questions when deciding to embark on a renovation project. Everyone must be able to find answers in the support offer, which is covered by Fiche No 13.  The renovation process needs to be as simple as possible, with a single contact to meet the many needs. As with other models that have already been developed around Europe, providing constantly evolving support will involve setting up a one-stop shop covering all aspects of the process. This one-stop shop must be easily accessible: one per municipality seems to be the best solution.  It will be divided into two main sections: a completely free information service offering information on financial aid, current regulations and technical aspects, and a paid support service offering assistance at any stage, from diagnosis to service will be specifically created to raise awareness of the one-stop shop and its services.  The technical aspects of a renovation are particularly difficult to grasp. If personalised support is not provided, to below will provide the necessary information and clarification.  A roadmap to achieve the performance target  This tool does not lack ambition as it aims to provide information on the extent of the work needed to achieve the target and increased property value at the end of the work, ensure the energy consistency of the renovation process while meeting the needs expressed by the owner, and avoid unhelpful blockages in the event of a phased renovation. Fiche No 14 describes this tool in detail.  The roadmap will consist of a personalised renovation plan supplementing the EPB certificate. It will be required for any renovation needing planning permission, and will be recommended by the one-stop shop in other cases. architect provided by the one-stop shop. Whether a total renovation or a sequential approach is involved, the plan will be based on a full diagnosis of the building in energy, urban and, more broadly, environmental terms ds and wishes.  Information provided at the right time  The measures established to incentivise and support renovation are not yet sufficiently well-known among the general public, and the energy performance of a property remains a characteristic that is often overlooked: notaries, architects and estate agents have a role to play in distributing useful information on the various incentives and support available and in raising public awareness of this subject. This strategy will also use these stakeholders, as explained in Fiche No 15.  258 Community initiatives: a collective approach to sustainability issues  With examples such as local currencies, collective composting, car sharing and grouped housing, community initiatives for a more sustainable society are on the increase. They have huge potential to reduce the environmental footprint of the Brussels building stock, and are the subject of a specific fiche (Fiche No 16): community events designed to raise awareness of the rational use of a building, grouped purchasing of sustainable materials and renovation work carried out at district level must be promoted and supported through financial aid and specific support from the one-stop shop referred to above. Particular attention will be paid to self-supply in multi-family buildings.  Rational use of buildings: a subject in itself  As an absolutely vital aspect that is complementary to renovation, the behaviour within a building must be treated as an entirely separate issue. To a large extent, it determines whether regional objectives in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be achieved.  The result displayed by the energy performance certificate is theoretical and based on standardised behaviour. A significant disparity therefore sometimes exists between this theoretical performance and the actual consumption within the building: a rebound effect and poor adoption of technologies need to be combated, which is the subject of Fiche No 17.  In broad terms, the general public needs to be made more aware of their energy consumption within a building. As has happened with water, when they receive their energy bill, households will be shown a comparison between their consumption and the average consumption in the residential sector. Eventually, energy bills will be issued more frequently; they will be sent monthly, allowing Brussels residents to graphically monitor the development of their consumption.  Improving the performance of the Brussels building stock also raises the question of the adoption of technologies within buildings. Poor use of these technologies sometimes results in higher consumption than necessary within an energy efficient building. It can also have a harmful impact on health (as in the case of a ventilation system not being maintained). Support for users of high performing buildings will therefore be reinforced through two measures: the financial assistance of associations that provide this support in public housing, and the establishment of a platform for exchanges between the various stakeholders, coordinated by Bruxelles Environnement.  Self-renovation: a reality that must not be neglected  In order to cut costs and retain full control of the work, some households take on the renovation of their housing themselves. What is the extent of this phenomenon? What training should be given to the professional supporting such households in this approach? How can quality work be guaranteed in such a situation? Fiche No 18 proposes to study these issues in more depth.  Indoor air quality: a health issue that must be highlighted more clearly  The general public is still not fully aware that indoor air is much more polluted than outdoor air. Construction products and materials (such as insulation) and inadequate ventilation are principally to blame. We spend the vast majority of our time in enclosed spaces, so this is a major problem. Increased awareness, availability of information and diagnosis tools, and regulation of product use in enclosed public spaces are some of the solutions set out in Fiche No 19.  Extensive and simplified support for various professional audiences  The support must cover all the various profiles and needs of professional audiences.  Some sectors already have specific support measures in place: construction professionals receive assistance from the CSTC (Scientific and Technical Construction Centre) and the CCBC (Brussels Capital Construction Confederation); professionals approved under the regulations on the energy performance of buildings have access to a dedicated technical support service. Property managers and small and medium-sized enterprises also have access to specific support.  259 Other professionals can use the services of the Facilitateur Bâtiment Durable, which offers specific support and a range of useful information on the sustainable renovation of buildings.  A one-stop shop for professionals  The aim of the measure, which is described in Fiche No 20, is simple: to make the Facilitateur Bâtiment Durable service into a one-stop shop meeting the various needs of professionals. The services offered by the Facilitateur will therefore be extended to also include quick scans, assistance with drafting applications, assistance with setting up a renovation project, and so on.   such as solar mapping and EPB certificates, this service will be permitted to contact professionals in order to encourage them to undertake the renovation of their property.  Small and medium-sized enterprises and the non-market sector must not be neglected  Energy bills are a source of concern for many self-employed workers, associations, and small and medium-sized enterprises. As a result, the Region is already assisting this sector through a specific support measure: free and personalised coaching known as the Pack Énergie (Energy Pack). Access is also available to the general support schemes for developers: the general sustainability advice service (Facilitateur Bâtiment Durable) and the environmental management label (Label Entreprise Écodynamique).  Assessing, integrating and extending measures: this is the objective of Fiche No 21 on support for businesses, SMEs and shops.  The Pack Énergie will be assessed and adapted so that it becomes a genuine lever for renovation, through sers rather than energy advisers, and so that it is consistent with the Facilitateur Bâtiment Durable service. The advisers appointed following Pack Énergie calls for projects will be integrated within the Facilitateur service so that each adviser uses the same tools and services.  The Label Entreprise Écodynamique will be extended to the energy renovation of buildings.  Jointly owned buildings: a challenge to be tackled without delay  With multiple occupiers in one building and a majority of accommodation occupied by tenants, jointly owned buildings epitomise the main obstacles to a renovation scheme. The complexity of the decision-making process and the short-term mandate of property managers also discourage the undertaking of major renovations. Jointly owned buildings merit special attention, which is why they have their own fiche (Fiche No 22).  Jointly owned buildings will benefit from a dedicated support service: the Facilitateur Copropriété (Jointly Owned Building Facilitator) will guide joint owners through the various administrative, financial and technical procedures. Specific tools will be developed, based around a unique web interface.  Municipalities will need support in their transition measures  In terms of reducing the environmental footprint, much is expected of local authorities. Due to their closeness to the population, they represent a very important level for action. Many of them are already part of the Agenda 21 approach. However, municipalities have few tools to meet these expectations: introducing energy accounting in their area and an action plan aimed at reducing energy consumption, particularly in the building sector, requires specific resources and skills.  Without doubt, SolarClick and NRClick, which are covered by Fiche No 3 on the exemplary role of public authorities, are already excellent regional initiatives allowing municipalities to benefit from the energy produced by photovoltaic panels and energy-saving work. In this respect, special attention must be paid to school buildings, which in some cases are in a worrying condition: the assessment of the NRClick programme will form an opportunity to review the support for local schools in terms of improving their buildings, in collaboration with the proposed Facilitateur École (School Facilitator) service.  Work must also be carried out on empowering municipalities in this area: establishing a network of local officials working in the area of energy and the environment, managed by Bruxelles Environnement, will allow them to 260 exchange advice and best practice, and jointly develop solutions to common problems. Fiche No 23 on support for municipalities details this measure.  Learning about sustainability for every stakeholder in a renovation process  Technologies and requirements are constantly developing towards more sustainability; the very concept of buildings is in flux. As they move from fixed to modular in the near future, they must include the sustainability constraint in each of their components. Designers and contractors will no longer have the same work as before.  Continuing training must include technological developments in sustainable construction, which should also be an integral part of curricula for all construction trades. Collaboration with the French Community and the Flemish Community will be established in this respect (Fiche No 23).  Specific communication on the various measures taken by the Region  Meeting the requirements imposed by the Region in terms of the performance of Brussels buildings and using the various tools and support offered by the Region to its citizens to meet those requirements will not be possible without a communication campaign setting out the context, recalling the objectives and establishing the link between the various measures of the strategy: this is the subject of Fiche No 25.  Simplify the lives of clients A single record for residential buildings  Within Bruxelles Environnement alone, a large amount of data and information on residential buildings is collected: EPB certificates, certificates of inspection or acceptance of heating installations and energy incentives, and, beyond the issue of energy, soil certificates and environmental permits. There is also the data and information collected by other authorities, such as cadastral data and planning permissions. In the long term, these will be supplemented by the roadmap, data on materials and, potentimodularity.  This is vital information, albeit limited at the moment. Centralising such data via a single platform will significantly facilitate the renovation process, and, beyond that, contacts and procedures with the authorities concerned. This single platform is the housing passport ) (Fiche No 26). It will initially contain the data collected by Bruxelles Environnement, but, as this initial prototype is developed, the desirability and feasibility of its extension to data held by other authorities will be examined.  Urban legislation in line with the regional ambition for renovation  The Region has already put sustainability at the heart of its urban legislation: the Brussels Planning Code (Code bruxelloi) refers to the sustainable development of the Region, the economical use of its resources and the improvement of the energy performance of its buildings.  Authorising or prohibiting certain work is not, however, in line with the regional desire to promote sustainable renovation. Ensuring that the rules applicable to the outside insulation of the front façade are flexible is, for jective. Removing certain work from the list of work subject to planning permission is an issue that must also be raised and assessed. As already recommended by the Air, Climate and Energy Plan, an interinstitutional working group will soon be set up to propose revisions to the urban regulations (Fiche No 27).  Long-awaited simplification of procedures  The multiple procedures and financial incentives and the administrative complexity of each mechanism are undoubtedly a major obstacle to renovation.  As alrcomplementary nature of the various financial incentives for renovation and the development of simplified interfaces will be examined (see in particular Fiche No  261 Incentives for the renovation of buildings in the Brussels Capital Region Incentives Objective Type of work Authority concerned Renovation  Improve the health, safety and basic comfort of housing Stability  Roof  Humidity  Dry rot  Ventilation  Electricity  Gas  Insulation  Cladding  Heating  Stairs  Rainwater  etc.  Bruxelles Urbanisme et Patrimoine  Energy  Improve the performance of the building and its equipment  Study/Audit  Insulation/Ventilation  Heat  Bruxelles Environnement  Façades  Improve the street façade  Rendering, cleaning, etc.  Bruxelles Urbanisme et Patrimoine  Heritage property  Restore unprotected heritage property  Various  Bruxelles Urbanisme et Patrimoine  Municipal  Encourage work within the municipal area  Various (e.g. rainwater tank)  Municipality   As mentioned in relation to the housing passport, centralising information is one of the keys to administrative simplification. A platform will be set up, which will have all the documents required for a planning permission procedure. A single interface will inform citizens about all the procedures and formalities to be carried out in a renovation process and about the financial aid that they can access for this purpose.  Document, assess and innovate Place regional action on a solid footing that is constantly assessed  Whenever a large-scale transformation process begins, there are many uncertainties and grey areas. The proposed strategy is based on our current knowledge, and we therefore need to examine and further study many issues and parameters: the actual state of Brussels buildings and the precise consumption of certain sub-segments; the development of technologies and their adoption by the various stakeholders; collective awareness of the need for society to consume fewer resources, and the needs of professionals and individuals in this transition.  Whether it is a question of implementing alternative funding mechanisms, promoting collective action through cooperatives or including other aspects of sustainability in the regulatory framework, it is these studies that will enable us to gauge the usefulness of certain solutions. The fiches therefore highlight the need to closely examine the various parameters that may influence the proposed models in the medium or long term.  By assessing the measures implemented through this strategy, we will be able to refine or alter the approaches as necessary. Indicators must therefore be carefully defined in relation to the resources, work, results, efficiency, effectiveness or impact of the measures. One of the fiches therefore concerns the need to document the Brussels building stock and the impact of the regional action on this stock (Fiche No 28).  Innovation to give an overview of sustainability  The process will be necessarily iterative, and innovative initiatives will ensure better performance with fewer impacts and increased comfort at a lower cost.  262 As indicated in Fiche No 29, an innovation laboratory (RenoLab) will be set up as a link between all stakeholders in the construction sector in order to share and encourage innovative practices. Over and above energy performance, innovation involves taking an overview of all the sustainability aspects of a building in order to consider its environmental impact. In this respect, the regional action is completely novel as it has, for some time already, been studying the reduction of this impact from all angles through the Guide Bâtiment Durable (Sustainable Building Guide): energy, site and building management, mobility, materials, human and physical environment, water, comfort (acoustic in particular), well-being and health are all themes covered by the Guide. This must be continually updated with new practices and techniques (Fiche No 32).  Two specific issues have also seen particularly innovative developments: reducing the impact of construction materials, and the modular design of buildings.  Analysing the environmental impact of materials throughout their life cycle is the aim of TOTEM (Tool to Optimise the Total Environmental impact of Materials), which is covered by Fiche No 30.  With regard to the circular economy objectives in the area of construction, BAMB is a project that is aiming to radically change our view of buildings, by including the diNo 31 explains the next steps in this project.  Following a period of experimentation and encouragement, it will be considered whether making TOTEM and the sustainable building reference framework compulsory in major renovation work will be useful.  From demolition to dismantling and reuse  According to the CSTC, statistics for Belgium reveal that around 5% of the building stock is in such a state that an acceptable level of performance cannot be achieved following renovation (124).  Given its impact, demolition must, however, remain an absolute exception. In the light of the regional circular economy objectives, demolition should be permitted only if it is intended as a source of materials, and not waste. The question of demolition, which is assessed by Fiche No 33 and which is closely linked to the circular economy, must therefore be dealt with in a way that maximises reuse of equipment and materials: any dismantling will therefore be subject to an inventory of reusable items and prior evidence of its need.  However, demolition also and in particular raises the question of the certification of materials for reuse: the feasibility of a compulsory certificate for each item that is potentially reusable must therefore be quickly studied. Reusing construction materials could drastically reduce construction waste (Fiche No 34).  Commit everyone to a more sustainable city The objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80%, or the factor 4 as it is sometimes known, requires an unprecedented mobilisation of all stakeholders. The measures in this strategy therefore involve everyone: public authorities and organisations, citizens, businesses, associations, federations, research centres, schools, etc.  The following graph clearly shows the need for such a mobilisation.                                                             124 https://www.cstc.be/homepage/index.cfm?cat=publications&sub=bbri-contact&pag=Contact49&art=731  263 Path to achieving the 80% reduction objective by 2050    Objectifs  Objectives Gouvernance Governance Accord du gouvernement Government agreement  The objective has been set and the priority sectors are known: the building sector is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in Brussels. In addition to this effort, and without exporting our pollution elsewhere, the nmental footprint needs to be considerably reduced. A building stock that consumes much less energy and produces more energy locally is one of the key steps to a resilient, more sustainable and also more desirable urban structure: improving the energy and environmental performance of buildings guarantees a genuine improvement in comfort within those buildings.  The Region must now determine the approaches that it intends to favour in order to encourage and support this transition so that it is fair and accepted, and achieves its objectives. That is why this strategy has been produced: use all possible sources of funding and set sufficient mandatory targets to ensure the credibility of its ambition; support, train and assist all stakeholders, simplify procedures for them and allow them to exchange best practices; provide information on all measures; constantly assess and innovate.  It is through all these measures that the transition to a sustainable building stock will be achieved and will genuinely ensure a better quality of life for everyone.  Action fiches The renovation strategy guidelines set out in the above sections are supplemented by 34 action fiches that are not included in this document for the sake of balance.   There is other scope for action in terms of buildings aside from this ambitious strategy to reduce the environmental impact of existing Brussels buildings. 264 Accordingly, for new buildings in the tertiary sector (excluding administrative and teaching areas within those buildings), an increase in the EPB requirement will be envisaged. The current PLAGE tool will also be assessed in relation to the commitments made in this document. The Brussels Government will also specifically commit to the public authorities setting an example in terms of building renovation. Furthermore, there are significant differences in surface area by use in the tertiary sector (see table below). Depending on the activity, a larger or smaller surface area may sometimes be justified. However, our view is that, in some subsectors, convergence could be envisaged so that optimum use is made of the limited Brussels space. Subsector (tertiary) Surface area by use in m²/use Retail 46.5 Transport and Communication 8.5 Banking 37.8 Education 152.5 Health 77.3 Administration 39.1 Other Sectors 92.5 Energy, waste, water 6.3  In the residential sector, the Citydev strategy for the development of new housing will incorporate the regional environmental and climate objectives by developing passive and zero-energy housing. The programme will provide for the development of 1,000 passive housing units every five years, of which 30% will be zero-energy. Lastly, one particular type of energy-intensive building could be specifically targeted: data centres. It would be useful for the CIRB (Brussels Regional IT Centre) to analyse regional data centres, firstly with a view to making them more sustainable and energy efficient, based on a prior audit, and secondly, where a new site is needed, in terms of incorporating the elements guaranteeing sustainability and reduced energy consumption from the design phase of the project. In this context, the Brussels Government undertakes as follows. - Taking account of the long-term objectives of the Energy Pact for public buildings, each purchase and large-scale renovation of regional or regionally funded public buildings must incorporate these objectives from 2019. The collaboration between the various authorities responsible for managing public buildings will be formalised and reinforced in order to achieve the set objectives. - The EPB requirement level for new non-residential buildings (sports centres, cultural centres, hospitals, residential homes, crèches, etc., excluding administrative and teaching areas within those buildings) will be assessed and raised from 2021. - In 2021 a proposal will be made to adapt the rules on the maximum surface area by use in the tertiary sector, following a dialogue with trade union and employer organisations. Within this dialogue, the Brussels Government will aim for at least a 10% reduction in administrative areas by 2030. - The PLAGE programme will be assessed and, if necessary, adjusted in agreement with the tertiary sector in order to steer its building stock towards the long-term objectives of energy neutrality. - Within five years, the Brussels Government will complete the construction of the 6,400 housing units indicated by the Regional Housing Plan and the Housing Alliance, which, depending on their current state of progress, could benefit from fast-track planning procedures in order to shorten their timescales for completion. - The Brussels Government will ensure that all existing social housing is returned to rental condition, in particular by removing obstacles and shortening timescales. 265 - The Brussels Government will produce an additional four-year plan aimed at reducing the energy consumption and costs charged to social housing tenants. - New working practices will be promoted in order to reduce the surface area by use in the tertiary sector (e.g. remote working, new office facilities close to stations, or actions targeted at sectors with the highest surface area by use, such as banking/insurance). - Through Citydev, 1,000 passive housing units will be developed every five years, of which 30% will be zero-energy. - The energy consumption of sites housing regional data centres will be reduced by introducing, in 2020, an energy audit for all relevant sites. The rules applicable to future data centres established in the Region will be examined, particularly in relation to the environmental permit. - An energy incentive will be created for the installation of sunshades. - Cooperation will be established with the federal level. - Taking into account the division of responsibilities and in addition to its own efforts, the Brussels Capital Region also wants to develop cooperation with the federal level within the framework of the Energy Pact. In this context, the Brussels Government will call on the federal level to: - reduce VAT on energy renovation work and environmentally friendly insulation; - invest more in the renovation of federal public buildings situated in the Brussels Capital Region (under Article 5 of the Energy Efficiency Directive); - instigate a comprehensive discussion of tax measures to speed up and improve the energy quality of renovations in the context of a socially just vision.  iii. Description of policy and measures to promote energy services in the public sector and measures to remove regulatory and non-regulatory barriers that impede the uptake of energy performance contracting and other energy efficiency service models The market for energy service companies (ESCOs) and energy performance contracting (EPC) is still relatively undeveloped in Belgium, despite a few positive individual experiences. Nevertheless, this energy efficiency financing model offers some potential for development. The Belgian public authorities are mindful of this and are in the process of establishing the structure needed to support this development in consultation with stakeholders (both suppliers and potential customers), which involves the following:  analysis of barriers to the development of the concept and searching for solutions;  communication campaigns to promote ESCOs and the benefits of energy performance contracting;  renewed contact with financial institutions to de-risk the financing of the sector;  preparation of specifications and model contracts, measurement and monitoring tools, and training/qualifications to ensure quality of service.  Federal State  The options for supporting the energy renovation of buildings through third-party financing formulas will be reviewed in depth by 2021.  Discussions will be launched within the Special Advisory Committee on Energy Consumption in order to define a legal framework enabling third-party investment firms to lend to individuals and businesses and provide them with the financial guarantees needed to carry out energy efficiency improvement work.  266 Flemish Region Energy services for local authorities As many local authorities are looking for support to implement energy saving or energy generation measures across their estates, Fluvius has been providing a service to facilitate this process since 2010. The service is an extension of the mandatory support required under Article 6.4.1.1/7 of the Energy Decree of 19 November 2010, which states that distribution system operators must assist a local authority with the planning and implementation of its energy policy if the authority requests them to do so. This supplementary service is not a regulated activity and thus has no impact on distribution system tariffs. Energy services in buildings may include, but are not limited to, the building envelope, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, lighting, heating and lighting maintenance, renewable energy and work associated with such measures (such as demolition and maintenance). Similar services are also available for public lighting and the application of the sustainable fleet principle. The VEB also offers energy services to local authorities. Energy services for public buildings On 7 July 2006, the decree on the retrofitting of school infrastructure was enacted. The decree defines the key elements of the investment programme for (new) school infrastructure through alternative sources of funding. In 2009, the private investment company Scholen van Morgen nv, which specialises in DBFM (Design, Build, Finance and Maintain), was chosen to accelerate the investment of funds totalling around EUR 1 billion. The programme consists of the design, construction, funding and maintenance (over a period of 30 years) of 182 school construction projects (new-builds and renovations). In February 2012, the Flemish Government set up the independent private agency Vlaams Energiebedrijf (VEB). on behalf of the public sector, making it more sustainable and efficient. It firstly does this by purchasing energy centrally and more cost-effectively, and, secondly, by pooling and utilising energy data. Lastly, it also advises public services on how to use energy more efficiently. With regard to this final aspect of its activities, the VEB has developed a comprehensive service that encourages public bodies to introduce energy-related measures in a structured and accessible way. Ideally, the approach should be based on an in-depth analysis of the portfolio (data analysis and on-site surveys are used to identify which buildings consume the most energy and which can potentially be renovated, following which a comparative analysis is carried out). A dynamic energy investment plan is then drawn up on the basis of energy the VEB works with stakeholders via a two-pronged approach: (i) by guiding them through the process of energy performance contracting, where a third party commits to a guaranteed energy saving for the public entity on the basis of energy-related measures, and (ii) by can refer to quickly and confidently when deciding on their energy-related measures. Energy services for businesses In 2017 Participatiemaatschappij Vlaanderen (PMV) set up a EUR 20 million fund for a period of five years. Energy Efficiency Fit invests in improving the energy efficiency of SMEs through public-private partnerships the energy efficiency of SMEs, although broad-based projects combining energy efficiency with local renewable energy generation (wind, solar, green heat) and energy management (flexibility, demand-side response) are also considered under the scheme. In practical terms, the Energy Efficiency Fund invests in projects, ESCOs or ESCO funds where, for every euro that the Energy Efficiency Fund invests in a project, private funds invest at least one euro in the same category or in a lower category. The projects, ESCOs or ESCO funds are managed by private managers. PMV thus unlocks the venture capital available for this type of investment. If the Energy Efficiency Fund discovers that some markets or niches are not being targeted, it has the option of setting up a new project company (ESCO or ESCO fund) to cover this target group. In the end, the ultimate goal is to make maximum use of energy efficiency opportunities in order to achieve the energy and climate targets.  267 Walloon Region The regulation of energy service companies (ESCOs) (which currently work with public services) will be reinforced and their area of action will be expanded. ESCOs provide skills, human resources and certain guarantees (energy performance contracts and even third-party investors) allowing the investments needed to reduce energy consumption to be made. The target audience is:  public buildings (current situation), including public housing;  businesses in terms of their buildings and industrial activities;  jointly owned properties. Individuals in the residential sector may be assisted at a later date. An ESCO agency develops the necessary tools (model contracts, performance monitoring, technical management, pooling of buildings) and institutionalises practices to improve efficiency. The aim is to manage and reduce the energy consumption of consumers. In the case of a tertiary or multi-family building, the relationship between the owner (the person likely to make the investment and therefore to bear the cost) and the tenant (the person likely to benefit from a more energy efficient building) is key. Steps should be taken to ensure a fair distribution of the costs and benefits. The manager of a portfolio of buildings will make every effort to:  apply the principle of the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO): the manager bears the costs associated with energy consumption (and therefore has an interest in reducing that consumption) and provides a full service;  mobilise resources and ensure that the benefits are fully controlled by the manager. The ESCO system reduces the risk for service-providers (portfolio of buildings) and releases customers from the energy-related administration so that they can focus on their core business. This measure also reinforces the exemplary role of public buildings. Particular attention must, however, be paid to the feasibility of including the thermal insulation of building envelopes in the ESCO system. This system is more difficult to apply to work where the return on the investment is longer, as in the case of thermal insulation. The analysis carried out has identified over 30 actions, grouped into 8 key tasks, for developing ESCOs in the Walloon Region. It has also highlighted a priority shared with the renovation strategy, namely the development of the legal and regulatory framework for ESCOs and EPCs (energy performance contracts). Several measures have been prioritised for this purpose: 268 ID Description Main stakeholders to be involved 1. Regional agency - Set up a regional facilitation agency as a single point of contact for all operators. - Its task: pool skills and information and support stakeholders so that the private and non-market sectors can adopt professional processes and implement them effectively. - In line with the renovation strategy, digitalisation and performance monitoring of organisations benefiting from energy services must be stepped up. - Walloon Public Service - Existing facilitation agencies (e.g. Rénowatt) - ESCO federations - Technical experts 2. 2. Technical tool box - Develop simplified EPC forms and frameworks tailored to SMEs in the tertiary sector. - Establish a technical framework and a performance measurement and verification standard that is both simple and tailored to SMEs in the tertiary sector (e.g. based on the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP)). - Set up a technical certification centre providing access to specialists (qualified staff) and hospitals. The techniques covered can be gradually added to the register so that the focus is always on proven results. - After 2020, develop an ESCO accreditation framework (once the market has been established). - Set up a technical certification centre (potentially involving extremely simplified monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV)), for example based on registers of techniques with proven performance and results validated by the technical centre (see above). The catalogues of Standard Qualifying Actions  serve as the basis. - Legal experts - Existing ESCO facilitators, ESCO federations 3. Dissemination - Launch an information campaign on energy services and the regional energy strategy. - Promote and publicise incentives for energy efficiency investments tailored to the tertiary sector and the available ESCO solutions. Publish model EPCs and a list of ESCOs that are recognised (or accredited in the medium term) via the facilitation agencies. - Publicise success stories/Develop an educational portal on EPCs for energy managers and legal professionals. - Communication team of the Walloon Public Service 269 ID Description Main stakeholders to be involved - Include energy efficiency funding and ESCO models in energy audit findings and renovation roadmaps. - Promote facilitation agencies among equipment suppliers, energy service-providers and energy/building managers. 4. Training - Establish a training programme for the banking sector, including the promotion of the European -Risking Energy Efficiency Platform (DEEP). - Set up a training course on performance monitoring and verification techniques/Develop interdisciplinary higher education training focused on ESCOs and EPCs. - Universities, higher education institutions 5. Reduce the risks associated with funding mechanisms  Study various mechanisms providing access to funding and reducing funding risks through banks, such as the following. - For the tertiary sector, use the Energy Transition Fund for revolving-type financing to allow access to capital for small ESCOs (or final beneficiaries in the bank guarantee model). The fund must be fed by various sources (public, municipal, community, green bonds, revenue from CO2 allowances, suppliers obligations under Article 7, etc.) and will be topped up through energy savings or loan interest rates. The fund will in particular offer subordinated debt at attractive rates. The total fund will be between EUR 250 million and EUR 300 million. - Establish other mechanisms to reduce the financial risk (and interest rate) for SMEs, e.g. additional public guarantee, subsidised interest rates (or tax relief), co-investment by sources other than the fund, etc. - Secure energy efficiency revenue streams: if the price of energy for the tertiary sector or public buildings is not increased through fiscal measures, financial support may be needed to supplement energy savings and guarantee a return for ESCOs, as well as to make the scheme sufficiently attractive for final beneficiaries. This should be consistent with measures taken under Article 7. - At regulatory level, develop green bonds at regional or municipal level, in line with the European framework, to raise new dedicated sources of funding. Banking world Public funds Community cooperatives Walloon Public Service, Energy fund 270 ID Description Main stakeholders to be involved 6. Pilot projects - Support EPC pilot projects for (1) selected tertiary sector businesses; (2) a panel of five or six local authorities and (3) a pool of Wallonia Public Service buildings. - Monitor and publicise the results. - Walloon Public Service - Current public facilitators (e.g. Rénowatt) 7. Public energy governance Review management procedures and regulations restricting the adoption of EPCs by public organisations (especially hospitals and schools), including the adaptation of management agreements and the inclusion of energy performance concepts (EPC, MRV, future energy savings, etc.) in multi-annual investment plans. Review existing maintenance agreements to allow the future adaptation or integration of EPCs (or energy efficiency improvements in general). Public authorities 8. 8. Monitoring of the measure - Monitor the effects of the actions implemented. - Reassess their relevance every year and make any modifications needed. - Conduct the necessary studies to refine them (e.g. for financial de-risking measures and legal support actions, development of MRV standards, etc.). - Walloon Public Service-DGO4 - Technical experts   271 iv. Other planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030 as well as other objectives referred to in point 2.2 (for example measures to promote the exemplary role of public buildings and energy-efficient public procurement, measures to promote energy audits and energy management systems, consumer information and training measures, and other measures to promote energy efficiency) Federal State FEDERAL BUILDING STOCK In terms of the renovation and construction of federal buildings: Objective: Bring the energy performance of federal public buildings into line with the neutrality objective by 2040, with 50% of federal buildings having to achieve this objective by 2030, taking into account the existing building stock and the technical, legal, HR, accessibility and public service continuity constraints faced by public buildings. - Régie des Bâtiments (Government Buildings Agency); - SNCB and Infrabel; - Defence authorities (La Défense).  Régie des Bâtiments Given the wide range of buildings concerned, action plans will be drawn up for each type of building with a view to achieving the energy neutrality objective (different standards will be envisaged for protected/listed buildings). The current obstacles (market supply, current standards, leasing or partnership constraints, budget, service continuity, etc.) that may prevent the objective being achieved in the set timescale will be studied and addressed, together with the opportunities (co-benefits, in terms of adaptation to climate change, that will result from improving the thermal management of buildings during heatwaves, for example). The concept of neutrality in terms of energy and climate will be precisely defined. Improving the building stock also involves rationalising its use by reducing the portfolio (closure of premises) and replacing buildings with high energy performance buildings, excluding renovation (e.g. new prisons). Once again, there will be co-benefits in terms of adaptation to climate change.  SNCB/Infrabel Reduction of the non-traction energy consumption. Between 2005 and 2017, the SNCB reduced its non-traction energy consumption by 17.5%. This effort will continue in the coming years. Between 2016 and 2022, the SNCB aims to achieve an additional reduction of 7% through the following actions:  - renewal and modernisation of lighting systems for platforms, stations, offices and other service buildings;  - continuation of the renewal of heating systems in buildings;  - entry into service of new workshops to replace old and less energy efficient workshops;  - renovation of existing buildings (insulation, frame, etc.); etc.  272 Estimated impact of the measure on absolute non-traction energy consumption and on CO2 emissions for the SNCB Reduction of non-traction energy  period 2016-2022 (SNCB) Evaluation of new PaMs Energy consumption CO2 emissions 2016 2022 reduction 2016 2022 reduction GWh GWh GWh % kton kton kton % Reduction of non-traction energy 264.0 245.5 -18.5 -7% 52.4 48.2 -4.2 -8%  heating oil 27.0 17.6 -9.4 -35% 8.2 5.3 -2.8 -35%  natural gas 125.0 123.8 -1.2 -1% 28.7 28.4 -0.3 -1%  electricity 112.0 104.2 -7.8 -7% 15.6 14.5 -1.1 -7%  For the period beyond 2023, a vision will be established to continue these efforts to 2040 or 2050. An action plan to 2030 is already envisaged, which will form the first step towards neutrality.  The building renovation rate must be speeded up in order to achieve neutrality by 2040. The number of square metres concerned must be precisely determined (see the register action below). Wherever feasible, the potential for adding appropriate renewable energy sources (PV, district heating systems, etc.) will also be taken into account.  Defence authorities In the management of their infrastructure, the defence authorities comply with the EPB and EE legislation. In particular, and within their budget constraints, their aim is to apply the NZEB (Nearly Zero-Energy Building) standard to any new or treated-as-new buildings and to major renovations from 1 January 2019, and to improve the energy efficiency of their existing buildings through -small-scale work/investment to reduce its heating oil and gas consumption. Vision of the defence authorities with regard to the energy consumption of buildings: 1. First, the defence authorities want to reduce their energy consumption by:  replacing old technical systems with more efficient and innovative techniques;  switching from heating oil to gas where feasible;  correctly setting their technical systems and adapting them to efficient consumption;  installing LED lighting;  insulating pipework, walls and roofs;  raising the awareness of staff. 2. Second, carrying out a number of large infrastructure projects will significantly reduce the energy consumption of the districts concerned, by replacing old buildings with modern and energy efficient buildings, which will also have positive effects in terms of adaptation to climate change (improved thermal management). 3. Last, the defence authorities want to invest in renewable energy where possible. Once again, a vision and an overall plan for the entire building stock will allow all the necessary work to be scheduled for different stages (2030, 2040), with the required resources being calculated. The objective of exceeding the NZEB standard through positive-energy buildings may be set for the long term.  273 For all public services, public interest bodies and social security institutions - The respective public procurement will aim to utilise the circular economy, particularly in terms of construction materials, and to optimise the co-benefits in terms of adaptation to climate change (thermal management). - An energy register of federal public buildings (Régie des Bâtiments, SNCB, defence authorities) will be produced by 2021. This will help to achieve the neutrality objective by 2040, as indicated in the national energy pact. - A tool that must not be forgotten will be the establishment of energy passports for buildings (see BECI), as indicated in the interfederal energy pact.  Budget A strategy for funding the large-scale energy renovation of public buildings will be established by 2021, taking into account the various existing options (CFDD recommendation on the National Pact for Strategic Investments and on the NECP/CION No 7). The use of innovative financial instruments such as public-private partnerships, energy performance contracts and green bonds will be envisaged for the work of these three main bodies. The National Pact for Strategic Investments indicates that most of the public investment will be focused on the major renovation of public buildings. According to the Pact, this will involve investment of EUR 17 billion by 2030 (linear projection), of which EUR 1.65 billion will be for federal public buildings (i.e. EUR 150 million per year).

Defence authorities The objective must be achieved through energy performance contracts (EPCs). It is currently estimated that, in total, the buildings eligible for an EPC account for 75% of the energy consumption of buildings. The objectives that could be achieved by 2030 (compared with 2018) are as follows: 1. Gas and heating oil: -15% = -28 GWh ~ savings of EUR 1.2 million/year 2. Electricity: -30% = -24.7 GWh ~ savings of EUR 3 million/year The estimated cost of the investments needed for the EPC approach, based on an extrapolated feasibility study, is EUR 60.5 million, of which EUR 55 million is the investment and EUR 5.5 million is the EPC return on investment = 14.4 years.  The reductions in energy consumption targeted through a number of large infrastructure projects, such as the construction of new headquarters for the Ministry of Defence, a new medical centre to replace the current military hospital and new infrastructures for the Melsbroek, Kleine-Brogel and Florennes airbases, could reduce electricity consumption by 40% and gas and heating oil consumption by 60% (baseline year of 2018) at the Evère, Neder-Over-Heembeek, Melsbroek, Kleine-Brogel and Florennes sites. As regards water, a 50% reduction is expected by incorporating rainwater recovery, among other approaches. The objectives that could be achieved are as follows: 1. Gas and heating oil: -60% = -46.5 GWh ~ savings of EUR 1.8 million/year 2. Electricity: -40% = -16.6 GWh ~ savings of EUR 2 million/year  Investments must also be made in renewable energy. At the moment, an initial project has been launched in Saffraanberg: 500 kWp at a cost of EUR 500,000. Generation is estimated at 475 MWh per year, with self-consumption of 85%-90%. The estimated CO2 reduction over 21 years (to 2040) is 2,654,415 kg. Below is an overview of the energy consumption of the defence authorities for the year 2017/2018:  2017 2018 2040 Electricity kWh 110,215,093 109,573,437 (-0.58%) 68.3 GWh Gas kWh 128,128,456 127,610,447 (-0.40%) 66.8 GWh Water m3 689,064 691,839 (+0.40%) 415 million litres Heating oil litre 11,722,083 12,249,145 (+4.5%) 0  Overall, the measures planned to reduce energy consumption should reduce electricity consumption to 68.3 GWh and heating consumption to 66.8 GWh by 2040. To make buildings energy neutral, EUR 142 million will need to be invested in renewable energy, which corresponds to installing 142,000 kWc or 752,432 m² of solar panels (at the current output of 310 Wp/1.64 m²).  Flemish Region INDUSTRY Current policy The table below shows the breakdown of energy consumption in industry by the various target groups. 277 Total energy consumption (in final GWh) EII businesses Non-EII businesses With EPC  Without EPC With EPC  Without EPC EPC participation 97.9% 2.1% 39.0% 61.0% Refineries EC > 5 PJ 27,361    EPC target group EC > 5 PJ 63,333 0.5 PJ < EC < 5 PJ 18.918 2,322 10,000 6,246 Voluntary signature of EPC 0.1 PJ < EC < 0.5 PJ Non-energy intensive EC < 0.1 PJ    9,370 Total 111,934 25,616 (EC = energy consumption; EII = energy-intensive industry)  The current energy policy for industry mainly focuses on intensive energy consumers -intensive  0.1 PJ (= 27.78 GWh). The Energy Decree and the Regulation on environmental permits require such businesses to meet obligations in terms of producing energy studies and plans. Since 2015, the Energy Efficiency Directive has required large businesses to carry out an energy audit. However, the main thrust of Flemish policy on energy-intensive industries consists of voluntary agreements. Sites within the target industrial group of energy-intensive industries can voluntarily sign such agreements with the Flemish Government, under which they commit to going further than the current legislation and receiving certain compensation in return. Flanders has a long tradition with this instrument: Benchmarking Covenant (2002-2014); Audit Covenant (2004-2014), and the current energy policy agreements (EPAs) (2015-2022). This method has proved successful and resulted in a sustainable improvement in energy efficiency in such businesses over the years. For non-energy-intensive industries, the Flemish Government has also developed a range of instruments, with the emphasis being on information, awareness-raising and encouragement of investments in energy efficiency. For example, mini-EPCs have been developed and businesses can resort to a wide range of economic support instruments (e.g. environmental incentive, portfolio of SMEs, increase in the tax relief (125) for investments in energy savings, etc.).  Additional policy As a sector, industry will be supported in the transition to a climate-neutral society. Through additional policies, a coherent framework for industry will be developed, which, in addition to energy efficiency, will cover the broader industrial transition to low-carbon processes, the integration of renewable energy and the efficient use of materials. Industrial processes must be completely overhauled (e.g. by moving towards electrification, use of green gas, green hydrogen and synthetic fuels, residual heat, circular processes, etc.). The existing range of energy efficiency support instruments will be extended to ensure a broader industrial transition within a larger group of businesses. The current instruments cannot yet reach all businesses through the same measure. There are still many opportunities for extending their scope and lowering the barriers to entry.                                                             125 Applications are processed by the VEA, which issues a certificate for this purpose. 278 Regulatory framework for industry Within the group of energy-intensive businesses (annual energy consumption > 0.1 PJ), voluntary agreements policy agreements For non-energy-intensive businesses (annual energy consumption < 0.1 PJ), the emphasis is on disseminating new solutions within the Flemish industrial fabric. These may involve incentives to obtain energy advice or support for specific consulting projects. An action plan for more energy efficient SMEs and tighter legislation will meet the European obligation to develop specific actions aimed at the energy use of SMEs. The starting point is to gather knowledge on energy consumption and identify useful measures. Sectoral characteristics will be taken into account. To overcome the current obstacles and barriers facing this target group, the policy instruments needed to better reach and support the various target groups will be developed. The optimum division between small businesses and very small businesses will be determined based on an analysis that will ensure the best possible approach for businesses and government. In addition, a pilot project will be developed with the industrial sectors to detect the obstacles and the opportunities if the voluntary agreement were extended to small businesses. Small businesses (in terms of energy consumption) will carry out an energy audit in order to precisely target the measures suited to the needs of the business. Establishing a link between this audit and the energy consumption will clarify the policy framework for businesses. It will also be possible to monitor the audit obligation through the existing web application for the energy audits of large businesses. Establishments falling within this category must update their energy audit if their business is extended or modified. The current legislation on energy audits does not impose any obligation to apply cost-effective measures. To encourage such businesses to also invest in energy efficiency, it is proposed that cost-effective measures are applied. The public authorities and these businesses must develop an attractive framework similar to the energy policy agreements, under which such businesses can voluntarily commit to go beyond the applicable regulations. Very small businesses (in terms of energy consumption) will produce at least an overall energy balance. A list -implemented as part of a voluntary agreement, while maintaining the current benefits for businesses signing an EPC. In developing this policy framework, the conditions to be met by the overall energy balance must be determined in consultation with the relevant stakeholders. It is important that the administrative burden remains limited. To prevent a disproportionate administrative burden being caused by the above policy instruments, the VEKA may introduce, in collaboration with Fluvius, automatic reporting of energy data for small and very small businesses. This database will be accessible through the electronic information point for entrepreneurs, among other routes. It will allow businesses to monitor their own electricity and natural gas consumption and to compare their energy consumption with the reference values using the NACE code.

Energy policy agreements will be used as a key policy instrument for supporting the industrial transition. The way in which energy policy agreements will be continued beyond 2023 will be examined. This will involve assessing the current target groups, the cost-effectiveness of measures and the attractiveness to businesses of participating in this scheme. Consultations will be organised with the sectors concerned on reinforcing and expanding the EPA instrument. Currently there are some parts of industry that cannot participate in this scheme. In this context, the European regulations and the wider industrial transition in Flanders should be taken into account. In addition to energy efficiency, the latter may also involve the climate impact and the efficient use of materials and water, without compromising the competitiveness of businesses. The WAM scenario takes account of the expansion of energy themes (126) ensuring a sustainable improvement in energy efficiency for EII businesses (0.865% per year) and non-EII businesses (1.22% per year). In order to rationalise the regulations between the different sizes of businesses, the threshold for an approved energy plan will be reduced to 0.1 PJ, in accordance with the government agreement. This will also allow additional energy savings to be made, over and above the energy savings made under the EPAs. To calculate this energy saving, the calculation model will take account of an annual improvement in energy efficiency of 0.50% e described measures in 2030 and their contribution to Article non-  Extension of mini-EPAs to other sectors It is assumed that the public authorities and the businesses concerned will be able to develop an attractive framework so that businesses can voluntarily commit to go beyond the applicable regulations. It is also assumed that, given the growing experience in various sectors, the number of businesses newly involved could rise rapidly each year to reach a total of around 1,000 businesses by 2030. This scheme can be combined with maintaining the SME portfolio for subsidised energy advice, with subsidies of 20% to 30%. It could also be examined whether the energy coaching project can be used to provide support.  Continued support for industry through economic support instruments: , strategic environmental aid and SME portfolio The and strategic environmental aid remain key instruments for supporting a wide-ranging industrial transition in Flanders, i.e. to improve energy efficiency and make the most efficient environmental investments. The current instruments are in the process of being assessed with a view to their continuation. Energy advice could also be subsidised through the SME portfolio.  Development of the ESCO market for businesses, with particular emphasis on SMEs The knowledge acquired  implemented between 2014 and 2017 to identify bottlenecks, could be used for this purpose.                                                            126 The energy savings resulting from using residual heat can therefore, for example, be included in the energy efficiency savings of the business supplying this residual heat. 280 Through the ESCO (2018) initiative, PMV could invest EUR 20 million over the next five years in ESCOs that will take on the energy efficiency investments of other businesses (that cannot make these investments). Particular emphasis will be placed on investments in SMEs. The initiative will be assessed in due course to decide whether it will continue.  Development of a service provision accessible to everyone (sensitisation, awareness-raising, information, advice, networking) by the VLAIO and its partners in order to reach the widest possible audience and ensure their active participation with the aim of achieving the energy and climate policy objectives For many businesses, it is important to share their knowledge of existing technologies and know-how. It is also important for them to obtain information, improve their awareness and, if necessary, receive advice and guidance on how they can tackle energy and climate issues. The VLAIO possesses valuable tools for involving these businesses. For example, a wide-ranging initiative has already been implemented in universities, which enables businesses to familiarise themselves with existing technologies. Service contracts provide resources to a number of structural partners so that they can provide easily accessible information, advice and guidance, in addition to the traditional guidance on starting up and growing businesses. The VLAIO will also make maximum use of its available channels to reach civil society. The agency will use its existing channels and partnerships to reach the greatest possible number of businesses in relation to energy and climate. The aim in this respect is not only to transfer know-how and provide information on technological options, but also to provide information, advice and guidance on how to incorporate that know-how and those options in the business model.  Communication of a range of transparent information Through the electronic information point for entrepreneurs, we will work to provide centralised information that is tailored to entrepreneurs by connecting them to existing information channels. In particular, information on best practices in the sector, local contact points, learning networks and support options will be combined in this process. We will also encourage sectoral federations to exchange information on best practices with a view to the energy transition of business.  Request for the Federal Government to increase the investment tax relief for energy saving measures from 13.5% to a level similar to that in the Netherlands, i.e. 45% In the Netherlands, 14,234 applications for tax relief on energy investments were made in 2015, which was clearly higher than the 1,139 in Flanders. The applications in the Netherlands equated to a total investment of EUR 1,368 million, compared with EUR 332 million in Flanders. In terms of use, there is therefore a significant difference between Flanders and the Netherlands. This measure will considerably reduce the payback times on investments.  Overview of the savings made through the described measures in 2030 The table below gives an overview of the measures that can be quantified in the WEM and WAM scenarios. The energy savings for each of the aforementioned measures are those achieved in 2030. 281 GWh, f WEM WAM EPA, DEN 10,143 10,506 EPA, no DEN 1,085 1,114 Non-EPA, DEN 0 101 Non-EPA, no DEN 0 224 Mini-EPA 0 775 Environmental incentive 205 99  To determine the contribution of the measures to Article 7 of the EED, the energy savings made through the measures over the period 2021-2030 must be cumulated. In the WEM scenario, the EPA and environmental incentive measures, cumulated over the period 2021-2030, respectively account for 47,819 + 868 = 48,687 GWh of final energy savings. In the WAM scenario, the EPA, non-EPA (regulatory framework), mini-EPA and measures, cumulated over the period 2021-2030, respectively account for 49,110 + 1,750 + 3,308 + 377 = 54,544 GWh of final energy savings.  TRANSPORT See point 3.1.1.1.  AGRICULTURE Current policy The Flemish energy policy measures and the technological developments based on the principles of the Trias Energetica strategy also have an impact on the agricultural sector. Renewable energy use will increase by 2030 as a result of utilising solid and liquid biomass, fermentation, PV, solar water heaters, heat pumps, biofuels in agricultural machinery and other methods. Despite efforts to rationalise energy consumption and use low-carbon fuels in glasshouse horticulture, the consumption of oil products (particularly heating oil) has not reduced, and has even slightly increased over the last five years. However, the relative importance of heating oil is expected to decrease due to energy savings and the switch to natural gas, biomass, heat pumps and recovery of residual heat, among other options. Natural gas consumption has risen significantly in recent years due to the combined production of heat and electricity on agricultural holdings. This trend will not continue because the glasshouse horticulture sector has largely transitioned from gas and heating oil boilers to cogeneration. Investments in energy saving techniques (insulation, heat recovery, frequency regulation of pumps and fans, LED lighting, pre-cooling, etc.), green heat and renewable energy (solar water heaters, heat pumps, local and sustainable use of biomass, tractors, etc.) are currently being supported by the VLIF (Flemish Agricultural Investment Fund). Over the period 2013-2017, aid for energy investments rose to an average of EUR 7 million per year (i.e. approximately 560 investment projects per year).  Additional policy Further efforts will be made to facilitate the dissemination of knowledge and technologies so that energy measures are introduced in the sector. For example, this may involve: business energy analyses that specifically cover the Trias Energetica principles; the Enerpedia guidance project and the Kratos business advice system, which offers simple energy analyses; and measures involving new energy technologies and more in-depth energy advice for agricultural and horticultural businesses. Centre of Expertise for Agriculture and Climate of the Flanders Research Institute for agriculture, fisheries and food) plans to expand its activities in the next few years, with particular emphasis on research into resources that can continue to reduce energy 282 consumption in horticulture. In the glasshouse horticulture sector, which accounts for a significant proportion of primary energy consumption, further efforts must be made to reduce greenhouse gases by 2030. Investments in new technologies will be needed to further decouple energy consumption from production volume. This involves district heating systems, glasshouse insulation, use of screens, transparent PV panels, heat recovery, residual heat, residual CO2, steam heat pumps, energy storage systems and possible geothermal energy solutions. In the agricultural sector as well, cogeneration is an efficient technology for transitioning to a climate-neutral society. The current support provided through certificates for the cogeneration savings of new units will be assessed and gradually withdrawn over the next 10 years (with 30% being withdrawn by 2025) as developments occur in the gas/electricity price ratio, new support mechanisms for capacity and flexibility, fair efficiency and the ultimate goal of gradually eliminating fossil fuels. When the post-2020 common agricultural policy (CAP) is implemented, it may be decided to offer broader support to energy investments through the VLIF. The selection method applied to all aid applications will be adapted so that investments that make the greatest contribution to reducing the pressure on the environment and mitigating and adapting to climate change will be ranked the highest. Energy emissions in the agricultural and horticultural sectors will be 28% lower in 2030 in the WAM scenario than in the WEM scenario. To achieve this reduction, as in the industrial sector, EPAs will be concluded from 2023 with the energy-intensive (glasshouse) horticultural sector. Under the 2019-2024 government agreement, the (glasshouse) horticultural sector is one of the notified enlargements of the EPA target group. Furthermore, non-energy-intensive agricultural businesses will also be able to conclude mini-EPAs, like the mini-EPAs for industrial SMEs, through the relevant (sub)sectoral federations.  Walloon Region  Brussels Capital Region Good Move plan The Good Move plan is the new regional mobility plan, which includes a regulatory part (127). It was adopted at first reading on 4 April 2019. The plan forms one of the methods being used by the region to achieve the climate and environmental objectives and commitments of the Brussels Capital Region, particularly those commitments set out in this NECP. It takes a short-, medium- and long-term view of the development of mobility in Brussels. The government will start to implement this plan once it adopts the final version of its strategic and regulatory part and once it provides the human and budgetary resources needed to rapidly, flexibly and fully implement the plan. objectives and measures for the period 2020-2030. It is based around six priorities (cross-cutting strategic action programmes) and provides for the implementation of around 50 measures. According to its environmental impact report, the Good Move plan could reduce vehicle-kilometres in the Brussels Capital Region by 21% by 2030 compared with 2018. The key energy and climate objectives of the Good Move plan are to reduce the use and ownership of vehicles and to green the rolling stock. In this respect, the key measures are grouped below according to their priority (128). The measures set out in the following sections are broken down into specific actions in the Good Move plan. Reference should be made to the plan for more details on those actions.                                                            127 The plan was adopted through the Order of 26 July 2013 establishing a framework for mobility planning and amending various provisions with an impact on mobility. 128 The Good Move plan is based around six priorities, but only four of those are relevant for supporting the regional climate objectives. The last two priorities, i.e.   with governance and knowledge and also the transparency of mobility policy data. They are not included in this plan, but 283 As the Good Move plan has not yet been finally adopted (a public inquiry was held from mid-June to mid-October 2019), the amendments made to the draft version (resulting in the final plan) will become part of the NECP. However, it will be ensured that the general ambition of the transport measures either remains constant or is revised upwards. Any downward revision of the environmental ambition of the measures must be offset.  Priority A - Good Neighbourhood This priority covers all the actions associated with organising mobility in the districts of Brussels in order to improve the quality of life of inhabitants. The ambition is to create the conditions so that districts are truly peaceful, so that quality of life and quality of public space are significantly improved, and so that the aspects of living in the district, universal accessibility, road safety, air quality and health are prioritised. This involves developing large calmed areas with a diameter of 1 km to 2.5 km. Road traffic will be permitted for local access, but through traffic will be heavily discouraged and speeds will be systematically reduced by establishing 30 km/h zones that are clear and understandable to users and that are reinforced by specific features (road narrowing through build-outs or pinch points, signage, etc.).  The main measures proposed are as follows: - Set 30 km/h as the prescribed speed on roads from 2025 (A.1) to maintain the local nature of the vast majority of roads, reduce actual speeds in order to limit environmental nuisance, and ensure calm, safe and mixed traffic. - Create peaceful districts (A.2) consisting of large calmed areas without through traffic, where quality of public space and accessibility to active modes of transport are prioritised in collaboration with local authorities. From 2020, at least five projects will be launched every year. In 2025, 10 transport networks will be in operation, with 20 in 2030. - Enhance and pool off-road parking (A.4) to reduce the public space occupied by parked vehicles and encourage vehicles into off-road car parks, in line with ensuring quality of life within the district, the overall parking strategy and the other actions included in the plan. The number of unreserved on-road parking spaces will gradually reduce from 265,000 to 235,000 in 2025 and 205,000 in 2030. - Optimise deliveries by developing local logistics space and smarter urban distribution (A.5) to ensure the supply of the various local urban functions, generally optimise deliveries across the district, including e-commerce, reduce the impact on active modes of transport and public transport, and reduce the nuisance caused. Five pilot projects will benefit from support every year from 2020.  Priority B - Good Network This priority covers all the actions associated with transport networks in order to ensure efficient and high-quality services and travel. The fundamental challenge is to re-establish the best possible balance between the car and other modes of transport on the various roads in order to improve travel via active modes of transport and also the performance of surface public transport. This will involve making a qualitative leap in terms of the facilities for active modes of transport and public transport. The Brussels Capital Region has developed a strategy for establishing clear priorities in the sharing of road space. This strategy involves ensuring that roads are multimodal by creating a key network for each mode of transport (walking, cycling, public transport, motorised traffic and heavy goods vehicles).                                                             this does not mean that their implementation and the respective investment by Bruxelles Environnement are not important. 284 The main measures proposed are as follows: - Adapt the main urban routes by making them multimodal (B.2) to improve their integration into the urban context, reduce the public space occupied by road traffic and its associated nuisance, and encourage alternative modes of transport. One urban route will be adapted in 2020, 18 by 2025 and 35 by 2030. - Create pedestrian routes (B.3) that allow people to walk long distances and offer rest areas. This will involve creating a network of uninterrupted pedestrian routes that connect regional hubs, particularly train and metro stations, and expanding the city centre beyond the Pentagon. It is planned that the network of pedestrian routes will be 30% complete in 2025 and 60% complete in 2030. - Create a network of priority cycle routes (B.4) to support the role of cycling in urban mobility. These routes must meet five quality criteria: they must be cohesive, quick (direct), safe, pleasant and comfortable. All the -will be in use by 2025. The Vélo PLUS network (Petite Ceinture [inner ring], Moyenne Ceinture Est [eastern middle ring], Avenue Louise, canal crossing, etc.) will be 50% complete by 2025 and 100% complete by 2030. - Through all available action levers, improve the performance of surface public transport (B.5) by improving the service speed and particularly the regularity of surface routes to make the network more attractive and more efficient. The planned speed of the bus and tram networks will be gradually increased from 16 km/h in 2020 to 17 km/h in 2025 and 18 km/h in 2030. - Continue developing the key public transport network (B.6) to meet the expected increase in its use, anticipate population changes and the creation of new districts, and reinforce the role of the public transport network as the backbone of urban development. Network extensions to Neder-Over-Heembeek, Tour & Taxi, the Heysel and the Nord-Albert part of the north-south route will be completed in 2025. The north-south route (diagonal) and the Marcel Thiry-Bordet extension will be completed in 2030. - Convert key bus routes into tram routes, including route 95 (to ensure a priority connection between the Gare Centrale and the new Usquare site) and route 49 (to extend the rail network from Albert to the Gare ). The government will initially set up these new routes as rapid transit routes in order to quickly improve the offer. Lastly, a route to ensure that the Mediapark site is accessible will be created as the site is developed. The extension of key routes 7 (to Forest) and 8 (to Evère and the Forêt de Soignes) will be studied and planned, as will the separation of certain parts of routes 92 and 55.  The metro extension to Bordet is confirmed for 2030. The surface work needed in all the areas impacted by the metro work will be carried out in accordance with the S-T-O-P principle. - appropriately adapted routes. A test will be conducted in 2020 with regard to access to the main logistics and industrial hubs of Brussels situated to the south of the canal area (Anderlecht Industrie) and in 2025 for those situated to the north (Schaerbeek-Formation).  Priority C - Good Service This priority covers all the actions associated with mobility services so that users are offered a range of integrated services which, for a significant proportion of the population, replace the need to have a personal car. This service approach must be implemented: - without increasing the overall demand for mobility; - by developing the offer and steering demand towards shared mobility by optimising resources; - by ensuring that services are accessible to everyone; - by preventing new services (car sharing, chauffeur-driven cars, self-driving shuttles) from replacing more efficient modes of transport such as walking, cycling or public transport. 285 The constraint imposed (for some) by the LEZ will be used as an opportunity to steer the population towards the MaaS (Mobility as a Service) concept and a reduction in car ownership.  The main measures proposed are as follows: - Support the development of MaaS (C.1): the MaaS concept is the new trend in the area of mobility and is intended to change how people move about, through a transport offer that integrates all modes of transport and all stages of the journey -to-in 2020 and the MaaS platform will become operational in 2021. - Set up integrated mobility service and information points (C.2) so that users can access information and advice on all mobility services and also purchase or subscribe to those services. Information on the issues associated with goods transport by and for individuals will also be offered, ranging from the use of cars to go shopping to the impact of home deliveries on mobility. Mobility shops must offer a genuine coaching service to meet the specific needs of users and allow them to try new ways of moving about and obtaining supplies. Particular attention will be paid to support for new arrivals and households that are separated from their vehicle due to the LEZ. The first mobility shop will be set up in 2020, with another five in 2025 and twenty in 2030. - Develop services for cycling and new forms of mobility (C.3), including for goods transport. By 2025, 25,000 secure parking spaces for bicycles will be made available at train and metro/pre-metro stations, with 50,000 by 2030. - Improve the accessibility of public spaces and the public transport network at a faster pace (C.5) This involves having a proactive policy to create high-quality pedestrian facilities so that the use of both walking and public transport are optimised. In 2020, 120 public transport stops (including their surroundings) will be made accessible, with 420 by 2025 and 700 by 2030. - C8: Develop stations and transfer points in order to improve the opportunities for intermodal transport. Transfer points will be requalified, while ensuring service quality, universal accessibility, comfort and clear pathways. Such sites must be better integrated in the urban fabric, particularly S-network stations. - Implement the regional part of the metropolitan Park & Ride (P+R) strategy (C.9). This strategy aims to offer feeder parking (for cars and bicycles) on key routes of the public transport network, at the earliest possible point in the transport chain, in order to reduce vehicle flows entering the Region. This offer will complement the offer that already exists or that is to be created at metropolitan level, and will be integrated into the management of public parking at regional level. By 2030, 10,000 parking spaces will be created, with an occupancy rate of around 80% (65% of spaces will be available in 2025). - Reinforce shared mobility services (C.11), in the form of mobility points, by ensuring that these complement public transport, so that reducing vehicle ownership is credible. In 2020, five mobility points will be brought into use, with 50 in 2025 and 200 in 2030.  Priority D - Good Choice This priority covers all the local measures and incentives designed to influence and guide personal and collective mobility choices. The actions are intended to ensure the best possible conditions: - for managing overall transport demand, by reducing the number of journeys, specifically those over long distances; - for encouraging use of the most appropriate mode of transport for each journey (depending on the conditions (season, weather, distance) and reason (need to transport children or goods, for example)); - so that owning your own vehicle is no longer essential. 286  The main measures proposed are as follows: - Reinforce parking management tools as a lever for achieving the mobility objectives (D.2), by supplementing and reinforcing the technical and regulatory tools, particularly the Regional Parking Policy Plan (Plan Régional de Politique du Stationnement  PRPS) and the COBRACE. The PRPS will be revised in 2020.  - Create tools aimed at discouraging vehicle ownership (D.3), whether personal or company vehicles. This involves creating and using various economic and tax tools. By 2025, a tool will have been developed for assessing mobility costs. - Base transport charges on use (D.4). The aim is to make users aware of their transport habits (choice of mode of transport, time of travel, etc.) in order to encourage them to rationalise and manage their mobility choices and use the most appropriate mode(s) of transport at the right time and in the right place. - Proactively support transport generators (businesses, schools, commercial, cultural and sporting activities) (D.7) by developing structural measures, trials or services (one-off or constant). Among the existing tools, the government has decided that business travel plans will be used as levers to reduce commuting pressure on the roads. - Change the logistics practices of the construction sector (D.9) so that logistics management becomes part of the circular economy and the best logistics practices are encouraged, such as consolidating flows and pooling vehicle deliveries, in order to reduce disruption on the roads. NB: The Good Move plan also includes phasing out internal combustion engines and developing alternative vehicles (measure D.5  Towards a carbon-free   Cooperation The Brussels Capital Region is fully engaged with the issues of mobility and is aware of the energy savings to be made in this area. It is also investing considerable resources in this respect and will continue to do so. However, work to coordinate with other bodies is vital, as around 340,000 commuters enter the Region every morning. In this context, the government is committed to strengthening its collaboration with the Federal Government and the other two Regions, whether through the regional policy statement or the Good Move plan. Measure E.3 that need to be managed by several federated entities and the Federal Government to ensure supra-regional mobility, including in terms of goods transport. It is also noted that improved collaboration will allow certain resources to be pooled, expertise to be reinforced and coherent action by the public authorities to be demonstrated to the public and socioeconomic circles in order to inspire confidence. confirmed in its 2019-2024 majority agreement that it wants to conclude a cooperation agreement between the Regions in order to implement smart kilometre charging for light vehicles in the metropolitan area or the entire country. If such charging is introduced, it must replace the current form of taxation. The government also undertakes to: - Strengthen its collaboration with the federal and regional authorities in terms of ensuring coherence in the metropolitan area. To this end, the government intends to start the groundwork on institutionalised cooperation between the various levels of power for the specific case of the Brussels Capital Region and to define a series of priority actions and a partnership framework for implementing those actions. The majority agreement identifies the following actions, among others: - In order to enhance the synergies between public transport operators, the government will propose a transport plan for the metropolitan area that is common to the four operators (SNCB, TEC, STIB, De Lijn). The government will request an increase in the SNCB rail offer to and from Brussels, as well as an increase in the rail offer throughout the Brussels network so that the maximum waiting time is 287 10 minutes during peak periods and 15 minutes during the rest of the day, including at weekends and in the evening. In order to support the development of the RER network and the S-network offer of the SNCB, the government will produce a regional plan to improve railway halts, in agreement with the SNCB, Infrabel and the affected municipalities. The government will consult the other two Regions to ensure cooperation in terms of the public transport offer. - More broadly, the government will study the operational and financial feasibility and the operating conditions of the intra-Brussels rail network for the benefit of Brussels residents. - Implement the Energy Pact, which in particular provides for the conclusion of a cooperation agreement on decarbonisation and the reduction of environmental and societal externalities in mobility. Taking into account the division of responsibilities, the Regional Government also undertakes to call on the Federal Government to: - reform business taxation, in particular by: - adapting the tax system for company vehicles in order to: - remove, reduce or redirect the tax benefits; - encourage the faster introduction of alternative solutions with a view to developing the MaaS concept; - improve its energy and environmental performance by reducing the proportion of internal combustion engines, with diesels being a priority (as part of the phase-out of internal combustion engines), and taking more account of size, weight and power. - introducing a tax framework that encourages employers to contribute to the public transport costs of all commuters, including public officials; - reducing VAT on work and facilities allowing the development of cycle paths; - reducing VAT on bicycle delivery services; - increasing investment in the railways for the transport of passengers: networks, stations (and surrounding district), rolling stock and service frequency; - encourage significantly increased use of the inland waterways for goods transport, where this is feasible; - systematically use embankments alongside railways for the development of safe cycle paths and, where possible, cycle highways; in particular, the work currently ongoing or planned on the RER network offers such opportunities; - adapt and gradually tighten product standards with, in particular, a gradual ban on the marketing of polluting vehicles based on various criteria (size, fuel, power, etc.); in particular, a call will soon be made for a ban from 2025 on light vehicles with internal combustion or hybrid engines that are over 1,500 kg, which will be gradually reduced to 1,000 kg by 2030; - ensure the adoption by all social partners of the bicycle kilometric allowance for workers using their own bicycle for commuting to their place of work (to be included in all collective agreements so that this becomes a worker right). As part of the new mobility cooperation agreement, the Brussels Capital Region will ask for the Regions to agree on the common objectives in relation to the development of the Brussels Ring, preceded by joint studies in this respect. The government confirms that it is opposed to the Brussels Ring being enlarged as such. Development of the Brussels Ring must be linked with a broader mobility project, incorporating public transport and cycling, as well as transit car parks, to encourage a modal shift from personal cars to alternative modes of transport. Development of the Brussels Ring must have the effect of reducing traffic in the Brussels Capital Region, by acting as a bypass for road journeys that do not need to enter the city centre, and, in terms of the environment and public health, must comply with the regional commitments and help to improve air quality. 288 Lastly, the government will also ask the other two Regions to tighten up the mandatory technical inspection of vehicles, in particular to reduce fraud (AdBlue and particulate filters), in line with the GOCA study (GOCA is the group of businesses approved to inspect vehicles and driving licences).   Regulating products and systems The Federal Government is responsible for setting product standards. It plans to introduce a broader, tougher policy on products and market access for products and equipment that consume energy (stricter emission standards, ban on the use of certain types of heating, and fuel standards, etc.), ensuring that sufficient attention is paid to harmonisation between the Regions. Products will be required to achieve a minimum energy efficiency rating by a certain date. An impact assessment using a model based on stock statistics is needed to estimate the precise impact of these measures. In this context, a study is currently under way to determine the structure of energy consumption in Belgian households. It is focusing in particular on household appliances and their specifications, such as the energy rating defined by the European energy label.  Federal State  Product standards, Ecodesign and labelling: o Broader, tougher policy on products at national level and via the European Union. o Access to market regulation (stricter emission standards, ban on the use of certain types of heating, and fuel standards), ensuring that sufficient attention is paid to harmonisation between the Regions. o Products will be required to achieve a minimum energy efficiency rating by a certain date. o An impact assessment using a model based on stock statistics is needed to estimate the precise impact of these measures.  The Federal Public Service for the Economy (Directorate-General for Energy) has launched a study in order to determine the stock of installed appliances and their specifications, such as the energy rating defined by the European energy label. One aim of the study, in the context of the NECP, is to look at possible policy developments based on a European energy label in Belgium and to assess the potential in terms of energy savings. On that basis, proposals may be made for a future Belgian policy that will go further than the EU policy.   Promoting energy efficient public procurement The public authorities take their exemplary role very seriously. As well as implementing energy efficiency measures in their buildings, they must also set a good example in their procurement procedures (for equipment, for example).  Federal State For public buildings:  Monitoring of the usable areas and energy consumption of property managed by the Régie des Bâtiments will continue.  All federal public buildings will be required to use the central purchasing body (grouped purchases) via the Federal Public Service for Strategy and Support (BOSA).  The obligation for the supplier to provide consumption data will be tightened up and appropriate tools will be developed for this purpose. This will be valid for gas and electricity (for which data are currently 289 available for around 95% of the consumption of the property managed by the Régie des Bâtiments) and also for heating oil or any other fuel.  A feasibility study (in terms of both quality and quantity) will be conducted on establishing an energy register or inventory for Belgian property (public and private sector). o More specifically for public buildings:  Monitoring of the usable areas and energy consumption of property managed by the Régie des Bâtiments will continue.  All federal public buildings will be required to use the central purchasing body (grouped purchases) via the Federal Public Service for Strategy and Support (BOSA). The obligation for the supplier to provide consumption data will be tightened up and appropriate tools will be developed for this purpose. This will be valid for gas and electricity (for which data are currently available for around 95% of the consumption of the property managed by the Régie des Bâtiments) and also for heating oil or any other fuel.  Other measures for the tertiary sector Walloon Region  Public service obligation for municipal lighting Under the Electricity Decree and the Walloon Government Decree of 6 November 2008, electricity DSOs are required to maintain and improve the energy efficiency of public lighting installations. Under those provisions and at the request of municipalities, the DSO must maintain the municipal public lighting installations in the geographical area for which it is responsible, which includes improving their energy efficiency. The DSOs must prioritise replacing lights that are more than 10 years old and must also take into account, in their plans, the need to prioritise the replacement of public lighting technologies that will no longer be marketed in the short and medium term due in particular to the European Ecodesign technical regulation being implemented. The programme of replacement must ensure that all lights are modernised within 10 years, with this replacement work being scheduled for completion by 1 January 2030 at the latest. Eventually, all public lighting installations will be equipped with the most appropriate LED technologies.  Support and assistance for private businesses in the tertiary sector, particularly in order to improve the energy performance of processes Alongside the UREBA programme mentioned in point 3.2.2 above and with specific reference to the public and non-market sectors, Wallonia will continue to support and assist private businesses in the tertiary sector: - Network of facilitators responsible for informing and assisting project owners in the tertiary sector and SMEs. - AMURE programme and Chèques Entreprises for energy audit subsidies for SMEs-VSEs. - UDE subsidies for process energy improvements, cogeneration and renewable energy use. - New AMURE incentives to improve insulation, ventilation, lighting and cold storage rooms in shops and restaurants. - Novallia funding for SMEs and VSEs that actively invest in the energy transition. Large private businesses in the tertiary sector must also carry out an energy audit under Article 8, like their counterparts in industry.  290  Reducing consumption and emissions through behaviour change Walloon Region According to an analysis conducted in Wallonia, individual behaviour change is regarded as a crucial lever for moderating energy consumption in housing, transport, leisure and other consumption sectors. The potential for reducing GHG emissions through behaviour change is high: studies carried out in other countries estimate that this can vary between 10% (129) and 27% (130). However, the level of acceptance of behaviour change is currently low, and estimated at just 5% (131). Long-term coherent programmes therefore need to be established in order to increase this level of acceptance and maximise the available reduction potential. Such programmes must have a clear message that is easy to take on board. Wallonia has been promoting rational energy use for many years. Various legislative tools (EPB) and incentives and subsidies have therefore been introduced, accompanied by communication campaigns in various forms and using various channels. The theoretical potential in Wallonia is around 2-3 TWh. However, it is virtually impossible to determine how much of this potential can actually be achieved without a precise action plan and retro-verification of the result obtained. Moreover, this result will never be achievable simply through a communication action, but will require the convergence of a whole series of coherent actions (communication, training, incentives, legislative or technical frameworks, etc.). In this context, Wallonia can take action through:  Coherent communication based on the objectives pursued: The basic long-term message must be accompanied by thematic campaigns based around certain annual priorities (subjects and targets) and taking account of the heterogeneity of the public. The basic rules of effective communications apply to such messages.  A long-term integrated approach that includes legislative measures: A recent study (132) indicates that awareness-raising campaigns can be a first important step, but that the literature suggests that they cannot by themselves bring about behaviour change, in particular once they have ended. The study highlights the effectiveness of using top-down approaches, including regulatory measures, to promote long-term behaviour change. The study also notes that temporary tax measures struggle to achieve long-term behaviour change. In connection with regulatory measures, a second study from 2018 (133) highlights the impact of changing default options in bringing about behaviour change. In the same respect, offering free audit programmes should also encourage investment in both the industrial and the residential sectors.  Removing barriers Another role of the public authorities is to remove barriers to this behaviour change. The actions identified in this respect are as follows: - Assist and encourage the emergence on the market of services/products/technologies that support responsible energy behaviour, by avoiding lock-ins. - Enable quick and easy access to information, via a centralised platform, ideally linked to the proposed platform for promoting responsible choices (see point 3.1.1(v)). A one-stop shop, based on existing                                                            129 (Stern, 2009) (USA). 130 (S. Nonhebel, 2001) (Netherlands). 131 (5% according to (S.

This can guide households towards the type of energy renovation to be carried out, help them to understand the benefits of reenergy passport, help households to identify contractors who can carry out the work, and guide them on how to finance the work. - Organise the local support network that will be accessible to the public and that will be responsible for some of the communication, practice advice and incentives. - Develop public infrastructure, where this is necessary. - Showcase best practices and establish a qualitative framework for products and services. - Establish the financial and legal framework of incentives and deterrents. - the impact of counter-productive external communications.  Assurance of governance A final important role of the public authorities is to regularly ensure that the actions taken towards the objective pursued are relevant. The impact of communication campaigns must be regularly assessed so that they can be constantly optimised by correcting them aim, if necessary. New ideas that emerge must also be rapidly incorporated. Likewise, the impact of the tools made available must be systematically monitored, and the extent of the financial support or brakes must be adapted as the situation changes. A group of experts should be formed to carry out this monitoring, communicate its conclusions and ensure the implementation of its recommendations.  v. Where applicable, a description of policies and measures to promote the role of local renewable energy communities in contributing to the implementation of policies and measures in points i, ii, iii and iv Flemish Region See point 2.4.3.4 Involving the public, local authorities and businesses in the energy transition point   vi. Description of measures to develop measures to utilise energy efficiency potentials of gas and electricity infrastructure Federal State Optimise the energy efficiency of the gas and electricity infrastructure used by gas and electricity transmission system operators.  Flemish Region Article 3.1.4/1(4) of the Energy Decree states that energy efficiency is one of the objectives that the Flemish energy market regulator (VREG) must pursue in developing the systems.  In practice, this is done by approving the investment plans of system operators. Under Article 4.1.19 of the Energy Decree, distribution system operators must submit an annual investment plan to the VREG for their systems, highlighting key investments and the associated timescales. On 26 February 2014 the Flemish Parliament approved a decree containing an article that provides a formal basis for the technical rules to include a requirement for the system operator to send the VREG its assessment of the energy efficiency potential of its gas and electricity infrastructure. 292 The study carried out by Synergrid under Article 15(2) of Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency did not suggest any additional projects and/or ideas for proactively limiting the energy losses of the distribution systems or adjusting investments in the existing infrastructure. The current investment policy already takes optimal account of energy losses in the power grids and the cost-effectiveness of investments, given the failure rate of existing assets and the expected safety and reliability performance of those grids. However, some improvements could be made to system operation. Article II.1.1.1(3) of the Technical Regulation for the operation of electricity distribution systems requires system operators to annually send the VREG their assessment of the energy efficiency potential of their electricity infrastructure, in particular regarding distribution, load management, interoperability and connection to energy generating installations, including access possibilities for micro energy generators. The Flemish DSOs have therefore looked at various measures to improve energy efficiency in the operation of their distribution systems. They report to the VREG on the implementation of those measures. Investment measures:  In terms of low-voltage, three-conductor systems (3X230V) are already being converted into four-conductor systems (3X230/400V) whenever they are replaced. Three-conductor systems (3X230V) that are in operation are also being converted into four-conductor systems (3X230/400V).  In terms of medium voltage, the optimal cable cross-section is being rolled out.   When new distribution transformers are purchased for new electrical cabinets or to replace existing transformers, DSOs must choose a high energy performance transformer that complies with Commission Regulation (EU) No 548/2014 on the ecodesign of transformers. The optimal choice of transformer must be determined by investment, load, loss and growth factors.  To optimise use of the distribution system, DSOs must install switch-disconnectors and remote-controlled circuit-breakers in their medium-voltage cabinets.  Operating measures:  switch to automatic transformer setting;  dynamic line rating;  reduction in consumption of substations and cabinets, with power for own use generated on site;  reduction in travel by using remote control/remote readings;  careful choice of the open point in distribution loops;  deactivation of spare transformers.  Walloon Region Under Article 15(2) of Directive 2012/27/EU, the various DSOs have assessed the energy efficiency potential of their gas and electricity infrastructure. All the measures assessed by each DSO are set out in the report sent to the Commission. Furthermore, the decrees organising the gas and electricity markets in the Walloon Region require DSOs to take account of energy efficiency when planning their investments. DSOs are required to consider energy efficiency measures in accordance with Article 11(2) of the Electricity Decree: The DSO shall guarantee that its assigned system is operated, maintained and developed under socially, technically and economically reasonable conditions, including interconnections with other power grids, in order to ensure security and continuity of supply while respecting the environment and energy efficiency. The government shall define the concept of socially, technically and economically reasonable conditions. 293  10° to examine, when planning the sys-side management and generating installation accommodation measures in order to avoid any increase in, or replacement of, system  A similar requirement is laid down in Article 12(2) of the decree organishall guarantee that its assigned system is operated, maintained and developed under socially, technically and economically reasonable conditions, including interconnections with other gas systems, in order to ensure security and continuity of supply while respecting the environment and energy efficiency. Such measures must be submitted to the regulator through adaptation plans, as defined in Article 15(1) of the  each DSO shall produce an adaptation plan for the system that it manages in order to ensure continuity of supply, security and development of that system under socially, technically and economically reasonable conditions. The government shall define the concept of socially, technically and economically reasonable conditions. When producing their adaptation plan, DSOs shall in particular consider measures involving intelligent system management, active demand-side management, energy efficiency, integration of decentralised generating  Technical regulations determine the timetable and methods for producing and updating the adaptation plan. The adaptation plan for distribution systems covers a period corresponding to the charging period. It is adapted as and when necessary and at least every year for the next two years, according to the procedure set out in the technical regulation. The adaptation plan for the local transmission system is produced at the same time as the development plan referred to in Article  A similar requirement is laid down for gas.  vii. Regional cooperation in this area, where applicable Not applicable  viii. Financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds at national level Walloon Region Funding of the renovation strategy The measures in relation to funding the renovation strategy are described in point residential   Funding of local initiatives The POLLEC project aims to provide financial and methodological support to municipalities that voluntarily adopt a Local Energy and Climate Policy under the Covenant of Mayors. The Covenant of Mayors is a European initiative enabling local and regional authorities to commit to reducing their GHG emissions by more than 20% by 2020 and by more than 40% by 2030. Three calls for projects have been launched by Wallonia since 2012. The pilot project enabled 16 municipalities to receive a subsidy for external support through an invitation to Climat  PAEDC). In the second campaign, 11 municipalities prepared a PAEDC, whilst six supra-municipal structures (province, local authority associations, local action groups) received subsidies in order to help a total of 62 municipalities in their area with the preparation of their PAEDC. The municipalities subsidised under the pilot project also took 294 part in this second campaign as they studied the possibility of setting up renewable energy generating installations through innovative funding mechanisms. Feedback on those mechanisms was provided to all the municipalities in Wallonia in the autumn of 2018. A third campaign was launched in November 2016. It involved 79 municipalities and was intended to enable new areas to initiative their energy transition. As a result of these three campaigns, a total of around 160 municipalities have become involved in the Covenant of Mayors and have prepared a PAEDC, i.e. over 60% of the municipalities in Wallonia. Measures will be taken by the Walloon Region to support the local authorities in the implementation of their PAEDCs.  Taxation The tax lever must be thoroughly reviewed. Taxation needs to be revised in order to ensure that the price signal is consistent with the goals and that negative externalities are internalised (polluter-pays principle). As a reminder, the aim in reforming taxation or any form of public support or levy is to ensure that price signals are consistent with the energy and climate objectives. Reforms will be effective only if they are accompanied by a broader package of measures that make low-carbon alternatives available and accessible. All those measures must be linked so that there is a gradual move towards an appropriate and predictable price signal that necessarily takes account of the financial capacity (and particularly the lack of capacity) of those involved to adapt to the price signal. For example, and as a reminder, the renovation strategy must prioritise vulnerable households so that they can anticipate any change in taxation. The various measures in question cannot be adopted just by the region. Most of the measures require close cooperation with the federal level and the other regions, either because responsibility lies at federal level or is shared, or because the schemes must be harmonised across the regions (in order to avoid distortions). All the measures must therefore be carried out in close cooperation with the other entities. The impact of tax measures will be studied in economic terms (competitiveness, etc.) and social terms (poverty, etc.) to ensure that taxation is fair and equitable in social and environmental terms. Furthermore, close attention will be paid to the budget neutrality of those measures at the various levels of power. The following measures will be taken: 1/ All taxation and tax expenditure will be fully analysed in order to identify price signals that are counter-productive in terms of the climate and environmental objectives. A comprehensive climate and environmental taxation framework will be established in order to rectify signals (ensure a fair price signal) in the sectors concerned. 2/ Separately from this comprehensive framework:  Buildings (134): o The modulation environmental performance will be studied, taking into account the financial capacity of households. o The use of property tax to indebt buildings (135) when work improving their energy performance is carried out will be assessed with regard to its legal and financial implications.  Transport:                                                            134 Reminder of certain items included in the strategy for funding the renovation strategy. 135 The debt is transferred from owner to owner. 295 o The modulation of vehicle registration tax and road tax environmental efficiency and its weight-to-power ratio will be introduced. o The introduction of an incentive for cycling (including for cargo bikes) and electric micro-mobility will be studied. o The introduction of a ceiling on amounts that can be deducted for business travel will be studied together with the Federal Government, in order to take account of the climate and environmental efficiency of vehicles. o The taxation of nozzles for dispensing alternative fuels (regional tax on vending machines) will be suspended in order to support the installation of LNG/CNG pumps. o The taxation of CNG, hydrogen and electric vehicles will be reviewed together with the other levels of power in order to fine-tune the Walloon objectives in terms of development alternative fuels.  All sectors: o Tax relief on rational energy investments will be studied together with the Federal Government for businesses that install alternative fuel infrastructure (charging points, CNG, LNG or H2 pumps).  Walloon investments From 2020, Wallonia intends to make long-term investments in the energy and climate transition through a range of actions that will be detailed in the coming months. The following is a non-exhaustive list of those actions. - KYOTO fund used in particular for the energy transition of businesses, international climate funding and roll-out of charging points: EUR 111 million. - Improvement of the environmental fabric by planting hedges and trees and creating protected areas: EUR 7.3 million (budget doubled). - Measures to encourage alternatives to car use (walking, cycling, bus and shared transport): EUR 80 million. - Increase in the bus offer in both urban and rural areas: EUR 3.7 million. - Greening of the bus fleet (purchase of hydrogen, electric and hybrid buses): EUR 4.5 million. - Gradual implementation of free bus travel, with the first stage being a reduction in prices for 18-24 year-olds and the vulnerable: EUR 5.4 million. - Renovation of public housing: EUR 100 million.
