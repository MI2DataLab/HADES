2.2   i. The elements set out in of Article 4(b) 2.2.1.1 Compliance with obligation under Article 3 of Directive 2012/27/EU Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, amending Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC, as amended by its 2018 revision (hereinframework for measures to promote energy efficiency improvements across the EU in order to ensure the EU energy efficiency target by 2020 / 2030. Article 3 of Directive 2012/27/EU allows each Member State to set an indicative national energy efficiency target, based on either primary or final energy consumption, primary or final energy savings, or energy intensity. At the same time, however, Member States should respect the EU energy efficiency target by 2020 and 2030, which is set at 20 % and 32.5 %, 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%020.00040.00060.00080.000100.000120.000140.000160.0002010201220142016201820202022202420262028203020322034203620382040TJCoalTechnological gasesOil and petroleum productsNatural gasBiogasRenewable sources (excl. biogas)Industrial wasteMunicipal wasteNuclear power plantsHeatElectricityRES shareChart 5: Development of heat sold and the share of RES  -48-  respectively. Achieving this target should lead in 2020 to EU primary energy consumption of no more than 1 474 Mtoe or final energy consumption of more than 1 078 Mtoe. For the year 2030, the revised EU Energy Efficiency Directive sets a target of at least 32.5 %; when converted to absolute values, the primary energy consumption should not exceed 1 273 Mtoe and final energy consumption should not exceed 956 Mtoe for the EU (excluding the United Kingdom, it is 1 128 Mtoe of primary energy consumption and 846 Mtoe of final energy consumption). The Czech Republic considers the indicative national target defined in Article 3 of Directive 2012/27/EU as a non-binding framework target, which does not create a specific and legally enforceable obligation for both the Czech Republic and other entities. Achieving the 2020/2030 target for final and primary energy consumption is influenced by a number of factors and assumptions, which may evolve over time. For this reason, the contribution of the Czech Republic is supplemented to include a specification of for the Czech Republic to reassess the indicative national targets. Contribution of the Czech Republic to the non-binding EU target by 2030 For the period until 2030, the Czech Republic considers it most appropriate to set a national target for the energy performance of the economy which better reflects the influence of external factors on final energy consumption, such as the economic growth. The 2030 national target of the Czech Republic corresponds to the reduction of the energy intensity of GDP creation to the level of 0.157 MJ/CZK and the creation of GVA to the level of 0.174 MJ/CZK. With regard to the obligation arising from Article 3(1) of the Energy Efficiency Directive, the national target of the Czech Republic is also expressed in the final energy consumption, which should not exceed 990 PJ or 1 735 PJ in primary energy consumption24.  The national target is determined as the maximum potential for reducing energy consumption in individual sectors of the economy, i.e. at the limit of final energy consumption that the Czech Republic can realistically achieve with regard to thThis potential reflects the effect of both the approved and planned strategies, policies and measures to be implemented in the period up to 2030, under the following assumptions:  GDP growth in line with the assumptions in Chapter 4.1;  annual increase in residential area, taking into account the demographic developments in the Czech Republic in accordance with the assumptions in Chapter 4.1;  growth in transport performance in the transport sector;  a change in the structure of the economy (growth of the services sector and a decrease of heavy industry);  increase/decrease of production in industry.  For a detailed description of the developments in and the setting of the final energy consumption target / primary energy consumption target, see Chapter 4.3. Strategies and policies affecting the level of final energy consumption include, without limitation:  Long-term strategy for the renovation of buildings pursuant to Article 2a of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive;  obligation under Article 5 of the Energy Efficiency Directive;  obligation under Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive;                                                            24 The value is in line with Eurostat methodology  Final Energy Consumption.  -49-   legislative and regulatory measures resulting from the transposition and implementation of national and EU legislation;  fiscal instruments  strategies and policies in other areas including, inter alia, the transport sector and specified in the following strategic materials: o State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic o National Reform Programme of the Czech Republic (NRP) o State Environmental Policy o Climate Policy in Czech Republic o Strategic Framework for Sustainable Development of the Czech Republic o Transport Policy of the Czech Republic for 20142020 with the Prospect of 2050. 2.2.1.2 Cumulative energy savings target under Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU for the period 20212030 The revision of Directive 2012/27/EU of 11 December 2018 extends the obligation to achieve new energy savings for the period 20212030.  In line with the text of the revision of Directive 2012/27/EU and the rules for setting the commitment, the 2030 was set at 84 PJ of new energy savings, i.e. 462 PJ of cumulated energy savings by 203025. The commitment respects the requirement to meet the minimum annual energy savings of 0.8 % of annual final energy consumption in accordance with Article 7(1)(b).  The target calculation baseline is the final energy consumption according to Eurostat data  Final Energy Consumption Europe 20202030. In the period 20212030, the Czech Republic does not exercise the Article 7(4). The cumulated energy savings commitment is based on the assumption of a proportional reduction in energy consumption over the entire commitment period.

The commitment will be revised in 2020 on the basis of a EUROSTAT data update  in accordance with the Directive, the reference value will be averaged over the most recent three-year period prior to 1 January 2019. This approach is chosen in view of the time inconsistence between the submission of the National Plan and the deadline for transposition and implementation of the approved revision of Directive 2012/27/EU.  -50-  Source: Prepared by MIT for the purposes of the National Plan Chart 6: Determining the cumulative commitment of the Czech Republic pursuant to Article 7 for 20212030 (PJ)  Source: Prepared by MIT for the purposes of the National Plan 2.2.1.3 Directive 2012/27/EU Article 5 of the Directive provides that each Member State shall ensure, as from 1 January 2014, the renovation of at least 3 % of the total floor area of buildings with a total useful floor area over 250 m2, where the buildings are owned and occupied by central government and which simultaneously do not meet the minimum requirements for the energy performance of buildings of Class C  Efficient. These minimum requirements are set by individual Member States on the basis of Article 4 of Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings. On the basis of the projected energy performance class of a partially renovated building stock of central government because there was progress towards this obligation already in the current 20142020 period 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energ26 approved by the Government, falling under the renovation obligation under Article 5 of Directive 2012/27/EU in 2021, the minimum energy savings were set for buildings not meeting the minimum energy performance class such that the savings would be achieved at the annual renovation rate of 3 % of the total useful floor area of non-compliant buildings. This approach is in line with the requirements of Article 5 of the Energy Efficiency Directive.                                                            26  Link to the document: https://www.mpo.cz/cz/energetika/energeticka-ucinnost/strategicke-dokumenty/plan-renovace-budov-ustrednich-vladnich-instituci-dle-cl--5-smernice-2012-27-eu-o-energeticke-ucinnosti--236718/  -51-  The determination of the annual energy saving commitment of 12.4 TJ assumes the implementation of of Article 5 of Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on e27. ii. The indicative milestones for 2030, 2040 and 2050, the domestically established measurable progress indicators, an evidence-based estimate of expected energy savings and wider benefits, ciency targets as included in the roadmaps set out in the long-term renovation strategies for the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU  Indicative milestones of the long-term building renovation strategy In accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2012/27/EU, an Update of the Building Renovation Strategy as part of the fifth Update of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan28 was prepared in 2017. The elaborated strategy analyses the different scenarios of the renovation of building stock, their costs and benefits, and proposes policy, legislative and economic tools for their implementation29. The energy and economic impacts of individual scenarios were evaluated on the basis of outputs of individual parts until 2020 (building stock overview, savings options in the building stock, renovation costs, defining individual renovation scenarios). In view of the new requirements for the Long-term Building Renovation Strategy under Article 2 of Directive (EU) 2018/844 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018, the current strategy can no longer be considered decisive.  A revision of the existing building renovation strategy was launched to meet all new requirements as soon as in early 201930. However, as of October 2019, the complete update work has not yet been completed. For this reason and with regard to the approval process of the final version of the National Energy and Climate Plan of the Czech Republic, this material does not contain the complete input of the Long-term Building Renovation Strategy, but only partial outputs. The scenario design for setting building renovation milestones by 2050 is set on the basis of an analysis of the current status of the building stock, the building renovation policy and its effect on improving energy performance of the building stock of the Czech Republic. Furthermore, the chosen scenario will reflect the extension of existing policies planned to be implemented after 2020. The current development of the renovation of the building stock (BaU scenario) reflects the current market situation. This scenario is based on data available from the Czech Statistical Office and the Ministry of Industry and Trade. This is a energy performance of buildings. These are mainly legislative, fiscal and behavioural measures. As regards fiscal measures on the part of the state, CZK 66 1777 million was allocated in 20142020.                                                            27  The value is an estimate based on the current renovation plan of the buildings of the central institutions. The commitment will be revised on the basis of the current data in 2020 following the planned renovations. 28  Link to the document: https://www.mpo.cz/cz/energetika/energeticka-ucinnost/strategicke-dokumenty/narodni-akcni-plan-energeticke-ucinnosti-cr--150542/ 29  The strategy works with the quality of buildings without any significant reflection on the purpose of their use, i.e. assesses buildings in particular in terms of their energy performance in accordance with Directive 2010/31/EU. 30  Already in 2018, strategy under Article 4 of the Energy Efficiency Directive.  -52-  Table 29: List of fiscal measures for the renovation of the building stock for the preceding and following periods Fiscal measures Sector Allocation 20142020 (NAPEE-III, CZK million) Current allocation for 20142020 (CZK million) Allocation 20212030 (CZK million) OP E residential, public authorities 31 500 23 214 14 000 OP EIC / OPC commercial 13 333 11 533 5 333 IROP residential  excl.

The buildings within the scenario were differentiated into residential and non-residential sectors. The single-family and multi-family (apartment) buildings were also evaluated separately within the residential sector. For example, for apartment buildings, the owners and differences in the depth of renovations that they have implemented have been identified to better single out the target groups for drawing funds from fiscal measures. For the residential sector, a renovation rate of 1.4 % is calculated, which means that 1.4 % of residential buildings in the Czech Republic will undergo renovation annually.

The setting of the Real Scenario is based on the above values (renovation rate, final energy consumption, renovation depth, etc.), assuming a greater extent of state intervention by 2030 and fiscal and legislative measures aimed to shift the depth of renovations. Based on the policies for complying with Article 7 of the Directive, in particular, financial support for the renovation of public sector buildings can be expected; see the table above. As a result of this support, an increase in the renovation rate can be expected in this smainly by legislative adjustments and information campaigns, focusing on the residential sector, where partial renovations without expert supervision currently prevail. As a result of the policies envisaged, see Chapter 3.2, the Real Scenario considers the following input parameters: The Real Scenario for residential buildings does not expect an increased number of renovated buildings, so the renovation rate for both scenarios remains unchanged and the predicted depth of renovation has a major influence on the development of building renovation.

Where applicable, other national objectives, including long-term targets or strategies and sectoral targets, and national objectives in areas such as energy efficiency in the transport sector and with regard to heating and cooling In this regard, it is possible to mention the target in relation to the heating and cooling sector, which follows from the approved State Energy Policy. This target states that 60 % of supplies in heat supply systems should be covered by cogeneration by 2040. This target is currently being met, but its future progress depends, inter alia, on the promotion of cogeneration. For more information on the support for CHP after 2020, see the Chapter 3.1.2
