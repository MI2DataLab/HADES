Decarbonisation Dimension  GHG emissions and removals i. Policies and measures to achieve the target set under Regulation (EU) 2018/842 as referred to in point 2.1.1 and policies and measures to comply with Regulation (EU) 2018/841, covering all key emitting sectors and sectors for the enhancement of removals, with an outlook to the long-term vision and objective of becoming a low emission economy and achieving a balance between emissions and removals in accordance with the Paris Agreement In April 2017, the Riigikogu approved the Estonian long-term climate policy hereinafter GPCP 2050). The GPCP 2050 is a vision document that lays down a long-term target for the reduction of GHG emissions and policies for adjusting to climate change or responding to the impacts of climate change, in order to ensure preparedness and the required resilience. The principles and guidelines set out in the document must be taken into account in updating and implementing the cross-sectoral and sectoral strategies and national development plans. The main sectoral policies and principles of the GPCP 2050 that pertain to the economy as a whole and contribute to achieving the targets indicated in point 2.1.1. are provided in an annex to the document (see Annex II, GPCP 2050 policies and principles). A detailed description of the guideline can be found in the GPCP 2050 document78. The compilation of the above-mentioned development document also followed the the targets of which is maintenance of ecological balance with the aim of treating nature development of Estonia. The Riigikogu                                                            77 Compared to the results of the non-intrusive scenario (minimal regulation and support) in the ESDP 2030 economic impact analysis model 78 http://www.envir.ee/sites/default/files/362xiii_rk_o_04.2017-1.pdf separate plan has not been compiled for the implementation of the national sustainable development strategy, and it is instead implemented via the strategies and development plans of different sectors. On 2 March 2017 the change adahad been completed in 2016 under the guidance of the Ministry of the Environment in cooperation with other ministries and partners and the Estonian Environmental Research Centre. The process of preparing the development plan was supported through the financial mechanism of the European Economy Association. The main objective of the development plan is to increase the preparedness and ability to adapt to climate change on the national, regional and local levels. Implementation of the of climate change on the national, regional and local levels and help ascertain the areas that are most vulnerable to climate change. The development plan will plan and guide the area of adaptation to the impact of climate change as a whole via a single strategy document, and the overall approach to climate change adaptation will be assembled and harmonised. This will ensure better cohesion between different sectors of climate change adaptation. The development plan sets out eight sub-objectives on the basis of the eight priority areas. The following are the policies and measures that will contribute to meeting the objectives listed in Table 4 and Table 5 of chapter 2.1.1. In addition to already implemented and ongoing policies and measures, several additional (taken into account in the preparation of the projections of Chapter 5.1 with additional measures) and planned (the impact of the measures has not been assessed in the preparation of the projections) policies and measures are presented below. As of August 2019, the preparation of drafts for several sectoral development plans (a development plan for the agriculture and fisheries sector, a forestry development plan and a transport development plan) for the period 2021-2030 is under way in Estonia. Since the process of drafting these development plans is still in the early phases, many of the planned measures presented in this chapter originate from three relevant studies completed in -effective measures for achieving commissioned by with the Environmental Investment Centre and the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Rural Affairs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications efficiency obligation in the period 2021-commissioned by the Ministry of Economy Affairs and Communications; and 3) the  commissioned by the Ministry of the Environment and the Government Office. It must be noted that in order to actually examine the following planned measures actually in the development plans, additional assessments must be conducted, and a methodology for taking a GHG inventory must be developed. No decisions have been made regarding the potential application of the above planned measures. A climate and energy committee was established on 11 July 2019 in order to agree upon suitable measures for meeting the targets, and the first meeting of the committee the best solutions for Estonia, have been planned to continue until the approval of the state budget strategy in spring 2020. The connection between the measures and GHG reductions is provided in Annex III, and a more detailed description of the measures can be found in Annex V of the plan. As the result of the application of existing and additional measures, it would be possible to reduce GHG emissions by as much as a quarter in the sectors covered in the plan in the period 2020-2030. Table 20 Reduction of GHG emissions by sector according to the scenario under the additional 2020-2030 measures. 2020, GHG emission Mt CO2ekv (incl LULUCF) Sectors 2030, GHG emission Mt Change, % 10.9 ENERGY 6.6 40% 2.1 TRANSPORT 1.7 19% 1.4 AGRICULTURE 1.6 -14% -1.4 LULUCF -0.2 -600% 0.3 WASTE,  0.2 33% 0.7 INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES 0.7 0% 14 TOTAL 10.5 25% Policies and measures for achieving the target under the Effort Sharing Regulation Measures across sectors with GHG emissions reduction potential The following describes the existing and envisaged cross-sectoral policies and measures for the reduction of GHG emissions. The existing cross-sectoral policies and measures with GHG reduction potential in the LULUCF and agricultural sector are: PM3 Support for climate-friendly and environmentally sustainable agricultural practices,  PM6  Natura 2000 support for agricultural land PM10  Converting arable land on peat soils to permanent grassland The existing cross-sectoral policies and measures with GHG reduction potential in the energy and agricultural sectors are: PM7 Investments for the diversification of economic activities in rural areas through a shift towards non-agricultural activities; and PM8 Investments to enhance the performance of farms. The planned cross- sectoral policies and measures with GHG reduction potential in the energy, transport and agricultural sectors are: PM11 The production of bioenergy and increasing its share in agriculture Measures in the business, public and housing sectors Measures to be considered in the housing and business and public sectors are mainly related to energy savings achieved through the reconstruction of buildings. The following are the main existing measures that influence GHG emissions: HF1 The reconstruction of public sector79 and commercial buildings; HF2 The reconstruction of private residences and apartment buildings; and HF3 The establishment of minimum requirements for nearly zero-energy buildings. The implementation of various additional measures is still under discussion or the release of additional funding for their implementation is anticipated (these are measures planned within the meaning of ANNEX IV). Such measures include: HF4 Investments in the street lighting reconstruction program; HF5 Additional reconstruction of public sector and commercial buildings; HF6 Additional reconstruction of private residences and apartment buildings. Measures in the heating sector The main existing measure that impacts the GHG emissions of the heating sector is: EN3 Development of the heating sector The implementation of various additional measures is still under discussion or the release of additional funding for their implementation is anticipated (these are measures planned within the meaning of ANNEX IV). One such measure is: EN4 Additional development of the heating sector Measures in the transport sector The main existing measures that impact the GHG emissions of the transport sector are: TR1 Increasing the share of biofuels in the transport sector; TR2 Increasing the fuel efficiency of the transport sector; TR3 The promotion of sustainable driving; TR4 Spatial and land use measures in cities to increase the fuel-efficiency of transport and enhancement of the transportation system; TR5 The development of convenient and modern public transport; TR6 Time-based road usage fees for heavy-duty vehicles. The implementation of the following additional measures is still under discussion (these are planned measures within the meaning of ANNEX IV). TR7 Support for purchasing electric vehicles; TR8 Additional enhancement of fuel-efficient driving; TR9 Additional spatial and land use measures in cities to increase the fuel-efficiency of urban transport and the effectiveness of the transportation system;                                                            79 Central government and local government buildings TR10 Additional activities for the development of convenient and modern public transport; TR11 Establishment of mileage-based road usage fees for heavy-duty vehicles; TR12 Tyres and aerodynamics of vehicles; TR13 Development of railway infrastructure (incl construction of Rail Baltic) TR14 Electrification of railways; TR15 Electrification of ferries. The studies carried out in 2018 to ascertain the most cost-effective measures for tax measures. The following measures are under discussion and will require additional study. TR16 Transition to public transport powered by biomethane and electricity Measures in the industrial processes and product use sector The main measure for reducing GHG emissions in the industrial processes and product use sector is: TÖ1 Prohibitions, restrictions and obligations arising from Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases and Directive 2006/40/EC relating to emissions from air conditioning systems in motor vehicles Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases (which entered into force on 1 January 2015) establishes a timetable for the gradual reduction of F-gases by 2030 that will be implemented through the application of a system of credits and through prohibitions and restrictions. In Estonia this measure is also supported through the project-based promotion of alternative natural and low GWP-content refrigerants, taking into consideration the prohibitions and restrictions arising from Regulation (EU) No 517/2014. The project-based promotion of alternative natural and low-GWP refrigerants consists of three activities:  To ensure that Estonian refrigeration technicians are able to acquire the knowledge required to work with the new technologies and substances (CO2, NH3, HCs) from 2020. The Estonian educational and vocational system will be adjusted to the new requirements, and in-service training will be provided to employees already operating in the market;  Additional measures will help prevent investments in technologies based on high GWP refrigerants that fall under strict restrictions, and the collection and recycling of these substances at the highest possible volumes will be ensured; and  It will be ensured that target groups are aware of the restrictions and prohibitions and technological opportunities arising from Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council, which will enter into force of in 2020, and that they can, if necessary, obtain assistance with the solution of technical problems and in making decisions regarding choices between different technologies. The above activities will serve to support and amplify the impact of Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 and other national legislation. These activities are still in the early phases, and it is therefore not possible to assess their impact separately from the impacts of Regulation (EU) 517/2014. Under Directive 2006/40/EC, from 1 January 2017 it is forbidden to sell new EU type-approval passenger cars, pick-up trucks and vans with air-conditioning systems that contain refrigerant with a global warming potential that is greater than 150. Estonia has not established significantly more stringent requirements than those laid down in Regulation 517/2014 and Directive 2006/40/EC. Measures in the agricultural sector In order to achieve the desired limitation and reduction of the GHG emissions of the agricultural sector, the following existing measures of the Estonian Rural Development Plan (ERDP) for 2014-tigation and climate change adaptation action plan for 2012-- PM1 Organic farming; PM2 The Agri-environment-climate measure and its sub-measures; PM4 Knowledge transfer and notification; PM5 Advisory services, farm management and farm relief services; and PM9 Animal welfare. The studies carried out in 2018 and 2019 to find the most cost-effective measures to fulfil the Estonian climate targets80 and analyse the opportunities to raise climate ambition in Estonia81 also presented the following measures. The measures listed below are under discussion and thus their impact is not taken into account in the GHG projections provided in Chapter 5. PM12 Improvement of the quality of feed for dairy cows; PM13 Increasing the share of grazing on grassland; PM14 Zero tillage; PM15 Winter plant cover; PM16 Precision fertilisation; and PM17 Replacing inorganic fertilisers with organic fertilisers; PM18 Investments in energy savings in greenhouses and vegetable warehouses and in introducing renewable energy therein; PM19 The neutralisation of acidic soils; PM20 The improvement of manure management; PM21 Audits in larger farms; PM22 Research and pilot projects.                                                            80 Report on ascertaining the most cost-effective measures for achieving the targets of the climate policy and Shared Effort Regulation in Estonia, 2018: https://www.kik.ee/sites/default/files/aruanne_kliimapoliitika_kulutohusus_final.pdf 81 Analysis of the opportunities for raising climate ambition in Estonia, 2019: https://www.sei.org/wp- content/uploads/2019/10/eesti-kliimaambitsiooni-t%C3%B5stmise-v%C3%B5imaluste- anal%C3%BC%C3%BCs-1.pdf  The agricultural and fishery sector development plan for the next decade, 2021-2030, which is currently being prepared, aims to create a joint strategic development document for the sectors and develop the program, measures and activities required for its implementation. It is anticipated that the development plan will be submitted to the Estonian government for approval at the end of 2019. One of the general targets of the EU common agricultural policy strategic plan 2021-2027 is to enhance environment protection and climate measures and contribute to European Union environmental and climate objectives. Measures in the waste sector The general waste-related requirements and rules are laid down in the Waste Act, which includes the following measure applied for limiting and reducing the GHG emissions: JM1 Restricting the proportion of biodegradable waste being landfilled and increasing the volume of reuse and recycling of waste materials As laid down in the Local Government Organisation Act, local governments are tasked with establishing waste management rules, as well as approving and updating a waste plan. According to the waste plans approved by the majority of local governments, incineration of waste is prohibited.  JM2 Reducing landfilled waste (incl. biodegradable waste) The national waste plan 2014-2020 aims to introduce sustainable waste management based on a waste hierarchy that primarily focuses on modern product design, clean and resource-efficient manufacturing and the recycling of manufactured materials. Emphasis is also placed on reducing the volume of hazardous substances in materials and products. The national waste plan covers the following measures to limit and reduce GHG emissions: JM3 Promoting the prevention and reduction of waste generation, incl reducing the hazardousness of waste; and JM4 Reducing environmental risks from waste and improving monitoring and supervision. In 2013 AS Eesti Energia finished building the modern and efficient Iru Power Plant, which produces heat and electricity from mixed municipal waste. Completion of the waste-to-energy plant has reduced the extensive amount of mixed municipal waste that was landfilled. Based on the estimation of the Action plan 2013-2030 for reducing air pollutant emissions from the Iru Plant, a total of 250 000 tons of mixed municipal waste is used to producing energy every year. The Iru cogeneration plant mainly incinerates Estonian mixed municipal waste, to which imported waste fuel is added in order to reach the annual target volume of 250 000 tonnes. Circular economy The objective of the circular economy is to decouple economic activity from the consumption of primary raw materials by creating a system of circular production and consumption in which losses are as low as possible. The transition to the circular economy requires changes to be made in the entire product value chain, from product design to new business models and consumption habits. In the case of new and existing products, the main focus is on designing the entire life cycle, focusing on selecting sustainable materials (avoiding or reducing hazardous substances), quality (long product life, offering the option of repair), optimisation of the supply chain (giving preference to local raw materials) and reuse and recovery (the opportunity to separate and recycle components). In addition to smart design solutions, research and development, eco-innovation, technological development and the sharing economy also play an important role.  The circular economy is a cross-sectoral principle, and hence cooperation between companies and international agreements, which create significant new opportunities for establishing new markets and partnerships, are of great importance. The role of the national government in the transition to a circular economy lines in creating favourable conditions for applying the principles of the circular economy and in removing barriers. For the circular economy to achieve its full potential, systemic thinking is required, and changes must be made in the entire socio-economic system, so that real changes in consumption, production, planning, policy, lifestyle, culture and values may take place. The circular economy makes a direct contribution to the reduction of GHG emissions, for example via more resource-efficient production and consumption, extending the lifetime of products, innovative business models that reduce dependency on primary raw materials or the development of waste management and recycling, thereby reducing the need to produce new products and materials. action plan by the end of 2021 under the leadership of the Ministry of the Environment in order to accelerate the transition to a more circular Estonia. Preparation of the development document and the action plan is planned to take place through cooperation that would involve all parties. The preparation of the development document and action plan will be divided into the following two phases: 1. Studies: development of the indicators pertaining to the circular economy and mapping of the current situation of the Estonian circular economy (2019-2020) 2. Preparation of the development document and action plan (2021) 3. Involvement of stakeholders throughout the entire process The Environmental Investment Centre supports the implementation of circular economy solutions via the Circular Economy Program. The objective of the circular economy program is to support research and development in the areas of environmental management, waste, subsoil, chemicals and related topics, the more efficient use of resources, the introduction of the principles of the circular economy, means to prevent generating waste and emissions, and the reduction of the environmental impact of these activities, raising awareness in the area of the circular economy and the development and broader application of sustainable consumption and production. Policies and measures to achieve the target under the LULUCF regulation. The Forest Act provides the legal framework for managing Estonian forests. The main objective of the Forest Act is to ensure the protection and sustainable management of the forest ecosystem. The Forest Act includes the reforestation measure, which aims to help forests recover after logging or a natural disaster. Under the Forest Act, forest owners are required to ensure reforestation within five years at the latest after logging or a natural disaster. Supporting prompt reforestation after logging favours consistent carbon capture in woodlands, and hence the preservation of the GHG capture level of Estonian forests. Riigikogu in 2011, is the official sustainable development strategy of the Estonian forestry sector. It lays down the forestry targets for 2011-2020 and describes the measures and resources required to achieve those targets. The main objective of the development plan is to ensure the productivity and viability of the forests, as well as their diverse and efficient use. One objective is to increase forest growth and the capacity for carbon capture via the appropriate forest management activities such as regeneration cutting, cleaning and thinning. The Ministry of the Environment began to draw up the Forestry development plan 2021-2030 in December 2017 by forming the required working group for compiling the terms of reference of the development plan. The task of the working group is to determine the forestry issues that need to be solved and draw up the terms of reference. Once the terms of reference have been prepared, the Ministry of the Environment will coordinate these with stakeholders and other ministries. The guidelines for the forestry sector that are set out in GPCP 2050 are taken into consideration when a new development plan is drawn up. The forestry development plan 2021-2030 will be submitted to the Riigikogu for adoption in May 2020. The future role of the LULUCF sector as either capturer or source of GHGs mainly depends on the management-related activities, but also on the use of peat soil and arable land and grassland management methods. The government has set the objective to increase use of timber since the age structure of Estonian forests enables more large-scale logging (12-15 million cubic meters per year), and failure to use the forest resources would be an unreasonable waste of renewable energy. The Estonian Rural Development Plan 2014-2020 supports the achievement of h which the measures for supporting private forestry are co-financed. The objective of the Rural Development Plan 2014-2020 is to support Estonian rural life by supplementing other measures set out in the EU Common Agricultural Policy, the Cohesion Policy and the European Common Fisheries Policy. The Ministry of Rural Affairs also wishes to help increase the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, enhance the sustainable use of natural resources and advance climate measures via implementation of the development plan. The Rural Development Plan is implemented through measures that are based on the needs and objectives detected during preparation of the development plan. A total of more than 20 (sub-)measures will be implemented within the framework of the development plan. Measures related to forest management -2020 cover the following existing measures, and their aim is to ensure the sustainable use of forests, i.e. increase the scope of the  MM1 In order to alleviate climate change, increasing the net growth of forests and their carbon capture capability via timely reforestation MM2 Promoting reforestation of managed private forests with habitat type compatible tree species MM3 Improving forest health and avoiding the spread of dangerous negative factors MM4 Reducing the environmental impacts related to the use of fossil fuels and non-renewable natural resources by increasing Estonian timber production and use MM5 Natura 2000 support for private forested land MM6 Investments in forest development and improvement of the viability of forests MM7 Ensuring the protection of habitats MM8 Conservation of biological processes and maintenance of species common in Estonia ii. Regional cooperation in this area, where applicable. The Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) have cooperated on several climate-related projects. A network of greenhouse gas inventory and projection experts has been established between the three Baltic States, with the aim of raising the quality of various GHG reports via knowledge and experience sharing. The project ended in 2017 but the cooperation between the experts continued even after it had ended. In recent years, close cooperation has taken place between experts in the LULUCF sector in the Baltic States to share information about relevant research in the area of forest management and the carbon capture of forests and possible new methods. A new project proposal for the improvement of datasets and methods and increasing capacity related to the implementation of the LULUCF regulation has been prepared through cooperation between the three countries. The objective of the project is to facilitate knowledge transfer between national and international experts regarding current approaches, models and databases for assessing the impacts of mitigation measures and data reporting. The project contributes to the enhancement of the Baltic gies in the LULUCF sector. This would also make it possible to increase the coherence and consistency of the Baltic land use policy between the LULUCF regulation, the EU Common Agricultural Policy and other relevant policies. In connection with the preparation of the national forestry accounting plan (FRL) 2021-2025, a regular exchange of information has taken place among colleagues from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and that will also continue during the preparation of the FRL 2026-2030. An Estonian-Latvian joint seminar on modelling the agriculture and land use sectors and reducing GHG emissions in agriculture took place in 2018. Both countries presented national measures applied in the agricultural sector as well as potential planned measures, including national cost-efficiency studies. iii. Without prejudice to the applicability of State aid rules, financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds, in this area at national level, where applicable European Union support and Union funds have been used and are planned to be used in the following existing and additional measures: EN3 Development of the heating sector EN4 Additional development of the heating sector EN11 Synchronisation of the Baltic electricity system with the synchronous areas of Continental Europe TR1 Increasing the share of biofuels in the transport sector; TR4 Spatial and land use measures in cities to increase the fuel-efficiency of transport and improve the transportation system TR9 Additional spatial and land use measures in cities to increase the fuel-efficiency of transport and improve the transportation system TR13 Development of railway infrastructure (incl. construction of Rail Baltic) HF1 Reconstruction of public sector and commercial buildings HF2 Reconstruction of private residences and apartment buildings HF5 Additional reconstruction of public sector and commercial buildings HF6  Additional reconstruction of private residences and apartment buildings PM1 Organic farming PM2 The agri-environment-climate measure and its sub-measures; PM3 Support for climate-friendly and environmentally-sustainable agricultural practices, so-called greening support PM4 Knowledge transfer and notification PM5 Advisory services, farm management and farm relief services PM6  Natura 2000 support for agricultural land PM7 Investments in the diversification of economic activities in rural areas towards non-agricultural activities PM8 Investments in raising the effectiveness of farms. PM9 Animal welfare measure MM5  Natura 2000 support for private forest estates MM6  Investments in forest development and improvement of the viability of forests   Renewables i. Policies and measures to achieve the national contribution to the binding 2030 Union target for renewable energy and trajectories as referred to in point (a)(2) Article 4, and, where applicable or available, the elements referred to in point 2.1.2 of this Annex, including sector- and technology-specific measures82. The NDPES 2030 document describes different measures for achieving the renewable energy targets described in the action plan. The following NDPES 2030 measures contribute most directly to the increase in the use of renewable energy:  Measure 1.1 Development of electricity production;  Measure 1.5 Efficient heat generation;  Measure 2.1 Increasing the availability of alternative fuels in transport; In order to achieve the targets described in chapter 2.1.2, the following measures will be applied, a detailed description of which is provided in Annex IV of this document: EN1 Renewable energy support and support for efficient cogeneration of heat and power; EN3 Development of the heating sector; EN4 Additional development of the heating sector; EN5 Renewable energy support via reverse auction (technology neutral); EN6 Renewable energy support via reverse auction (technology specific); EN7 Research and development activities program of the energy development plan; TR7 Aid for the purchase of electric vehicles; TR16 Transition to using biomethane and electricity for propulsion in public transport TR13 Development of railway infrastructure (incl. construction of Rail Baltic); TR14 Electrification of railways; TR15 Electrification of ferries. PM11 Production of bioenergy and increasing its share in agriculture ii. Where relevant, specific measures for regional cooperation, as well as, as an option, the estimated excess production of energy from renewable sources which could be transferred to other Member States in order to achieve the national contribution and trajectories referred to in point 2.1.2 For the additional achievement of the targets described in Chapter 2.1.2 (raising the share of renewable electrical energy to 50% by 2030 if the collaborative mechanisms with other Member States are implemented), preparations will be made, and a measure is foreseen to support this; its description is provided in an annex to this document (see Annex IV);                                                            82 When planning these measures, Member States shall take into account the end of life of existing installations and the potential for repowering.  EN2 Support for investments in wind farms In order to implement collaborative mechanisms and map opportunities in Estonia, an expert group on renewable energy consisting of the representatives of ministries and market participants who also deal with statistical trading has been convened. The expert group mapped a list of possible cooperating countries, and an overview of the countries that are actively seeking opportunities for statistical trading to support the development of renewable energy will also be prepared. Lists of joint projects and measures, offering a clear overview of the projects that Estonia can offer to other Member States with regard to the targets for the upcoming period, will also be mapped. Coordination between ministries to find solutions to administrative problems will also be promoted. Considering the favourable wind conditions, the availability of biomass and the volume of completed projects in Estonia, local operators that develop renewable energy have excellent opportunities for developing renewable energy production units through flexible cooperation mechanisms. More than 4 GW of wind farms on shore and in coastal waters are now in the development stage in Estonia. The completion dates for these wind farms depend largely on the mitigation of defence restrictions, which mainly involve altitude constraints on land and on the establishment of the plan for the marine area, which will presumably be carried out by the end of 2020. The figure below depicts the preliminary plan for the Estonian marine area, on which the blue hatched areas are potential areas suitable for the development of wind energy, the dark lines mark the borders of the marine area, and the earlier planning areas are marked with a red background. The potential of earlier planning areas is ca 3 GW.  Figure 13 Preliminary plan for the Estonian marine area. After the mitigation of the restrictions, the potential for wind energy development is 300 MW in Eastern Estonia and 850 MW in Western Estonia. The potential of the marine area as a whole is in the is roughly 7 000 MW83  Area No 1: ca 3 000 MW  Area No 2: ca 4 000 MW  Area No 3: ca 150 MW This is an initial indication, since much depends on the overlap between these areas, on wind shadows, on buffer areas between different developments and on the advance of technology. Regarding overlapping, it will be possible to realise 60-70% of the areas highlighted in the plan for the marine area. The potential of the given areas has been determined on the basis of current technology, a distance of ca 1 km between windmills, and the size of the areas in question. 1 GW of renewable energy capacities may be added to the wind energy area by 2030, according to projections. Two pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations (hereinafter PHES) with a total capacity of 550 MW are under development in Estonia, and there is potential for renewable energy production from biomass. Considering that Estonia intends to build new primarily market-based electricity generation capacities through the implementation increase energy security by using electricity generation capacities that are mainly based on domestic primary energy resources or building fuel free electricity production capacities in Estonia, support will be granted for the realisation of projects that are in line with the above principles. iii. Specific measures on financial support, where applicable, including Union support and the use of Union funds, for the promotion of the production and use of energy from renewable sources in electricity, heating and cooling, and transport The NDPES 2030 document specifies different measures for achieving the renewable energy targets described in the action plan. The following measures of NDPES 2030 contribute most directly to the increase in the use of renewable energy:  Measure 1.1 Development of electrical energy generation;  Measure 1.5 Efficient heat generation;  Measure 2.1 Increasing the application of alternative fuels in transport. The following measures will be applied to achieve the targets described in chapter 2.1.2, a detailed description of which is provided in Annex V to this document: Existing measures EN1 Renewable energy support and support for efficient heat and power cogeneration Support is paid for the electricity that is generated from renewable energy sources, in cogeneration mode from biomass or in efficient cogeneration mode.  EN5 Renewable energy support via reverse auction (technology neutral)                                                            83 Map of the preliminary plan: http://mereala.hendrikson.ee/eskiislahendus.html The objective of this measure is to increase the share of renewable energy through reverse auctions. The volume and schedule of the auctions is correlated with the trajectories of meeting the renewable energy targets. The following is the schedule of announcement of auctions: Year announcement of auction Volume of auction 2019 5 GWh 2020 5 GWh 2021 450 + 5 GWh 2023 650 GWh  EN3 Development of heating sector This measure covers the transition from fuel oils to renewable energy, the reduction of heat losses in district heating networks and the transformation of inefficiently operating district heating networks into communal district heating systems and local heating systems. TR1 Increasing the share of biofuels in the transport sector; The objective of the measure is to achieve a 10% share of biofuels in the transport sector by 2020. To achieve this, a blending obligation was established for liquid fuels and the share of the biomethane use in the transport sector will be increased. TR7 Support for purchasing electric vehicles The objective of the purchasing support is to increase the use of electrical cars. This measure primarily supports the acquisition of vehicles with higher mileage (business vehicles, incl. vans). Possible additional measures (envisaged) EN6 Renewable energy support via reverse auction (technology specific) The objective of the measure is to increase competition in the generation of electrical energy from renewable energy source via technology-specific reverse auctions.  EN4 Additional development of the heating sector This measure covers additional reconstructions of boiler houses and heating networks and additional support for customers to transition to district and local heating systems. TR16 Transition of public transport to biomethane and electricity The objective of the measure is to meet the objectives of the renewable energy and clean vehicle directive by introducing electric buses in urban regions and gas-powered buses that use biomethane as fuel in rural areas and thereby also reduce GHG emissions in the transport sector. TR13 Development of railway infrastructure (incl. construction of Rail Baltic) The objective of the measure is to make the shift towards increasing the use of public transport and non-motorised means of transport, and also managing and reducing demand. TR14 Electrification of railways The electrification of railways aims to develop an environmentally friendly means of transport by increasing the competitiveness of rail transport while at the same time also directing some cargo from the roads to the railways. By making the carriage of goods by safer and more environmentally-friendly environment. TR15 Electrification of ferries The objective of the measure is to electrify the ferries between the mainland and the islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa. This is technically achievable up to 50% for the connection with Hiiumaa and 100% for Saaremaa. The carbon reduction potential of the measure from 2023 would be: on the Saaremaa line - 8072 t CO2/yr; on the Hiiumaa line - 4120 t CO2/yr. The total reduction would amount to 110 000 t CO2 by 2030. EN7 Research and development activities programme under the energy development plan Projects and activities that contribute to the implementation of the energy sector development plan, and thereby also to the promotion of renewable energy, will be implemented under the programme. PM8 Investments to increase the effectiveness of farms The objective of this measure is to support the production of heat and electricity from biogas. PM11 Bioenergy production and increasing its share in agriculture. The objective of the measure is to increase biomethane production on farms, where the objective is to produce biogas from manure, including slurry, that could replace the use of fossil fuels in energy and transport. The emphasis is on smaller investments. PM18 Investments in energy savings in greenhouses and vegetable warehouses and in the introduction of renewable energy therein The objective of the measure is to increase the share of renewable energy in horticulture and to increase energy savings through the introduction of modern technologies (cogeneration, solar panels, new covered areas). EN12 The acquisition of air surveillance radars for the development of wind farms Altitude constraints arising from national defence considerations are in force in large parts of Estonian on-shore and offshore areas (the constraints are stricter in north-eastern Estonia, south-eastern Estonia and western Estonia). One possible solution could be to invest in additional pre-warning systems and through these exempt the areas suitable for building wind farms from the altitude constraints imposed by national defence considerations. National defence air surveillance radars and radio systems are among the pre-warning systems that are necessary for ensuring early detection, and the same applies to Police and Border Guard radars. The objective of the measure is to support the development of wind energy by acquiring pre-warning radars, in order to promote the development of renewable energy in Estonia. For some regions, one possible solution would be to invest in additional compensatory measures and thereby release the areas suitable for building wind farms by exempting them from the altitude constraints dictated by national defence considerations. EN13 Pre-development of offshore wind farms (connection, planning), joint projects In order to build offshore wind farms, developers need to make significant expenditures even before it is clear whether it will be possible to build a wind farm in the desired area. For example, it may transpire that the area in question needs to be reserved for nature preservation. The high risks increase the price of renewable energy for society and deter potential developers. Possible solutions include national government activities for the pre-development of offshore wind farms (e.g. carrying out the necessary planning proceedings, establishing a connection to the power grid). It would primarily be feasible for the national government to consider such pre-development in joint projects with other countries (e.g. Latvia). In addition to the measures set out in Annex IV of this document that either have a financial contribution or a regulative character, Estonia also implements other activities that may be classified as measures supporting renewable energy: Ongoing studies and analyses or those that will be carried out in the near future An , the aim of which is to analyse the instruments of the financial benefit (local benefit) in the local authorities and local communities in which the company operates, in order to analyse the impact of regularising agreements on the attitudes of the parties in the event of the realisation of local benefit and to find possible alternative legal solutions to problems. The objective should be to achieve equal treatment, legal certainty, transparency of agreements and the maintenance of the possibility of entering into flexible agreements appropriate for all parties. Preparation of a manual of proceedings pertaining to renewable energy projects, with the objective of making the so-called manual of proceedings available to the project developers and persons who wish to invest in renewable energy, in order to facilitate understanding of the proceedings. The analysis of the opportunities to increase climate ambition in Estonia, which has the aim of determining the probable measures and attendant effects that could help Estonia to get from the current greenhouse gas reduction target of 80% by 2050 to the target of a 100% reduction and achieve zero net emissions or neutrality. Other measures/actions that support the generation of renewable energy In addition to monetary support measures for Estonia to acquire new electricity generation capacities based on renewable energy, state support must be provided to developers, and solutions must be found for potential problems. For example, the obstacles to the development of wind energy are mainly associated with national defence and environmental constraints, the opposition of local people and the resulting development risks. In order to alleviate these bottlenecks, different ministries and authorities must cooperate. The ministry responsible for the sector sent a letter to local governments that invited them to consider opportunities for planning areas for generating energy during preparation of the comprehensive plan. In Estonian conditions this primarily means planning areas that would be suitable mainly for the development of wind and solar energy. The importance of the role of local governments in developing renewable energy in the broader context of achieving the joint national renewable energy targets was emphasised. Motivating local governments and the local community Analysis of benefit that renewable energy production units bring that should, as it were, compensate for the possible disturbances, e.g. visual pollution, noise disturbances, and the NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) effect. In addition to the study, visits to local governments and engagement in legislative processes are also foreseen, in order to introduce the amendments, obligations and targets arising from new directives. Relaxing national defence constraints. All countries that develop wind energy have been exposed to disturbances caused by wind farms to the operation of air surveillance radars. Altitude constraints that arise from national defence considerations are in effect on most of the territory of Estonia. These altitude constraints can be relaxed through investments in additional compensatory measures (e.g. radar and radio reconnaissance systems). Nature conservation restrictions and the relaxation of such restrictions. The construction of any production facility in the natural environment involves some impact, but is important to bear in mind that nature conservation restrictions and established nature conservation areas should not automatically rule out renewable energy generation in that area. It is important to find so-called areas of compromise. Planning of the Estonian marine area Planning of the Estonian marine area is currently under way, and its aim is to reach agreement on the use of the Estonian marine area in the long term, in order to promote the marine economy and contribute to the achievement and preservation of the good environmental condition of the marine environment. The marine area plan is prepared as a thematic plan for the whole marine area of Estonia, as part of the plan for the  During development of the marine area plan, the synergy between the activities that are already taking place today and those that are planned for the future in the marine area are assessed, and the environmental and also economic, social and cultural impacts involved with the implementation of these activities is assessed. The established marine area plan will serve as the basis for making different decisions on the future use of the marine area (see Figure 13, marine area plan). Possible joint projects, e.g. a joint offshore wind farm We see great potential in joint projects with other Member States. One of the most interesting such projects would be a joint project with Latvia that would help both countries to achieve their renewable energy targets. Two prospective locations for developing joint projects are the Gulf of Riga and the area west of Saaremaa (see Figure 13, areas No 1 and 2). These areas are large enough to build a roughly 1 000 MW wind farm, and also hold potential for building an infrastructure network with support from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), which would also increase the security of supply of the Estonian electrical system, and higher interconnection capacities with the southern neighbouring. The Latvian marine area planning solution also includes potential locations for joint projects with Estonia. The potential of offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea is estimated to be 93.5 GW, incl. 7 GW in the Estonian marine area84. Future energy solutions Of clean energy technologies, the Estonian private sector plans to build pumped-                                                           84 EUROPEAN COMMISSION DG ENERGY 2019 STUDY ON BALTIC OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY COOPERATION UNDER BEMIP Final Report storage hydroelectric power stations in Paldiski (500 MW)85 and at the Estonia mine (50 MW)86. In Finland, ground source heat pumps are popular for heating both private dwellings and logistics and shopping centres. A pilot project of 6.4 km and 3.3 km deep boreholes in Espoo which would aim to use geothermal energy for district heating, with a capacity of 40 MWth87, was analysed during 2019. Based on the example of the Finnish experience with geothermal energy, heating elements 88 (e.g. solid oxide fuel cell SOFC)89, etc., will make it possible to start planning future energy solutions in the next decade. iv. Where applicable, the assessment of the support for electricity from renewable sources carried out pursuant to Article 6(4) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 According to Section 594(1) of the Electricity Market Act (EMA), support will be granted to electricity producers to achieve the renewable energy source electricity production target (17.6%) by 31 December 2020. By its decision, the Riigikogu will approve the targets for renewable energy source electricity production after 2020, and the changes to the principles for achieving those targets. The Government of the Republic will develop the relevant principles and will submit these to the Riigikogu for approval at the latest three months before the relevant decision is expected to be made by the Riigikogu. The Estonian support scheme was amended in June 2018 when the current direct support was replaced by a scheme based on reverse auction. The state has established ble 90. The domestic target for 2030 is determined in the NDPES 2030 document (30%), but based on the specified projections and renewable energy production trajectories, we would set the target at 40% (see Chapter 2.1.2.). The NDPES 2030 also establishes 50% as the target for electricity production from renewable energy sources, but this target is set provided that the statistical transfers performed with other countries become operational and that the joint projects are realised. The existing support scheme allows the state to find in a flexible and cost-effective manner electricity producers whose production helps contribute to the target of electrical energy produced from renewable energy sources. The proposal of the Government of the Republic to the Riigikogu for setting the targets and mechanisms for reaching the targets enables the state to find a more expedient way to meet the targets. The Estonian government periodically organises analyses that examine the changes in the principles of the support scheme and, if necessary, it makes a proposal to the Riigikogu                                                            85 Paldiski gets different kind of power station https://majandus24.postimees.ee/6139227/paldiski-saab- teistsorti-elektrijaama 86 https://www.err.ee/857972/estonia- kaevandusse- kavandatakse- pumphudroelektrijaama 87 Jarmo Kallio 2019 Geothermal Energy Use, Country Update for Finland http://europeangeothermalcongress.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CUR-10-Finland.pdf 88 Fuel Cells Hydrogen Europe 89 Solid Oxide Cells https://elcogen.com/products/solid-oxide-fuel-cells/ 90 https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/taastuvenergia_tegevuskava.pdf for changing the mechanisms of the support scheme. As the result of the scheme that has functioned since 2007, in 2017 the level of electricity from renewable energy reached 16.8% of total electricity consumption. The dynamics of electricity production from renewable energy sources are provided in  Figure 14 below.   Objective  RES-E production, 2007-2020 (GWh/year)  Figure 14 Electricity production from renewable energy sources, 2007-2020, GWh/yr As projected, the dotted lined volumes in the figure are produced with production equipment that qualified under the old support scheme. A total of 158 GWh of additional electricity from renewable energy sources will be placed on the market by 2020, fully  Considering the NDPES 2030 target (30% RES-E), production capacities that produce electricity of 2.56 TWh/yr from renewable energy sources must be placed on the market by 2030. According to the Electricity Market Act, the Government of the Republic will organise a reverse auction if the State does not meet the target for electricity produced from the renewable energy source. The person who offers their production with the lowest support rate will win the reverse auction. v. Specific measures to introduce one or more contact points, streamline administrative procedures, provide information and training, and facilitate the uptake of power purchase agreements91 Under the Electricity Market Act, connection conditions are facilitated for connecting to the grid power generation equipment using renewable energy sources and with a capacity of under 15 kW. Electricity producers also do not require an activity licence if the net capacity of the production equipment is below 200 kW. vi. Assessment of the necessity to build new infrastructure for district heating and cooling produced from renewable sources. Efficient thermal -92, and in the course of its implementation local governments received help in analysing the efficiency of district heating systems and future needs. Based on the analysis, it may generally be claimed that it would be more profitable to reconstruct the existing district heating infrastructure than to build a new local heating system in its place. Today new residential areas are mainly connected to district heating regions. The perspective regions for the district cooling in Estonia are downtown Tallinn and Tartu. There are two district cooling stations operating in Tartu  the downtown 13 MW district cooling station and the Aardla 5.4 MW district cooling station. The total length of the district cooling route is 2.9 km. vii. Where applicable, specific measures on the promotion of the use of energy from biomass. This chapter describes the availability of biomass resources, including both domestic potential and also imports from third countries. Different biomass uses by other sectors (agriculture and forest-based sectors) as well as measures for the sustainability production and use of biomass are also examined. The NDPES 2030 document describes different measures for achieving the renewable energy targets described in the development plan. NDPES w biomass resources. The measures listed in the table of measures in Annex III and IV of this document also help to increase the use of biomass: EN1 Renewable energy support and support for efficient cogeneration of heat and power TR1 Increasing the share of biofuels in the transport sector PM8 Investments to enhance the effectiveness of farms                                                            91 Executive summary of the policies and measures under the support framework that the Member States are required to adapt under Sections 21(6) and 22(5) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, with the objective of promoting and facilitating the development of the self-consumption of renewable energy and renewable energy communities (facilitate the uptake of power purchase agreements). 92 https://www.struktuurifondid.ee/sites/default/files/rakenduskava.pdf PM11 Production of bioenergy and increasing the share of bioenergy in agriculture The generation of energy from biomass takes into account the biomass sustainability criteria, waste hierarchy, and the principles of sustainable forestry management by preserving natural diversity.  Other elements of the dimension i. If applicable, national policies and measures affecting the EU ETS sector and assessment of the complementarity and impacts on the EU ETS. In Estonia the production of electricity and oil from oil shale is the largest participant and influencer in the EU ETS. Taking into consideration existing and known future environmental requirements and climate targets, once the production facilities become depreciated, it will be possible to produce a certain amount of liquid fuel from oil shale and thereby in turn use the by-products of production and waste heat to generate electricity. The profitability of producing liquid fuels from oil shale primarily depends on the world market prices of crude oil but also on EU ETS unit prices and local environmental charges. The international quality requirements for fuel are also important influencers (e.g. restrictions on sulphur content). The quality of oil shale oil may be improved via pre-refining. The investment required for building such a pre-refining plant amounts to EUR 650 million. In order to ensure the long-Development Plan for the Use of Oil Shale 2016-designates the trends in the use of oil shale as a nationally strategic domestic energy source. Planning covers the assessment of the use of shale oil and shale gas by considering the economic, social, security and environmental protection aspects. The Riigikogu approved the development plan in March 2016. In addition to developments in the oil shale industry (incl. more efficient use of oil shale), excise duties and also environmental charges for electricity and fuels influence the reduction in emissions. Excise duties Fuels with imposed excise duty93 include unleaded petrol, leaded petrol, aviation gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, special-purpose diesel fuel, light fuel oil, heavy fuel oil, oil shale heating oil, car gas (LPG) and (CNG), coal, lignite, coke and oil shale, liquefied gas, natural gas, fuel-like product, liquefied combustible and biofuel. Biogas, including also biomethane, is exempt from the excise duty. To ensure the competitiveness of energy-intensive users, Estonia has introduced excise duty differences. Electricity-intensive companies and those with intensive gas consumption can submit an management system must comply with the EVS-EN ISO 50001 standard in order to apply for the permission. For electricity-intensive companies that hold a permit for exemption from the excise duty on energy, the rate of excise duty for electrical energy is                                                            93 Alcohol, Tobacco, Fuel and Electricity Excise Duty Act https://www.riigiteataia.ee/akt/120062019003 EUR 0.5 / MW/h of electricity. For companies that hold a permit for exemption from the excise duty on energy, the rate of the preferential excise duty for natural gas is EUR 11.30 / 1000 m3 of natural gas. Environmental charges Another fiscal measure that impacts the emissions applied in Estonia is environmental charges. The tax policy of the Government of the Republic is based on the target of reducing environmental impacts by increasing emission charges and charges for the use of natural resources. The Environmental Charges Act creates a basis for establishing the rates for charges for the use of natural resources and emission charges, establishes the procedure for their calculation and payment and prescribes the basis and specific purposes for the use of budgetary income obtained from the use of the environment. Environmental charges are established in accordance with the need for down by law these are also based on the value created by the natural resources. A mineral resource extraction charge that is higher than the minimum rate established by law is applied with the aim of earning income for the State. For energy-producing minerals, the added value of the energy-producing minerals is also taken into account alongside the objective of earning income. An emission charge for emitting carbon dioxide into the air was established in Estonia in 2000. Currently the Environmental Charges Act (which entered into force in 2006) requires the owners of combustion installations to pay emissions charges for pollutants emitted into the air. All companies that are required to possess an Ambient Air Pollution Permit are required to pay emissions charges for pollutants emitted into the air. By Regulation of the Minister of the Environment, an Ambient Air Pollution Permit is obligatory for companies that own or use combustion installations (with solid, liquefied or gaseous fuel) with net power of 1 MW or higher when burning fuel. As an exception, only companies that produce thermal energy are required to pay carbon emission charges. From 2009, the rate of the carbon emission charge has been EUR 2/t. Emission charges must also be paid for installations that emit nitrous oxide into the air. Emission charges are not imposed for methane and fluorinated greenhouse gases (HFC, PFC and SF6). As an exception, the Environmental Charges Act establishes the opportunity to replace the emission charge (incl. the carbon dioxide emission charge) with environmental investments by companies. The emission charge is replaced by financing if the polluter applies at their own cost environmental measures that reduce the volume of emissions or waste by 15% compared to the period before the investment. The state has used the received environmental charges to fund environmental projects (incl. the replacement of boiler equipment using fossil fuels, the reconstruction of district heating systems, etc.) for the last 20 years via the Environmental Investment Centre. Under Section 23(3) of the Environmental Charges Act, companies in the EU ETS that generate thermal energy (installations with the installed rated thermal input over 20 MW) do not pay the emission charge at the higher rate if the quantities of carbon dioxide emitted thereby are covered by additional emission allowances purchased by the company and recorded in the annual report. In other words, if the allowed carbon volume is exceeded, the higher fee is not charged if it is covered by the additional purchased emission allowances. Measures in the electricity production sector The following measures, which had significant impacts, have previously been implemented in Estonia, and these will significantly influence Estonian CO2 emissions until 2030: 1) Over the period 2004-2005, two PC-boilers were replaced with FBC-boiler blocks (2×215 MW) at the Narva Power Plants; and 2) Construction of an additional FBC boiler block (with a capacity of 300 MW), the Auvere oil-shale based power plant, began in 2011. The investment costs were ca EUR 640 million. The power plant became operational in 2015 and was fully completed in 2018. The new power plant is designed so that biomass can make up 50% of the fuel input used. ii. Policies and measures to achieve other national targets, where applicable Adaptation to climate change Adaptation to climate change and the corresponding measures have slowly but consistently become a horizontal subject in Estonia that will help to tie all relevant sectors and administrative levels to the adaptation measures. For example, local of environmental and weather monitoring information systems. Several local governments have taken climate change related risks into consideration in local development plans, and also in the reconstruction of water and sewerage and other routes and in the preparation of zoning plans and comprehensive planational strategic development documents include direct and indirect measures that may help society adapt to the impact of climate change. The majority of these relate to the mitigation of climate changes and the regulation of emergency situations (based on the Emergency Act and the Water Act). the development plan is to reduce the vulnerability of Estonia to climate change through a framework for action and to achieve readiness and the capability to cope with the impact of climate change on local, regional and national levels. The development plan also has eight sub-targets that are directly based on the vulnerability of sectors, describe them and are defined accordingly. Their fulfilment is supported in the implementation plan of the development plan by the measures for adaptation with the impact of climate change, which are presented together with the corresponding activities, results and costs (see Table 21). Table 21 Sectoral overview of vulnerability from climate change and measures for adapting to climate change Sector and target Vulnerability Sectoral adaptation measures 1. Health and rescue capability Improved rescue capabilities and protect their health and property has reduced the negative impact of climate change on health and the living environment. The main health sector vulnerability arises from the capability and readiness of health care systems to adapt to changing climate and extreme weather phenomena (potential interruptions in medical aid), susceptibility and inequality of people, the proportion of more vulnerable people (the elderly, children, people with chronic diseases) and the presence and functioning of warning systems. Vulnerability in the case of rescue capability depends on processing massive numbers of emergency (floods, forest and landscape fires) accident learned helplessness and on the disruption of rescue work and public order. 1.1. Development of information, monitoring and support systems and preparation of action plans for the improvement and management of health risks arising from climate change. 1.2. Increasing rescue capabilities 2. Land use and planning Storm, flood and erosion risks have been managed, the heat island effect has been mitigated, the climate proofing of settled areas has been increased by selecting the best solutions in land use and in planning land use. The realisation of climate risks in land use depends on the maintenance or non-maintenance of drainage systems, and also on their natural amortisation. The main risks involved in climate change are expressed and aggravated in cities exposed to weather daily activities are planned in restricted areas with specific land use, a built environment and an urban landscape. The vulnerability of Estonian cities from climate change primarily depends on demographic processes, namely depopulation and the ageing of the population, the declining birth rate, but also the increasing spatial polarisation, compaction and suburbanisation of Harjumaa County, the decline of 2.1. Raising awareness of the impact and risks of climate change in land use, urban management and planning, the development of planning methodologies for at-risk areas and the organisation of a legal framework 2.2. Management of flooding risks and the development of green areas and urban landscapes to manage climate risks small towns, peripheralisation and mass emigration. 3. Natural environment The diversity of species, habitats and landscapes and favourable conditions for and the integrity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is ensured in a changing climate, and socio-economically important ecosystem services are provided at an adequate volume and quality. The greatest vulnerability in the natural environment is the sensitivity of the favourable condition and integrity of all ecosystems (terrestrial ecosystems, freshwater ecosystems, the marine environment) and the volume and quality of ecosystem services to changes in hydrological regime (incl. ice and snow cover), and from the point of view of biodiversity, habitat specialists are most vulnerable. 3.1. Preservation of biodiversity in changing weather conditions 3.2. Prevention of the introduction of invasive alien species in nature and combating and controlling invasive alien species in a changing climate 3.3. Ensuring the favourable condition of ecological communities and the diversity of landscapes and organising nature conservation in a changing climate 3.4. Ensuring the stability, favourable condition, functions, resources and diversity of terrestrial ecosystems and habitats in a changing climate 3.5. Monitoring of the condition of surface water bodies, the structure of biota, external and internal load of substances caused by changes in temperature and hydrological regime and minimising climate risks 3.6. Minimising the negative impact of climate change in order to achieve good conditions in the marine environment and the preservation of biodiversity 3.7. Ensuring socio-economically important ecosystem services at an adequate volume and with adequate quality, taking into consideration climate risks 4. Bioeconomy The sustainability of the bioeconomy sectors that are important for Estonia is ensured through climate-conscious planning of agriculture, forestry, water management, fisheries and tourism and peat extraction. The climate change ignorant planning of agriculture, forestry, water management, fisheries and tourism and peat extraction (not taking into account changes in hydrological regime and the increase in average temperatures) threatens the sustainability of the bioeconomy sectors that are important for Estonia. 4.1. Safeguarding the food supply in a changing climate via the development of land improvement systems, increasing the competitiveness of agriculture and knowledge generation and transfer 4.2. Ensuring the productivity and viability of forests and their diverse and efficient use in a changing climate 4.3. Safeguarding the welfare (income) of people whose livelihoods depend on the sustainability of fish stocks and fishing in a changing climate  4.4. Diversification of tourism and increasing visitor satisfaction 5. Economy Economic operators use the opportunities provided by climate change in the best manner and manage the accompanying risks. The relative slowness of climate change and the response speed and adaptability of Estonian businesses towards external changes will ensure that the economy has a low vulnerability even if adaptation entails the cessation of operations or a significant change in their character in regions that are heavily impacted by climate change. Vulnerability will increase if the economy as a whole is unable to take advantage of the new 5.1. Management of the household risks connected with climate change 5.2. Favouring business activities that take into account the impact of climate changes opportunities provided by climate change. 6. Society, awareness and cooperation Citizens understand the dangers and opportunities associated with climate change. The level of understanding of the accompanying risks and opportunities and the level of research and education in Estonia will significantly impact the vulnerability of society and its adaptability to climate change. Individuals who are uninformed, have a low income, have poor socio-economic conditions and lower social capital are most vulnerable from climate change. 6.1. Improvement of risk management and ensuring the capability of employees of state and local government bodies to manage the risks that accompany climate change 6.2. Supporting adaptation to the impact of climate change in pre-school education, general education and hobby schools, environmental education centres and vocational educational institutions 6.3. Ensuring up-to-date and thorough information on climate change, incl. transition impacts of global climate change on Estonia 6.4. Participation in cooperation in international climate change mitigation and adaptation to the impact of climate change and in the development of a strong international climate policy 7. Infrastructure and buildings The availability of vital services or the energy efficiency of buildings will not be reduced as a result of climate change. The increasing frequency of extreme weather phenomena also tests the transport system, wherein a combination of several circumstances may lead to unpredictable risks and hazardous situations. A  comparison of the various means of transport shows that road transport as a whole is most vulnerable, and also the movement of people in 7.1. Ensuring safe traffic, cargo traffic and access to vital services in changing climate conditions 7.2. Ensuring the durability and energy efficiency of buildings and a comfortable indoor climate in changing climate conditions connection with infrastructure-related traffic disruptions, slipperiness risks, reduction on the load-bearing capacity of unpaved side roads and the safety of light traffic roads. The overall vulnerability of transport technologies and fuels in the second half of the century is not known. The vulnerability of buildings compared to the EU average is increased by the ageing, low-quality and hence energy-intensive building stock. 8. Energy and security of supply Energy independence, security, security of supply and the usability of renewable resources will not decrease or the volume of final primary energy consumption will not increase as a result of climate change. Energy independence and security of supply, which rely heavily on the oil shale industry and depend primarily on the existence and availability of domestic energy resources and the adequacy of the production capacities required for producing energy (electricity, heating and fuels) are generally forecast as not being particularly vulnerable to climate change by the end of the century. The use of renewable sources such as biomass and peat are more vulnerable than oil shale energy due to their seasonality and the need for intermediate storage. 8.1. Ensuring the usability of renewable energy resources and the supply of energy and heating for consumers in changing climate conditions Initiative to transition to low carbon technologies In addition to ordinary auctions in the EU greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system, aviation allowance auctions have also been held since 2014. Under Directive 2009/29/EC and the Atmospheric Air Protection Act, 100% of the income from the auction must be used for mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. Considering the relatively low volume of income from the aviation auction and the desire to ensure that the results achieved with that income are as constructive as possible, it would be reasonable to direct it to projects with rapid growth potential, including to the promotion of smart ICT solutions and green technologies or to sustainable technology in the environmental and climate sectors. One preference is to support start-ups and research and development related to climate change mitigation and adaptation processes. In 2018, for example, the Ministry of the Environment supported the ClimateLaunchpad green sector business idea contest, which was organised by NGO Cleantech ForEst in Estonia, the research project of the Space program of the Väätsa Basic School on measuring thermal radiation sources and the albedo effect from a stratospheric helium balloon as well as the development of the FAHM field experiment by the Chair of Ecophysiology at the University of Tartu. These funds have also previously been used to support various innovative start-up solutions. In 2016 the development of prototypes by the companies ShipitWise, Hepta Group Energy and Themo was supported through NGO Prototron. 33 Estonian technology companies signed an agreement at the Tallinn Digital Summit in autumn 2019, promising to transfer their operations to a fully environmentally sustainable footing by 2030. In order to analyse the opportunities for introducing low GHG emission technologies, the Ministry of the Environment has launched the following projects.  To analyse the opportunities for minimising the GHG emissions of the Estonian assessing the suitability of different carbon capture technologies and developing scenarios for implementing those technologies in the Estonian oil shale industry94;  The hydrogen working group, which has the aim of analysing the opportunities for implementing hydrogen and fuel element technology in Estonia to achieve the 95, which brings together companies, research and educational institutions and individuals interested in the development of hydrogen technologies in Estonia, also participates in the working group. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications is also preparing for the planning of the roadmap for the decarbonisation of energy-intensive industries, incl. financial instruments for its realisation. To introduce the low-carbon technologies, the proposals have been made during public discussion of the draft NECP 2030, to consider the development of carbon-based taxation. Just transition The concept of just transition developed in 1990s North America, where trade organisations saw just transition programmes as support for employees who had lost work due to environmental protection. This term has become broader over time, and under these programmes planning has taken place and investments have been made in the transition to environmentally and socially sustainable jobs, sectors and economies96.                                                            94 https://www.ttu.ee/projektid/climmit/ 95 NGO Estonia Hydrogen Association http://h2est.ee/eesti-vesinikuyhing/strateegia/ 96 Just Transition Centre report to OECD 2017 http://www.oecd.org/environment/cc/g20-Due to the absence of investment, social policy and foresight, the implementation of climate policy may, among other things, lead to the loss of jobs in regions that depend on fossil fuels. In the United States, the Just Transition Fund has been established for communities connected with coal mining, to support for transition to new energy97. The establishment of a similar fund for the decarbonisation of the EU ETS secto-intensive industries. The www.just-transition.info platform has been created in order to gather examples for solving the social problems that have arisen in connection with the greener management of European coal mining areas and to learn from these. The Estonian oil shale sector employed a total of 7303 people in 201898.  coal mining areas are situated in Ida-Virumaa County, and the Ida-Virumaa programme99, the Ida-Virumaa action plan 2015-2020100 and the Ida-Virumaa County development strategy 2019-2030+101 have been drawn up for this area. According to the latest known information, the oil shale energy will remain as the largest industry in Ida-Viru county during the next decade. These documents may be supplemented, as needed, with the just transfer measures in Ida-Virumaa by, for example, engaging more people made redundant in the oil shale industry in forestry, renewable energy, etc. In planning shale oil production, the plans of ocean shipping must be taken into consideration, as well as reaching the use of the carbon-neutral fuels by 2050102 and its impact on employment in the oil shale sector. The Estonian economy also requires investments in the transition to cleaner energy and more sustainable jobs, and also in the transition to wind farms (incl. acquisition of air surveillance radars for national defence purposes), electrical energy storage solutions, cogeneration stations, biofuels and electricity in transport, the development of electric railways and modern rental housing stock, the reconstruction of apartment buildings, the demolition of abandoned sites, the reduction of the carbon intensity of the cement and lime industry and the recycling of the tail gases generated by industry. iii. Policies and measures to achieve low emission mobility (including electrification of transport) In March 2011 the Government of Estonia entered into a contract with Mitsubishi Corporation to sell an emissions allowance totalling 10 million AAUs in order to launch an electromobility programme. This programme comprised three parts: 1) The Ministry of Social Affairs adopted 507 Mitsubishi iMiev electric cars as a pilot                                                                                                                                                                                            climate/collapsecontents/Just-Transition-Centre-report-just-transition.pdf 97 Just Transition Fund http://www.justtransitionfund.org/ 98 Oil shale industry yearbook 2019 https://www.energia.ee/-/doc/8457332/ettevottest/investorile/pdf/Polevkivi aastaraamat 2019 est.pdf 99 Programme for Ida-Virumaa https://www.rahandusministeerium.ee/sites/default/files/document_files/REGO/ida- virumaa_programmi_alused.pdf 100 Action plan for Ida-Virumaa https://www.siseministeerium.ee/sites/default/files/dokumendid/Arengukavad/ida- virumaa_tegevuskava_2015-2020_26.02.15.pdf  101 Ida-Virumaa County development strategy 2019-2030+ https://ivol.kovtp.ee/maakonna-arengustrateegia 102 E.g. the biggest ocean shipping company in the world, Maersk, intends to introduce carbon-free fuels by 2050 https://www.maersk.com/about/sustainability/shared-value/decarbonising-logistics project; 2) The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications developed a support scheme for private individuals and legal entities for purchasing electric cars; 3) Recharging infrastructure for electric cars covering the entry country was built. SA KredEx organised the allocation of the purchase support and management of the fast recharging network. Currently, KredEx no longer grants the support, and the infrastructure is being privatised. The pilot plan of aid for the purchase of the electric vehicles is prepared in August 2019 (Pilot project of Measure TR7 Aid for the purchase of electric vehicles to assess the relevance of the measure) that provides for EUR 1.2 million for the aid for the purchase of the electric vehicles. The objective of the support measure is to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and other ambient air pollutants in the Estonian transport sector through the broader introduction of electric vehicles. To gain the greatest possible impact, the purchasing aid is directed towards the companies and natural persons with high need for transport. Support is to be provided for the purchase of 223 electric vehicles.  The forecast for the four-year period of the program as a whole is that it will reduce transport sector emissions by 3 500 t CO2 eq103. At the same time, the owners of the electric vehicles purchased through the aid will also receive renewable energy certificates in the amount of the energy consumed driving the vehicles. The renewable energy certificates confirm the use of the renewable energy in the energy system balance in different sectors. The results of the activities of the hydrogen work group launched by the Ministry of the Environment in October 2019 will specify the opportunities for introducing hydrogen fuel and the plan to be implemented in the transport sector, as well as other sectors. The Estonian Hydrogen Association has joined the international hydrogen initiative, which has the objective of achieving the decarbonisation potential of hydrogen technology--term energy supply104. iv. Where applicable, national policies, timelines and measures planned to phase out energy subsidies, in particular for fossil fuels An overview of the energy subsidies used in Estonia are summarised in chapter 4.6.iv. The most extensive of these are connected with the consumption of fossil fuels. The lower rate of excise duty is applied to diesel fuel used in agriculture, and support is also granted for generating electricity from peat or oil shale processing retort gas in efficient cogeneration mode. Estonia does not plan to amend these two measures, since the lower rate of excise duty for diesel fuels supports the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, and the Estonian government does not intend to promote the launching of additional cogeneration stations using fossil fuels.                                                            103 -effective measures for achieving the targets of the climate policy https://kik.ee/sites/default/files/aruanne_kliimapoliitika_kulutohusus_final.pdf 104 The Hydrogen Initiative http://h2est.ee/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/The-Hydrogen-Initiative.pdf
