5. IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF THE PLANNED POLICIES AND MEASURES211   Impact of the planned policies and measures described in section 3 on the energy system and greenhouse gas emissions and removals, including comparison with projections of existing policies and measures (as described in section 4). i. Projections of the development of the energy system and GHG emissions and removals, and where applicable, of emissions of air pollutants in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/2284, in the light of the planned policies and measures, covering at least ten years after the end of the period covered by the plan (including for the last year of the period covered by the plan), including relevant Union policies and measures. GHG emissions projections for the additional measures scenario have been calculated for 2016-2040, with 2016 used as the reference year (baseline year) (see Figure 46). Years with additional measures (see Figure 46) [sic]. In the additional measures scenario, the projected GHG emission trends take into account the planned additional measures in Annex III of this plan and their impact.                                                            211 The proposed policies and measures are options under discussion which have a realistic chance of being adopted and implemented after the date of submission of the national plan. The resulting projections under section 5.1.i will therefore cover not only implemented and adopted policies and measures (projections for existing policies and measures), but also planned policies and measures.   kt CO2 eq.

The impact of the policies and measures provided in the tables has been identified in a 2018 study -effective measures for achieving climate policy and 212. Table 37 Impact of planned policies and measures on pollution in the agricultural sector                                                            212 https://www.kik.ee/sites/default/files/aruanne kliimapoliitika kulutohusus final.pdf Measure Impact on air pollutants PM11 Production of bioenergy and increasing its share in agriculture There are no precise figures on the additional impact on ambient air, but the impact of the production process can generally be assessed as negative - emissions increase from the biomethane production process, where relatively large quantities of electricity and thermal energy are used. Lifecycle emissions to ambient air from production depend on the fuels used to produce electrical and thermal energy. Emissions also occur from the additional transport of manure to the biogas station and the transport of digestate to the fields. At present, in all Estonian biogas stations where the wet anaerobic digestion of livestock manure technology is used, i.e., when solid manure is used as additional substrate (quite common), the digested material (digestate) is liquid. So in the Estonian context, it is not possible to speak of the impact of separate digestion on NH3 and H2S emissions from solid manure. Compared to unfermented liquid manure, the impact of fermentation on NH3 emissions is negative, i.e. fermentation results in increased NH4-N content in digestate, so the risk of ammonia emission is higher (various sources point to a 10-20% increase). The impact on H2S emissions is positive, i.e. a large amount of sulphur in the substrate volatilises (or may volatilise) as H2S during the fermentation process. H2S in the composition of biogas or potentially occurring in biogas is removed from the biogas or substrate (depending on the technology used). In the first case, bound with active carbon, in the second case with FeCl3, and an insoluble sulphur compound is created. Thus the sulphur content in the digestate that may potentially volatilise is significantly lower. PM10 Converting arable land on peat soils to permanent grassland From the point of view of ambient air, the reduction of CO2 and other emissions from the combustion of machine fuels (SO2, PM2,5, NOx, VOC) in agricultural machinery is positive. The impact on H2S and NH3 emissions can reportedly be assessed as neutral. PM12 Improving the quality of feed for dairy cows There are no data about additional impacts on ambient air. The volume of machine work was not expected to increase. The impact on SO2, incl. H2S, NOx, VOC, NH3 and PM2.5 emissions can reportedly be assessed as neutral. There is no impact on NH3 and H2S emissions since vegetable fats are used as a source of energy available in the small intestine. Vegetable fats and higher-quality roughage have no direct relationship with nitrogen metabolism. PM13 Increase in the share of grazing land Among the impacts on ambient air, the increasing ammonia (NH3) emissions can be assessed as negative. However, H2S emissions are decreasing since a prerequisite for their emission is an anaerobic environment, which is primarily associated with stall buildings (manure channels) and liquid manure storage facilities. The impact on SO2, NOx, VOC and PM2.5 emissions can reportedly be assessed as neutral. PM14 Zero tillage Related effects can be assessed as positive: nitrogen leakage into the soil is reduced, and from the point of view of ambient air impact, emissions from combustion of machine fuels (SO2, PM2,5, NOx, VOC) are reduced. The impact on H2S and NH3 emissions can reportedly be assessed as neutral. PM15 Winter plant cover A negative spillover effect from the measure impacts ambient air in connection with increased emissions (SO2, PM2,5, NOx, VOC) from agricultural transport (transport of fertilisers and seeds, sowing). PM16 Precision fertilisation The impact on ambient air is positive: H2S emissions are reduced as the cumulative quantity of plant nutrients is decreasing, since fertiliser is delivered exactly where needed and in the optimum amount. The impact on SO2 excl. H2S, NOx, VOC, NH3 and PM2.5 emissions can reportedly be assessed as neutral. PM17 Replacement of inorganic fertilisers with organic fertilisers There are no data about additional impacts on ambient air, thus the impact is neutral. The impact on SO2, incl. H2S, NOx, VOC, NH3 and PM2.5 emissions can reportedly be assessed as neutral. In the case of fertilisers, the overall impact on emissions (particularly on NH3) depends on the technology (equipment) and work organisation. Conditions are favourable for the absorption of NH3 ions into soils when (i) fertiliser is applied to soil, (ii) soil has good uptake properties, (iii) soil is suitably moist, (iv) the acidity of soil is low, and (v) the temperature is low. Table 38 Impact of planned policies and measures to the pollutants in the transport sector Measure Impact on air pollutants TR7 Aid for the purchase of electric vehicles Related effects on air pollutants can be assessed as positive: in terms of ambient air, the measure contributes to the reduction of air pollutant emissions (SO2, PM2,5, NOx, VOC). The impact on H2S and NH3 emissions can reportedly be assessed neutral. TR8 Additional enhancement of fuel-efficient driving TR9 Additional spatial and land use measures in cities to increase the fuel-efficiency of transport and enhance the transportation system TR10 Additional activities for the development of convenient and modern public transport TR11 Establishment of mileage-based road charges for heavy goods vehicles TR12 Tyres and aerodynamics of vehicles TR13 Development of railway infrastructure (incl. construction of Rail Baltica)   Table 39 Impact of planned policies and measures on pollutants in the energy sector Measure Impact on air pollutants EN4 Additional The impact of replacing district heating with local heating can be assessed as development of heating sector management negative, i.e. emissions to ambient air may increase since the better controllable and high boilers of district heating boiler stations are replaced with numerous local boilers. The impact on H2S and NH3 emissions can reportedly be assessed as neutral. The impact on ambient air of renovating heat pipelines can be assessed as positive. Since the need for heat production decreases, emissions to ambient air also decrease (SO2, NO2, NOx, solid particles, VOC). The impact on H2S and NH3 emissions can reportedly be assessed as neutral. The impact on ambient air of reconstructing boiler houses can be assessed as positive. Since the efficiency of heat production increases, emissions to ambient air also decrease (SO2, NO2, NOx, solid particles, VOC). The impact on H2S and NH3 emissions can reportedly be assessed as neutral. The exact scope of the impact depends on which fuel is replaced with the biofuels (chips). HF5 Additional renovation of public sector and business buildings The impact on ambient air of renovating office buildings can be assessed as positive. Since the need for heat production decreases, emissions to ambient air also decrease (SO2, NO2, NOx, solid particles, VOC). The impact on H2S and NH3 emissions can reportedly be assessed as neutral. HF6 Additional renovation of private homes and apartment buildings The impact of the measure can be assessed as positive. Since the need for heat production decreases, emissions to ambient air also decrease (SO2, NO2, NOx, solid particles, VOC). The impact on H2S and NH3 emissions can reportedly be assessed as neutral. The policy of decreasing energy poverty also contributes to the measure as this helps to increase the capability of lower-income households to invest in the energy efficiency of the buildings. At the same time, as the State only provides partial support for the renovation of buildings, the involvement of private investments is also required for a positive effect. Supporting the renovation of apartment buildings is budget neutral - the equivalent of 33% of the aid is received back into the economy as tax income already during performance of the works.  ii. Assessment of policy interactions (between existing policies and measures and planned policies and measures within a policy dimension and between existing policies and measures and planned policies and measures of different dimensions). In this section, it is necessary to establish a robust understanding of the impact of energy efficiency/energy savings policies on the sizing of the energy system and to reduce the risk of stranded investments in energy supply. Decarbonisation To meet the targets established by the effort sharing regulation, when planning the activities it is important to focus on the most efficient use of measures, e.g. increase support to already functioning measures or also consider the possibilities for intergrouping the measures during planning.  The main objectives of measures implemented or planned in the transport sector are to increase vehicle efficiency and reduce the national transport demand. One target of the -car use by improving conditions for walking, cycling and use of public transport, and the use of smart solutions for various new services, in particular the provision of short-term bicycle and car rental services. For a number of measures, the scenario of projections with additional measures provides an estimate of the mitigating effect on GHG emissions for several measures if additional funding is released for implementation of the measures.  According to the scenario with existing measures, emissions from the transport sector will increase by around 1% by 2030 in comparison with 2016. Additional measures in 28.4% compared to the projections with measures, reducing emissions 27.9% by 2040 in comparison with 2016. The opportunities for reducing GHG emissions in the agricultural sector are primarily related to limiting GHGs related to the cultivation of arable land. The 2018 -effective measures for achieving climate policy and shared commitment to make their implementation more effective. According to the study, it would be effective to group measures PM10, PM14 and PM15 relating to the use of arable land use and PM16, PM17 and partly also measure PM15 relating to fertilisation. On 11 July 2019, the Climate and Energy Committee of the Government of the Republic was formed to discuss measures suitable for fulfilling the objectives and to formulate the  iii. Assessment of interactions between existing policies and measures and planned policies and measures, and between those policies and measures and Union climate and energy policy measures. environmental, climate and energy policy and the related legal framework. National sectoral targets and national measures for achieving these are determined during preparation of the sectoral development plans.  Macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmental, employment and education, skills and social impacts of the planned policies and measures described in section 3 The NECP 2030 measures are predominantly laid out in current development plans, where the environmental impact assumed to be associated with implementation has been assessed on the basis of an environmental impact assessment and the Environmental Management System Act213. The development plans for forestry, agriculture, transport and waste management for the new planning period starting in 2021 are being prepared, and the environmental impact of the development plans will be reassessed during this process. The NECP 2030 measures are expected to have a positive environmental impact compared to the situation if these measures were not implemented. The negative impacts that may accompany the measures can be mitigated through implementation of NECP 2030. The environmental impacts expected from the NECP 2030 measures are described in the following tables. Table 40 Estimated environmental impact of energy measures.                                                            213 https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/112122018045 No ENERGY MEASURES IMPACT EN1 Renewable energy support and support for efficient cogeneration of heat and power Environmental impact must be assessed when planning activities with significant environmental impact. The installation of wind electricity stations on a water body and other activities with significant environmental impact are listed in Section 6 of the Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Management System Act. The majority of NECP 2030 energy measures were assessed during preparation of the NDPES 2030 SEA programme and report: A significant impact on endangering biodiversity is associated with an increase in logging due to increased use of wood fuels. Additionally, the burning of wood fuels in spot and local heating causes health effects from PM2.5, and this decreases as a result of the measure. A significant impact on energy security is associated with the growth of the share of imported fuels and energy, primarily due to the significant decrease in electricity generation from oil shale. The closure of old oil shale combustion plants significantly reduces the need to pump cooling water and groundwater from mines, and reduces GHG and pollutant emissions and waste generation. Wind farms and solar stations will not lead to significant negative impacts, but they have local effects, mainly in the form of visual disturbance due to landscape changes, and changes in the habitats, feeding and migration of birds and animals due to noise and shade from wind turbines. Negative impact on Natura 2000 areas can be avoided. No significant land use change is planned. No significant negative cross-border impact is expected.

No TRANSPORT MEASURES IMPACT TR1 Increasing the share of biofuels in the transport sector The majority of NECP 2030 transport measures were assessed during the preparation of the NDPES 2030 SEA programme and report214: TR2 Increasing the fuel efficiency of the transport sector                                                            214 https://energiatalgud.ee/index.php/ENMAK:Dokumentatsioon 215 https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/transpordi_arengukava_2014-2020_ksh_aruanne.pdf TR3 Promotion of sustainable driving The significant impact on the endangering of biodiversity is two or three times smaller compared to the electricity and heating sectors, and the planned measures will reduce GHG and pollutant emissions. Increasing use of biofuels and electrical vehicles will reduce the negative environmental impact of transport. The production of biofuels does not have a significant global environmental impact, as in Estonia biomethane is mainly produced on the basis of wastewater and agricultural waste and is directed to existing gas network for use in gas-powered vehicles. The growing number of vehicles increases the fuel demand of vehicles and infrastructure  developments, and therefore the importance of developing public transport grows; During preparation of the strategic environmental assessment report215 for the Transport Development Plan 2014-2020: The assessment of the compliance of the plans in Chapter 4.2 of the Development Plan with the environmental targets showed that the Development Plan promotes the use of energy from renewable sources and the achievement of environmentally friendly modes of transport, reduces transport noise, reduces the need for transport by directing the settlement and production structure, and reduces the number of victims of traffic accidents. At the same time, the following risks exist: the measures contained in the Development Plan are not sufficient to break the link between TR4 Spatial and land use measures in cities to increase the fuel-efficiency of transport and enhance the transportation system TR5 Development of convenient and modern public transport TR6 Time-based road charge for heavy goods vehicles TR7 Aid for the purchase of electric vehicles TR8 Additional enhancement of fuel-efficient driving TR9 Additional spatial and land use measures in cities to increase the fuel-efficiency of transport and enhance the transportation system TR10 Additional activities for the development of convenient and modern public transport TR11 Establishment of mileage-based road charges for heavy goods vehicles TR12 Tyres and aerodynamics of vehicles TR13 Development of railway infrastructure (incl. construction of Rail Baltica) TR14 Electrification of railways TR15 Electrification of ferries TR16 Transfer of public transport to biomethane and electricity  Table 42 Estimated environmental impact of building stock measures.  No BUILDING STOCK MEASURES IMPACT HF1 Renovation of public sector and business buildings The majority of NECP 2030 building stock measures were assessed during preparation of the NDPES 2030 SEA programme and report: Renovation of a building reduces the hence reducing both fuel needs and emissions. At the same time, the electricity demand of the building increases with installation of forced ventilation, heat pumps, smart home solutions etc. To cover the growing power demand, there are energy measures for renewable energy, efficient cogeneration and security of supply. As a result of the building stock measures, the energy efficiency of Estonian building stock will increase, the indoor climate of buildings will improve, indoors 80-90% of the time); the lifetime and usability of buildings will be extended, and the value of property will increase. HF2 Renovation of private homes and apartment buildings HF3 Establishment of minimum requirements for nearly zero-energy buildings HF4 Investments in street lighting reconstruction programme HF5 Additional renovation of public sector and business buildings HF6 Additional reconstruction of private homes and apartment buildings economic growth and transport demand; with the improvement of public transport conditions, car use and energy consumption in the transport sector continue to increase; greenhouse gas emissions will not be reduced but the aim is to limit them; all measures included in the Development Plan aimed at reducing transport demand and introducing alternative fuels and encouraging their use contribute in part to limiting the spread of pollutant emissions, but the Development Plan still envisages an increase in the number of movements (incl. an increase in vehicle traffic), meaning that the reduction of pollutant emissions might not be guaranteed. Table 43 Estimated environmental impact of agricultural measures. No AGRICULTURAL MEASURES IMPACT PM1 Organic farming The majority of the NECP 2030 agricultural measures were assessed during preparation of the Estonian Rural Development Plan 2014-2020 SEA programme and report216: According to Chapter 5.3.1, the measures of the rural development plan focus particularly on strengthening agriculture, improving the related social situation in the country and maintaining good environmental status.  PM2 Agri-environment-climate measure and its sub-measures PM3 Support for climate-friendly and environmentally sustainable agricultural practices, so-called greening support PM4 Knowledge transfer and information PM5 Advisory services, farm management and farm relief services  PM6 Natura 2000 support for agricultural land The application of the planned measures will result in better environmental status in rural areas compared with not applying the RDP measures in comparable conditions. The implementation of the measures as planned is not expected to lead to a deterioration of the state of the environment, but it is nevertheless important that the planned measures consistently ensure the protection of the environment and its improvement. According to table 5-2, the introduction of renewable energy and energy saving solutions, bringing buildings and equipment into line with current standards, land improvement, conservation of traditional landscapes, and protection of biodiversity, water and soil will have a direct positive impact.

No FORESTRY MEASURES IMPACT MM1 Increasing the net growth of forests and carbon capture capacity for mitigating climate change through timely reforestation According to table 5-2 of the Estonian Rural Development Plan 2014-2020 SEA report, maintenance improves the carbon capture capacity of a forest stand, storm damage is prevented, and carbon is stored in long-lived products when the accumulated wood is taken for use in the timber industry. MM2 Promoting the regeneration of managed private forests with tree species compatible with the habitat type                                                            217 https://www.envir.ee/sites/default/files/jaatmekava_keskkonnamoju_strateegiline_hindamine.pdf 218 Circular economy https://ringmajandus.envir.ee/ MM3 Improving forest health and preventing the spread of hazardous negative factors The SEA report of the Forestry Development Plan to 2020 highlights the destruction of resources as a significant negative economic impact if less is grown than is felled during the longer term. Rural municipal roads are damaged by higher volumes of logging, and uninventoried and valuable old forests can be destroyed by active use of timber. The NECP 2030 forestry measures are all expected to have a positive environmental impact; a negative impact on biodiversity may be associated with fragmentation of forests in connection with an uncontrolled increase in timber production (measure MM4). Such a development is likely to be ruled out, since the majority of managed forest land in Estonia has a certificate of sustainable forest management (1.75 million ha of forest land without economic restrictions), incl. 1.5 million ha with an FSC219 and 1.2 million with a PEFC220 certificate. 100% of state forest land has both certificates.

No INDUSTRIAL PROCESS MEASURES IMPACT TÃ–1 Prohibitions, restrictions and obligations arising from Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 on fluorinated GHGs and Directive 2006/40/EC relating to emissions from air-conditioning systems in motor vehicles As a result of the measure, GHG emissions will be reduced, i.e. the measure will have a positive environmental impact. Table 47 Estimated environmental impact of cross-sectoral measures.                                                            219 Monthly Figures https://fsc.org/en/page/facts-figures 220 PEFC Annual Review 2018 pefc.org No INDUSTRIAL PROCESS MEASURES IMPACT IP1 Green technology investment programme As a result of the measure, GHG emissions will be reduced and the measure will have a positive impact. The measure also contributes to the promotion of entrepreneurship related to mitigating and combatting climate change. Tables 48, 49 and 50 present the macroeconomic impact of the planned policies and measures in the agricultural, transport and energy sectors under point 3 of the Plan up -effective measures for achieving climate policy and shared commitment objectives in Estonia221. Table 48 Macroeconomic impact of planned measures in the agricultural sector. Marginal cost 2e GDP 2030 Macroeconomic impact Impact on health, environment, employment and education, skills and social impact PM11 Production of bioenergy and increasing its share in agriculture 428 2.0 Although this is a measure with high production demand, the impact on GDP is positive as a result of import replacement and the promotion of local manufacturing. The foreign trade balance is also improved. The GDP change takes place via the biomethane production process plus indirect and induced effects. 20% of the effects occur via the agricultural sector. The measure has the positive spillover effect of reducing nitrogen leaching and the higher value of digestates as fertiliser compared to unprocessed manure. The impact is also positive in terms of energy security and reducing the use of fossil fuel. PM10 Converting arable lands on peat soils to permanent grassland 14 -0.7 The decreasing profitability in agriculture weakens competitiveness. As a result of the drop in purchasing power, GDP will decrease and the balance of foreign trade will improve again. The GDP change takes place through the addition to indirect and induced effects. 69% of the effects occur via the agricultural sector. Reduced air pollution (particulates) also marginally reduces heart and lung disease, which in turn prolongs healthy life expectancy (incl. working time) and slightly reduces the pressure on health care spending. The impact on biodiversity is also positive. The need for liming is also reduced. Reducing soil leaching also leads to an increase in soil carbon stocks and soil fertility. Eutrophication of surface water bodies and groundwater pollution are reduced. The latter, in turn, reduces the resources needed to implement the                                                            221 https://www.kik.ee/sites/default/files/aruanne_kliimapoliitika_kulutohusus_final.pdf status of water bodies. The reduced pressure on water bodies from diffuse pollution also brings a positive impact for fisheries. PM12 Improvement of the quality of feed for dairy cows 113 -2.1 Implementation of the measure means that additional expenditure will be incurred in agriculture and as a result the added value (profitability) will decrease. Overall, however, the macroeconomic impact is still marginal. The GDP change takes place via a fall in and induced impacts. It is estimated that 69% of the cumulative GDP impact occurs via the agricultural sector. However, reduced purchasing power improves the foreign trade balance. Since the market of the agricultural produce is open to international competition, the additional costs mean a negative impact on the competitiveness of Estonian dairy farmers and the risk of carbon leakage. Appropriate support for dairy farmers should therefore be considered when implementing the measure. PM13 Increase in the share of grazing 1213 -8.0 Profitability in agriculture improves and competitiveness is strengthened. As the result of the strengthened purchasing power (through increased profitability), imports increase and the impact on the foreign trade balance is negative. The GDP change takes profitability plus indirect and induced impacts. 69% of the impacts occur via the agricultural sector. If the pasture lands are established through the restoration of semi-natural biotic communities, the impact on biodiversity will be more positive (especially on coastal grasslands) - lower plants receive more light and trampling promotes seed germination). Reduction of soil leaching also leads to an increase in soil carbon stocks soil fertility. Eutrophication of surface water bodies and groundwater pollution are reduced. The latter, in turn, reduces the resources needed to implement the status of water bodies. The reduced pressure on water bodies from diffuse pollution also brings a positive impact for fisheries. There is positive impact on animal welfare and health - grazing is considered to be the most healthy to keep animals. The risk of the spread of infectious diseases is negative. PM14 Zero tillage -400 7.0 The increasing operating surplus (profit) in agriculture has a positive effect on GDP growth and, through indirect effects, also on employment. However, imports increase through the improvement Reduced air pollution (particulates) marginally reduces heart and lung disease, which in turn prolongs healthy life expectancy (incl. working time) and slightly reduces the pressure on health care spending. Zero tilling reduces soil of purchasing power. The competitiveness of farm holdings is improved. The GDP change takes profitability, plus indirect and induced impacts. 69% of the impacts occur via the agricultural sector. degradation, which also  slows the decrease in the area of arable land, which has become a global problem. Reducing soil leaching also leads to an increase in soil carbon stocks soil fertility. Eutrophication of surface water bodies and groundwater pollution is reduced. The latter, in turn, reduces the resources needed for implementing the good status of water bodies. The reduced pressure on water bodies from diffuse pollution also has a positive impact on fisheries. The negative effect of the spread of pests and plant diseases is possible, so there is a need for greater use of chemicals (pesticides). PM15 Winter plant cover 43 -2.4 The decreasing operating surplus (profit) in agriculture has a negative effect on GDP growth and, through indirect impacts, also on employment. The competitiveness of farm holdings is weakened. The GDP change takes place via decreased profitability of farmers, plus indirect and induced impacts. 69% of impacts occur via the agricultural sector. Air pollution (particulates) marginally contributes to heart and lung disease, which in turn reduces healthy life expectancy (incl. working time) and slightly increases the pressure on health care spending. However, a positive impact arises from the reduction of nitrogen leakage into the soil. PM16 Precision fertilisation -166 5.0 The increasing operating surplus (profit) in agriculture has a positive effect on GDP growth and employment. Reducing fertiliser imports has a positive effect on foreign trade. The GDP change profitability, plus indirect and induced impacts. 75% of impacts occur via the agricultural sector. The measure has a positive spillover effect through the reduction of nitrogen leakage (i.e. leaching into water bodies). This also has a favourable effect on soil biota, increasing soil fertility. Eutrophication of surface water bodies and groundwater pollution is reduced. The reduced pressure on water bodies from diffuse pollution also has a positive impact on fisheries. PM17 Replacement of inorganic fertilisers with organic fertilisers -143 2.1 The increasing operating surplus (profit) in agriculture positively effects the growth of GDP and also employment. The reduction fertiliser imports has a positive effect on foreign trade. The GDP change takes place via the improvement in lity plus indirect and induced impacts. 74% of impacts occur via the agricultural The measure has a positive spillover effect from the reduction of nitrogen leakage into the soil, which decreases eutrophication of surface waters and groundwater pollution, and has a positive impact on the fisheries sector. sector. Table 49 Macroeconomic impact of planned measures in the transport sector. Marginal cost  GDP change,  Macroeconomic impact Impact on health, environment, employment and education, skills and social impact TR7 Aid for the purchase of electric vehicles -397 -11.2 The measure increases costs in the public sector and savings in the private sector. Taken together, the divergent effects will have a negative impact on GDP and employment. Reduced air pollution (particulates) marginally reduces the risk of heart and lung disease, which in turn prolongs healthy life expectancy (incl. working time) and slightly reduces the pressure health care spending. Energy security increases as dependency on petroleum-based imported car fuel is reduced. TR8 Additional promotion of fuel-efficient driving -251 3.7 The measure results in a certain positive impact on the economy through additional purchasing power. Reducing the use of imported fuels leads to an additional positive impact on foreign trade, but the effect of the shift in purchasing power (from fuels and other car costs) on the increase in imports will be more pronounced and, and the balance will deteriorate overall. All direct impacts occur via the transport sector. Reduced air pollution (particulates) marginally reduces the risk of heart and lung disease, which in turn prolongs healthy life expectancy (incl. working time) and reduces the pressure on health care spending. The number of accidents also decreases. TR10 Additional activities for the development of convenient and modern public transport; -335 -18.9 This measure has the greatest impact on the road transport sector (public transport). Negative effects arise from fuel consumption and activities related to passenger cars (maintenance, sale, insurance). Overall, the negative impacts outweigh the positive ones (in terms of GDP and employment). The impact of the transport sector on GDP is positive, through the development and growth of public transport. All positive direct and indirect effects come from the transport sector. However, the overall effect is still negative due to public expenditure. Reduced air pollution (particulates) marginally reduces the risk of heart and lung disease, which in turn prolongs healthy life expectancy (incl. working time) and slightly reduces the pressure on health care spending. In addition, the number of accidents is reduced, as is expenditure on vehicle repair. People will lower incomes will benefit more from the measure, so there will be some income redistribution effect. TR9 Additional spatial and land use measures in cities to increase the fuel-efficiency of transport and enhance the transportation system -264 -17.9 This measure will generate cost savings and increase purchasing power in the private sector, with Reduced air pollution (particulates) marginally reduces heart and lung disease, which in turn prolongs public sector costs exceeding revenues. Overall, the negative effects on the economy outweigh the positive ones. However, the measure will have a negative impact on the added value of the transport sector through reducing car sales and repair services. healthy life expectancy (incl. working time) and reduces the pressure on health care spending. The number of accidents also decreases, as does expenditure on vehicle repair. TR11 Establishment of mileage-based road charges for heavy goods vehicles; 147 15.0 The measure leads to increased costs in the private sector and additional revenue in the public sector (road charges received exceed costs and tax revenue reduction). Overall, the positive effects on the economy outweigh the negative ones. Reduced air pollution (particulates) reduces the risk of heart and lung disease, which in turn extends the time of living healthy life expectancy (incl. working time) and marginally reduces the pressure health care spending. The number of accidents also decreases, as does expenditure on vehicle repair. TR12 Tyres and aerodynamics of vehicles 222 -5.8 The measure increases costs in the public sector and savings in the private sector. Taken together, there will be a negative impact on GDP, but employment will even increase, albeit minimally, in particular through motor vehicle repair services Reduced air pollution (particulates) reduces the risk of heart and lung disease, which in turn prolongs healthy life expectancy (incl. working time) and marginally reduces the pressure on health care spending. The number of accidents also decreases, as does expenditure on vehicle repair. TR15 Development of railway infrastructure (incl. construction of Rail Baltica) 74 8.5 This measure will lead to an increase in public sector costs due to the great need for subsidies, and savings in the private sector. A significant rise in employment is naturally expected during the construction period. One negative spillover effect is that an estimated of 560 ha of forest land needs to be deforested during the construction of the railway route (taking into consideration the need for deforestation of a railway corridor of up to 50 m). The maturity of the forests in the way of the railway has not been separately assessed. Emissions from deforestation of 560 ha of forest amount to approx. 282 tonnes of CO2e, i.e. 0.28 million tonnes of CO2e. Considering the areas deforested in previous years (ca 200-600 ha per year), deforestation due to Rail Baltica may amount to 560 ha over several years, which may climate agreements, especially if deforestation takes place after 2020. During the construction period of Rail Baltica, Estonia must take into account additional emissions when fulfilling land use and forestry sector obligations. As a mitigation measure, the timber harvested during construction of Rail Baltica must be transformed to the maximum possible extent in Estonia.   Table 50 Macroeconomic impact of planned measures in the energy sector. Marginal cost  GDP change,  Macroeconomic impact Impact on health, environment, employment and education, skills and social impact EN4 Additional development of the heating sector 45 -1.5 The replacement of district heating with block heating increases costs in the private sector (building owners). In summary, there will be some negative impacts on both GDP and employment. The impact of the measure can be assessed as negative: emissions to ambient air may increase as better controllable and high boilers in district heating stations are replaced with many local boilers. The measure may create fertile ground for the development of new ideas or innovation. 32 0.0 The reconstruction of heating pipelines is expected to create additional costs for district heating. Overall, however, the macroeconomic impact is still marginal. The measure has slight positive health effects (reduced risk of heart and lung disease) that will prolong healthy life expectancy (incl. working time) and marginally reduce the pressure on health care spending (reduces the need for heat production, which in turn reduces ambient air emissions). The reduced use of imported fossil fuels will have a positive impact on energy security. -12 -0.3 The renovation of boiler houses is expected to lead to cost savings in district heating. Overall, however, the macroeconomic impact is marginal.

The the renovation period. reduced use of imported fossil fuels will have a positive impact on energy security.    Overview of investment needs i. Existing investment flows and forward investment assumptions with regard to the planned policies and measures energy and climate plan needed for this purpose, the contribution of the private, public and non-profit sectors must be combined. Given the large investment needs of public sector activities, all available resources must be used to implement the activities, including national tax revenues, co-financing from relevant EU funds, income from trading GHG emission allowances and financial instruments with reasonable terms. -term budget framework 2021-2027 (submitted in 2018, still under negotiation as at October 2019) provides, inter alia, for EU funding for activities contributing to climate and energy goals. According to the contribute horizontally to achieving climate goals. The contribution of various EU funds to climate goals is planned differently depending on their specifics, including at least 40% of CAP funds (direct agricultural payments and the rural development fund), 37% of Cohesion Fund resources, 30% of ERDF resources, 30% of EMFF resources, 35% of funds under Horizon Europe   the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, and 60% of the funds under the Connecting Europe Facility (investment in transport, energy and digital infrastructure). As of the end of October 2019, the establishment of the Just Transition Fund is also likely to assist the regions most impacted by the GHG reduction target in carrying out the activities necessary for achieving a just transition. The sources for this new fund have not yet been agreed. It is important that the creation of the fund does not harm those parts of the EU budgetary framework (cohesion policy, common agricultural policy and the Connecting Europe Facility) that contribute to climate targets above the expected average of 25% of the MFF. To achieve climate and energy policy targets, it is important that the conditions for the next (2021- 2027) and subsequent EU budgetary frameworks are negotiated, prepared and implemented in the same way as other horizontal objectives and duly taken into account when designing criteria and conditions for different EU budget programmes, to enable synergies to be achieved by contributing to other key objectives. In doing so, it is necessary to avoid undue constraints on the ability of countries and project implementers to combine resources from different sources (incl. various EU programmes and other options, and increasingly financial instruments alongside grants) to contribute to climate policy goals in order to achieve rapid movement towards targets and facilitate the finding and implementation of optimum solutions. It is also important that in addition to activities that directly contribute to climate policy targets, activities that contribute to these indirectly should also be financed, as without them the achievement of GHG emission reduction targets is not realistic. The feasibility of implementing the actions of the climate and energy plan also depends, inter alia, on the fact that the updating of the rules and regulations on EU state aid will take account of market failures that occur in achieving the just transition of the regions most dependent on use of (solid) fossil fuels and the need to encourage the overcoming of these, specifically adjusting public sector contributions where necessary and justified. enue, EU 2014-2020 budgetary framework funds (primarily the European Regional Development Fund, Cohesion Fund, Connecting Europe Facility, and to a lesser extent also the Rural Development Fund, LIFE and Horizon 2020), as well as auctioning revenue from the EU ETS system (in line with the objectives set out in Article 10(3) of Directive 2003/87/EC117, Section 161(4) of the Atmospheric Air Protection Act and the state budget strategy) will be used to implement the NECP 2030 measures. The state budget strategy (which is prepared for at least four years in accordance with the State Budget Act) defines the financing volumes to be used during the strategy period, incl. the planned distribution of EU structural and investment funds (Structural Funds, Rural Development Fund, Maritime and Fisheries Fund) and GHG allowance auctioning proceeds. In order to implement measures contributing to the goals of climate and energy policy Estonia  directed structural and investment fund support in the amount of  796.1 million during the EU budget period 2014-2020, incl. the promotion of energy efficiency, sustainable transport and energy and resource efficiency of enterprises222. According to the state budget strategy (2020-2023), measures will be funded  269.8 million during the period 2013-2020. The development of renewable energy is facilitated on the basis of the Electricity Market Act by directing the fee for renewable energy collected from energy consumers to energy producers, using other measures related to taxes and fees (which are reviewed in Section 3.2) and organising consumer awareness and information activities (incl. e.g. in cooperation with the Kredex and Environmental Investment Centre foundations). The private sector  residents, associations, enterprises  invest in the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy with their own resources (this is encouraged with various public support measures, including support for energy audits). To achieve the targets of the NECP 2030, it is planned to continue combining various investment sources in the next EU budget period 2021-2027, gradually increasing the share of financial instruments to encourage the choice of activities for implementation, inter alia, on the basis of their economic viability and to increase leverage in the use of public funds. According to preliminary estimates as of autumn 2019, the public sector expenditure needs in 2021-2030 for the implementation of NECP 2030 measures   589 million in transport,   278.5 million in                                                            222 https://www.struktuurifondid.ee/et/toetatavad-valdkonnad  226 million per year for all these sectors. In addition, investments are expected from the private and non-profit sectors. The more specific distribution and schedule of measures and the state budget funds planned for their implementation will be decided upon the preparation of the medium-term state budget strategy (the strategy is updated annually in the spring).   ii. Sector or market risk factors or barriers in the national or regional context The main risk factors for energy management, incl. the market, are continuous variables related to balancing unmanaged and/or weather-dependent energy sources (solar, wind, hydropower, biomass) and managed capacities during peak demand, fluctuations in fuel and CO2 prices, regulatory tightening, technology development, the geopolitical situation and the technical security of supply. The obstacles include competencies at different levels (incl. avoiding investments that run counter to national targets; gaps in climate, environment and technology knowledge and insufficient dissemination of this knowledge) to cope with these variables continuously, incl. keeping up with digital technology and other innovations. The implementation of most of the above measures, incl. related investments, requires the following conditions to be met:  Monitoring global and local energy markets;  A stable regulatory space (incl. strategic planning);  The existence of competencies, continuous increase of these and dissemination of awareness;  The availability of technology and technical capability;  Cross-sectoral cooperation:  Systematic monitoring of the implementation of measures. iii. Analysis of additional public finance support or resources to fill identified gaps identified under point ii. To implement the measures, incl. determining the resources necessary for investments, the following is necessary:  The creation of indicators and a platform for monitoring changes in the energy market, and participation in international cooperation  The timely engagement of the sector in the application of EU legal requirements (to take into account the time available for the transposition of legal requirements and public consultation on the timetable for the implementation of measures)  The organisation of training sessions and internships to increase competencies related to the implementation of measures, investments, the application of new requirements (analysis of knowledge related to the application of measures and training needs), information campaigns, continuous updating of training programmes (regular analysis of training needs).  The presence of affordable technologies and a workforce (regular analysis of technologies and the workforce)  Diversification of cooperation methods  Yearly assessment of the implementation of the measures and, if needed, proposals for increasing their beneficial impact based on that assessment.  Impacts of planned policies and measures on other Member States and regional cooperation This chapter should cover the impact of the policies and measures proposed under Chapter 3 on other Member States and regional cooperation, up to at least the last year of the period covered by the plan, including a comparison with forecasts of existing policies and measures. i. Impacts on the energy system in neighbouring and other Member States in the region to the extent possible. Electricity infrastructure measures (see Chapter 2.4.2 for more details) primarily address the synchronisation of the electricity systems of the Baltic States with the frequency band subject to EU law. Within the framework of the Baltic synchronisation project, activities will take place in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Investments in synchronisation will strengthen both cross-border connections and the national electricity transmission network. This will remove bottlenecks in the electricity system and increase the interconnectivity of the Baltic and Polish energy grids. In 2017, the connectivity level of the Baltic States electricity system was >60% in 2017. In the same year, the connectivity level of Poland was 4%56. Investments in the context of the synchronisation of the Baltic States will increase it by 2.4 percentage points62. Hence the activities planned under the synchronisation project will have a significant positive impact on the electricity systems of Member States in the neighbouring region and in other regions. Meeting the targets of the national energy and climate plans is not expected to have significant negative impacts on the other Baltic States. On the contrary, aspects such as energy supply. According to monitoring programmes for existing wind farms, e.g. in the North Sea, offshore wind farms can be built without significant damage to the environment through appropriate planning and mitigation measures. When planning, it must be taken into account that in addition to being technologically suitable solutions, offshore wind farms can also provide various seabed habitats223.  GW; as a result of current policies, this will multiply many times over the coming decades. The efficiency of new offshore wind farm capacities is 40-50% as a result of larger turbines and other technological upgrades, being comparable to those of gas and coal stations in some areas, and exceeding those of on-shore wind farms and solar plants224. The interconnectivity level in the Baltic States is over 60%, which will increase with synchronisation of the electricity system with the European network. The connection capacity between Estonia and Latvia will be 700 MW until 2025, after which it will double. The Baltic States have coordinated the exchange of national energy and climate plan measures and have assessed the possible impacts of the measures on neighbouring                                                            223 WWF 2014 Environmental Impacts of Offshore Wind Power Production in the North Sea https://www.wwf.no/assets/attachments/84-wwf_a4_report___havvindrapport.pdf 224 IEA 2019 Offshore Wind Outlook 2019 https://www.iea.org/offshorewind2019/ countries. Most measures do not have a negative effect on other countries. Direct cross-border impact are expected to occur with electricity and gas network development projects. This impact is generally positive, especially in terms of energy prices and energy market integration.  Estonia and Latvia are also the biggest manufacturers of wood pellets225, supplying the European countries who lack the renewable energy sources. The cooperation of the sector has become stronger in the wood supply (incl. wood chips and wood pellets) to the wood industry and energy sector, e.g. Baltpool initiated by the Lithuanian operator226. Cooperation opportunities of the Nordic countries and Baltic States are also sought for the development of future technologies (energy storage, CCUS, hydrogen, etc.). ii. Impacts on energy prices, utilities and energy market integration. One result of the Baltic States electricity system is the convergence of the electricity exchange price in the three countries. In 2017, the electricity exchange price was 5.8% higher in Lithuania and 4.5% higher in Latvia than in Estonia. At the same time, the electricity exchange price in Estonia was essentially the same as in Finland (33.2 227. Thus, the planned electricity infrastructure measures will have a positive impact on both the energy exchange price and electricity market integration. iii. Where relevant, impacts on regional cooperation The Baltic States electricity system synchronisation project has a major impact on the Baltic States and Poland, and this has created a need for very intensive regional cooperation. In the most important formats, such as the Energy Committee of the Baltic Council of Ministers and the BEMIP high-level and technical working groups, cooperation has intensified in recent years. Both cooperation forms regularly monitor the implementation of the project and resolve issues and problems raised.                                                              225 Graanul Invest https://www.graanulinvest.com/eng/frontpage 226 Baltpool https://www.baltpool.eu/lv/ 227 Nord Pool Spot.
