4.2. Dimension decarbonisation 4.2.1. Greenhouse gas emissions and removals Trends in greenhouse gas emissions and removals The observed trends in greenhouse gas emissions and removals were determined on the basis of National Inventory Report 2019. Greenhouse Gas Inventory for 1988-2017. Submission under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol. The present document discusses general trends in emissions by sector using the UNFCCC reporting methodology and IPCC classification, and provides additional information on some of the major activities. In 2017, total GHG emissions in Poland (excluding LULUCF  land use, land use change and forestry), converted to CO2 equivalent, amounted to 413.78 MtCO2eq and were 28.3% lower than 1988 emissions (the base year for Poland under the Kyoto Protocol) and 2.5% higher than in 2005. 2017 emissions, including LULUCF, were 379.93 MtCO2eq, 32.37% less than in the base year and 6.48% more than in 2005. GHG emissions from installations covered by the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and emissions from other activities covered by the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESD) Emissions from ETS installations in Poland account for approx. 50% of total emissions in 2005-2017. In 2017, those emissions, excluding LULUCF, totalled 202.2 MtCO2eq. The energy, industrial processes and product use sectors are the largest contributors to ETS emissions. Non-ETS emissions totalled 211.5 MtCO2eq in 2017 and were higher than ETS emissions due to an increase in fuel consumption in the transport sector. Domestic GHG emissions are on a downward trend, with a very mild rate of decline since 2000, including years with a slight increase in emissions. It should be noted, however, that the list of installations covered by the ETS has been extended since 2013 to include installations in the chemical sector and that additional gases have begun to be included in the overall greenhouse gas balance. CO2 was the dominant gas accounting for 81.34% of emissions in 2017. The remaining gases were: CH4  11.94% (calculated as CO2eq), N2O  5.03%, F-gases  1.69%. Tables 4.20 and 4.21 present the breakdown of GHG emissions in Poland by gas, expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Details of GHG emissions, by gas, calculated as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) and broken down into ETS and non-ETS, are shown in the figure below. Table 19 presents the breakdown of GHG emissions in Poland by gas, expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.

GHG emissions and removals in the energy sector  current state The entire energy sector accounted for approx. 93% of emissions in 2017. The largest part of emissions comes from the fuel combustion sector, sub-sectors 1A and 1B, whose share in total emissions is approx. 81.53%. Total CO2 emissions are dominated by the fuel combustion sector 1.A (92.5%), including energy 1.A.1 (48.7%), transport 1.A.3 (18.6%), manufacturing and construction 1.A.2 (9.2%), and other sectors 1.A.4 (16.0%). Trends in emissions from the energy sector and the breakdown of emissions by sub-sector are shown in the figures below.  Figure 5. Trends in GHG emissions in the energy sector. Source: KOBiZE  Figure 6. Emission trends in the energy sector by sub-sector: 1A1  Energy, 1A2  Industry and construction, 1A3  Transport, 1A4  Other (including trade, housing and agriculture)  - Transport The share of transport in total GHG emissions in 2017 was approx. 15.31%. These emissions came mainly from road transport (approx. 97%) and from rail, air and water transport. The chart below shows the breakdown of total greenhouse gas emissions by mode of transport and change patterns. Following a significant increase until 2011, transport emissions stabilised by 2015. The years 2015-2107 saw a surge in emissions caused by an increase in fuel consumption by 37.1%. Apart from the successful combating of illegal trade in liquid fuels, this growth was driven by strong performance of the economy and an increase in the number of cars in use in the country.  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  23   Figure 7. GHG emissions from transport in 1988-2017. Source: KOBiZE  - Other sectors (including housing) GHG emissions from housing have been steadily decreasing since 2010. This is largely due to measures to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and reduce air pollution. It should be noted, however, that emissions from this sub-sector depend, to a large extent, on the existing climatic conditions.  Figure 8. Emission trends in the energy sector by sub-sector: 1A4a  trade and services, 1A4b  housing and 1A4c  agriculture, forestry, fisheries.

Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  24   Figure 9 GHG emissions from industrial processes and product use  - Agriculture Emissions from agriculture totalled approx. 31.74 MtCO2eq in 2017, accounting for approx. 7.7% of total GHG emissions. Trends in emissions from this sector are presented in the chart below. Nitrous oxide emissions are dominated by soil emissions, which generally demonstrate a slight upward trend with peaks in 2008 and 2013, whereas emissions from manure management show a weak downward trend. These trends are attributable to fertiliser management. The chart below shows the breakdown of 2017 emissions by sub-sector and by gas. Figure 10. Trends in GHG emissions from agriculture by sub-sector: A  enteric fermentation, B  manure, D - agricultural soils, F  burning of plant waste, G  liming, H  urea application  - Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) Activity in the analysed sector resulted in net emission reductions of approx. 29.2 MtCO2eq in 2017. Trends in this respect, by sub-sector, are shown in the chart below. One can notice a trend towards lower absorptivity resulting mainly from the use of woodland and agricultural land for housing development.

Trends in those emissions and their breakdown by sub-sector are shown in the chart below (Figure 12).  Figure 12. GHG emissions from waste by sub-sector: 5.A  solid waste disposal on land, 5.B  biological treatment of waste, 5.C  waste incineration, including open-burning of waste, 5.D  wastewater handling22  The presented data show declining trends in GHG emissions in all the sub-sectors except for waste incineration. These trends are most evident in solid waste disposal, which is associated with a decrease in waste discharged to landfills and with wastewater handling. Waste incineration shows an upward trend, which is related to an increasing thermal utilisation of waste. 22 Ibidem. 22 Ibidem. Emission forecasts based on projected changes in sectors The 2040 projections of GHG emissions are based on the following data sources:  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  26  1) Activity forecasts prepared by ARE S.A. for the purposes of the NECP, presented in sections 4.3 and 4.4 of the report. 2015 is the base year for forecasts; 2) Draft Fourth Biennial Report for the UNFCCC (BR4), Institute of Environmental Protection (Instytut  National Research Institute, KOBiZE, 2019. The forecasts take into account the implementation of current policies and regulations in the following areas: improvement of energy efficiency, improvement of the security of fuel and energy supply, diversification of the fuel mix in the energy industry, development of the use of renewable energy sources, development of competitive fuel and energy markets, reduction in the environmental impact of power generation. The forecasts were prepared for the following sectors according to the IPCC classification of sources and taking into account the following methodological assumptions: - Energy (including Transport)  GHG emissions were calculated on the basis of ARE S.A.'s forecasts of domestic demand for fuels and energy until 2040 (with respect to transport  calculations and forecasts presented in the Draft Fourth Biennial Report for the UNFCCC (BR4), Institute of Environmental  National Research Institute, KOBiZE, 2019); - Industrial processes and product use, Agriculture and Waste, as well as Land use, land-use change and forestry  calculations and projections of emissions were based on the results of projections presented in the Draft Fourth Biennial Report for the UNFCCC (BR4), Institute of Environmental  National Research Institute, KOBiZE, 2019. Below are the synthetic results of the 2020-2040 greenhouse gas emissions forecasts for Poland by IPCC sector, compared with 2005-2015 emissions (Tables 23 and 24). Table 21.

Energy GHGs [ktCO2eq] GHGs [ktCO2eq] Looking forward to 2030, total GHG emissions are projected to increase slightly by approx. 0.3% in relation to 2005. Emissions will then start to fall to reach approx. 334 million tonnes in 2040, a reduction of approx. 17% between 2005 and 2040. In 2040, the largest emission volumes will continue to come from the energy sector, notably the combustion of fuels, but emissions in this sector will gradually decrease. A slight upward trend is expected in the industrial process and product use sector. In agriculture, GHG emissions will be increasing slightly until 2040. On the other hand, there has been a steady decrease in emissions from waste since 2005. The largest emission reductions are expected in the energy sector.

Renewable energy  - Renewable energy sources - current state In accordance with the targets for the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption set out in Directive 2009/28/EC, the 2020 target for Poland was set at 15%. To meet this commitment, the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy (NAP) was adopted in 2010 that sets a 15.5% target for RES share of the national   Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  32   Figure 16. Comparison of RES share in the national economy with the trajectory of RES development presented in the NAP. Source: ARE S.A., NAP  total RES share  total RES share  NAP The total share of renewable energy was 6.9% in 2005. As a result of policies to promote renewable energy, the share of RES in gross inland energy consumption totalled 9.25% in 2010, i.e. 0.33% below the ceiling adopted in the NAP. A year later, the use of RES began to exceed the target set in the NAP and continued to do so until 2014 when renewable energy reached a 11.5% share in final gross energy consumption (compared to the target of 11.45%). 2016 and 2017 saw a significant decrease in the share of RES in gross energy consumption. This is due to two main factors: changes in the support system for RES-based power generation and a significant decrease in the use of biofuels in transport. The former significantly reduced the rate at which RES investments were brought into operation in 2016-2017. In turn, a reduced use of biofuels is the result of an increase in biofuel exports, which has translated into a decreased availability of biofuel on the domestic market.  Figure 17.

In the heating and cooling sector, 11.73% of energy consumed came from renewable sources in 2010. In 2015, RES accounted for 14.54% of energy consumed in the heating and cooling sector, and this is the only sector in which the use of RES in 2016 was higher than the target set in the NAP. This is a result of the popularization of biomass as an environmentally friendly heating fuel. 2017 and 2018 saw a decrease in the RES share in the heating and cooling sector down to 14.49% and 14.58% respectively, a difference of 0.53% and 1.1% compared to the NAP. In the transport sector, 6.57% of energy consumed came from renewable sources in 2010. The RES share in transport peaked in 2011 and then reached 4.20% in 2017. In the electric power sector, RES accounted for 6.65%, in 2010, 13.43%, in 2015, 13.09% in 2017 and 13.03% in 2018. Following the aforementioned change in the support system in 2016 and 2017, the commissioning of new investment projects slowed down, which resulted in arresting the rate of increase in use of RES in the electric power industry.  - Forecasts of energy generation and consumption from renewable sources The trajectories of national and sectoral RES shares presented in this subchapter assume the continuation of current trends and, consequently, do not factor in any exceptional measures to increase those shares, beyond those already defined in national legipossibility of the government administration stepping up efforts to achieve the 2020 target required by EU regulations in relation to the share of RES in final gross demand. It is assumed that the following basic mechanisms will be operated in the period under consideration to support electricity generation from RES: certificates of origin (this system is being gradually phased-out) and auctioning (expected to be in place by the end of 2035 for all RES technologies listed in the Act13 except for offshore wind farms, for which support is expected to continue until the end of 2040). Both systems have a maximum technology subsidy period of 15 years. It is also assumed that sources characterised by a stable mode of operation and those which may constitute a valuable addition to the existing generation units will mainly be given preference in future auctions for the supply of energy from renewable sources. The calculations are based on the data presented in the Eurostat SHARES forms used for reporting by Member States on the achievement of the 2020 RES targets. 2015 was selected as the base year, although the statistical data for 2016 and partly 2017, available at the time of preparation of this document, relating to the level of gross final energy demand and production from the particular RES generation units, were also taken into account. In the transport sector, the RES share was calculated as recommended in the RES Directive. The calculations were based on the assumption that the share of energy from renewable sources equals the amount of RES energy consumed in transport divided by the total amount of energy consumed in transport14.                                             13 The Act of 20 February 2015 on renewable energy sources (Journal of Laws 2017, item 1148 and 1213, as amended). 14 numerator  all types of energy from renewable sources consumed in transport. For the calculation of the share of electricity produced from renewable sources and consumed in all types of vehicles and for the production of renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels, Member States may choose to use either the average share of electricity from renewable energy sources in the EU28 or the share of electricity from renewable energy sources in their own country (the former option was selected as it was considered to be more favourable). Furthermore, for the calculation of the electricity from renewable energy sources consumed by electrified rail transport, that consumption is considered to be 2.5 times the energy content of the input of electricity from renewable energy sources. For the calculation of the electricity from renewable energy sources consumed by road transport, that consumption is considered to be five times the energy content of the input of electricity from renewable energy sources. For the calculation of biofuels in the numerator, the share of energy from biofuels produced from cereal and other starch-rich crops, sugars, oil crops and energy crops cannot be more than 7% of the final consumption of energy in transport. A factor of 2 is applied to the calculations of  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  34  The anticipated national gross final energy demand and production from the particular generating units classified as RES was determined for the purposes of the study. A detailed description of the projection of an increase in energy demand for the calculation purposes is provided further in the document. For hydroelectric and wind power plants, the production figures presented in Table xx are normalised values according to the methodology recommended by Eurostat15. - Wind power plants  the maximum average annual rate of construction of new capacity in 2017-2020 was assumed at 100 MW, reflecting changes in preferences for subsidising RES technologies, in line with the auction volumes announced and proposed to date. In 2020-2025, the rate of growth of newly commissioned units (both on-shore and off-shore) was capped at 200 MW and increased to 500 MW in 2026-2030, 750 MW in 2031-2035 and 1000 MW in 2036-2040. It should be stressed that a large number of wind power units currently in operation will reach the end of their anticipated lifetime in 2031-2040 and will be replaced by new units, as a result of which the assumed maximum rate of net capacity growth is much lower (500 MW in 2031-2035 and 250 MW in 2036-2040). With regard to offshore wind power plants, it was assumed that no such units would be constructed in the coming years due to legal and technical restrictions. It was assumed that the first offshore wind farms with a total installed capacity of 400 MW would be launched through auctions by 2025. The total installed capacity of wind power plants is the result of the cost optimisation process (being competitive to alternative sources), assuming that this technology is subsidised at a level ensuring the rates of return expected by investors. - Hydroelectric power plants  a maximum average annual power growth rate of 10 MW was assumed in relation to small hydroelectric power plants (below 10 MW) for the whole period under consideration. In addition, a minimum construction rate was set at 7 MW/year. No increase was envisaged for hydroelectric power plants above 10 MW, except for the construction of the 80 MW hydroelectric power plant in Siarzewo on the Vistula (to be commissioned in 202816). - Biomass  the trends observed in relation to all technologies using biomass in combustion processes for both electricity and heat production are assumed to continue. It is primarily expected that power plants and CHP plants with dedicated boilers of less than 50 MWel and 150 MWt (which will be supported by an auction system and will be treated preferentially in this system due to the stability of their operation), as well as distributed generation units using local resources will continue to develop. The maximum combined rate of construction of biomass-fired power plants and CHP plants is assumed to be 30 MW by 2020 and 75 MW/year in the following years, while the minimum rate is half of that. However, the assumption of continuing trends results in a limited increase in the use of biomass in district heating plants, where there is a significant untapped potential. In addition, the analysis assumes an increase in biomass consumption by home furnaces, consistent with the trend observed in recent years, which is attributable to, amongst others, replacement of outdated coal-fired boilers with new ones that are designed for pellet burning (as part of anti-smog measures). The results of the biomass projections are based on an analysis of the potential of this raw material and on numerous industry studies17. However, they lead to a conclusion that a significant increase in biomass use is unlikely unless additional incentives are provided. - Biomass and coal co-firing  the analysis assumes that co-firing will take place only in existing coal units, with the production volume being the result of optimisation under the MESSAGE model. As the current formula of the support scheme for co-firing does not generate sufficient incentives for generators to return to this form of electricity production, the analysis assumed that co-firing could again be made profitable under existing support schemes with the aim of increasing the share of RES in 2020. It is assumed that support for co-firing will not continue after that year.                                             second-generation biofuels. denominator  the total amount of energy consumed in transport (petrol, diesel and biofuels, as well as electricity, including electricity used for the production of renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels). 15 In the case of hydroelectric power plants, normalisation consists in correcting production levels with the use of the gross capacity factor averaged over the last 15 years. A similar method was applied to wind power plants, except that a 5- 16 The investment is considered a priority water project on a national scale. 17 Biomass Energy Europe. Executive Summary, Evaluation and Recommendations, Chalmers University of Technology, 2011.  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  35  - Biogas installations  the assumed growth of this technology (a minimum of 30 MW/year, a maximum of 50 MW/year) is based on historical data and on the auction volumes proposed to date. It is primarily expected that the use of agricultural biogas will increase, given the limited potential of undeveloped organic waste from landfills and sewage treatment plants. - Photovoltaic installations  the minimum rate of growth of new capacity assumed in the analysis, i.e. 75 MW/year for large installations connected to the power grid and 50 MW/year for small prosumer installations (rooftop installations), is based on the analysis of the rate of construction observed in recent years and takes into account the auction volumes announced and proposed to date. - Solar collectors  the development trend observed in the country in 2012-2016 in relation to this technology is expected to continue. Further support is assumed for individual installations in the form of credit subsidies. - Heat pumps  an increased average rate of development of this technology is assumed in relation to the one observed in the last six years (an average annual increase of approx. 15%) due to the expected increase in technical and economic efficiency of heat pumps, as well as their growing popularity and support in the form of subsidies. - Biofuels  it is assumed that biofuel consumption will be driven by the need to achieve the targets set in the Polish legislation in terms of percentage shares in fuel sales, taking into account technical limitations related to the doping of conventional fuels and the EU requirements regarding the maximum share of biofuels derived from food crops. EU legislation sets the required minimum share of energy from renewable sources in 2020 at 10% of final energy consumption in transport in each Member State. This resulted in the introduction into national legislation18 of requirements concerning the minimum contribution of biocomponents and other renewable fuels consumed in all modes of transport to the total volume of liquid fuels and liquid biofuels consumed during the calendar year in road and rail transport, calculated according to the calorific value. The 2020 National Indicative Target is 8.5%, and it is assumed that the target will be met and will remain unchanged until 2040. - Electricity from RES  the consumption of electricity in rail, road and pipeline transport was determined using the STEAM-PL simulation model. The forecast assumes that there will be approx. 870,000 electric vehicles on Polish roads by 2030 and approx. 2,400,000 by 2040, consuming respectively 1.2 TWh and 3.0 TWh. Estimates of the pace and extent of e-Mobility development are based on the assumption that excise tax exemptions will be the only type of support available to potential buyers. The rate at which an increase in vehicles of this type, but its estimation is subject to a significant level of uncertainty. Tables 27-30 present national and sectoral projections of RES share based on the assumptions discussed above. These projections show that the continuation of RES support policies (as at the end of 2017) does not guarantee the fulfilment of the 2020 obligation set in the EU Directive. Due to the limited potential (relatively low levels of windiness, low levels of sunshine, unfavourable hydrological conditions - a lowland country with support mechanisms (RES become competitive only when the prices of CO2 emission allowances are high and the technology costs are significantly reduced, a process slower than originally expected). The current contribution of RES to gross final consumption (2015) is 11.9%. Cost optimisation, as well as an analysis of development opportunities based on existing trends and in the absence of extraordinary measures going beyond the existing legal and regulatory framework (as assumed in the scenario), suggest an achievable level of RES share in gross final energy consumption at 13.2% in 2020, 15.2% in 2030 and 18% in 2040. Electric power is the sector in which the RES share is growing at a fastest rate. The RES share is increasing in this sector from 15% in 2020 to 19.4% in 2030 and 25.9% in 2040. In the heating and cooling sector, where there is a relatively high potential, the increase is insignificant due to the limited scope of support. Moderate increase in the transport sector is a consequence of the assumption that the National Indicative Target for 2020-2040 will be maintained at 8.5%.                                             18 Act of 25 August 2006 on bio-components and liquid biofuels (Journal of Laws 2014, item 1643, as amended).

Under this model, distributed sources are competitive in relation to the retail price of electricity. The fact that energy can be used on the site where it is produced, without having to transmit it over long distances, is an important advantage of technological solutions of this type. Prosumer energy generation is undoubtedly an element of the system that can contribute to the improvement of local energy security and further diversification of energy supplies. Prosumerism is only just beginning to develop in Poland and, similarly as in western countries, is expected to play an increasingly important role in the future. The results of analysis regarding the possible production potential of RES-based small installations and microinstallations, as presented below, are based on the assumption of a gradual decrease in technology costs, an increase in retail prices of electricity (mainly as a result of the rising costs of CO2 emission allowances for units relying on fossil fuels), as well as the methods of support involving mainly the co-funding of investment costs, the availability of preferential loans, and the possibility of feeding excess energy generated by prosumers into the grid subject to the rules applicable to the system of discounts provided for by the RES Act. It is apparent from the results obtained that photovoltaics will be the fastest growing technology among small installations and microinstallations in buildings (and the one with the highest rate of cost reduction). The tables below show projections of electricity and heat generation from renewable energy sources by small installations and microinstallations in buildings, including data on electricity self-consumed and fed into the grid. The share of energy fed into the grid in the respective periods is determined on the basis of an analysis of historical data provided by the Energy Regulatory Office (URE)20. The projections on the generation of heat by microinstallations are based on the STEAM-PL simulation model which takes into account elements such as the level of demand for useful energy output, existing potential, technology costs, subsidies, user preferences, existing pace of development, forecasts from industry organisations and reputable Polish and foreign research institutions.
