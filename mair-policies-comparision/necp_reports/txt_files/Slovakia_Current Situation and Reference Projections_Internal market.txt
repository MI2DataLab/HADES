Current interconnection level and main interconnectors54 The current level of interconnection of the transmission system including the main interconnection lines is shown in the following Table 65, while Figure 44 documents the current actual transmission capability of main interconnectors.

At present, the V440 line current load rating is 1609 A (summer 1200 A) and V449 is 2000 A (summer 1800 A). ii. Projections of interconnector expansion requirements (including up to 2030)55 The total thermal capacity of the Slovak border crossings is now 10 200 MVA (9 306 MW); by 2030 this should reach 14 000 MVA (12 203 MW). The trend in the overall level of Slovak interconnection by 2030 and its dispersion with respect to trends in the source mix, i.e. the ratio of the assumed net import transmission capacity to the total anticipated installed electricity generation capacity in the SR is shown in Figure 45.  Figure 45: Indicative electricity interconnection targets                                                  55 With reference to national network development plans and regional investment plans of TSOs.   The anticipated trend in the indicative parameters for interconnection, due to achieve a minimum of 30% of import of the anticipated maximum load and 30% of export of installed RES output including hydroelectric power plants is shown in the following figure. Figure 46 Estimated trend in indicative interconnection parameters  It is clear from this that the 15% target by 2030 will be met as well as the indicative parameters. The price difference between business zones will depend on the electricity market in 2030.  The values of the maximum transmission capacities on the individual cross-border profiles of the transmission system of the SR were calculated for the 2023 and 2028 development time horizons for the import and export directions of power flows on SR cross-border profiles with checks of the validity of the basic N-1 safety criterion only in the transmission system of the SR. The calculation of transmission capacity values at cross-border profiles depends in particular on the topology and system connection, the location and deployment of the electricity generating equipment, and the maximum permissible current loads on the TS lines. The values of maximum transmission capacities on SR cross-border profiles are calculated for the basic network connection state, the production of electricity generating equipment and the loading of the electricity system of the SR considered for separate development time horizons (Y+5 and Y+10). The operating transmission capacities on SR cross-border profiles, determined for the current situation, maximum Y+1, are also calculated taking into account the current system connection, the deployment of electricity generating equipment (maintenance of power generation facilities and elements of the transmission system of the SR) and the loading of the electricity system of the SR at the given calculated hour. For the current state, respectively for the Y+1 horizons, tradable transmission capacities are also determined that already take into account the necessary safety provisions for unexpected events and for the large differences between trading and real power flows, so-called circular flows, the TS operator was able to meet the basic N+1 security criterion. Taking these states into consideration, which can only be estimated very poorly for the coming years, the tradable transmission capacity values for 2023 and 2028 would be lower than the maximum transmission capacity values. Based on the results of calculations of transmission capacities on SR cross-border profiles in the 2023 and 2028 time horizons, we can state that the construction of new 2x400 kV cross-border lines SR) - - SR) and 400 kV R. Sobota (SR) - Sajóivánka (HU) will significantly increase the maximum transmission capacity at the SR-HU cross-border profile  by about 85% in the export direction and about 47% in the import direction. The commissioning of the new SR-HU lines would have a minimum or even negligible influence on the maximum transmission capacity of other SR cross-border profiles. Figure 4: Schematic view of the planned investment project for the construction of new cross-border lines on the SR-HU profile   Planned SEPS Investment  The shutdown of the 220 kV system in central and western Slovakia, mainly the 220 kV cross-border lines on the SR-CZ profile, and the increase in the maximum current carrying capacity of the V404 Varín (SR)   000 A, in comparison to the 2023 time horizon, namely the shutdown of the 220 kV cross-border line on the V280 Senica (SR)  Sokolnice (CZ) SR-CZ profile with the connection of the new R400 kV Senica to the SR)  Sokolnice (CZ) line, will increase the maximum transmission capacity on the SR-CZ profile in the import direction by 35%, while in the export direction the increase will be negligible. For the other cross-border profiles under consideration, the shutdown of the 220 kV system in the western part of the transmission system of the SR and the increase in the permissible current carrying capacity of the V404 line will have a minimum, respectively negligible, impact (maximum 3%). Figure 5 Shutdown of the 220 kV cross-border lines on the SR-CZ profile  In the 2022 time horizon, SEPS intends to shut down the V280 Senica (SR) - Sokolnice (CZ) 220 kV cross-border line on the SR-CZ profile as part of the planned phase-out of the 220 kV part of the TS in central and western Slovakia. In the 2026 time horizon, SEPS is considering the shutdown of the V270 (SR)  Lískovec (CZ) 220 kV cross-border line. These topological changes mean that the total transmission capacity in the import and export directions on this profile may be reduced by approximately 10% of the current maximum value in both directions, as confirmed by the results of culations. One of the main general recommendations of this study for both companies to achieve the greatest reduction in the period with reduced maximum transmission capacity on the CZ-SR profile due to the complete shutdown of the 220 kV cross-border lines, is synchronisation of the planned investment measures of both sides in both material and temporal terms. To eliminate the consequences of reducing the maximum transmission capacity on the CZ-SR - Varín (SR) cross-border line the maximum permissible current carrying capacity will increase from 1 740 A to approximately 2 000 A, on the side through the complete reconstruction of the line in 2018 and on the SEPS side through the building of a new single 400 kV line between 2024 and 2025. The above planned investments on both sides will not only compensate for the impact of the shutdown of the 220 kV cross-border lines, but will also present the possibility of further increasing the maximum transmission capacity on the CZ-SR profile. planned investment actions in material and temporal terms to reduce the period with a reduced  maximum transmission capacity on the CZ-SR profile as much as possible resulting from the complete shutdown of the 220 kV cross-border lines. These described topological changes in the 220 kV Slovak TS have a negligible impact on the TTC values of other SR cross-border profiles, and there is also no significant change in the maximum transmission capacities for the 2028 time horizon on these cross-border SR profiles. All the above mentioned considerations and assumptions about the development of the TTCs of the individual cross-border SRS profiles in the 2023 and 2028 time horizons are based on the analyses and assumptions of SEPS and ENTSO E. The TTC values of the development horizons analysed for 2023 and 2028 should be understood as informative and non-binding annual values that apply exclusively to the analysed development variants for the Slovak TS. The NTC values for the next period are, or will be, specified by the SEPS electricity dispatching.  4.5.2. Energy transmission infrastructure  i. Key characteristics of the existing transmission infrastructure for electricity and gas56  Characteristics of the transmission system of the SR  The transmission system of the SR is above all a set of electrically interconnected 400 kV, 220 kV technology devices, 110 kV in selected equipment, via which transmission is achieved of electricity from its generators to individual customers for the transmission system of the SR (TS SR) as well as cross-border transmission of electricity. These are, in particular,  national and cross-border 400 kV, 220 kV lines and selected 110 kV lines,  400/220 kV, 220/110 kV and 400/110 kV transformers,  400 kV, 220 kV substations and selected 110 kV substations,  compensating devices.  Figure 6 Transmission system of the SR                                                   56 With reference to overviews of existing transmission infrastructure by TSOs.   The TS SR also includes the relevant support, so-called secondary installations without which transmission and control of the Slovak electricity grid would not be possible. These are management information systems (MIS), commercial metering, protection and automation systems, telecommunication transmission devices, and so on. Users of the TS SR are also directly connected to the TS SR by means of their electrical equipment; these users are:  three regional distribution system (DS) operators,  five electricity customers,  four electricity generators. In addition, the TS SR is synchronously connected to adjacent transmission systems to the following extent:  two single 220 kV interconnections and three single 400 kV connections to the Czech Republic (CZ),  one double 400 kV link to Poland (PL),  one single 400 kV link to Ukraine (UA),  two single 400 kV connections to Hungary (HU). Through these interconnections, the Slovak electricity grid is synchronously connected with TSs in Europe, the operators of which are together with SEPS part of ENTSO-E. Electricity lines The individual stations in the TS SR are galvanically connected by means of forty-six 400 kV transmission lines with a total length of 2,138 km, seventeen 220 kV transmission lines with a total length of 826 km and seven 110 kV transmission lines with a total length of 80 km. Of the total number of 400 kV and 220 kV transmission lines, the TS SR has eight 400 kV and two 220 kV cross-border lines, together with a total length of about 444 km in the SR, connecting the TS SR with the neighbouring CZ, HU, PL and UA transmission systems.  Further information - for example, on the number of masts, is published at the TSO SEPS web site (https://www.sepsas.sk/TechnickeÚdaje.asp?kod=16). Characteristics of the gas transmission network The transmission network is characterised in legislation as: A network of compressor stations and a network of high-pressure gas pipelines interconnected and serving to transport gas within the defined territory, without the extraction network and storage and high-pressure pipelines serving primarily to transport gas to a part of the defined area. One company is active in gas transmission in Slovakia  eustream, a.s.  the operator of the national transmission network. Based on the decision of the Government of the Slovak Republic of 28 November 2012, the form of separation was determined according to the requirements of European legislation using the Independent Transmission Operator (ITO) model.  In 2018 a total of 59.7 billion m3 of natural gas was transported. This amount means eustream, a.s. continues to be one of the most important gas transporters within the EU, based on volume. The transmission network is made up of parallel DN 1200 and DN 1400 pipes in four to five lines, the total length of the pipelines in the transport network is almost 2 270 km. The transmission network includes 4 booster stations (BS)  and BS Ivanka pri Nitre  which ensure the pressure differential required for continuous gas flow with a total output of 600 MW. They are located about 110 km from one another. The total transmission deliverability is more than 90 billion m3 annually. From the transmission network, natural gas within the defined area passes through the national interconnection stations into the distribution system and is transported to final customers.

Projections of network expansion requirements at least until 2040 (including up to 2030)57  By 2040, the SEPS TS operator is considering the reinforcing the SR-CZ profile by 1x400 kV line from Ladce (SR) - Otrokovice (CZ). According to the information in point 2.4.2 ii, this is to minimise the impact of the planned shutdown of the 220 kV TS on the SR-CZ profile, or more exactly, on the TS SR and TS CZ. It is a realistic assumption that preparation of this project will begin after 2025 so that the companies have declared their willingness to coordinate cooperation on their operational and developmental plans on the SR-CZ profile. For the 2030-2040 timescale, SEPS is not considering building further cross-border connections. A 2x400 kV SR - PL line and a fifth line between SR and HU are at the consideration and potential planning stage. There are no discussions on this subject between SEPS and the neighbouring TS concerned.  After a long break, communication was established with the TSO operator in Ukraine, the company NPC Ukrenergo. The Slovak-Ukraine cross-border profile is often a bottleneck (as is the profile to Hungary) in cross-border electricity transmission and causes operational and management problems for electricity dispatching in Slovakia. The Restoration of the 400 kV Mukacheve (UA) - SR) line project was included in the PECI/PMI 2018 list, approved by the Energy Community Ministerial Council in November 2018. The anticipated deadline for the comprehensive                                                  57 With reference to national network development plans and regional investment plans of TSOs.  renewal of the V440 line in the Slovak Republic is 2030. However, this must be done using new calculations around 2023. Ukraine will have completed its plan to reconstruct this line on its side by that time. Implementation of investment plans by the transmission system operator  Following the decision on the gradual phase-out of the 220 kV system, TS SR development is focused mainly on the development of the 400 kV system from the point of view of the transmission infrastructure (TS/DS lines and transforming). The controlled phase-out of the 220 kV TS is long-term, technologically and organisationally, a time- and cost-intensive task requiring repairs of TS 220 kV equipment to the extent necessary, via maintenance work or partial reconstruction to ensure the operation of some 220 kV systems until around the year 2025 when they will be at the limit of their technical and reasonable life, or beyond. A significant impact on the development of the 400 kV TS comes in particular from the development of new generating capacities and the change in their structure both in the Slovak Republic and in neighbouring countries. Both factors have a direct or indirect impact on the loading of the Slovak energy grid, which implies a need to strengthen TS SR infrastructure. In addition, the strategic goal of the SR in electricity generation is directed towards an export balance for the Slovak Republic (EMO 3,4, decentralised production and RES, and also a New Nuclear Source around 2035), which has, or will have, an effect on the load on cross-border profiles through export flows. The enhancement, and associated strengthening of, the 400 kV TS , in addition to the aforementioned gradual phase-out of the 220 kV TS, are also conditional on no less important impacts, either in the form of existing investment plans, as well as potential new 400 kV TS users or indirectly impacting impulses from lower voltage level individual distribution systems (particularly in terms of decentralised production), as well as through external influences such as transit flows, typically from north to south. The TS operator has to respond flexibly to these impacts, which, in view of the TS operators development plans, leads to necessary planning and implementation of both national and cross-border investment projects. Information about the TSinvestment plans is provided every two years through the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of the Transmission System (the most recent document covers 2020 to 2029). Information on selected SEPS projects is also available in the ENTSO-E Ten-Year Network Development Plan, the current version of which is available at http://tyndp.entsoe.eu/. Implementation of investment plans by the distribution system operator The permanent objectives are to strengthen the critical points of the system, to renovate the system in terms of its physical condition, to comply with quality standards, to reduce electricity distribution losses and to connect new supply points. The investment activity reflects the actual development and quality needs of the distribution system, previous developments, as well as the legislative requirements on a distribution system operator. Quality of distribution and trouble-free operation of the distribution system is very important for customers. Planned activities and investments in the distribution system are aimed at achieving the expected quality of service, and SSE-D is making every effort to meet customer expectations. The investment process is divided into three basic chapters - new connections, quality and increase in the transmission capacity of lines and other investments related to distribution activity. NEW CONNECTIONS Under this investment chapter, development actions for the construction of the distribution system have been addressed because of the need to connect larger supply points to high voltage, such as industrial parks, multifunctional buildings and commercial premises, as well as the connection of new  supply points to low voltage, such as standard supply points (family houses, apartment developments, smaller business premises, and civic amenities). Under this chapter in 2017, 214 constructions were completed for low- and high-voltage and EUR 8.49 million invested.  QUALITY AND INCREASE IN TRANSMISSION CAPACITY From the point of view of investment construction in the quality and increase in transmission capacity, in 2017 178 structures were built for low- & high voltage level and 21 structures for very high voltage at a total annual investment cost of EUR 23.74 million. The purpose of these investments was to ensure the reliability and continuity of electricity distribution. The continuing priorities of this construction were compliance with qualitative parameters, elimination of the unfavourable physical condition caused by external influences and the age of the equipment, reduction of the fault rate, modernisation of the facilities, deployment of elements with remote monitoring and control functions and improvement in the possibilities for electricity distribution. These contribute towards reducing the SAIDIP parameters, i.e. the planned downtime in client-minutes, and SAIFIP, i.e., the planned downtime frequency in client-downtime events. MAIN ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENTS FOR DISTRIBUTION SECTOR DEVELOPMENT In order to ensure the development and stability of the distribution system, significant projects for the very high voltage distribution system were implemented in the year 2017 and prepared for the upcoming period. In particular, these were the construction of the new 110/22 kV substation Novaky, which will ensure safe and reliable supply of customers with regard to the needs of Slovenské elektrárne, a.s. in the plants of Elektrárne Nováky (power supply and supply of own requirements) and Fortischem, a.s., Nováky (supply from the transmission system), preparation for the application of European Commission regulations on Requirements for Generators (RfG) from the point of view of access and connection to the distribution system, preparation of connection conditions for nodal areas Liptovská Mara - - reliability of electricity distribution and more. The company VSD operates an extensive distribution system, which accounts for nearly 22 000 km of power lines at very high voltage, high voltage and low voltage. At very high voltage, the distribution system is powered by four higher-level transmission system power stations with a voltage level of 400 kV and 220 kV. At very high and high voltage, the company operates 57 electrical transformer and switching stations. Reliable and secure distribution of electricity to all company customers, independent of the voltage level of the connection, is ensured by VSD by the set-up of all internal processes such as planning for the renewal and development of the distribution system, setting up and overseeing compliance with technical standards in respect of distribution reliability quality, and increasing the overall efficiency of electricity distribution. Level of reliability of electricity distribution. In 2017 as well, VSD succeeded in maintaining the distribution network reliability index at a favourable level of 99.96% ASAI (Average Service Availability Index), also taking into account weather and distribution interruptions caused by third parties. A programme of systematic renewal and modernisation of networks in eastern Slovakia also made a significant contribution towards this result, with the help of which our company can ensure a high-quality electricity distribution for new investors and the growing economy. Investments in renovation and modernisation of the distribution system. It is in the long-term interests of VSD to have reliable and safe operation of the distribution system. It directs its decisions in proposing investment plans in line with this basic objective. In 2017, VSD invested EUR 44.1 million into its system (2016: EUR 43.7 million), with the largest amount of funds invested as usual in system renewal to further improve customer service. Investments in automation and innovative technologies are an essential and natural effort on the part of VSD to increase the quality of services provided, not only in the area of electricity distribution but also in areas such as the provision of metered electricity values through the eVSD customer portal, but also for more comfortable communication with the customer. In 2017, VSD invested in innovative technologies in the field of communication and transmission of measured and monitored  data from the customer to VSD information systems, focusing on communication technologies related to the operation of smart metering, especially in the areas of: LoRa  (Long Range Radio Communication) and PLC  (Power Line Carrier). 4.5.3. Electricity and gas markets, energy prices i. Current situation of electricity and gas markets, including energy prices  A problem of the current EU electricity market having an impact on the electricity market in the Slovak Republic and neighbouring markets is that the market is fundamentally distorted by various subsidies and grants in particular in the development of renewable energy sources. The increase in the volume of renewable sources (mostly photovoltaic and wind power) has been achieved through the introduction of support schemes in the form of direct operating subsidies, essentially throughout the EU, including the SR. Wholesale electricity prices are also negatively influenced by the existence of capacity mechanisms that are already in place or are being introduced in some countries. This caused low market prices, which have recently begun to grow. As a result of this is that the EUs energy system as a whole suffers from the shutting down of conventional and flexible resource capacities and insufficient investment in new capacities. To address the challenges of the current EU electricity market, the European Commission has presented a proposal for EU Electricity Market Reform (a new electricity market design) under the Clean energy for all Europeans package. The third liberalisation package was not designed for the current and a future source base with a high proportion of decentralised and variable renewable resources. This package is a reflection of the Energy Union concept in concrete legislative proposals and should form the basis for implementing the EUs climate and energy targets by 2030 in the electricity sector. It represents a vision of the organisation of the market in the 2030 horizon.  The aim is to achieve better electricity market preparedness for a change the energy system (energy transformation). The aim is to provide the right investment signals as well as the market and energy market flexibility required for the market integration of new production sources, especially volatile renewable sources. At the heart of the energy transformation are end-users, who will get more rights and the option to choose their electricity suppliers as well as to produce electricity and supply it to the network. From the perspective of the SR, it is particularly important that the future model of the EU electricity market does not jeopardise the security of electricity supply and does not lead to increased end-user electricity prices. There have been no significant changes in gas supply for Slovak gas customers. Due to the size of the gas market in the Slovak Republic and the relatively stable natural gas prices that fell slightly during 2019, this trend should remain unchanged and neither a significant increase in the number of customers nor the entry of new suppliers into the energy market in Slovakia is anticipated. The price of electricity and gas depends on a range of different supply and demand conditions, including the geopolitical situation, the national energy mix, diversification of imports, network costs, environmental protection costs, adverse weather conditions or excise rates and taxation, as well as government measures reducing energy prices. The Slovak Ministry of Economy has prepared measures to increase the competitiveness of enterprises in the form of compensation for the tariffs for the operation of the system for energy-intensive enterprises that meet the conditions specified in the amendment to the Act on the Promotion of Renewable Energy Sources.   Also, the reform of the system to support the production of electricity from renewable energy sources and cogeneration of electricity and heat will ensure the cost-effectiveness of the support system, while minimising the impact on end-user energy prices. Electricity market In the wholesale electricity market, the Authoritys competences are only in the creation of legislative conditions and in compliance monitoring.  Figure 47 Electricity price trends in 2018-2019  The decisive participants in the electricity market in the Slovak Republic are: - Slovenské elektrárne, a.s. - the major producer of electricity, which in 2018 provided 68.65% of electricity generation in the Slovak Republic from its own sources. Electricity generation in the amount of 18 638 GWh provided 60.22% of electricity consumption within the Slovak Republic. The installed capacity of Slovenské elektrárne, a.s. for electricity generation was 4 081 MW,  - encouraging generators of electricity from renewable energy sources and high-efficiency cogeneration. For 2017, the amount of electricity generated from renewable energy sources at a surcharge was estimated to be 2 780 GWh and the amount of electricity produced by high-efficiency cogeneration of electricity and heat at a surcharge was 2 316 GWh, -  as the sole holder of a permit for electricity transmission , the transmission system operator, also fulfilling the tasks of energy dispatching (provided an equalised balance on the defined territory of the Slovak Republic),  - OKTE, a.s., organiser of the short-term electricity market as an institution for evaluating and organising the short-term electricity market and ensuring the clearing, assessment and settlement of variances in the Slovak Republic, - , a.s. and Východoslovenská  are the exclusive operators of the regional distribution systems in the relevant parts of the defined territory, to which more than 100 000 supply points were connected. In addition to these three distribution companies, 157 holders of permits to distribute electricity were also active in the electricity market. These were operators of local distribution systems in production and non-production facilities, to which less than 100 000 supply points were connected,   Currently, 439 entities have business licenses in the electricity sector. Retail market The adoption of Act No 250/2012, on regulation in network industries, introduced price regulation of the supply of electricity to vulnerable customers, which are household customers and small enterprises.  Price regulation in electricity supply covers: -  electricity supply to households -  electricity supply to small firms  -  electricity supply by the supplier of last resort. Electricity supply to households Maximum electricity prices for households have two components and consist of a monthly payment per single supply point and of the price for electricity supplied in the low or high band. Electricity supply for households is divided into eight tariffs.

Wholesale market  The wholesale gas market is characterised by:  the purchase of gas based on long-term contracts,  the purchase of gas on commodity exchanges,   the purchase of gas from another trader - gas supplier   trading at the virtual point of trade of the transport system operator   trading, respectively. by a change in ownership of stored gas in underground storage facilities. Retail market Maximum gas supply prices for vulnerable customers were comprised of two components, a maximum fixed monthly rate and a maximum gas tariff for gas supplied. Consumer tariffs were divided into six tariff groups 1 to 6 according to the amount of gas consumed annually. A vulnerable gas consumer according to the Regulatory Act is a household gas customer or a gas subscriber in the small business category. A small business within the meaning of the Regulatory Act is a natural gas customer with an annual gas consumption at all supply points of up to 100 000 kWh in the previous year and is part of the vulnerable consumers group.

The market is concentrated if the HHI is more than 0.1 and is highly concentrated at a value exceeding 0.2. Figure 55 shows the HHI trend between 2015 and 2017. There is a gradual decrease in the HHI value in the gas market, but it can be said that in 2017 this value was also above the high concentration threshold. Figure 55 HerfindahlHirschman Index 20152017  ii. Projections of development with existing policies and measures at least until 2040 (including to 2030)  Stagnation rather than a slight increase in gas consumption is anticipated in the near future. In accordance with energy legislation, certificates for the construction of energy facilities were issued for various companies, while others published their intentions in this area (new sources for the generation of electricity and heat from gas). However, the implementation of investment plans is a decision for the companies themselves, while decision-making is influenced by several factors such as the market price of electricity, the market price of gas as the input commodity, etc. Other factors that will affect the level of consumption include the average annual temperature and the continuation of various energy-efficiency-related measures, e.g. the thermal insulation of buildings and modern technological solutions for them. In the households segment, gas consumption as well as the availability of alternative fuels will influence consumption levels. Competition between different gas suppliers on the market can play a positive role in prices.
