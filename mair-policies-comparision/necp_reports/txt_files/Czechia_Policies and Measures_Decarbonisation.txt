30. In this respect, it will be a key plan for the Czech economy based on ten pillars, such as industry and energy, innovation, raw materials policy, transport tly under preparation, which should map in detail the necessary investments, inter alia, in the energy sector, for at least the next ten years. Then there is the Innovation Strategy of the Czech Republic 20192030, which was approved by Government Resolution No 104 of 4 February 2019. It is a strategic framework plan that predetermines government policy in the area of research, development and innovation and it is elve years. The innovation strategy consists of nine interconnected pillars, which contain the starting points, the basic strategic objectives and the instruments leading to their fulfilment. These pillars represent the following areas: Research and development funding and evaluation, Innovation and research centres, National start-up and spin-off environment, Polytechnic education, Digitisation, Mobility and construction environment, Intellectual property protection, Smart investment and Smart marketing. In this respect, the Czech Republic also acknowledges the importance of the EU Competitiveness Council, in which it is actively involved.  Top national competitiveness targets resulting from the approved State Energy Policy. These are the following goals (see also Table 6):   Maintain transmission capacity for export and import at a level of at least 30 % of the electricity system load;  Optimise discounted energy costs;  Keep the energy prices at no more than 120 % of the OECD level;  Achieve and maintain the levels of final electricity and gas prices below EU-28 level;  Achieve and maintain the share of energy expenditure in total household spending as low as possible below 10 %;  Optimise the share of the energy sector in gross value added;  Reduce the share of energy imports in gross value added below 2010 levels;  Maintain positive total economic value added of the energy sector;  stabilise the effect of energy imports on the balance of payments. 3 Policies and measures 3.1  The Czech Republic has long been struggling with combustion process emissions of substances posing health risks (PM2.5, PM10, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, benzo(a)pyrene, NOx, VOC, ground-level ozone, CO, dioxins, toxic metals and others), which are generated by the combustion of coal in household furnaces in almost every municipality in the Czech Republic. Also, emissions from old diesel and petrol engines in transport pose a health risk. Because of the seriousness and the national scale of the problem, it is desirable to reduce, as a priority, emissions of CO2 from combustion processes in these major areas of household furnaces and old diesel and petrol engines, even as a major multiplier effect, which also justifies State subsidies to protect public health, because at present the damage to health and property is far from internalised into fuel and energy prices.  -75-  3.1.1 GHG emissions and removals  i. Policies and measures to achieve the target set under Regulation (EU) 2018/842 as referred in point 2.1.1 and policies and measures to comply with Regulation (EU) 2018/841, covering all key emitting sectors and sectors for the enhancement of removals, with an outlook to the long-term vision and goal to become a low emission economy and achieving a balance between emissions and removals in accordance with the Paris Agreement 3.1.1.1 Transport sector The strategic and policy objectives and the main principles of development in the field of transport and transport networks are laid down by the Transport Policy of the Czech Republic 20142020, with a view to 2050. These are being gradually elaborated further in follow-up strategies. The main objective is to create conditions for the development of a quality transport system, which makes use of the characteristics of the various modes of transport and relies on the principles of competition with regard to its economic and social impacts and its impacts on the environment and public health. The State Environmental Policy of the Czech Republic 20122020 also includes requirements for the support of the use of alternative fuels, development of environmentally-friendly transport or economic instruments to include externalities from all modes of transport. Transport policy envisages the gradual replacement of conventional fuels (i.e. oil-based fuels) for alternative energy in road transport and the further electrification of railways and urban public transport, with the gradual shift in freight transport from road to rail or water. A similar 2030 sub-target is set by the State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic (2015) and the National Emission Reduction Programme of the Czech Republic (2015).  A number of measures are being implemented in the Czech Republic to promote the use of different types of alternative fuels. In accordance with Act No 16/1993, on road tax, vehicles for the transport of persons or freight vehicles with a maximum permissible weight of less than 12 tonnes using alternative fuel (hybrid drives, electric motors, CNG, LPG and bioethanol E85) are exempt from road tax; lower excise rate is applied to natural gas used in transport, even though the advantage is gradually decreasing. A certain (although lower) advantage in this area also applies to the use of LPG in transport. In order to meet the targets laid down in Directive 2014/94/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the requirement to establish a national policy framework for the development of alternative fuels in transport and related infrastructure, on 20 November 2015 the Government of the Czech Republic adopted the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility. For more detailed information on this programme, see Chapter 3.1.3.1 of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility. In the 2014Programmes. While the Operational Programme Transport (OPT) is aimed at supporting the public infrastructure of charging and filling stations (CNG/LNG/hydrogen), the Integrated Regional Operational Programme (IROP) supports the development of clean mobility in public transport and the Operational Programme Entrepreneurship and Innovation for Competitiveness (OP EIC) supports the introduction of electromobility in the business sector. Also, the Operational Programme Prague  Growth Pole of the Czech Republic has created a new specific target for the purchase of zero-emission electric buses, including the development of the related infrastructure. The operational programmes also include other measures that have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions in all priority axes focusing on the development of railway infrastructure (TEN-T network completion) and infrastructure for other sustainable transport (e.g. modernisation of electric traction of urban public transport).  -76-  Act No 201/2012, on air protection, requires also a minimum share of biofuels in the total amount of vehicle gasoline and diesel for a calendar year to be put into free tax circulation. Fuel suppliers are obliged to gradually reduce greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy contained in the fuel over the life cycle of the fuel. By 31 December 2014, they had to reach a 2 % reduction in emissions, then by 31 December 2017 they had to reach a 3.5 % reduction and a 6 % reduction by the end of 2020. Only biofuels meeting the sustainability criteria under Government Decree No 189/2018, on sustainability criteria for biofuels and on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from fuels can be counted towards the obligations. Act No 353/2003, on excise tax, then lays down the tax rate for individual fuels and the conditions under which pure and high-percentage biofuels are subject to a lower excise rate. The Multi-annual Programme for the Promotion of the Further Use of Sustainable Biofuels in Transport 20152020 (Government Resolution No 655/2014) aimed to maintain the existing system of promotion of the use of pure biofuels and high-percentage biofuel blends in transport. The Programme describes the use of liquid biofuels in transport both technically and legislatively and constitutes a framework that sets the optimum level of support for each biofuel type. However, its adjustments, which had to be made following the notification of the Programme to the European Commission, significantly reduced the interest of motorists in the use of high-percentage or pure biofuels in transport, whose current use is therefore only minimal. An important tool for creating a sustainable urban transport system is the elaboration of a Strategic Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan. The aim is to comprehensively address the issue of mobility in bigger cities connected with suburban areas, not only in terms of transport issues, but also in terms of the possibilities of influencing mobility and how it is made possible. Strategic Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans should be developed and regularly updated in cities with a population of over 40 000. Energy savings are based on increased use of public transport in passenger transport and on increasing the share of rail transport compared to road transport in freight transport. The public transport strategy, prepared as the initial strategic document of the Ministry of Transport for public transport in 20152020 with a view to 2030, therefore aims to improve the public transport system. Public transport operators and transport infrastructure managers can apply for support through the Integrated Regional Operational Programme for a range of activities related to the increase in sustainable forms of transport, such as fleet renewal. This will be necessary to comply with Government Decree No 49/2015, so that the average age of public transport vehicles is not more than 9 years.  In the area of freight transport, it is necessary to mention the Freight Transport Strategy 20172023 with a view to 2030, which, in view of the more difficult introduction of alternative energies in freight transport, highlights this especially in the area of urban freight transport and city logistics. According to this strategy, smaller, preferably alternative-drive lorries must be used for deliveries especially in historic city centres. The use of LNG (possibly even bioLNG) in the short term and electricity or hydrogen in the long term would have the greatest potential in this area. Road freight transport should be more broadly reflected in the forthcoming update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility. Fuel savings are also facilitated by increased traffic safety and fluency in all modes of transport, which is the aim of the approved Action Plan for the Deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems 2020 with a view to 2050. Among other things, intelligent systems will allow the technical condition of transport routes to be monitored and serious traffic accidents to be prevented. Implementation of the National Cycling Development Strategy 20132020 aims to improve the coordination of the development and the conditions for the use of this environmentally-friendly non-motorised transport. To support the use of environmentally-friendly vehicles, the National Emission Reduction Programme  -77-  alternative-52. Under this measure, public authorities should, as part of its fleet renewal, regularly purchase M1 and N1 alternative-drive vehicles in order to achieve at least a 25 % share of alternative-drive vehicles in the total public administration fleet by the end of 2020 and a 50 % share of alternative-drive vehicles by the end of 2030. Low-emission zones are geographically defined areas that limit access of vehicles on the basis of their emissions in order to improve air quality in these areas. The rules for the classification of road motor vehicles into emission categories and emission labels were laid down in Government Decree No 56/2013. The introduction of low-emission zones is also supported under the National Programme Environment. The National Programme is also geared towards supporting alternative modes of transport (e.g. carsharing, bikesharing, alternative drives, or non-motorised modes of transport).  In 20162018 within the National Programme Environment, the Ministry of the Environment announced three calls with a total allocation of CZK 300 million for municipalities, regions and their organisations to support the purchase of alternative-drive vehicles. This call is complementary to the OP EIC calls for legal persons. effective from April 2019), which entails the exemption from the registration fee, and the exemption from tolls up to 50 g CO2/km; from 2021, there is also a discount of vignettes for natural gas and biomethane vehicles. 3.1.1.2 Agriculture and forestry sector An important way of using methane and preventing its spontaneous formation is the processing of residues of agricultural production in biogas stations. The main tool to promote biogas utilisation was the introduction of feed-in tariffs and green bonuses linked to the amount of electricity produced. The construction of biogas stations has been supported under operational programmes and is also supported in the current period. The Rural Development Programme supported the construction of agricultural biogas stations. The construction of biogas stations using biowaste is supported by the Operational Programme Environment, while the Operational Programme Enterprise and Innovation for Competitiveness provides support to the output of heat from the existing biogas stations for its efficient use. The Action Plan for Biomass in the Czech Republic 20122020 foresees the possibility to achieve annual energy production from agricultural land and agricultural by-products and processing of agricultural products in the range of 133.9 to 186.8 PJ by 2020. The use of by-products and biodegradable waste accounts for the largest share (44 %), targeted cultivation of biomass for energy use on arable land accounts for about 40 % and energy use of grassland harvest makes up the rest (about 16 %). Such energy can replace the corresponding amount of fossil fuels, thereby contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The Rural Development Programme of the Czech Republic 20142020 goes beyond the cross-compliance control measures and will address the achievement of climate targets by 2020, notably  resources and supporting the transition to a climate-proof low-                                                           52  The measure will be de facto replaced by requirements arising from the transposition of Directive 2019/1161 on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles. The Ministry for Regional Development in cooperation with the Ministry of Transport and other ministries is also currently working on a draft law on the support of low-emission and zero-emission road vehicles.  -78-  - and forestry-ese targets will also be partially facilitated by measures under Priority 2 regions and promoting innovative agricultural technologies and sustainable  An important tool for reducing the consumption of mineral fertilisers is the development of organic farming, where the use of nitrogenous mineral fertilisers is completely prohibited. The organic farming regime is laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 of 28 June 2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 and Act No 242/2000, on organic farming. The support provided under the Rural Development Programme of the Czech Republic has a substantial impact on the expansion of the area of agricultural land managed according to organic farming principles.  Carbon sequestration in soil is facilitated by mandatory compliance with the standards on Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition and compliance with mandatory farming requirements, transposed by Government Decree No 48/2017, laying down requirements in accordance with acts and standards on good agricultural and environmental condition for controls of cross-compliance and consequences of their infringement for the granting of certain agricultural support. Paying support to farmers is conditional, inter alia, on meeting these standards and requirements. Important measures under the Rural Development Programme include the agri-environmental climate measures, namely due to maintaining or enhancing the nitrogen retention capacity by setting appropriate land management or by the transition to a culture with higher retention potential. Another effect of this measure is the strengthening of anti-erosion measures with a high sequestration impact, especially in nitrate-endangered areas or along watercourses (grassing, grassland care). One of the tools for addressing climate issues by expanding forest areas is local support for afforestation of agricultural land provided under the Rural Development Programme. Government Decree 185/2015, on the conditions for granting subsidies in the context of agricultural land afforestation measures and amending some related decrees, provides for subsidies for the establishment of and care for forests for a period of 5 years and for the termination of agricultural production on afforested land for a period of 10 years.  Another tool is the support for preventing forest damage by forest fires and natural disasters and catastrophic events, which also contributes to the reduction of forest fire emissions / the conservation of carbon in biomass and soil. Carbon sequestration in soil will also be facilitated by the support for sustainable management of permanent grassland.  Reduce the impacts of the expected global measures are generally focused on creating more resilient forest ecosystems by supporting diversified forests with the greatest possible use of natural processes, varied tree species, natural renewal and cultivation process variability.  The Strategy of the Ministry of Agriculture with a view tof the forest management-household use and consumption of wood and wood products; (ii) create conditions for investment in the forest management sector and the downstream value chain, which will lead to the production of higher added value wood products; (iii) reduce exports of wood mass from the Czech Republic; (iv) promote research and development towards better use of wood mass and explore new product opportunities with the use of wood.  -79-  All this should lead to increased use of wood as a renewable carbon-binding raw material and a substitute for other materials whose production is associated with high CO2 emissions. Reducing exports of raw wood and its processing (especially to cut timber and timber boards) in the Czech Republic will  3.1.1.3 Waste management sector The EU principles in the field of waste management are enshrined in the Czech legislation by the Waste Act. In December 2019, the Government of the Czech Republic passed a new Waste Act, which transposes Directive (EU) 2018/851 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 amending Directive 2008/98/EC on waste into the Czech legislation.  Act No 477/2001, on packaging and amending certain acts, addresses the prevention of waste packaging. It defines the basic obligations for the handling of packaging and packaging waste, including the labelling of packaging, reusable packaging, returnable packaging, returnable deposit packaging and take-back. New European regulations, together with new technological procedures for handling selected products, resulted in the need to adopt a special law on the handling of these products. The forthcoming draft End-of-Life Products Act lays down the rights and obligations of all those who handle electrical equipment, batteries and accumulators, tyres and vehicles from their placement on the market until their processing after they have become waste. In addition, work is carried out on the preparation of the implementing legislation related to the amendment to the Waste Act, Act No 223/2015, as well as new implementing legislation defining the rules for solid alternative fuels produced from waste (SAF Decree), a list of wastes that will be banned from landfilling from 2024 (Landfill Ban Decree).  The basic strategic document and tool for waste management is the Waste Management Plan of the Czech Republic 20152024 (WMP), which also fulfils and further elaborates the State Environmental Policy of the Czech Republic 20122020. The WMP is designed in accordance with the waste management hierarchy in accordance with the above Directive 2008/98/EC, on waste. The strategic objectives of the plan are to prevent waste generation and to reduce specific waste production, minimise the adverse effects of waste generation and its management on human health and the environment, ensumaximise waste utilisation as a substitute for primary sources and transition to a circular economy.  The Waste Prevention Programme, approved by Government Resolution No 569 of 27 October 2014, is a strategic document with specific targets and measures, thus creating the conditions for lower consumption of primary sources and gradual reduction of waste production. Reducing the amount of waste also reduces the demand for its processing and the associated greenhouse gas emissions. This government programme introduces the following tools: education and training, elaboration of expert analyses for the possibility of setting new legislative requirements in the field of waste prevention, methodological and legislative measures, and support for research and development. The Waste Prevention Programme is part of the Waste Management Plan of the Czech Republic. 3.1.1.4 Household sector Under the New Green Savings grant programme, funded from the revenues from auctioning of emission allowances, it is possible to combine the reduction of the energy performance of buildings with the greening of the heating source, where it is possible to obtain grants for biomass boilers, heat pumps or gas condensing boilers. Furthermore, it financially supports the construction of new buildings with very  -80-  high energy performance (buildings approaching the passive energy standard) and installation of photovoltaic systems. The New Green Savings (NGS) supports energy savings and the replacement of heating sources in family houses throughout the Czech Republic, and in residential buildings only in Prague. The construction of new low-energy buildings is supported within the NGS throughout the Czech Republic. As part of the greening of heating, the installation of solar (photothermal) systems is also supported under the NGS. Reducing the energy performance of buildings outside of Prague Capital City is also supported within the Integrated Regional Operational Programme.  More efficient and cleaner heat production in households is also supported through the OP E 20142020. The grants are intended to replace old environmentally damaging solid fuel boilers with modern low-emission boilers (e.g. gas condensing boilers) and a heat pump; the highest subsidy is provided for biomass-only boiler with automatic fuel supply and heat pump. 3.1.1.5 Industry sector In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the industry sector, it is crucial to implement cross-cutting measures based on EU legislation. In addition to the EU ETS, especially integrated pollution prevention and control, in accordance with Act No 76/2002, on integrated prevention, has a major contribution to reducing emissions. Emissions of fluorinated gases are regulated by Act No 73/2012, on ozone-depleting substances and on fluorinated greenhouse gases, and Implementing Decree No 257/2012, on the prevention of emissions of ozone-depleting substances and on fluorinated greenhouse gases, which transpose the relevant EU regulations. The achievement of climate and energy goals in the area of manufacturing industry, which includes, for example, the steel, chemical, ceramic, cement, glass, paper, brick and lime industries, is a separate and very complex issue. These industries have a particularly significant potential in this regard and this fact should be considered in the framework of creating national strategies and policies. It is mainly due to the specific needs of this sector and the great variety of technologies used and developed in it that this sector is not dealt with in detail in the submitted material. The prerequisite is the rapid development of an independent industrial policy of the Czech Republic for the period 20212030 with a view to 2050, which will address the sector in a comprehensive way, i.e. including maximising support (including state support) in developing and applying all technologies contributing to climate and energy goals, physical and price affordability of energy, maximum protection of competitiveness, etc. In this respect, Plan. 3.1.1.6 Energy sector The contribution of the energy sector to greenhouse gas emissions (or their reduction) is described in detail in other parts of this document. However, it is useful to emphasise the role of individual energy sources within the energy mix in reducing greenhouse gases. In this respect, it is useful to briefly describe the role of nuclear energy as an emission-free energy source (the role and expected development of other emission-free sources, especially renewable sources, is described in other parts of this document).  A total of 6 nuclear power units in the Temelín power plant and the Dukovany power plant are currently in operation in the Czech Republic. The key national strategy documents clearly state that the maintenance of the current share of nuclear energy in the energy mix and its further development is crucial for achieving the long-term low-emission commitments of the Czech Republic. The current State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic envisages increasing the share of nuclear energy in primary energy  -81-  sources to 2533 % (from the current level of about 15 %) and increasing its share in gross electricity production to 4658 % (from the current level of about 29 %). Following the approval of the State Energy Policy in the Czech Republic in May 2015, the National Action Plan for the Development of Nuclear Energy in the Czech Republic was approved in June 2015, which specifically elaborates on the requirement of the State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic to strengthen the role of nuclear energy. The strategic assignment is to ensure the continuity of operation of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant, which will have been in operation for 50 years in 2035. The process of obtaining key permits and preparation of both sites is currently under way. However, there has been no decision on the investment and financing model so far. The analytical parts of this document consider the further development of nuclear energy in accordance with the approved strategic documents. This development is relevant for the post-2030 period and will be updated, if necessary, together with the update/preparation of the next National Plan (for the period 20302040). ii. Where relevant, regional cooperation in this area The Czech Republic does not consider this area relevant at the National Plan level. More precisely, regional cooperation is regulated in detail at EU level and at the level of international institutions such as the UNFCCC. iii. Without prejudice to the applicability of State aid rules, financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds, in this area at national level, where applicable Reducing emissions outside the EU ETS is significantly facilitated by the support from EU funds for the development of renewable energy sources and improving energy efficiency, as described in Chapters 3.1.2 and 3.2 below. Operational Programme Transport 20142020 contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in transport, mainly supporting the development of transport infrastructure, which leads to a reduction in fuel and energy consumption. The Rural Development Programme 20142020 contributes to reducing emissions and increasing declines in the agricultural and forestry sectors by supporting agri-environmental and climate measures and modernising agricultural and forestry operations. Key national programmes include the above New Green Savings programme, funded from the revenues from the auctioning of emissions allowances, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions, primarily in the household sector. 3.1.2 Renewable energy i. Policies and measures to achieve the national contribution to the binding 2030 Union target for renewable energy and trajectories as referred to in point (a)(2) Article 4, and, where applicable or available, the elements referred to in point 2.1.2 of this Annex, including sector- and technology-specific measures53                                                            53 When planning these measures, Member States shall take into account the end of life of existing installations and the modernisation potential.  -82-  3.1.2.1 Existing policies for the promotion of renewable energy sources The following table summarises existing policies on renewable energy sources.

Source: Prepared by MIT for the purposes of the National Plan 3.1.2.2 Policies to ensure the achievement of renewable energy target by 2030 In order to meet its national contribution to the European RES target at 32 % by 2030, as set out in Chapter 2.1.2, the Czech Republic has amended Act No 165/2012, on supported energy sources. The policies proposed in this amendment can be seen as the main policies for ensuring the achievement of the transport target by 2030. Under Act No 165/2012, a new RES support scheme after 2020 is proposed, which should ensure progress towards the national contribution in this area. In this respect, however, it must be emphasised that this is only a draft amendment to the act, which still has to go through the legislative process of the Czech Republic, which usually lasts between one and two years. At present, the overall 2020 EU target for the share of energy from RES to total final energy consumption of is 20 %, as well as binding targets for individual Member States where the target for the Czech Republic is set at 13 %. This national target of the Czech Republic was already achieved in 2013 and in 2016 the Czech Republic reached the share of energy from RES to total final energy consumption of 14.89 %. Between 2021 and 2030, at least a 7 % increase in the share of energy from RES to final energy consumption will have to be achieved. However, this increase does not take into account the fact that 2028 in the case of electricity plants that are claiming and receiving operating support today, where the production of energy from renewable energy sources may terminate after the end of the current operating support for these plants, because without any operating support there is a risk that these plants will shut down. The risk of plant shutdowns and terminations may mean that without any further measures to  -84-  maintain and motivate these plants to stay in operation, certain types of outages may occur (an indication 2.1.2). The most high-risk plants are fuel sources using biomass and biogas. These sources currently account for 6.3 % of the share of energy from RES to total final energy consumption of the current share of energy from RES of 14.89 %. The 6.3 % does not include the production of heat in households, which accounts for another 5.04 % of the share of energy from RES out of 14.89 % of the current share of energy from RES, or the use of biofuels in transport. It is therefore essential to keep these plants in operation if their production is still sufficiently efficient; any further support to maintain production in these plants will be more effective in achieving the targets. If current plants are not kept in operation, it would be necessary from the present perspective (2016) to have new generating plants and facilities to provide more than 7 % by 2030. The setting and structure of the support system to ensure the achievement of energy targets from supported energy sources by 2030 in the draft amendment to the Supported Energy Act In order for the Czech Republic to be prepared for this situation, Act No 165/2012 proposes the preparation of tools and measures with appropriate forms of support for all supported energy sources. The selected approach is conceived as a comprehensive solution for the new support setting in the period 20212030 for the development of new RES sources as well as for the maintenance of energy-efficient plants that are currently in operation. In simple terms, this principle can be summarised as follows: a) modification of the current form of support for small sources up to 1 MW, where the support will no longer be used in the form of feed-in tariffs, but only in the form of an hourly green bonus. This - b) introduction of support through competitive tenders (auctions) for sources above 1 MW. This is a -legislation.  c) introducing a new form of support so that some existing sources can be maintained in operation and some other new sources can develop, and introducing new forms of support to ensure the required sectoral RES targets in heating and cooling. d) This involves the introduction of new forms of support in order to ensure the achievement of sectoral RES targets in transport required by the revised RES Directive. This involves the promotion of biomethane. 1. Adjustment of operating support for the construction of new plants in individual sectors  Support for electricity from renewable energy sources  The scope of support will only be for non-fuel sources (except PVPP) and landfill or sludge gas. Fuel sources were redirected to heat support to ensure the achievement of the RES target in the heating and cooling sector. The form of support for new electricity plants will be applied by an hourly green bonus, with a division into electricity plants, which will compete for the support in an auction. For sources up to 1 MW (6 MW for wind power) support will be provided in the form of a green bonus laid down in an ERO price decision and for sources above 1 MW, the support will be provided by means of auctions in  The duration of the support will remain unchanged  over the lifetime (20 or 30 years). Support for electricity from secondary energy sources  The scope of the support will be limited to mining gases. Waste heat will be supported through investment support and municipal waste incineration plants will be supported through heat generation.  -85-  The form of support for new electricity plants will be applied by a yearly green bonus, with a division into electricity plants, which will compete for the support in an auction. For sources up to 1 MW  support will be provided in the form of an annual green bonus officially laid down in an ERO price decision and for sources above 1 MW, support will be provided by means of auctions in the form of the  over the lifetime (15 years). Support for electricity from high-efficiency combined heat and power  -Support for CHP electricity will not be announced if other operating support is announced for the given type of supported energy source  for example, if operating support for RES electricity and operating support for SES electricity is announced, the support for CHP electricity will be announced only for non-renewables. The generating facility will only be able to use one type of operating support. The form of support for new electricity plants will be applied by a yearly green bonus, with a division into electricity plants, which will compete for the support in an auction. For sources up to 1 MW support will be provided in the form of an annual green bonus officially laid down in an ERO price decision and -efficiency cogeneration  over the lifetime (15 years).  Aid for heat from renewable energy sources  The scope of the support will be used to build new biogas, biomass and geothermal power plants and to compensate for fuel costs for RES compared to fuel costs for non-RES in the case of biomass and geothermal energy (this is not about supporting new plants, but about supporting heat to keep the heat plant in operation, see below). The form of the support will be determined by an annual green bonus. The duration of support for the construction of new biogas, biomass and geothermal energy plants will be set oafter the announcement of the support in a government decree. 2. New types and forms of support In order to maintain energy-efficient power and heat plants in operation, support will be put in place to maintain the plants in operation. Support for electricity to maintain the operation of a power-generating facility The support is intended to offset the difference between the price of biomass and the price of solid fossil non-RES fuels in biomass-fired power-generating facilities or operating costs and the market price of electricity and heat in a high-efficiency CHP power-generating facility, a secondary source power-generating facility. The form of the support will be determined by an hourly or annual green bonus. The duration of the support will be set at least 3 years after the announcement of the support in a government decree, and if the market situation is the same  i.e. the operating costs and the biomass price are higher than the market price of solid fossil non-RES fuels or the market price of electricity and heat. Support for heat to maintain the operation of a heat-generating facility Heat-generating facilities are subject to the same principle and rules as the above electricity support to maintain the operation of a power-generating facility. In the case of heat support to maintain the operation of a heat-generating facility, this support will also apply to the co-incineration of RES and  -86-  non-RES, it is the transition from electricity support to heat support. The form of the support will be determined in this case by an annual green bonus. Support for electricity to modernise a power-generating facility   The support is intended for electricity produced in a power-generating facility in which modernisation was carried out under the conditions laid down in the Implementing Decree. By using electricity support on the modernised power-generating facility, the right of electricity support which was created prior to the modernisation of the power plant terminates. The support applies to electricity produced in the power-generating facility meeting the conditions imposed on new plants. The support will be in the form of an hourly or yearly green bonus or auction bonus. The duration of the support will be for the lifetime of the power-generating facility; support may also be set for a shorter period of time.  New type of support to ensure the fulfilment of the RES target in the transport sector  support for biomethane In order to ensure the achievement of the RES target in the transport sector and the sub-target in this sector for advanced biofuels, it is necessary to introduce new support, which will initiate the production an annual green bonus over the lifetime (20 years). Operating support financing is proposed from the State budget, mainly from the savings for the support of RES electricity for biogas power-generating facilities which will be converted to biomethane plants. This support will set the following conditions: support for generating plants in the Czech Republic connected to the distribution or transmission system operated by a gas production licence holder in accordance with the quality requirements for biomethane, odourisation and measurement. At the same time, the same requirements as for the support of electricity and heat will apply, i.e. the registration of the plant and support in the OTE system or requirements for measuring and reporting the amount of biomethane etc. Preparations are underway to extend the issue of guarantees of origin for biomethane and to use their extended form for reporting the volume of biomethane production and consumption in the Czech Republic. The possibility of extending the issue of guarantees of origin for biomethane and the use of their extended form for reporting the volume of production and consumption of biomethane in the Czech Republic is also being analysed. 3. New forms of support  support by means of auction bonus The amendment to the Act introduces an adjustment in the provision of operating support for electricity from RES according to the Environmental and Energy State Aid Guidelines 20142020, which are very likely to be set for 20212030 and at the same time responds to the revised RES Directive. In both EU regulations, larger sources must tender the amount of operating support. A mandatory auction bonus is therefore introduced to support electricity from RES for generating facilities with a capacity exceeding 1 MW (with a capacity exceeding 6 MW or 6 units for wind power plants) and for CHP plants and secondary energy source plants with a capacity exceeding 1 MW. In the case of electricity generation plants, the auction bonus is tendered. In the case of the CHP and SES power-generating facilities, the generating facility is supported by the directly tendered annual auction bonus, in the case of a RES power-generating facility the producer is supported by an hourly auction bonus, which is determined as the difference between the reference price and the hourly market price of electricity. The support in the form of the auction bonus will be paid to the generating facility by OTE, a.s. The amendment to the Act contains provisions concerning the announcement of the auction, the evaluation of the tenders received, auction support contracts, the exercise and termination of the right under financial guarantee, the extinction of the right to support from the auction and the publication auction result. The auction may  -87-  be cancelled, but this action must be duly substantiated it must be determined whether the auction will be repeated. The act also provides details of the auction support contract. The MIT undertakes to ensure the provision of support in the amount and manner specified in the contract, and the producer undertakes to commission the power-generating facility or modernise it, keep it in operation and produce electricity under the conditions laid down by the contract and the law. An amendment to the contract may only be made in writing; it is not possible to change the tendered reference price or auction bonus.  4. New form of regulation of supported energy sources A new form of regulation in the law is set in several steps. The first step is to create the actual Integrated Plan with a forecast for 20212030. The Integrated Plan is implemented in accordance with a government decree, which will cover at least 3 subsequent years. The government decree (GD) is issued 12 months before the first year of the period defined in the government decree, and for the next period the government adds the values for the following period (year) by a decree. The right to the above forms of support for power-generating facilities, heat-generating facilities or biomethane-generating facilities commissioned from 1 January 2021 or for modernised generating facilities and generating facilities  there will no longer be an automatic statutory entitlement to support. The act also stipulates the content of the government decree, which will at least specify the types of supported sources, the types and forms of support, the types of facilities and the amount of installed capacity of power-, heat- and biomethane-generating facilities to be supported, the maximum amount of financial security and its form in the case of an auction, the definition of the types of supported energy sources (SES) which, in the case of auctions, cannot participate without a building permit or the determination of whether there will be a joint auction for new and modernised power-generating facilities, and the duration of the electricity support and heat support to maintain the operation of a power-generating facility and heat-generating facility. Effective regulation and control of the achievement of predicted and target values of energy from RES will be carried out every month by entering the data in OTE register. If the values are exceeded, the support for other generating facilities will no longer be provided. The amendment to the Act sets out the procedure and the process for the completion of generating facilities under construction. Relation between the new support scheme and the National Plans Any support for sources beyond 2020 will be linked to the implementation of the National Energy and Climate Plan (for 20212030). State support will be granted in such a way as to achieve the trajectory / the target point and control points specified in this document. The initiator for the use of appropriate tools to support RES (including SES) is the MIT, after identifying the possibility of non-compliance with the National Action Plans, which will always choose which form of support is most appropriate at the moment to ensure the achievement of the national RES target. In order to ensure predictability of the planned support for investors, in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027 the MIT will determine the expected timetable in relation to the expected allocation of total State aid (investment support + operating support, both in the form of officially determined support and in the form of auctions), covering the following three years. This timetable and the estimate of all the support provided for RES (and other SES) for the following 3 years will be set out in a government decree. The government decree will be sources, depending on the need for development and the achievement of targets. Figure 1: Relation between support scheme under amendment to Act No 165/2012 and National Plans  -88-   Source: Prepared by MIT for the purposes of the National Plan ii. Where relevant, specific measures for regional cooperation, as well as, as an option, the estimated excess production of energy from renewable sources which could be transferred to other Member States in order to achieve the national contribution and trajectories referred to in point 2.1.2  Specific measures in the field of regional cooperation may be identified as follows: (i) statistical transfer; (ii) projects of common interest; (iii) the Union Fund for RES; (iv) opening of support schemes; and (v) National Energy and Climate Plan; (vi) cross-border cooperation projects. Statistical transfer The Czech Republic does not currently plan on using a voluntary statistical transfer of production from domestic renewable sources to another Member State. Nevertheless, such a potential transfer should not be ruled out. However, the Czech Republic will primarily try to meet the contribution to the European target specified in Chapter 2.1.2. However, the development of renewable sources can of course exceed this target. In this case, statistical transfer of the Czech Republic (in the role of a RES share provider) to another Member State could be considered. The Czech Republic also does not plan on using the transfer that the Czech Republic is able to achieve it using national sources. Again, it is not sensibly to exclude the relevant use of statistical transfer in the event that it would not be possible to meet the stated objective on the basis of the domestic development of RES. Projects of Common Interest (PCI) / Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) projects The Czech Republic would also welcome its potential involvement in RES-related projects of common interest (PCI) or projects supported by the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). At this point, however, it is not possible to provide more specific information. Projects of common interest also depend to a large extent on the interest of investors and the availability of suitable sites.  European RES Fund The Czech Republic also does not rule out its involvement in the European RES Fund. However, the exact functioning of this fund is not yet fully defined; therefore, it is not possible to provide more specific information in this respect. Obligation to define and publish a long-term schedule in relation to the expected allocation of support under the Promotion of Renewable Energy Sources Directive 2025 2020 2030 2021 2022 2023 2024 2026 2027 2028 2029 Horizon of the first National Climate and Energy Plan Reference point Reference point Progress evaluation of  2023 in 2025  Progress evaluation  of 2025 in 2027 Reference point  -89-  Opening of support schemes The legislative framework for the opening of support schemes is laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, in particular Article 5 thereof. The Directive states that Member States may allow participation in renewable electricity support schemes for producers located in other Member States. When making available support schemes for renewable electricity, Member States may provide that the aid for the indicative share of the newly supported capacity or the budget allocated to it is made available each year to producers located in other Member States. These indicative shares may reach at least 5 % each year between 2023 and 2026 and at least 10 % between 2027 and 2030 or the level of electricity network interconnection of the Member State concerned in any given year, whichever is the lower. The Czech Republic reflected the above legislative framework in the preparation of the amendment to Act No 165/2012, on supported energy sources (the Directive was not effective when the amendment was being prepared). If necessary, the above Article will be further transposed into national legislation by 30 June 2021. National Energy and Climate Plan The Czech Republic considers the preparation of the National Energy and Climate Plan to be a measure for regional cooperation in the field of RES in itself. On the basis of this planning document, it will be possible to compare the planned approaches of individual Member States and, where appropriate, to identify opportunities for joint RES projects or cross-border impacts of individual policies. Cross-border cooperation projects We can specifically mention the RESINDUSTRY project, which aims, inter alia, to exchange best practices in setting up subsidy programmes. The Czech Republic, Spain, Malta, Austria, Poland, Estonia and Finland are involved in this project56. iii. Specific measures on financial support, where applicable, including Union support and the use of Union funds, for the promotion of the production and use of energy from renewable sources in electricity, heating and cooling, and transport  Financial support for the development of renewable sources can be divided into three basic groups:  Measures paid by the owners and constructors of buildings without support  measures and instruments based on the option of energy generating facilities by owners and constructors of building as part of meeting the requirements for energy performance of buildings, and gradual tightening of these requirements up to nearly zero-energy buildings.   Investment support  maximum use if the Czech Republic has sufficient funding from EU funds or, if available, earmarked funding (for more information, see Chapter 3.2). In addition, the ETS-related instruments will be used to support RES investments. (for more detailed information on the revenues from the auctioning of emission allowances and their potential use, see Chapter 3.2, part viii.).  Operating support  support will be provided for certain types of RES whose production cost is currently higher than the market price and investment support alone will not ensure their further development. For biomass and biogas sources, support will be provided to the maximum possible energy efficiency of using this primary fuel, i.e. methane production and power generation in a high-                                                           56 For more information see the following link.  -90-  efficiency CHP facility. This support will also be used to cover the fuel cost difference, as the amount of support will be determined so as to offset the increased cost of purchasing RES fuel compared to fossil fuel or to offset the increased cost of producing RES energy compared to the market price of energy.

Where applicable, the assessment of the support for electricity from renewable sources that Member States are to carry out in accordance with Article 6(4) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001  In accordance with the requirements of the Promotion of Renewable Energy Sources Directive, the Czech Republic shall, at least every five years, assess the effectiveness of its national support schemes for electricity from renewable sources and their effects on different consumer groups and on investments. The results of this assessment will be taken into account in the long-term planning (as may be indicated in the update of the National Plan) and the results may be reported and commented on in the progress reports in accordance with the requirements of the Energy Union Governance and Climate Action Regulation. v. Specific measures to introduce one or more contact points, streamline administrative procedures, provide information and training, and facilitate the uptake of power purchase agreements Summary of the policies and measures under the enabling framework Member States have to put in place pursuant to Article 21(6) and Article 22(5) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 to promote and facilitate the development of self-consumption and renewable energy communities Simplifying administrative procedures The newly set-up building law processes should aim to simplify, accelerate and streamline administrative processes related to issuing building permits. Priority should therefore be given to the                                                            58  The State budget contribution for RES support is partly financed using the revenues from the sale of emission allowances. 11.70011.70011.70015.70015.70026.18526.1855.9006.4005.8002.0001.9001.9001.90005.00010.00015.00020.00025.00030.0002011201220132014201520162017CZK millionAmount of state budget contributionAmount of solar payment -92-  reduction of any administrative procedures leading to the permitting of buildings, focusing on having a single administrative procedure. Such a procedure should result in a single permitting decision replacing all the partial decisions of building authorities (land-use permit and building permit), and the decisions of other administrative bodies and authorities concerned issued in accordance with the applicable legislation. The purpose should be to remove the chain of administrative procedures and, subsequently, administrative decisions, and thus reduce the possibility of appealing against individual decisions and subsequent actions brought before administrative courts. One permitting decision will include all the existing aspects of the land-use permit and will be extended to include some aspects that are currently part of the building permit (construction and technical aspects); it will be issued on the basis of new building documentation with newly defined content and scope (simpler documentation). Subsequently, the commencement of construction. After completing the construction, the builder submits the as-built permit. Throughout the process, public interests would be monitored by authorised persons (designer, building manager, technical supervisor of the builder). The entire management process will focus on concentration, with the obligation of the parties, the authorities concerned and the public concerned to put forward their comments on the project as soon as possible, with penalties for non-compliance with that obligation, i.e. disregarding later objections or comments. The assumption is that this single permitting decision, which includes all the permits required to implement a project, will be issued by a single building authority, which will conduct the permitting procedure and issue a decision. The basic Act. It is anticipated that, to the maximum extent possible, the relevant authorities defending public interests in accordance with special legislation will be integrated into the new system of state building administration. The concerned authorities which will not be integrated will submit observations for the purposes of proceedings under the new Building Act. Regarding the issue of computerisation, building authorities will be able to use an entirely new IT system to handle a significant part of their activities electronically, including electronic submission of forms and documentation and other documents relevant to the procedure. Unifying all document formats and creating an information system for electronic procedures before building authorities will reduce administrative burden and streamline activities, both financially and in terms of time. At the same time, it would increase the efficiency of public administration, thus increasing the international competitiveness of the Czech Republic. It would also increase the transparency of all the agenda processes in the entire Czech Republic, as well as the mutual coordination of the individual authorities concerned, persons concerned or the possibility of monitoring statistical data. By standardisation and building a unified information system, building authorities will be able to provide higher quality services. By the end of January 2020, a sectional draft of the new Building Act should be submitted to the Government, and a new Building Act should be published in the Collection of Laws by the end of 2020, with individual provisions expected to gradually come into effect during 2021.59 Encouraging and facilitating the development of renewable energy self-consumption and renewable energy communities The Czech Republic will establish a framework to support and facilitate the development of the -legislative measures. This framework will be developed on the basis of an evaluation of existing barriers to the                                                            59  The information given in this subchapter is drawn from the factual intent of the new Building Act, approved by Government Resolution No 448 on 26 June 2019.  -93-  development of community energy and will include specific objectives, plans and policies. In this context, the EU directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources will be transposed into the Czech legal system, which will strengthen the rights of community energy participants and lead to the expansion of a number of related projects. can also be seen as a community for renewable energy sources. However, specific support settings cannot be anticipated at this point. Some partial information and assumptions about funding in this area are provided in Chapter 5.3.  vi. Assessment of the necessity to build new infrastructure for district heating and cooling produced from renewable sources Heat supply systems represent energy infrastructure that is necessary for the efficient use of heat from renewable and secondary energy sources which are impossible or inefficient to be acquired and used separately in individual buildings (less valuable biomass, biogas from biowaste, geothermal energy, waste heat from industrial processes, etc.). The use of locally available heat sources contributes to the decentralisation of the energy sector, reduces dependence on fossil fuel imports and strengthens the local economy.  The Czech Republic has a developed heating sector that needs to be gradually transformed for the use of low-carbon energy sources, including energy from secondary sources and waste heat, and their transport to consumers, especially in urban agglomerations.  sources in existing heat supply systems will be crucial. The Czech Republic therefore plans to support mainly the modernisation of existing heat supply systems in order to meet the requirements for efficient energy supply systems under the Energy Efficiency Directive. However, there is also room for the creation of new (especially smaller) renewable heat supply systems, for example through the use of heat from biogas stations, which today are mostly used only for electricity generation and potentially have a large amount of heat produced from renewable sources. The solution could be the conversion of existing biogas power plants to biomethane plants and the use of biomethane for CHP in a place using heat. vii. Where applicable, specific measures on the promotion of the use of energy from biomass, especially for new biomass mobilisation taking into account: (i) biomass availability, including sustainable biomass: both domestic potential and imports from third countries; (ii) other biomass uses by other sectors (agriculture and forest-based sectors); as well as measures for the sustainability of biomass production and use The following measures can be considered as measures on the promotion of the use of energy from biomass:  Investment support  operational programmes and State programmes   New Green Savings (Ministry of the Environment)  OP E 2014 2020 (Ministry of Environment and Regions)  Operational programmes  Operational programme Enterprise and Innovation for Competitiveness (Ministry of Industry and Trade)  Operational Programme Environment (OP E) (Ministry of the Environment)  Exemption from real estate tax (in accordance with Act No 338/1992) for selected groups of sources (geothermal energy sources including heat pumps, solar collectors and biomass energy sources)  -94-   Indirect support by promoting cogeneration from renewable energy sources  Direct operating support of renewable heat in accordance with Act No 165/2012.  Higher charges for landfilled municipal waste, prohibition of landfilling of recoverable waste The implementation of appropriate measures leading to an efficient and effective use of the biomass energy potential in the Czech Republic is described in the Action Plan for Biomass in the Czech Republic60. For detailed information regarding the availability of biomass, see Chapter 2.1.2. 3.1.3 Other elements of this dimension i. Where applicable, national policies and measures affecting the EU ETS sector and assessment of the complementarity and impacts on the EU ETS The EU ETS is partly affected by the promotion of the production of electricity from renewable sources and energy savings in final consumption, leading to a reduction in the demand for emission allowances in installations within the EU ETS.  Energy savings programmes (such as New Green Savings) are gradually influencing the EU ETS in terms of the number of installations included in the system. About 30 % of the approximately 300 installations are just above the thermal input threshold for inclusion in the EU ETS (20 MW). Energy consumption, including heat off-take from central heat supply systems within the EU ETS, is decreasing due to the programmes, and these installations are gradually forced to shut down oversized low-efficiency solid fossil fuel boilers and replace them with a new appropriate source such as natural gas. This reduces the applicable heat input below the 20 MW threshold and the facility ceases to fall within the EU ETS. Since 2013, this has annually eliminated an average of five installations from the EU ETS, and this trend is gradually accelerating. ii. Policies and measures to achieve other national targets, where applicable Policies and measures to achieve national targets are detailed in other parts of this document. The Czech Republic considers it relevant to mention in this section the plans and measures to adapt to climate change. lution No 861 of 26 October 2015. The document has been prepared for 20152020 with the view to 2030. It is the result of inter-ministerial cooperation, with the Ministry of the Environment being responsible for the overall coordination. The aim of the Adaptation Strategy of the Czech Republic is to adapt to the impacts of climate change as much as possible, to maintain good living conditions and to preserve and potentially improve the economic potential for future generations.  The Adaptation Strategy of the Czech Republic identifies the following priority areas (sectors), which are expected to be most affected by climate change. These sectors are forestry, agriculture, water regime in the landscape and water management, urbanised landscape, biodiversity and ecosystem services,                                                            60  The document is available at: http://eagri.cz/public/web/mze/zivotni-prostredi/obnovitelne-zdroje-energie/biomasa/akcni-plan-pro-biomasu/akcni-plan-pro-biomasu-v-cr-na-obdobi.html  -95-  health and hygiene, tourism, transport, industry and energy, emergencies and the protection of the population and the environment.  Continuous implementation of the Adaptation Strategy of the Czech Republic will be evaluated in 2019 and then every 4 years. The Adaptation Strategy of the Czech Republic is implemented by the National Action Plan for Resolution No 34 of 16 January 2017. The Action Plan elaborates the measures outlined in the Adaptation Strategy of the Czech Republic into specific tasks, assigning responsibilities, implementation deadlines, relevance of measures concerning individual climate change manifestations and sources of funding.  The Action Plan is structured on the basis of climate change manifestations such as long-term drought, rising temperatures, extreme meteorological phenomena and natural fires. Given that these phenomena cut across sectors, inter-ministerial cooperation is needed to prevent and address negative impacts, in order to ensure coordination of the implementation of adaptation measures across sectors. The Action Plan contains 33 specific targets and 1 cross-cutting target on education, training and awareness-raising. The individual targets are pursued by 52 priority measures and 160 tasks. The 34 specific targets include a total of 350 tasks, of which 160 are priority 1 tasks, 150 are priority 2 tasks and 40 tasks fall under the cross-cutting education and training target. As an EU Member State, the Czech Republic is committed to common EU targets and is actively involved in negotiating the adaptation policy within the EU. The Adaptation Strategy of the Czech Republic is in line with the EU Adaptation Strategy. iii. Policies and measures to achieve low emission mobility (including electrification of transport) 3.1.3.1 National Action Plan for Clean Mobility61 National Action Plan for Clean Mobility Policies and measures to support the development of low emission mobility are contained, in particular, in the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility 20152018 with a view to 2030 (NAP CM). The NAP CM is based on the requirement of Directive 2014/94/EU on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to adopt the relevant national policy framework for the development of alternative fuels markets in the transport sector and related infrastructure. The NAP CM deals with electromobility, CNG, LNG and also with hydrogen technology (or fuel cell technology)62. Due to the direct link to Directive 2014/94/EU, this document applies primarily to those alternative fuels for which that Directive requires the Member States to define national targets for the development of the relevant charging and filling station infrastructure within the above national framework, where this is considered desirable (see area of hydrogen filling stations). This focus of the NAP CM is also in line with the effort to support primarily technologies that are currently on the brink of full commercial use. The NAP CM contains a total of 49 specific measures, including the determination of the deadline and responsibilities, which are divided into the following thematic areas: (i) legal/legislative measures; (ii) direct incentives to purchase alternative fuel vehicles; (iii) tax incentives; (iv) non-financial incentives                                                            61  The document is available at: https://www.mpo.cz/cz/prumysl/zpracovatelsky-prumysl/automobilovy-prumysl/narodni-akcni-plan-ciste-mobility--167456/ 62  The update also partially addresses other alternative fuels, such as LPG / bio-LPG, synthetic fuels and ammonia-based fuels.  -96-  on the demand side (including related administrative measures); (v) research, technological development and demonstration; (vi) other measures. The implementation of the NAP CM is continuously monitored and evaluated; the outputs from this evaluation are included in the annual reports, which are submitted to the Government of the Czech Republic for approval/information by 30 June of each year. Table 43 shows a comprehensive summary of the development of clean mobility based on the document Information on the implementation of the measures under the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP CM) for 2017.

In order to provide the most up-to-date information, below is, among other things, the information from this proposal, but it should be stressed that this is not an approved version of the document; it is still subject to change and the formulation do not anticipate the final version of this document. At the beginning of 2020, the NAP CM Update should be submitted for approval to the Czech Government. This document will then be provided to the representatives of the European Commission.68 Beyond the NAP CM there are also some other strategic materials that contain measures and policies aimed at achieving more extensive development of low emission mobility. These include, for example,                                                            63  Plug-in hybrids were not independently monitored before 2018. According to 2018 statistics, it can be estimated that plug-in hybrids account for less than 10 % of total hybrid registrations. 64  Electrical engineering Industry Association (270 stations and 631 available charging points) 65  This is a moderately optimistic scenario (Option 1) 66  The filling station was in trial mode. 67  This is a moderately optimistic scenario (Option 1) 68  The information below is from the NAP CM Update, in order to keep the National Plan as up-to-date as possible. However, it should be stressed that at the time of preparation of the National Plan it is still unapproved material that may still be subject to partial changes during the approval process.  -97-  the Action Plan for the Future of the Automotive Industry in the Czech Republic69, or the Memorandum on Long-Term Cooperation in the Development of Natural Gas Vehicles 202570. 3.1.3.2 Electromobility Expected development Chart 13  shows a baseline scenario for the development of electromobility until 2040 with a detailed focus on the period until 2025 that was formulated as a part of the NAP CM in 2015. Chart 14 then shows the prediction of the development of electromobility prepared by the Car Importers Association for the purpose of NAP CM Update. Here, the number of clean electric vehicles (BEVs) in the streets is estimated at 217 200 vehicles by 2030, which is about 3 % of the fleet. At the same time, this objective corresponds to the medium-term forecast prepared for the purposes of the NAP SG. For the purpose of setting the strategic electromobility development goal within the NAP CM Update, an interval was chosen that corresponds to reaching a number of 220 000 to 500 000 electric vehicles (BEV) in the streets by 2030. The upper limit of the interval represents approximately 7 % share of electric vehicles (BEV) in the Czech fleet. The estimate of the development of the number of electric buses in the Czech fleet in 2030 corresponds to a level of approximately 800 to 1 200 units (without trolleybuses). It is also desirable to focus on the introduction of electromobility in the freight transport segment at least in the medium term. The NAP CM or the NAP CM Update indicate the specific measures needed to ensure the above development. Chart 13: Baseline scenario of electromobility development in the Czech Republic according to NAP CM (thousands of vehicles)  Source: National Action Plan for Clean Mobility                                                            69  The document is available at: https://www.vlada.cz/assets/media-centrum/aktualne/Akcni-plan-o-budoucnosti-automobiloveho-prumyslu-v-CR.pdf 70  The document is available at: https://www.mpo.cz/assets/cz/prumysl/2018/5/Memorandum-CNG.pdf  -98-  Chart 14: Number of BEVs prediction according to CIA  Source: Car Importers Association for the purposes of the NAP CM Update Charging infrastructure When estimating the electric vehicle market at the target level for the above vehicles, taking into account the expected factors (increase of charging stations performance, building of charging hubs, share of public and non-public charging), the need for public charging stations is expected to be such as to allow a supply of 1 000  1 500 GWh of electricity/year (low), up to 2 000  3 000 GWh of electricity/year (high) by 2030. In order to develop electromobility at the level of 220 thousand, the NAP CM Update quantifies the need for publicly accessible infrastructure in 2025 at 6 200 charging points and 19 000 charging points in 2030. Achieving development in the amount of 500 thousand vehicles then corresponds to the need of 11 000 charging points in 2025 and 35 000 charging points in 203071. The initial demand for public charging stations in the medium and high scenarios can also by satisfied by the involvement of DSOs, provided that this could not be ensured by market means and subject to meeting the conditions laid down by Article 33 of Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for electricity. Link to increasing the share of RES in the transport sector The developments in electromobility and future electricity consumption in the transport sector are also very important in terms of contributing to the 14 % target of share of renewable energy in transport. In 2016, total electricity consumption in transport amounted to 1 636 GWh, with the rail transport accounting for the vast majority (94 %). In line with the possibility to use the European renewable energy mix in dividing electricity production into renewable and non-renewable components in line with                                                            71  Within the NAP CM Update, these charging infrastructure values are also divided into more detailed performance-based intervals. 050.000100.000150.000200.000250.000201320142015201620172018201920202021202220232024202520262027202820292030NumberYearly increase of el. vehiclesTotal number of el. vehicles -99-  the current text of the Directive, the total electricity consumption of RES in transport totalled 449 GWh in 2016. In 2016, electricity from RES in transport accounted for 1.6 % of the total of 6.42 %. Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources brought many partial changes. These include, in particular, the change in the rail transport multiplier from 2.5 times to 1.5 times. Furthermore, the change in the road transport multiplier from 5 times to 4 times, the implicit limitation of the possibility to use the European mix72 and the addition of other fuels to be included in the denominator. Based on the analyses carried out by the Czech Republic, the contribution of electricity consumption in transport in 2030 is expected at 0.8 %73. This corresponds to the total electricity consumption in road transport at approximately 419.8 GWh74 (including trolleybus transport), where approximately 67.5 GWh corresponds to the share of renewable electricity, assuming an approximate 16.1 % share of RES in electricity by 2030 (this share corresponds to the methodology for the period -, i.e. the share in 2028). This is an increase of about 350.8 GWh compared to the current situation (in 2016 the electricity consumption in road transport was 69 GWh  the vast majority of which was attributed to trolleybus transport). Chart 15 It shows the target consumption of electricity in road transport depending on the share of RES in the national electricity mix. Chart 16 then shows the dependence of the electricity consumption in road transport on the development of consumption in rail transport (assuming a 16 % share of RES in the electricity mix), which amounted to 1 536 GWh in 2016.  The strategic objective of the NAP CM Update is to achieve 220500 thousand electric vehicles (BEV) in 2030 (see above). Based on the material prepared for the purposes of NAP SG, it is stated below that the consumption of 200.65 thousand passenger electric cars, which is approximately comparable to the lower limit of the interval defined in the NAP CM Update, corresponds to approximately 296.5 GWh (this depends, of course, on the accepted assumptions). In this case, in order to achieve a 14 % transport sector contribution to the RES share target, the other segments, namely bus transport and the commercial vehicle category, would need to develop at around 120 GWh to reach 420 GWh. If the development exceeds the minimum value of the NAP CM Update interval, the contribution of electricity consumption in the transport sector to the fulfilment of the RES share in this sector should be fulfilled or even exceeded, which may compensate for insufficient development in other segments or in this case, a higher proportion than the indicated 14 % may be achieved.                                                            72  In the opinion of the Czech Republic, this unfairly discriminates against countries which meet their RES targets primarily in the heating and cooling sector compared to countries with a higher RES share in the electricity sector, which may also lead to a lower motivation for the development of electromobility if this development is seen strictly as an instrument for meeting renewable energy targets. Also, the Czech Republic believes that the prohibition to use the European mix was not sufficiently discussed and the impact of this change was not sufficiently considered. 73  The conservative value compared to the current contribution to the 1.6 % share is mainly due to changes in the parameters of the Directive, which relatively reduce the share of electricity from RES. 74  This is a decrease compared to the value of 551.3 GWh, which was provided in the Draft National Plan due to an increase in the share of RES and, in particular, an increase in the share of RES in the electricity sector.  -100-  Chart 15: Contribution of road transport necessary for progress towards the RES target depending on the share of electricity from RES  Source: Prepared by MIT for the purposes of the National Plan Chart 16: Necessary contribution of road transport for the progress towards the RES target depending on consumption in rail transport (for 16 % RES share)  Source: Prepared by MIT for the purposes of the National Plan Development of electromobility in terms of network infrastructure development 490,2453,2419,0387,1357,4329,6303,7279,5256,779,876,973,971,068,165,162,259,356,3010020030040050060014,0%14,5%15,0%15,5%16,0%16,5%17,0%17,5%18,0%GWhShare of RES in electricity production in the Czech RepublicNon-renewable energy shareRenewable energy share368,7360,8357,4353,0345,1337,270,268,768,167,265,764,20501001502002503003504004505001.5001.5251.5361.5501.5751.600GWhElectricity consumption in rail transportNon-renewable energy shareRenewable energy share -101-  Another relevant document in the field of the future development of electromobility is the National Action Plan for Smart Grids with its accompanying materials. This is, in particular, a study for the purposes of the National Action Plan for Smart Grids, which focuses, among other things, on analysing the measures necessary to ensure the readiness of distribution systems. These values then also constitute the default data for the respective network models. The medium development scenario reflects the lower limit of the interval defined in the NAP CM Update and roughly corresponds to it.

The development of the CNG car fleet, despite the decrease in sales in 2018 and in the first half of 2019, caused by the lack of CNG cars on the Czech market, has been growing by about 30 % year-on-year for a long time. There are currently around 23 000 natural gas vehicles in the Czech Republic (see Table 47). The average year-on-year growth of the vehicle fleet has long been maintained at 32 %. The number of CNG buses has been growing every year thanks to the use of grants for their purchase, and there are currently 1 300 of them in operation, which represents more than 6 % of the Czech fleet. The issue  -102-  parking the CNG cars in collective underground garages remains one of the significant barriers affecting their development. The infrastructure of CNG filling stations is developing every year. There are currently 199 public CNG filling stations in the Czech Republic, as well as about 50 non-public CNG filling stations and about 200 in-home slow filling stations. More than 60 % of public dispensing points are found in gas stations, others are accessible at company premises or as stand-alone dispensing points. Private companies and some transport companies operate non-public CNG filling stations, of which there are over 50. Companies and small traders also use slow CNG filling equipment (home filling machines), of which there are more than 200. The average year-on-year growth is 25 %.  The development of LNG infrastructure is still in its infancy in the Czech Republic. There is one public LNG station and several LNG mobile filling stations, mainly used by companies to test LNG-powered trucks. However, it is important that there is currently a project being prepared with the subsequent implementation of 13 new LNG public filling stations, which will be created by 2022 thanks to the subsidy support of the Ministry of Transport within the Operational Programme Transport. The potential and use of biomethane, both in the form of bioCNG and bioLNG, is also an integral part of this issue. In the long run, this is a key issue, since biomethane has significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions than fossil CNG and LNG. The gradual replacement of fossil CNG and LNG with biomethane is essential for the environmental benefits of this alternative fuel.   Table 47: Number of filling stations, vehicles and CNG sales  2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Public filling stations 32 34 45 50 75 108 143 164 185 Vehicles total 2 500 3 250 4 300 6 300 8 055 12 000 15 500 18 900 22 600 Passenger cars 2 112 2 807 3 818 5 747 7 205 10 750 13 970 17 160 20 660 Buses 300 336 362 404 518 820 1 020 1 120 1 234 CNG sales (m³) 10.058 12.089 15.242 21.952 29.912 43.589 59.346 67.603 75.832 CNG sales growth (%) 24.4 20.2 26.0 44.0 36.3 45.7 36.1 13.9 12.2 Source: CNG4you Chart 17 shows the expected development of the number of natural gas vehicles based on the NAP CM Update. In the case of natural gas, it is a range of approximately 26 000 to 55 000 vehicles by 2030, of which the LNG segment should represent a market of 3 500 to 6 900 vehicles during this period. The expected development of the number of natural gas vehicles is significantly more conservative than the corresponding target contained in the original NAP CM. This is a reaction, among other things, to the current developments in the field of European legislation, which is pushing manufacturers to develop emission-free vehicles.  -103-  Chart 17: Development of the number of natural gas vehicles with a view to 2050  Source: Czech Gas Association for the purposes of preparing the NAP CM Update According to the strategic objectives of the NAP CM Update, the development of the CNG vehicle market should reach 35 000 vehicles by 2030. In the case of LNG vehicles, the aim of the NAP CM Update is to reach 5 000 vehicles by 2030. This development is of course conditioned by a number of factors, which are described in more detail in the NAP CM Update. With regard to the expected further development of the CNG car fleet in the Czech Republic, the NAP CM Update expects an infrastructure of approximately 350 to 400 public CNG filling stations by 2030. With respect to LNG, the NAP CM Update aims to reach 30 LNG filling stations. While it can be expected that the projected development of the CNG infrastructure may already happen on a purely market basis (i.e. without any public support), the development of LNG infrastructure may need to be supported at least partially from public sources. If natural gas in the transport segment is to be perceived by the general public as an environmentally friendly fuel, it is necessary to gradually replace it with advanced biomethane, which is also related to meeting the targets for increasing the share of RES in the transport sector under Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (see Chapter 4.2.2, part (ii)). Therefore, the development of biomethane production and its application in the transport sector in the Czech Republic is one of the strategic objectives of the NAP CM Update. The NAP CM or the NAP CM Update indicate the specific measures needed to ensure the above development. 3.1.3.4 Hydrogen mobility As mentioned above, the original NAP CM focuses on the use of hydrogen in transport rather marginally. The reason is that in 2015, when this document was being prepared, there was no hydrogen vehicle registered in the Czech Republic, and that the only hydrogen station in the Czech Republic is not publicly accessible and is used primarily for a single hydrogen bus operated under the project Tr2015. Nevertheless, the NAP CM declares the interest of the Czech Republic to include hydrogen in the national policy framework for alternative fuels in transport under Directive 2014/94/EU on the implementation of alternative fuels infrastructure. This is evidenced by the target set by the Czech Republic for the development of hydrogen filling stations. According to this document, 35 stations should be built in the Czech Republic by 2025. This is the initial target, with the NAP CM expecting it to increase in the future, based on a study that would more fully assess the potential of hydrogen mobility in the Czech Republic. The NAP CM also notes that hydrogen mobility should be supported by the same  -104-  measures development of infrastructure for hydrogen filling stations should be stimulated, for example by investment support. Similarly, it is assumed that hydrogen vehicles will enjoy from the same benefits as electric vehicles, whether in terms of parking in cities or the use of preferential lanes. These vehicles are also assumed to be exempt from paying the motorway toll charges. In order to realise these benefits, hydrogen vehivehicles) will begin in April 2019. The task of the NAP CM regarding the study of hydrogen mobility opportunities in the Czech Republic was fulfilled in 2017, when the study was prepared for the Ministry of Transport by Grant Thornton Advisory75. This study contains 4 scenarios of possible long-term development in the area of hydrogen mobility in the Czech Republic, with the baseline scenario considered the most realistic. This scenario envisages that there should be 115 886 hydrogen passenger cars and 1 091 hydrogen buses in 2030. The study also states that one of the main requirements for the development of hydrogen mobility is the existence of a functioning and safe filling station infrastructure. However, its costs cannot be expected, at least in the initial phase, to be borne exclusively by private operators. It is therefore desirable for the State to actively support the construction of both public filling stations for ordinary citizens and the non-public part of the hydrogen infrastructure for public transport or municipal services. In view of this, within the f-programme to support hydrogen stations be doubled compared to the original plan (CZK 100 million).  On the basis of the simulation of possible future scenarios for hydrogen vehicle market development, the study includes the prediction of the number of vehicles and hydrogen filling stations for the years 2025, 2030 and 2050. The model outputs of this study clearly show that if at least the baseline development scenario is to be achieved, at least 12 hydrogen filling stations should be built in the Czech Republic by 2025. For this reason, in the future update of the NAP CM, the Ministry of Transport should adjust the national target of the number of hydrogen filling stations from the current 35 to 12 stations. should form the basis for the Ministry of Transport to update the NAP CM. It was subsequently submitted for information to the Government of the Czech Republic. In 2018, some parts of the study (including prediction in the baseline scenario) were further updated. Future update of the NAP CM can see further refinement of developments in this area.

The NAP CM Update is based on the above study and aims to achieve a range of 4050 thousand passenger hydrogen vehicles by 2030 in the field of hydrogen mobility. This represents approximately one quarter of the battery electromobility objective. At the same time, the NAP CM aims to reach 95 hydrogen buses by 2025 and 870 hydrogen buses by 2030. In the area of freight transport, it is not yet possible to set such a specific objective, as the above study did not address the area. The target value for 2025 within the Czech Republic is the construction of 15 hydrogen filling stations. Up to 80 hydrogen filling stations should be built by 2030, and this objective may be further specified in the next NAP CM Update following further developments in the hydrogen vehicle market not only in the Czech Republic but also throughout the EU. 3.1.3.5 Other alternative fuels Other alternative fuels include, in particular, LPG / bioLPG, synthetic fuels and ammonia-based fuels. The NAP CM Update deals with these fuels in more detail, especially in the accompanying analytical material. The following text provides information on expected / possible development only for bioLPG, because bioLPG is the fuel that is most likely to develop among those from the alternative fuels category, at least in the medium term, when compared to other alternative fuels such as synthetic fuels and ammonia-based fuels. In the Czech Republic, alternative fuels from renewable sources can temporarily play a very important role in reducing CO2 production due to the age of the car fleet, the renewal of which is not happening fast enough. LPG / bio LPG Fossil LPG With regard to the way in which LPG is obtained (it is pr % of the product produced), LPG is considered as a product whose consistent availability on the market will last for as long as other fossil fuels are available. The decline in its availability can be expected only after a reduction in the supply of fossil fuels to the European market. BioLPG A gradual increase in the supply of bioLPG is expected after 2020. BioLPG is created as a by-product in the production of HVO (i.e. essentially waste, as in the case of conventional LPG). New technologies are also being tested for the direct production of bioLPG from waste cellulose, and it can be assumed that other production methods will follow.  -106-  Specifics of LPG / bioLPG utilisation on the Czech market The advantage of LPG on the Czech market is a fully developed distribution infrastructure (about 900 petrol stations) and a high popularity of this fuel (about 170 000 vehicles). The main potential of this fuel is in the conversions of older vehicles with worse emissions parameters. LPG can thus partially address the emissions of the older fleet for a large part of drivers who do not  and who constantly use cars of an above-average age. At present, LPG is used almost exclusively in passenger cars and small municipal vehicles. Some development projects (e.g. in Spain, USA) test the further use of LPG in heavy vehicles (e.g. buses). These can be expected to appear very quickly in the Czech Republic as well, because unlike in other alternative technologies there is no need to develop the supply infrastructure. LPG (propane-butane) as an energy source for households LPG is used in households as a source for heat production (bulk, in limited cases bottles) or cooking (bottles), in the Czech Republic it is about 80 000 tonnes per year. LPG is an effective alternative in places not connected to natural gas distribution. The advantages of using LPG are again lower emissions (compared to local solid fuel furnaces) and easy handling. Product availability, as well as experience in this area if consumers are encouraged to switch to cleaner fuels. Future of bioLPG 2050+ BioLPG development projects focus on waste recovery. In terms of GHG, it is an emission-neutral source. Current LPG RDE tests also show very low pollutant emissions, so it is a source that is suitable for long-term use also in inhabited areas. The ease of use is also facilitated by the good fuel storability, the long range of the vehicle and minimal technical constraints in production / conversion (a relatively lightweight and well-placeable tanks compared to CNG)  Possible restriction Like any other alternative fuels, LPG is accepted by the market thanks to tax relief (the current tax rate in the Czech Republic copies the minimum requirements of the EU). The consumption forecast has been prepared on the assumption of keeping the existing tax burden / the LPG tax ratio relative to other available classical or alternative fuels unchanged. Any unilateral increase in the tax on LPG would result in a reduction in the consumption of this fuel. 3.1.3.6 Requirements of Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding the achievement of a 14 % share of RES in the transport sector According to Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, energy suppliers for the transport sector must collectively achieve a 14 % share of energy from renewable sources in a given Member State by 2030. The share of first-generation biofuels must not be higher than 7 % (2020 + 1 %, maximum 7 %), the share of advanced biofuels and biogas must be at least 3.5 % in 2030 (at least 0.2 % in 2022; at least 1 % in 2025). The Czech Republic is trying to break down this target by the suppliers of individual types of individual types of transport fuels, for which certain mandatory percentages of RES will be prescribed, by means of the prepared changes of national legislation. At the same time, the use of first-generation biofuels will be utilised to the maximum extent possible, while respecting both the technical parameters of the quality of individual fuels given by normative documents and the possibility  -107-  of actual use of the fuels in question given by the fleet in the Czech Republic, which is quite obsolete (average fleet age in 2018 was 14.75 years) and its renewal is slow.  Car manufacturers will also have a significant impact on the use of individual fuels in transport in the coming years, where Regulation (EU) 2019/631 of the European Parliament and of the Council sets average emissions for the passenger cars sold by them within EU to 130g O2/km, then to 95 g CO2/km from 2021, with another 15 % decrease from 2025 (compared to 2021) and a 37.5 % decrease from 2030 (compared to 2021). Similar targets are defined for light commercial vehicle manufacturers and even manufacturers of heavier trucks, but there is a time offset for the latter so the process starts from 2025 (the revision of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 of the European Parliament and of the Council envisages extending the scope to include trailers, buses and other groups of trucks in 2022). The targets for manufacturers will have a decisive impact on the fleet composition and they can potentially improve the use of alternative fuels and propulsion. Given that emission targets for manufacturers are set at EU level and not by individual Member States, it is essential that relevant measures are implemented in the Czech Republic to support the development of the market for alternative fuel vehicles. At the same time, if the fleet is not sufficiently renewed (mainly as a result of insufficient support), imports of older used vehicles, along with all the negative consequences, may increase in the conditions of the passenger car market in the Czech Republic. The assumptions that the targets set for manufacturers will automatically contribute to the renewal of the vehicle fleet may be in line with the conditions of the Czech market. EU requirements for car manufacturers and fuel suppliers are not mutually compatible. For this reason too, as it is currently very difficult to estimate real future developments in these areas, the domestic legislation will allow suppliers of individual fuels to meet their obligations in the field of RES in transport not only directly, but also by exploiting the potential of RES utilisation by other fuel suppliers by associating with them in a similar way the national legislation already allows for emission savings.  At the time of preparation of the National Plan, no precise allocation of obligations to individual fuel suppliers as required by Directive (EU) 2018/2001 was available. The relevant provisions will be transposed into the national legislation of the Czech Republic by 30 June 2021 at the latest. However, the Czech Republic will inform the European Commission of further progress in this area through the relevant progress report. 3.1.3.7 Voluntary commitments of municipalities and cities Municipalities and cities are among the major emitters of greenhouse gases, where the main sources of pollution are energy consumption (buildings, public lighting, new construction) and transport.
