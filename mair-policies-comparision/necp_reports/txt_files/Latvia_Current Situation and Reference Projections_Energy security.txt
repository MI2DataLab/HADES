2.4. Energy security  2.4.1. Current situation  In 2018, different biomass heating / motor fuels  solid biomass, gaseous biomass and liquid biomass (biofuel), as well as electricity dominated in generation of energy sources in Latvia. 50  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 Solid fuel (peat) is also produced in Latvia in small amounts, while lubricants were produced from petroleum products as an energy source. Petroleum products and biomass (solid, liquid and gaseous biomass) were consumed in equal amounts in primary energy consumption in 2018, while gaseous fossil heating/motor fuel was consumed by one quarter less than biomass. Petroleum products (imported petroleum products in transport consumption) dominate in final energy consumption in 2018, the second largest consumed heating/motor fuel in Latvia in 2018 was biomass (solid, liquid and gaseous biomass). Furthermore, the final consumption of thermal energy and electricity in Latvia in 2018 was lower and almost equal to each other. Energy security is best described by how much energy Latvia can produce itself (within the country) and how much energy needs to be imported, as well as the number of sources the energy is imported from.  Key should read: Changes in inventories and statistical discrepancy Imports and inputs for bunkering Total primary energy consumption Export and bunking Production of primary energy resources and re-processed products Figure 23. Latvian structure of production and consumption of energy sources, imports and exports of energy sources in 2017 (TJ) Latvia significantly decreased its energy dependency73 in the period from 1990 to 2017  50.4 % (31 % reduction in the period from 2005 to 2017). However, 44.1 % of the primary energy consumption in Latvia came from imported energy in 2017. Energy dependency in Latvia is currently lower than in the EU in general (55.1 %) and has decreased despite the increase of the total primary energy consumption in the recent years. An improvement in energy dependency indicators may be explained by the increase in the share of use of RES,                                                       73 energy dependency shows how much a country is dependent on energy imports to meet its energy needs. This indicator is calculated by subtracting energy exports from imports and dividing the result by the total energy consumption. This indicator can be calculated for any energy product. 51  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 and by the opening of the electricity and gas market, which fostered entry of new market players into the market and at the same time reduced energy dependency on Russia.  % for solid fossil fuels, 100.12 % for petroleum products, and 101.9 % for natural gas, which is explained by the fact that none of these types of fuel is extracted in Latvia (except lubricant, peat and peat briquettes). At the same time, it should be mentioned that Latvia does not use all the gas imported for consumption immediately, but stores part of the lso neighbouring countries with natural gas deliveries in the winter season. Latvia does not use all the imported amount of liquid petroleum products, but exports part of them.  Key read: EU  Latvia  Figure 24. Energy imports in Latvia and EU 19902017 (%)74 In 2017, Latvia generated  101 % of electricity needs due to unusually high water levels in the Daugava and the output of HPPs. 16 % less electricity was imported, but 9 % more electricity was exported through the Latvian transmission system in 2017 compared to 2016. As in 2016, the balance of electricity produced and consumed in Latvian was negative with electricity imported into the Latvian transmission system significantly exceeding electricity exported from the Latvian transmission network. Similarly, Latviaelectricity consumption exceeds the total amount of electricity produced in Latvia, in 2018 local electricity producers covering electricity consumption Table 7.

The Baltic States imported 982.5 GWh of electricity from third countries in the first half of 2018 (from January to June). Electricity imports from third countries reached 776.4 GWh in total in 2017, which is a 16 % down on 2016. However, electricity exported from the Latvian transmission network increased by about 9 % over 2016. An important component of the current operational setup is the BRELL (Belarus, Russia, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia) agreement concluded between the transmission system operators of the Baltic States, Russia, and Belarus, which provides for a mutual assistance of energy system operators of the countries operating in a synchronous system and, among other things, cooperation in maintaining emergency reserves totalling 500 MW or 100 MW for each member country.   Latvia meets the energy security target with existing measures and existing technologies, because Latvia has toperational capacity of 24,219 GWh, which ensures regional gas supply stability for customers in Latvia, Estonia, northeast Russia and Lithuania. The functioning of the natural gas system in the event of one facility in the system failing is assessed and prepared according to the methodology described in Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2017 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and repealing Regulation (EU) No 994/2010, which takes into account the N-1 principle76 or the operational failure in the single largest natural gas infrastructure. N-1 allows an assessment to be made of the level of protection of natural gas consumers or the security of the natural gas infrastructure in a given territory as a percentage by taking into consideration various parameters of the natural gas system.                                                       76 N-1 is a theoretical calculation that describes the ability of the technical capacity of the gas infrastructure to satisfy total gas demand in the calculated area in the event of disruption of the single largest gas infrastructure during a day of exceptionally high gas demand occurring with a statistical probability of once in 20 years. 53  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00  Key should read: Coverage 56% (at start of exceptional natural gas season 2018) Coverage 30%l N-1: 193.2% Coverage 100%; N-1: 248.6%  Figure 25.

Development projections  The electrical network synchronisation project is expected to be completed by 2025, because in 2018 the Baltic States signed a joint document on synchronisation of electrical networks of Baltic States with continental Europe with Poland and EC, which intends to ensure synchronisation of Latvian, Estonian and Lithuanian electrical networks with the continental Europe and thus ensure closer integration into the European market, more intensive competition, improved energy security, reducing the historic over-dependence on Russia.  A single (Finland-Latvia-Estonia) natural gas market will start operating on 1 January 2020, Finnish natural gas markets. This process will involve establishing an interconnection between the natural gas transmission systems of Finland and Estonia that will allow Finland to join the regional market of the Baltic States, whilst the transmission connection between Lithuania and Poland will provide access to other natural gas markets in Europe and significantly decrease the dependency of the region on the leading natural gas supplier.

Internal energy market  2.5.1. Electricity interconnectivity 2.5.1.1. Current interconnection level and main interconnections The wholesale price of electricity at the electricity stock exchange is affected not only by scheduled and unscheduled repair works in the transmission network, but also scheduled and unscheduled repaired works at power plants, as well the availability of hydro resources in Scandinavian countries and in Latvia.  It is important to mention the total net capacity of the transmission network (NTC), which is 1,000 MW for the Latvian and Estonian interconnection (in the direction from EE to LV). It should be added that this is one of interconnections, where overload is observed. In turn, the capacity of the Lithuanian and Latvian interconnection (in the direction from LV to LT) is 1,234 MW.  The latest interconnections  the NordBalt submarine power cable between Lithuania and Sweden with a total capacity of 700 MW and the LitPol-link interconnection between Lithuania and Poland with a total capacity of 500 MW  increase the total interconnection capacity of the energy system of the Baltic States with other EU countries from the previous 1,000 MW to 2,200 MW.
