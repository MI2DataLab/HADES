28 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA  2.1 Decarbonisation Dimension Overview of key objectives:  contribute to achieving net-zero GHG emissions at EU level by 2050, which is the starting point for planning objectives, policies and actions up to 2030,  effective placement in space for accelerated use of RES,  further reduce GHG emissions by 2030, as determined for Slovenia by the Effort Sharing Regulation, i.e. at least 20% compared to 2005, while achieving sectoral objectives: o transport: + 12 %, o general consumption:  76 %, o agriculture  1 %, o waste management:  65 %, o industry*:  43 %, o energy*:  34 %. * only part of the sector not covered by the ETS,  reduce GHG emissions in buildings by at least 70% by 2030 compared to 2005,  ensure that no net emissions are produced in the LULUCF sectors by 2030 (after applying the accounting rules), i.e. in the LULUCF sector emissions will not exceed sinks,  in the area of adaptation, reduce Slovenia's exposure to climate change impacts and its sensitivity and vulnerability to them, and increase society's resilience and adaptive capacity,  achieve at least a 27% share of RES in energy end-use by 2030 and o achieve at least 2/3 renewable energy use in buildings (share of RES in final energy use excluding electricity and district heating), a ban on the sale and installation of new heating oil boilers after 2022, o at least 30% share of renewables (including surplus heating) in industry, o 1% annual increase in the share of RES and surplus heat  and cold in district heating and cooling systems, o at least 43% share of RES in the production of electricity, o at least 41% share of RES in heating and cooling,  o at least a 21% share of RES in transport,  decarbonisation of electricity production - phasing out of coal: at least by -30% by 2030 and the decision to abandon coal use in Slovenia in accordance with the just transition principles by 2021,  gradual decarbonisation of energy-intensive industries: guarantee financial incentives for restructuring production processes with the introduction of green technologies,  increased investment in human resources and the new knowledge needed for the transition to a climate-neutral society and to reduce the implementation deficit.     29 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA  2.1.1 GHG emissions and removals The EU has set itself the goal of reducing GHG emissions by 2030 as its nationally determined contribution30 to the objective of the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, by 40% compared to 1990, which means a 36% reduction of GHG emissions compared to 2005. This objective is divided into two sub-objectives: 43% reduction in emissions under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS); 30% reduction in emissions in sectors outside emissions trading for which nationally binding targets are set. The Government of the Republic of Slovenia stipulated in SRS 2030 that the transition to a low-carbon circular economy [...] is a priority development orientation for the whole economy31. A key objective of Slovenia's long-term climate policy is the necessary transition to achieving zero net greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the century for the sustainable development of the economy and society. The NEPN targets take these long-term orientations into account and are consistent with the long-term Climate Strategy. Exemptions or refunds of duties that promote the use of fossil fuels contrary to the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets will be gradually phased out by 2030. Inefficient use of fossil fuels and coal imports will become uneconomical thanks to gradually increasing the environmental tax on CO2 32and other duties. With a view to achieving the target of decarbonising the economy, energy-intensive industries will be required to commit themselves to reducing energy and emission intensity. At the same time, we will give them financial incentives to restructure production processes into less energy-intensive processes, based on the expedited introduction of green technologies. Slovenia will also provide fiscal incentives - in the form of incentives - to invest in energy efficiency, reduce final energy use or invest in self-supply and renewable energy (RES).  Slovenia's binding objectives for greenhouse gas emissions for 2030 in sectors outside the ETS (non-ETS) In accordance with the Regulation on binding greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States33, Slovenia is obliged by 2030 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in sectors not covered by the ETS by at least 15% compared to 2005 levels. In addition to the 2030 target, the Regulation also lays down a linear trajectory, which, given the flexibility laid down in the Regulation, should not be exceeded. The NEPN sets higher targets for reducing GHG emissions (non-ETS) by 2030, i.e. by at least 20% compared to 2005. The more challenging target for reducing GHG emissions does not envisage any increase in ambition or expectations in the area of the share of renewables (RES), where Slovenia is limited by some important or specific national circumstances that determine the further increase of the share of RES. In order to successfully achieve and exceed the GHG emission reduction target (non-ETS), it is important to manage and reduce emissions in all the sectors involved; the NEPN therefore sets more                                                            30  NDC. 31  Accepted on 7 December 2017, available at: http://www.vlada.si/fileadmin/dokumenti/si/projekti/2017/srs2030/Strategija_razvoja_Slovenije_2030.pdf. 32  Gradual adjustment of the level of the environmental tax on CO2 pollution to the level of emission allowances. 33  Regulation (EU) 2018/842 sets national GHG emission reduction targets for each EU Member State in the range of 0% to 40%.

It is of vital importance for Slovenia to take proper and efficient actions in to address the issue of transport and its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. In the first stages, given the constant growth of road transport (freight and passenger), Slovenia needs to pay special attention to rail transport and sustainable mobility measures. This will reduce the carbon footprint of the transport sector and relieve heavy traffic, which is becoming unsustainable on Slovenian roads. To achieve this goal, we plan to:  upgrade railway infrastructure (preparation by 2025, implementation by 2030) and increase the capacity of passenger corridors and upgrade lines to meet TEN-T standards and increase capacity,  develop integrated public transport (harmonisation of timetables, integration of urban transport, establishment of a public passenger transport operator)  promote sustainable transport choices in the calculation of travel costs,  reduce the need for private motor vehicle use (telework, modified parking policy, etc.),  join up spatial planning and transport planning,  arrange micro-mobility nodes along city thoroughfares and highways, as appropriate,   change excise and toll policy with the aim of, as far as possible, diverting freight transit transport to rail,   provide an adequate support environment for the integrated electrification of the Port of Koper,  organise and establish a digital platform that will promote all possibilities of public passenger transport, forms of co-travel and the creation and establishment of new sustainable mobility business models,  by 2023 analyse the prospects for banning the sale of new and import of old vehicles that use liquid fossil fuels as motor fuels,                                                            34  Determined by taking into account legally binding targets, policy decisions already made at EU level on long-term targets, the cost of reducing GHG emissions in Slovenia and other general development, sectoral and environmental targets and taking into account the effects of technological solutions. 35  https://www.energetika-portal.si/fileadmin/dokumenti/publikacije/op_tgp/op_tgp_2020.pdf.  36  Combustion Sectors (1.A.2) and Industrial Processes (2.). 37   31 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   provide an adequate support environment for the introduction of alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) for freight transport and compressed natural gas and other synthetic fuels and hydrogen (H2) for road transport,  streamline administrative procedures in the electrification of transport. In the next decade, Slovenia needs to manage the rapid growth of passenger and freight transport and to direct traffic flows to alternative means of transport. It is crucial to gradually reduce energy consumption by increasing energy efficiency and switching to low-emission vehicles. Since walking and cycling also contribute to sustainable mobility, we will actively promote the construction of cycling and pedestrian infrastructure. Slovenia will thus provide the population with simple, fast, green transport that is non-invasive for the environment and urban centres in the last kilometres. The target is to reduce the number of journeys by private motor vehicle (now 67% of journeys) and significantly increase the number of journeys by foot, bicycle or public transport. Total GHG emissions The NEPN shows that by 2030 Slovenia will reduce its GHG emissions by up to 36% compared to 2005. The NEPN makes provision for the gradual phasing out of the use of domestic and imported coal for energy needs or a reduction of at least -30% by 2030 and a decision to abandon the use of coal Slovenia in accordance with the just transition principles by 2021. The exact timetable for abandoning coal use in Slovenia will be determined by a strategy for abandoning coal use and restructuring coal regions in accordance with the just transition principle, which will be adopted by 2021 at the latest. The objective of abandoning coal use in Slovenia will be duly taken into account in the NEPN update in 2024. Slovenia's commitments under Regulation (EU) 2018/841 Part of the EU national contribution is the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector, where Slovenia's objective is to ensure that the LULUCF sector does not produce net emissions, i.e. emissions in the LULUCF sector will not exceed sinks, and that we maximise the scope of emission sinks by 2030. Other national targets SRS 203038 under the eighth development goal, i.e. transition to a low-carbon circular economy, identifies three performance indicators39 to monitor the achievement of the set goal: 1. material productivity - by 2030 reach the target of 3.5 purchasing power standard (PPS)/kg (compared to the baseline value of 1.79 PPS/kg in 2015), 2. share of renewables in energy end-use - by 2030 reach the target of 27% (compared to the baseline of 22% in 2015), 3. emission productivity - by 2030 reach the EU average in 2030 (compared to the baseline of 2.9 PPS/kg CO2 equivalent in 2015).

The resolution, among specific objectives under the heading Sustainable management of natural resources and the provision of public goods, includes adaptation (production/technological and economic adjustments to changed conditions) and climate change mitigation (reduction of greenhouse gas emissions). For climate change adaptation and mitigation, the following objectives are also important; they will need to be revised and adapted in coming years in the light of the newly adopted EU climate neutrality objectives up to 2050:  reinforcing research support for agricultural and rural development,  effective transfer of knowledge to final beneficiaries,  functioning and efficient AKIS (Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation System),  adaptation of species and varieties of agricultural plants,  adherence to modern guidelines for rotation,  support for the use of modern technological solutions for adaptation to climate change.  most important natural resources and in total accounts for 33% of its territory. Slovenia has limited high-quality agricultural land, so maintaining such land is of paramount importance. Given that agriculture also plays an important role in reducing GHG emissions; agricultural measures need to be adopted to reduce the environmental burden of greenhouse gas emissions and the consumption of natural resources. In 2016, Slovenia already adopted its National Strategic Framework for Climate Change Adaptation (SOPPS)41, including guidelines to incorporate adaptation more widely into policies, measures and practices. The document sets out the vision that by 2050 Slovenia will become an adaptable and resilient society ensuring high quality and safety of life in such a way as to fully exploit the opportunities in the climate change situation.  The key objectives of the NEPN in the area of climate change adaptation are:  to substantially reinforce research and the production of expert bases (at least five targeted research projects should be launched in 2020, gaps must be considered beforehand, and a plan for the necessary bases should be drawn up),  by 2021 to draw up an action plan for adaptation with clear measures to accelerate the integration of climate change adaptation in all areas (e.g. adaptation of railway infrastructure and electricity transmission and distribution networks, increasing resilience to extreme weather events in agriculture, forestry, etc.).                                                               41  The strategic framework for adapting to climate change, adopted by the Government of the Republic of Slovenia in December 2016, sets the framework and guidelines for adaptation to climate change in Slovenia.

When drawing up the NEPN, Slovenia reviewed the previously adopted SRS 2030 target of a 27% share of RES by 2030 and - based on updated expert bases, prior public consultation, comprehensive environmental impact assessment42 and to the maximum extent possible taking account of the Commission recommendations43 and specific national circumstances  fixed a development-oriented and feasible national share of renewables and sectoral targets up to 2030.44 Slovenia will actively strive to improve energy efficiency and thus limit energy use. This will reduce primary and final energy consumption. Through appropriate legal incentives (positive legal discrimination), Slovenia will actively promote and encourage the use of renewables with a favourable impact on security of energy supply, as it will reduce dependency on fossil fuel imports. In addition to increasing the share of renewables in the final consumption of energy, the share of renewables in the electricity generation and gas sectors should also be increased. In the adoption of RES measures, special attention will be given to reducing bureaucracy and the appropriate integration of RES into the buildings, spatial planning and energy system and the process of siting all the necessary facilities. With the successful implementation of all planned policies and measures by 2030, the following can be achieved:  at least a 27% total share of RES and sectoral shares of RES: o 43% share in the electricity sector, o 41% share in the heating and cooling sector, o 21% share in transport (with an 11% share of biofuels45).  The use of renewables is projected to increase by 3 890 GWh by 2030 in relation to 2017, renewable electricity generation by 2 223 GWh, the use of biofuels in transport by 1 841 GWh, with renewable heat consumption reduced by 488 GWh. In the same period, final energy consumption is reduced by 3 247 GWh (with electricity consumption increasing by 1 246 GWh, consumption in transport by 253 GWh and energy consumption for heating and cooling decreasing by 4 746 GWh).  In line with the new RES Directive, the share of advanced biofuels is gradually increasing in all scenarios for biofuels.  An indicative target for 2030 is also set for the supply of natural gas: a 10% share of renewable natural gas (biogas, compressed natural gas (CNG), H2).                                                            42  The comprehensive environmental impact assessment showed the extent of the RES contribution that can be achieved in a sustainable manner by 2030 through measures and investment in Slovenia, provided that a stable and predictable environment for investors is ensured. Slovenia has already had to remove several of the projects already taken into account in the RES targets up to 2020 and 2030 from the strategy papers due to the negative environmental impact assessment. 43  In its recommendation of 18 June 2019, the Commission called upon Slovenia to in particular significantly increase the level of ambition for the share of renewables by 2030 to at least 37%, based on the formula in Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, and to raise the level of ambition in the heating and cooling sector, to achieve the indicative target referred to in Article 23 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and the transport target referred to in Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 (available at: https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/si_rec_sl.pdf). Slovenia has to indicate in the NEPN which relevant circumstances affecting the RES target have been taken into account. 44  The share of renewables that, on account of environmental constraints or other reasons, we will not be able to achieve in Slovenia will have to be ensured in accordance with the Regulation by other measures, e.g. participating in cross-border projects, through statistical transfer or payments into the EU financial mechanism for renewables.  45  Share of biofuels in non-LPG liquid fuel consumption in road and rail transport. 34 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA  Outline of development of the total share of RES in the period 2021-2030 Figure 2 and Table 3 show the outline of development of the total share of RES from 2021 to 2030.

The use of wood biomass is in line with the objectives of LULUCF and does not reduce sinks. Achieving this goal requires careful management of forests and improvement of the sustainable cascade use of wood. Therefore, the NEPN policies are as follows:  to maximise the share of Slovenian wood processed domestically for products with the highest added value (strengthening value chains),  using only wood that is not suitable for industrial processing into semi-finished or finished products and used wood for energy purposes (including as a source for synthetic fuels); INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 41    wood should be properly integrated into the system and into the indicators of sustainable construction and green public procurement. Wood biomass from Slovenian forests is an important factor in mitigating climate change, in sustainable development, the security of the heat supply, positive economic effects, synergistic effects throughout the wood processing chain and reducing dependency on imports. The economic aspect is also important since the use of lower quality wood for industrial and energy purposes greatly improves the economics of wood processing chains. Wood biomass waste is of great importance in the production of heat and electricity in district heating systems, in the use of the latest technologies that contribute to reducing air pollution, and in the production of synthetic fuels. It will only be possible to use wood biomass for energy purposes in a controlled and environmentally friendly manner so as not to cause excessive emissions of particulate and volatile matter, a challenge which is feasible from both educational, legislative and technical perspectives. Increasing the use of biomass in modern individual, collective and industrial installations for heating and generating heat and power is important for Slovenia, as it makes it possible for the country to improve reliability and competitiveness in the energy supply, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect the environment. Use of biofuels The use of biofuels will be prioritised for the development, production and use of advanced sustainable biofuels. In doing so, we will take advantage of development opportunities with respect to the raw materials available and will stimulate the necessary technological development with development incentives to carry out pilot projects. In line with the objectives of the NEPN, we will supplement the strategy in the area of market development by establishing suitable infrastructure associated with alternative fuels in the transport sector in the Republic of Slovenia47. Slovenia will intensively promote the development of technologies for the production of sustainable biofuels, advanced synthetic gas and liquid fuels and use imported ones until it develops and establishes its own production structures. Other RES targets  Due to the complexity of achieving the overall target for renewables, Slovenia has set goals in the following sectors:  at least 2/3 of energy use in buildings from RES (share of RES in final energy use excluding electricity and district heat) and a ban on the sale and installation of new heating oil boilers to be introduced by 2023 at the latest;  1.3% annual increase in the share of RES in heating and cooling in the industry sector, including waste heat and cold (priority resource utilisation);48  at least 30% share of RES (including surplus heat) in industry;  1% annual increase in the share of RES and surplus heat and cold in district heating and cooling systems;49  by 2021, establish a legislative framework incentivising accelerated community development in the area of renewable energy (shared power plants) and targeting RES investments in areas where no major additional investment is needed in the network.                                                            47  The strategy already envisages a 7% blending of biodiesel in fossil diesel from 2018, increasing its share in the coming years and gradually increasing the share of heavy goods vehicles operating on pure biodiesel from 0 to 10% between 2020 and 2030 (available at: www.energetika-portal.si/dokumenti/strateski-razvojni-dokumenti/strategija-za-alternativna-goriva/). 48  In accordance with the requirements of Article 23 of the revised (EU) Directive 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of RES. 49  In accordance with the requirements of Article 24 of the revised (EU) Directive 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of RES. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 42   Status of the renewables sector and relevant national circumstances Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action stipulates that in determining the national contribution for its share of energy from renewable sources by 2030, Member States should also take into account any relevant circumstances affecting renewable energy deployment, such as the equitable distribution of deployment across the Union; the economic conditions and potential, including GDP per capita; the potential for cost-effective renewable energy deployment; the geographical, environmental and natural constraints, the level of power interconnection and other relevant circumstances. Slovenia notes that the Commission recommendation for Slovenia of a 37% share of RES by 2030 is based solely on application of the indicative formula in Annex 2 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, clearly ignoring relevant circumstances with an impact on determination of the share of renewables, despite the requirement under Article 31(2) of the Regulation. Considering the relevant circumstances, Slovenia cannot comply fully with the Commission recommendations with regard to the national contribution to the RES target by 2030. Below, Slovenia provides justifications for a set of relevant circumstances which should also under Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 have been  taken into account when determining the national contribution to the RES target up to 2030. a. Transport sector situation In accordance with the RES Directive, Slovenia has adopted an ambitious target for the use of RES, i.e. a 25% share of RES by 2020. Slovenia achieved a 21.04% share of RES in 2017 and, in 2018, a 21.14% share, which is below the target. Except for the heat and cooling sector, Slovenia was lagging behind in achieving the indicative sectoral targets in the transport and electricity sectors. Countries where transport accounts for a large share of gross final energy consumption and which have a high baseline share of RES find it much more difficult to make progress than other countries in spite of the perhaps greater potential and available financial resources, because the small share of RES in transport calls for much higher (often unattainable) shares in the heat and electricity sector (the total RES potential is thus less).  Slovenia ranks fourth in the EU in terms of the share of energy consumption in transport in the end-use of energy (Figure 8 [sic]), as here the introduction of RES is extremely demanding, as the only RES are biofuels, whose use is restricted under different standards and whose production is a major sustainability challenge (especially the first generation). INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 43   Figure 7: Comparison of projected national RES shares, EC calculations and shares of energy use in transport, source: MzI based on IJS-CEU calculations, 2019  Key to Figure 7:   Share of energy consumption in transport in gross final consumption,   RES forecasts in NEPN,   RES - EC calculation, recommendation Projections of the transport sector indicate a further increase in transport in Slovenia by 2030, i.e. passenger and especially freight transport, which will further increase energy consumption in the sector - the projections for various scenarios up to 2030 show an increase in energy consumption in the transport sector by between 6% and 24% by 2030. This will make the introduction of RES in the transport sector up to 2030 extremely demanding and difficult and put significant restrictions on the achievement of the total RES share by 2030 since Slovenia will have to compensate for the smaller share of RES in the transport sector by action in other two sectors (electricity and heat). b. Environmental and other restrictions affecting the introduction of energy from renewable energy sources in Slovenia There are 355 Nature 2000 sites in Slovenia, of which 324 are designated under the Habitats Directive and 31 under the Birds Directive. The areas cover 37.46% of Slovenia's surface area and are home to 114 endangered plant and animal species and 60 habitat types under the Habitats Directive and 122 protected species under the Birds Directive. Slovenia tops the list in Europe in terms of the area covered by Natura 2000 sites and the number of protected species. Many areas (see figure below) that are suitable for the introduction of RES (mainly hydro and wind power plants) are subject to Natura 2000 protection. The possibilities for using wind energy are consequently limited and substantially more restricted than in other EU countries (Slovenia does not have the option of setting up offshore wind farms). The possibility of using wind power is further restricted by the extremely dispersed population settlement patterns (very few locations with adequate wind speeds meet the noise protection requirements for the necessary distance from residential settlements). INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 44   Figure 8: Map of Natura 2000 sites in Slovenia  Source: Natura2000.si The execution of large hydro-electric plant (HPP) construction projects, aside from the conservation of nature and the protection of water bodies, is also highly dependent on spatial siting procedures and the implementation of related water infrastructure projects. Further promotion of the use of renewables in Slovenia is strongly conditioned by environmental and spatial legislation - the future implementation of RES projects by 2030, in particular in the area of hydro-electric power and wind, will be feasible in Slovenia only if EIA procedures are properly implemented, with other public interest procedures outweighing the public benefit of nature conservation and enforcement of water exemptions (in accordance with EU legislation). In addition to demanding spatial placement processes, opposition to the continued use of hydro-electric power and wind energy in Slovenia is also intensifying in some local communities, the general public and parts of the non-governmental sector. The target set for a 27% share of RES in 2030 will not be achieved solely through the implementation of projects outside Natura 2000, or projects whose environmental impact is likely to be considered insignificant. In order to achieve this goal, it will also be necessary to carry out projects for the construction of hydro-electric power plants and wind power plants (WPP), which are likely to have a significant impact on nature and therefore require a procedure to ascertain that public interest takes precedence over the public interest of nature conservation. Without effective environmental measures that will respect successful decisions allowing for exceptions under EU legislation in the area of water and nature protection, the implementation of these projects will not be possible. c. Enhancing energy efficiency in the heating and cooling sector and the impact on the overall share of RES Increasing energy efficiency in the building and heating and cooling sectors also has a direct impact on reducing RES consumption. Specifically, through restoring or improving the thermodynamic properties of buildings and distribution network, savings in the consumption of heat for space heating and cooling can be achieved, which in turn reduces the consumption of RES (biomass) in this sector and has a negative effect on the total share of RES. In the period 2012 to 2017 energy efficiency measures in the heating and cooling sector reduced the use of wood biomass in households by 497 GWh. d. Consideration of the share of energy-intensive industry in Slovenia, which is higher than the EU average Nearly two-thirds (62.2%) of the final energy in industry is consumed by four energy-intensive industries: the production of metals, the production of paper and paper products, the production of INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 45   non-metallic mineral products, and the production of chemicals and chemical products. Almost 30% of value added in industry was generated by emission-intensive activities in 2014, which places Slovenia at a high, fourth place in the EU in terms of this indicator. This share is higher only in Belgium, Ireland and Denmark, but in these Member States, the contribution of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in value added is significantly higher than the contribution of these industries in Slovenia. At present, the commercially available technologies in these industries do not allow for greater use of RES. e. Inconsistency of the framework equation in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 with the provisions of Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 and the inadequacy of input data when considering the contributions to be taken into account in the framework of the equation in Annex II Slovenia takes the view that the framework equation in Annex II does not reflect all the elements that Member States must take into account in determining their national contribution to the 2030 RES target in accordance with Article 5. Important circumstances which must be taken into account by a Member State and which are not evaluated by objective criteria in the equation are geographical, environmental and natural constraints and other relevant circumstances. Moreover, the input data used to calculate individual items for calculating the share of RES for Slovenia in the equation are not appropriate. According to the EUCO32.5 scenario, the PRIMES 201650 model for Slovenia predicts that energy consumption in transport will decrease by -5% in the period 2015 to 2030, while expert bases drawn up for the NEPN indicate that energy consumption in transport, even with deployment of the most ambitious measures, will continue to increase by around 6% up to 2030. In this scenario, the PRIMES model also envisages that an additional 121 MW of hydro-electric power plants and 208 MW of wind power will be built in Slovenia by 2030 compared to the year 2015, which does not take into account the real restrictions on spatial placement and implementation of environmental legislation. The data used to determine the proportion of RES on the basis of potential are therefore not appropriate in expert terms. Far exceeding the EU target of interconnectivity should not entail additional burdens for the Member State. There is still great ambiguity regarding the use of input data in determining the national contribution which reflects the level of interconnectedness of Member States. Not only is the input that is an integral part of the equation nowhere publicly available or accessible (e.g. the Union average), but the definition of the contribution in such a way that more connected Member States have to contribute a higher proportion of RES than less connected Member States is also inconsistent with the fundamental principle of the fair sharing of effort throughout the Union. Due to the specific nature of electricity systems, small Member States are in principle much more interconnected than large Member States, and increasing the obligation to contribute in this way, on the basis of the equation, does not reflect the provisions of Article 5.                                                             50  https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/20170125_-_technical_report_on_euco_scenarios_primes_corrected.pdf.
