INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 80   2.2 Dimension energy efficiency  i. The elements set out in Article 4(b)  (1) the indicative national contribution towards energy efficiency needed to attain the % energy efficiency in 2030, as set out in Article 1(1) and Article 3(5) of Directive 2012/27/EU, on the basis of primary or final energy consumption or primary or final energy savings or energy intensity; Member States shall express their contribution in terms of absolute level of primary energy consumption and final energy consumption in 2020, and in terms of absolute level of primary energy consumption and final energy consumption in 2030, with an indicative trajectory for that contribution from 2021 onwards. They shall explain their underlying methodology and the conversion factors used; Italy intends to pursue an indicative reduction target for 2030 of 43% for primary energy consumption and of 39.7% for final energy consumption, with respect to the reference PRIMES 2007 scenario.  In terms of the absolute level of primary and final energy consumption for 2020, it is estimated that the indicative targets set pursuant to Directive 2012/27/EU, equal to 158 Mtoe and 124 Mtoe, respectively, will be surpassed.  By contrast, with regard to the absolute level of energy consumption for 2030, Italy is pursuing a target of 125.1 Mtoe of primary energy and 103.8 Mtoe of final energy, following the trajectory indicated in the following figure, starting with the estimated consumption for 2020. Figure 17  Trajectory of primary and final energy consumption (Mtoe) in the period 2020-2030 [Source: RSE]   In order to set this target, a trajectory based on attaining the savings obligations defined pursuant to Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) of 11 December 2018, which provides for a minimum target reduction in final consumption of 0.8% per year for the period 2021-2030, calculated on the basis of the three-year period 2016-2018 (with estimates being INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 81   made for 2017 and 2018), was developed. The proposed scenario also works on the assumption that the targets relating to renewable sources and decarbonisation will be attained.  (2) the cumulative amount of end-use energy savings to be achieved over the period 2021-2030 under Article 7(1)(b) on the energy efficiency obligation schemes pursuant to Directive 2012/27/EU; Pursuant to Article 7(1) of the EED, the energy savings targets set for each Member State to be attained between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2030 are equivalent to a minimum of 0.8% per year of the average final energy consumption in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.  The first step needed to calculate the savings target involves identifying the amount of final energy consumed nationally during the aforementioned years. Where available (2016 and 2017), statistical data from Eurostat (Final Energy Consumption Europe 2020-2030  FEC2020-2030), were taken into consideration, while for 2018, an estimate based on the TIMES model, developed by Italy for the purposes of the present plan, was used.   The following table shows data relating to the situation in Italy, on the basis of the calculation. Table 14  Final energy distributed and average final energy during the three-year period 2016-2018 (data given in Mtoe) [RSE calculations on the basis of data from Eurostat] given in Mtoe) [RSE calculations on the basis of data from Eurostat]  2016 2017 2018 Final energy consumption 115.9 115.2 116.5 Average for the three-year period 2016-2018  115.9   On the basis of the average final energy consumption during the three-year period 2016-2018, it is possible to calculate the annual saving of 0.8% to be attained during the period 2021-2030 and, consequently, the cumulative saving to be attained by 31 December 2030. These values are provided in the following figure.   INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 82   Table 15  Savings to be attained during the period 2021-2030 on the basis of the average final energy consumption during the three-year period 2016-2018 (data given in Mtoe) Year Annual saving     Annual energy savings    TOTAL 2021 0.8% 0.927          0,927 2022 0.8% 0.927 0.927         1,854 2023 0.8% 0.927 0.927 0.927        2,781 2024 0.8% 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927       3,707 2025 0.8% 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927      4,634 2026 0.8% 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927     5,561 2027 0.8% 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927    6,488 2028 0.8% 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927   7,415 2029 0.8% 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927  8,342 2030 0.8% 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 0.927 9,269 TOTAL cumulative saving during the period 2021-2030       50,977  Therefore, it is estimated that new measures will produce a 0.927 Mtoe incremental saving of final energy per year for the period 2021-2030, which is primarily attributable to the civil and transport sectors.  In terms of the overall cumulative amount, this translates into a 50.98 Mtoe saving of final energy to be attained through active policies during the period 2021-2030.   Therefore, in order to comply with the obligation, a reduction in final energy consumption of nearly 9.3 Mtoe/year by 2030 through active policies is required, to be attained primarily in non-ETS sectors.  Although the calculation of the annual saving set out in the previous table on the basis of the latest available data shows a minimum reduction target of 50.98 Mtoe from 2021 to 2030 (which corresponds to an annual saving of about 9.25 Mtoe by 2030), the target already set INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 83   out in the draft INECP, of about 51.4 Mtoe (an annual saving of over 9.35 Mtoe by 2030) is confirmed.   Italy has decided not avail itself of the options referred to in Article 7(2) of the EED for 2021-2030.  The figure below shows the estimated annual savings forming the subject of the 2030 target by sector. Figure 18: Distribution of the savings forming the subject of the 2030 target by economic sector (Mtoe)  Residential Tertiary Industry Transport Total  The distribution of sectoral contributions, which must be regarded as indicative, is the result of the modelling approach employed: with a view to minimising system costs, the sectors with higher efficiency potential and measures with an appropriate level of cost effectiveness were identified, in order to ensure that the objective of the Energy Efficiency Directive is met. The sectoral distribution is influenced by developments in the performance levels and costs of energy technologies, the potential of the sector, and the renewables target, which leads to options, such as heat pumps, which facilitate the attainment of the renewables targets, being favoured.  The civil sector, along with transport, is identified as the main sector for efficiency improvement measures, with a reduction in energy consumption of approximately 5.7 Mtoe compared with the base scenario for 2030 and a commitment to gradually eliminate oil for heating purposes. In particular, the residential sector contributes to 3.3 Mtoe of this decrease, whereas the tertiary sector reduces the projections for its consumption by 2.4 Mtoe, thanks to structural renovation measures and the installation of heat pumps, as well as a greatly improved efficiency of end-use devices. In this regard, it is useful to monitor best practices that can easily be replicated on a local level, especially in integrating RES in the construction sector. Lastly, simplifying authorisation procedures and removing or relaxing town planning constraints, which are particularly strict for certain installations, could help develop the use of RES on a more broadly agreed and widespread manner. In this, the public    3.3 9.3  2.4  2.6 1.0 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 84   administration would need to assume more responsibility for promoting decarbonisation in public sector building projects.   A further significant contribution is made by the transport sector, which, as a result of measures to shift private passenger mobility towards collective and/or smart mobility and freight transport from road to rail, and the improved efficiency of vehicles, is responsible for an approximately 2.6 Mtoe contribution to the gap between the two scenarios for 2030. The industrial sector should achieve a reduction in consumption of approximately 1.0 Mtoe, but this does not mean it is a sector with few opportunities for action.  Thanks to the use of technological models of the entire energy system, there is no need to employ predetermined conversion factors, with the quantification in primary energy instead being accounted for directly by modelling tools.  (3) the indicative milestones of the long-term strategy for the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, the roadmap with domestically established measurable progress indicators, an evidence-based estimate of expected energy savings and wider benefits, and the contributions to the Union's energy efficiency targets pursuant to Directive 2012/27/EU in accordance with Article 2(1) of Directive 2010/31/EU; Some preliminary figures inferred from the strategy currently being drawn up are set out below.  Table 16 shows a breakdown of Italy by climatic zone and the respective number of municipalities.   For winter heating of existing buildings, national energy consumption can be deemed proportionate to the product of degree days and population. Thus, climatic zone E, which has the highest population, accounts for the largest share of consumption, while climatic zone B has the lowest share, excluding zone A, in which just 0.04% of the population lives (it consists of just two municipalities).

Of this 45%, the residential sector accounts for 29% of the total and services (the sector that experienced the highest growth), for 16%. Size of the national stock of buildings Residential buildings Italy has 12.42 million buildings intended for residential use, with nearly 32 million homes. Over 60% of this stock is over 45 years old; in other words it was built before Law 373/19763, the first energy-saving law, came into force. Of these buildings, over 25% have annual consumption ranging from a minimum of 160 kWh/m2 per year to over 220 kWh/m2. The situation of the building stock in the residential sector is illustrated below, broken down by year of construction and climatic zone, and by state and condition of the buildings.

Table 17  Residential buildings, number and floor area 2018, by period of construction   INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 86   Non-residential buildings Buildings intended for non-residential purposes are grouped in the most common categories: schools, offices, shopping centres, hotels, health-sector facilities. There are about 435,000 non-residential buildings on Italian territory intended for these purposes, excluding health, as shown in the table below. The total floor area is about 340 million square metres, of which 37% in climatic zone E, and, overall, nearly 70% in temperate or cold zones.  Table 19  Non-residential buildings (schools, offices, shopping centres, hotels) and area by climatic zone More details and analyses will be included in the long-term strategy for the refurbishment of the building stock, which is expected to be ready by 10 March 2020.  In the case of hospital buildings, the hat in 2016 Italy had over 27,000 public and accredited private sector health facilities, broken down by type as shown in the table below.  Nearly zero-energy buildings  experiencing an increase in nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEBs), of which there were about 1,400 in 2018. Most of these were newbuilds (90%) and for residential use (85%), as noted by the nZEB Observatory. The refurbishment of over 130 mainly non-residential public buildings to nZEB standard is planned by the end of 2020.4                                                             4 egli edifici a energia quasi zero (nZEB) in Italia 2016-  Climatic zone Number of non-residential buildings m2 zone A 148 173,490 zone B 22,515 23,421,687 zone C 84,233 83,915,666 zone D 102,264 95,050,723 zone E 206,451 125,487,887 zone F 19,119 13,231,516 Total 434,730 341,280,969  Table 20  Number of facilities by type of healthcare provided, 2016 Healthcare type Type of facility Total Public Private accredited Hospital care 537 492 1,029 Specialist outpatient care 3,628 5,300 8,928 Local residential care 1,326 5,998 7,324 Local semi-residential care 974 2,090 3,064 Other local care 4,932 717 5,649 Rehabilitation (under Article 26) 246 863 1,109 Total 11,643 15,460 27,103   INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 87   However, nZEB buildings account for no more than 0.03% of existing stock on a regional basis, while less than 10% of all nZEBs are existing buildings  mainly schools and small single or two-household homes  that have been refurbished to meet these standards. Assessment of consumption The average consumption for the various intended uses was calculated with reference to the distribution of buildings by climatic zone and period of construction, and on the basis of the consumption data resulting from statistical surveys on a representative set of buildings. The results of some initial analyses, which may be updated in the final strategy, are shown below.  Table 21  Intended use and average annual consumption indicator weighted by climatic zone  As regards buildings for large-scale retail distribution, electricity is the most widely used form of delivery for final energy use, at over 90%, as shown by studies conducted at both the Italian and European levels. The study conducted on energy diagnoses for the food sector found an average of nearly 95%, taking energy withdrawn from the grid, self-produced and self-consumed. The following table shows the average specific consumption for the various types of large-scale distribution; the values for supermarkets and hypermarkets are again taken from the energy diagnosis study.

This study found average electricity consumption of 303 kWh/m2 and consumption for healing and cooling of 342 kWh/m2.  Estimated refurbishment rate To provide further observations on the results of the models used in the simulation underlying the INECP, this section on the long-term strategy for the building stock examines the current refurbishment rate that is needed to reach the targets, as though each renovation initiative were deep, i.e. envisaging large-scale renovation work both on the buildings themselves and on the installations (virtual deep renovation rate (VDRR)). This necessarily produces lower rates than those on which the INECP models are based, but it allows for the normalisation of the types of intervention and the specific savings related to them.  Current refurbishment rate The VDRR intervention and technological solution, starting with the data relating to tax deductions for energy efficiency initiatives (known as the Ecobonus). Ecobonus estimates indicate that in 2014-2018 over 1.7 million projects were carried out, of which more than 334,000 in 2018. Of these, about 140,000 applications were for replacement window and/or door frames, 90,000 for replacement winter heating systems and over 70,000 for solar shading systems. Door and/or window replacements accounted for 33% of the savings obtained in 2018 and the insulation of under-roof spaces and vertical closures for 28%, with other savings from work on winter heating systems.  The annual VDRR kWh/m2 achieved in 2014-2018 through initiatives related to paragraph 333 of the Ecobonus provision (overall refurbishment), is about 0.26%.  Focus on 2030 and 2050 To analyse the VDRR to 2030 a specific modelling tool was developed. The initial annual VDRR estimates for the residential sector for 2020-2030, which are necessary to obtain the 2030 INECP target, point to a need to accelerate the annual VDRR to around 0.7%. From a technological perspective the analyses are consistent with the INECPgrowth in air-water heating pumps to be used for domestic hot water (DHW), heating and cooling systems, both autonomous and centralised. By 2030, in the light of the goal of almost Type Total consumption (kWh/m2/year) Minimarket 535 Supermarket 598 Hypermarkets 527 Department store 255 Specialist large-scale outlets 219  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 89   complete decarbonisation by 2050, a growth in the rate of transforming existing buildings into nZEBs can already be assumed.  For non-residential buildings, on the other hand, a cost-optimal model (i.e. which considers only those interventions that have the minimum cost for the best result) was developed. This gave a VDRR of 2.9% by 2030 (hospitals excluded). By 2050 the target scenario envisaged by the long-term strategy referred to in the Governance Regulation envisages almost complete decarbonisation in the civil sector, with the elimination of direct emissions in the residential and services sectors. To achieve this goal, a start can be made from the INECP target scenario for 2030, with appropriate interventions in the civil sector.  For both the residential and non-residential sectors it will therefore be necessary from 2030 to 2050 to make a further effort to reduce final energy consumption and CO2 emissions with respect to the VDRR.   (4) the total floor area to be renovated or equivalent annual energy savings to be achieved from 2021 to 2030 under Article 5 of Directive 2012/27/EU on the exemplary role of public bodies' buildings; With regard to the energy renovation each year of 3% of the floor area of properties of the central public administration pursuant to Article 5 of the EED, the current programme of measures is expected to be able to meet the obligation imposed by the Directive. The existing measure was also reinforced by the 2019 Budget Law, which earmarked further resources for the programme, totalling 25 million for 2019 and 40 million each year from 2020 to 2022. Provision is also made to continue with the Energy Renovation Programme for the Central Public Administration (PREPAC) during the period 2021-2030, which programme will be enhanced as a result of the experience gained during the seven-year period 2014-2020. In particular, considering an overall floor area of buildings subject to the provisions of Article 5 of the EED equal to 15.2 million m2 in Italy per 4 102 occupants, during the period 2021-2030, 3.2 million m2 of floor area of buildings associated with the central public administration will be subjected to energy renovation.  The following figure shows the trend in floor area in respect of which renovation has been planned and financed, and the floor area which is still to be renovated. The data from 2014, i.e. starting from the year the obligation was imposed, to 2018 are final, whereas the data for the following years up until 2030 are assumed to comply with the minimum rate of 3% established by the EED. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 90   Figure 19  Trend in renovations of the building stock of the central public administration (millions of m2)   ii. The indicative milestones for 2030, 2040 and 2050, the domestically established progress indicators, a reliable estimate of expected energy savings and wider benefits, and their contributions to the Union's energy efficiency targets as included in the roadmaps set out in the long-term renovation strategies for the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, in accordance with Article 2(1) of Directive 2010/31/EU Reference is made to the information given in section i.(3) above iii. Where applicable, other national objectives, including long-term targets or strategies and sectoral targets, and national objectives in areas such as energy efficiency in the transport sector and with regard to heating and cooling The attainment of the energy targets, as previously described, is strategically linked to the renewal of the building stock, both public and private, with priority being given to energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies.  In order to attain the targets, technologies capable of ensuring low heating, cooling and domestic hot water (DHW) demand, which will be met with high energy efficiency and the use of renewable sources, must be used. Consideration must also be given to the increase in comfort demand in households, associated, in particular, with the relatively new cooling demand.  Heat pumps, both electric and gas, which allow heating, air conditioning and DHW production to be carried out using just one item of equipment, clearly making them suitable for providing air conditioning to a significant number of civil buildings located in Italy, are of strategic importance amongst the solutions that are currently available.  In addition, Italy will aim to expand the use of efficient district heating and district cooling by exploiting the residual economic potential in a manner consistent with the other objectives of energy and environmental policy, including the reduced demand for energy recovery from waste and the limited use of biomass in order to reduce emissions.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 91   In particular, according to the results of the report drafted by GSE on the assessment of the national potential for the application of HEC and efficient district heating established by Article 14 of the EED, the economically sustainable growth potential for energy provided by district heating is approximately 4,000 GWh, to be attained by extending national district heating and district cooling networks by approximately 900 km, on top of the current network size of approximately 4 100 km.   A review of this potential is planned in the near future as part of the update envisaged by the EED.   The above-mentioned GSE report estimates an incremental economic potential of HEC in the industrial and service sectors of about 14 TWh for heat and 10 TWh for electricity. In this respect, possible synergies between the promotion of energy efficiency and the use of heating/cooling renewables, and the benefits of electricity-thermal coupling that could be produced by fuelling HEC systems using biomethane will need to be evaluated.  Figure 20  Economic potential of growth in energy provided by district heating (TLR) by source (GWh) [Source: GSE, 2015-2016 Report on the assessment of the national potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration (HEC) and efficient district heating (TLR)]   The aforementioned assessment of the growth potential for district heating was conducted jointly with the assessment of the growth potential for high-efficiency cogeneration, with focus being placed, as a matter of priority, on the main sources for each objective (district heating and HEC), namely natural gas, biomass and waste. It may be appropriate to carry out an in-depth and broad spectrum analysis on the integration into district heating networks of certain technologies that are currently marginal in a district heating context, but have potential for high-density urban neighbourhoods, such as, for example, thermal solar energy, centralised heat pumps or the recovery of waste heat from installations located throughout Italy. The assessment of the potential of district heating and HEC, and the integration of these technologies, will be updated and examined more closely with a view to 2030 (according to the provisions of Article 15 of RED II), with account being taken of a new generation of district heating systems that are ready for use (fourth generation), characterised by a low temperature of the heat transfer fluid, and of the role that could be played by heating storage combined with solar installations, HEC systems and district heating networks.
