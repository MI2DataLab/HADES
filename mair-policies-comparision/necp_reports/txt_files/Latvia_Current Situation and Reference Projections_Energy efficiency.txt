2.3. Energy efficiency   2.3.1. Current energy consumption  Total primary energy consumption58 was 196.9 PJ59 in 2018. In the period from 2011 to 2016, total primary energy consumption saw a declining trend, however, the total primary energy consumption constantly increased in 2016-2018, and the increase in the period has already reached approximately 9.5 %.  Figure 16. Primary energy consumption and final energy consumption, energy intensity of primary energy consumption and final energy consumption 1995-2018 (PJ)60 In 2018, 58.1 PJ were consumed for generation of thermal energy and electricity (in the transformation sector) and 44.7 PJ of energy were produced (29.7 PJ of thermal energy and 15.0 PJ of electricity), which is 9.6 % more compared to 2017. Hot and dry weather considerably affected the ability of HPPs to produce the necessary amount of electricity, which prompted an increase in natural gas consumption in the transformation sector, resulting in a 5.2 % increase in the share of natural gas in the sector compared to 2017. Latvia mainly uses a fossil energy source  natural gas  to produce thermal energy and electricity in the transformation sector (cogeneration units and boiler houses): 81 % in 2010, 53.7 % in 2017, and 59.0 % in 2018. The share of RES consumed by the transformation sector increased by 5.4 percentage points in five years and reached 40.5 % in 2017. This is an important indicator considering that RES used in the transformation sector are local energy sources: wood fuel, biogas and other types of biomass. The final consumption of energy sources was 174.55 PJ61 in 2018, which is 9.1 % more than in 2016. The largest consumers of energy sources in 2018 were the transport sector (31 %),                                                       58 Within the meaning of Directive 2012/27/EC (and Directive 2018/2002) (within the scope of the definition defined in the directive) 59 CSB 60 Data source: EUROSTAT, CSB 40  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 households (28.8 %) and industry (22.8 %). Compared to 2017, in 2018 an increase in the final consumption of energy sources was observed in transport (+3.3 %), industry (+13.3 %) and households (+2.9 %), while a reduction in consumption of energy sources was observed in agriculture and forestry (-3.6 %) and business and public sector (-2.7 %).  Figure 17. Final energy consumption of Latvia by sectors in 2008-201862  Key reads:  Transport Commercial and social sector Agriculture, forestry, fishing Industry and construction Households Total (final energy consumption) In the space of five years, the total consumption of energy sources in industry has increased by 12.8 %, reaching 37.6 PJ in 2018. The largest consumption of energy sources in 2018 was in manufacturing of wood, wooden and cork products  20.7 PJ or 50.4% of the final consumption of energy sources in industry. Energy consumption in this sector increased by 5.5 % in comparison with 2017 as a result of higher consumption of wood pellets. The largest reduction of consumption of energy sources in 2018 was registered in manufacture of basic metals (-7.9 %) in comparison with 2017. The consumption of energy sources by households was 51.5 PJ in 2018, which is 2.9 % more than in 2017. The structure of consumption of energy sources in households has not changed substantially in the recent years  wood fuel has been used predominantly. The consumption of natural gas has increased significantly (+9.3 %) and the consumption of coal has decreased (-32.7 %) in comparison with 2017. Over five years, the consumption of energy sources in transport has increased by 16.4 % and has reached 52.8 PJ in 2018. This constitutes approximately one third of Latvia                                                                                                                                                                      61 Within the meaning of Directive 2012/27/EC (and Directive 2018/2002) (within the scope of the definition defined in the directive) 62 Data source: CSB 41  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 consumption of energy sources, and is based almost entirely on imports of petroleum products, because the share of electricity and biofuel in transport is comparatively small. Diesel is the main energy source used in transport with a share of 64.3 % in 2018. Diesel is an important source of fuel for freight transport, which is an important economic sector in Latvia considering its geographic location. Diesel is a very important resource for the development of the agricultural industry. An increase in the share of consumption of liquefied gas has been observed in transport in recent years, though the consumption of liquefied natural gas in the total energy balance has fallen by 5.2 % compared with actual indicators in 2017. Petrol consumption of cars has fallen by 10.6 % over five years and reached 7.7 PJ in 2018, which was 4.1 % less than in 2017. The main reason for the increase in fuel consumption in road transport was an increase in the number of passenger cars (even higher increase in kilometres covered by passenger cars) and an increase in the number of registered passenger cars in 2014-2018 by approximately 7 % per year. In 2017-2018, the highest increase in transport energy consumption was observed in inland navigation (42.2 %), international air transport (9.5 %, due to an increase in air passengers), and rail transport (7.8 %, promoted by a 12.5 % increase in cargo transportation) . On the other hand, a reduction in transport energy consumption was observed in inland air transport and transport by pipeline.  Figure 18. Share of energy consumption in transport in 2018 (%)63   Right hand block reads, top to bottom: Bioethanol, Biodiesel fuel Electrical energy With continuous development of the sector, international air transport in 2018 had the second largest energy consumption in energy after road transport with a share of 11.9 % in transport energy consumption, but railway transport was the third largest transport energy consumer with 4.8 % of the total energy consumption in transport. By implementing the                                                       63 CSB 42  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 railway electrification project transition from diesel propulsion to electric propulsion, which will allow use to be made of more energy efficient locomotives and significantly reduce the use of fossil energy sources (estimated reduction  up to 45,126 t CO2 per year), making rail transport more environmentally friendly. 2.3.2. Progress in fulfilling the 2020 energy efficiency targets of Latvia  The analysis of actual primary energy consumption and final energy consumption trends until 2017 suggests that they are in line with fulfilling the optional target of Latvia for 2020.    Key should read, LH column: Primary energy consumption forecast  trajectory of indicative target Total primary energy consumption RH column: Energy final consumption forecast  trajectory of indicative target Final energy consumption Figure 19. Estimated and actual primary energy consumption and final energy consumption (under Directive 2012/27/EU) for 20122020 (PJ)64 The cumulative energy savings attained between 2014 and 2017 as a result of implementing alternative measures for improving energy efficiency until 2020 are 5 227 GWh, or 53 % of the mandatory cumulative target (9 896 GWh).  2.3.3. Current potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient DH and cooling  In accordance with the requirements of Article 14 of Directive 2012/27/EU, Latvia has carried out a comprehensive assessment of the potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling and a cost-benefit analysis pursuant to Directive 2012/27/EU65. The assessment led to the following results:                                                        64 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/lv_annual_report_2019_lv.zip  65 https://www.em.gov.lv/lv/nozares_politika/energoefektivitate_un_siltumapgade/zinojumi_eiropas_komisijai/  43  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 1) The overall share of cogeneration in DH in Latvia is high  72.6 %. Moreover, some of the regional DH systems in Latvia have almost reached the maximum share of cogeneration in heat production and a high share of renewable energy in the overall fuel structure in 2017 (e.g. Jelgava with 97 % output in cogeneration mode and 85 % of the fuel in the form of renewable energy). As a result of the analysis of the potential it was concluded that there is no potential for increasing the share of RES at national level in DH, while it was identified high-efficiency cogeneration in district heating but a more in-depth financial analysis is required in each specific case, and at the same time calculations should be based on market prices of electricity and thermal energy.  2) Compared to individual heating solutions, DH has the highest energy efficiency level due to higher share of efficient cogeneration. At the same time, DH requires significant investments in infrastructure and involves high operating and maintenance costs. Energy losses in the network also reduce the efficiency of DH. These conditions make DH economically viable only in territories with comparatively high density of heat demand.  Heating density in the territories analysed mostly shows sufficient heat demand for the expansion of the existing DH to be viable for the economy in general. The biggest potential for centralised heating is in the household sector. However, DH demand from households and industries is limited, as the majority prefer individual heating solutions for economic reasons. 3) In order to realise the centralisation potential in DH, it is necessary to create economic incentives to final consumers so that the heating costs in DH do not exceed the costs for alternative individual heating solutions. Such incentives include measures to achieve the reduction of heating tariffs in the DH system, including the need to attract EU funds for investments in establishing new regional DH networks and renovating the existing (old) networks in municipalities where the existing or planned intensity of the heating network exceeds 2 MWh/m. Optimisation of operation and maintenance processes of DH operators and review of the related costs is also necessary. 2.3.4. Indicative development projections The final energy consumption forecasts calculated using the macroeconomic forecast and the assumptions used in modelling provide that also in 2030 main final energy consumption sectors will be industrial and construction, transport and household sectors, which will consume 23.5 %, 24.2 % and 26.7 %, respectively, in total final energy consumption. The business and public sector will consume 15.6 %, but the share projected in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries is expected to be 6 %.  44  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00  Key should read, left to right, top to bottom: Agriculture, forestry, fishing Industry and construction Transport Non-energy use Commercial and social sector Households International aviation Total (final energy consumption) Figure 20. Final energy consumption projections broken down by sectors until 203066 (PJ) The most important increase in energy consumption in 2030, compared to 2018, is expected in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries  17.8 %, while a reduction in final energy consumption is expected in other sectors. The total energy consumption in 2030 is approximately 11 % smaller than in 2018.                                                       66 IPE 45  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00  Missing key should read, left to right top to bottom: Solid fossil fuel Solid biomass MSW Fossil liquefied fuel Liquid biomass Electrical energy Natural gas Gaseous biomass Figure 21. Final energy consumption projections broken down by types of energy until 203067 (PJ) It should be noted that the share of electricity and natural gas in total final energy consumption will increase by more than 5 percentage points by 2030. The increase in natural gas consumption is ensured by its wider use in road transport. At the same time, considering the increase of energy efficiency of cars and wider use of electric vehicles, the share of fossil liquid heating fuel / motor fuel consumption will reduce by approximately 6.7 percentage points.  Based on the calculated final energy consumption projections, the most optimal solution for final consumption in the baseline scenario (minimum total system requirements), where the calculated primary energy consumption in 2030 is approximately 12.9 % less than in 2017, and no significant changes are expected in the structure of primary energy types in 2030 compared to 2017. Consumption of solid biomass and liquid fossil heating fuel / motor fuel reduces most, but consumption of biofuel, biogas and other RES increases. The main reason for this reduction is decreased final energy consumption in households, services, business / services sector, and transport. The biggest reduction is observed in consumption of fossil heating fuel, gaseous biomass and solid biomass  by 33.9 %, 27.5 % and 23.6 %, respectively, which is explained by reduced fuel consumption in industry, household and transport, but the biggest increase will be in liquid biomass, which is used in transport, and                                                       67 IPE 46  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 other non-biomass RES, which is explained by growing use of zero emission RES technologies in domestic energy generation. No significant changes are expected in the structure of primary energy types, where the dominant types of heating fuel / motor fuel are natural gas and liquid fossil heating / motor fuel. The share of biomass in total consumption will fall by 6.5 percentage points, but the share of liquid fossil heating fuel / motor fuel by 5.9 percentage points.  Key should read as in previous figure.  Figure 22. Primary energy consumption projection until 203068 (PJ) The results of the modelled baseline scenario show that planned energy efficiency measures save 5.3 PJ of energy in 2030. This means that final energy consumption would be 5.3 PJ higher without these measures.  The results of the modelled baseline scenario show that planned energy efficiency measures with final energy consumers and save 7.2 PJ in energy transformation and transportation sectors in 2030. This means that primary energy consumption would be 7.2 PJ higher without these measures.  2.3.5. Cost-effective minimum level of requirements for buildings Minimum energy efficiency requirements for part of buildings and elements of buildings were increased in Latvia back in 2014. Changes and clarifications69 made to the construction standard entered into force on 1 January 2020 and focus on the improvement of the quality of projects and thus improvement of physical construction parameters of buildings. 5Table.

In order to avoid placing restrictions on various structural solutions and architectural configurations or the wishes of the designer, during reconstruction of buildings, regulatory thermal transmittance values have been removed from the current construction standard. It is important to reach kWh/m2 heating consumption and maximum permissible U values. Maximum permissible U values are shown in the standard for the purposes of restricting building of structures that are very poor and unsafe from and thermal and technical point of view, which may lead to different types of problems during operation.

The permissible U value for windows and balcony doors has been reduced.  The requirements for the minimum permissible level of energy performance of buildings, the assessment of energy performance for heating in renovations and reconstructions will be stepped up as from 2021, because: 1) Directive 2010/31/EU provides that the State encourage renovated buildings to be nearly zero-energy buildings; 2) the building decarbonisation target should be reached by 2050; 3) the current requirements for reconstructions and renovations in kWh/m2 was much easier to reach as HTR (with regard to the buildings with an area of at least 1000 m2 and the indicator be reached up to 60 kWh/m2 per year (the minimum permissible level for heating consumption)). Therefore, by bringing in experts in the respective area, it is necessary to evaluate the efficiency of indicators and compliance with different types of buildings and to improve the construction standard regulation if necessary.   6Table.
