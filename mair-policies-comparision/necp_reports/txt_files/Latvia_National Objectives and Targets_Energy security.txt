3.3. Energy security  SDSL2030 set the energy dependency reduction target for 2030 as less than 50 % of imported net energy sources in gross domestic energy consumption (plus bunkering), which matches the target included in LTESL2030  to reduce imports of energy and energy sources from the existing third country suppliers by 50 % compared to 2011. Table 19curity policy and their performance indicators Policy outcome in the energy security dimension Actual value Target value 2017 2020 2030150 Share of imports in gross national energy consumption (incl. bunkering) (%) 44.1 44.1 30-40 Share of imports from third countries in gross national energy consumption (incl. bunkering) (TWh) 17.7 - 14.1 Options to purchase natural gas from various sources (number of sources) >2  >2 Ensuring and improving energy security is also resolved by increasing the share of RES and improving energy efficiency in order to considerably reduce the need for energy sources (local or imported), but other used energy sources would be RES of different technologies and sources as much as possible. 3.3.1. For diversification of energy sources and supply from third countries With regard to the targets for diversification of energy sources, goal is to significantly increase the installed capacities of wind and solar technologies, as well as the capacity of heat pumps, where this volume is currently insignificant, the goal also being to develop the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) in                                                       150 Regular font is used for already applicable targets, which are set out in binding EU legislation, other Latvian policy planning documents or legislation, bold font is used for the binding targets to be defined in the Plan 86  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 transport and to start production of biomethane for its further use in transport or in production of electricity / thermal energy. With regard to the goals for diversification of energy supplies from third countries, Latvia has already performed electricity and natural gas market opening measures and has diversified suppliers of these resources. Although 100 % of petroleum products consumed in Latvia are imported and 78 % of petroleum products are consumed in transport (only two of all the countries importing petroleum products are third countries), Latviais to continue to secure the maximum number of suppliers of petroleum products. 3.3.2. Reducing energy imports EDG2020 lay down the energy independence (net energy imports/gross domestic energy consumption including bunkering) target for 2020  44.1 % share of energy imports in gross domestic energy consumption.  on imported energy sources can be seen to be falling  from 55.9 % in 2013 to 44.1 % in 2017. It can therefore be considered that Latvia is meeting its 2020 and 2030 targets through the implementation of current policies and measures. Therefore, Latvia has set the goal of continuing to reduce energy dependency as the goal for reducing energy dependency. LTESL2030, for its part, lays down an optional and non-binding target for 2030  to reduce energy imports from the existing third country suppliers by 50 % compared to 2011 when energy imports from countries outside the European Economic Area amounted to 28.2 TWh. It means that the respective imports cannot be larger than 14.1 TWh by 2030.  3.3.3. Increasing the flexibility of the energy system The goal in the period until 2022 is to develop national legislation for the operation of aggregators by prescribing rights and obligations of aggregators, payment for their services, and relations between aggregators and other participants of the system and market operators. This would promote the capacity of balancing the system and its flexibility. The operation of aggregators in Latvia is not possible without smart meters installed and available for the consumers. Under the electricity metering modernisation plan of AS the plan is 2022 (covers 99 % of consumers). The data readout system of smart electricity meters is protected by using multi-layer access principles, and all its layers use data encryption methods, thus excluding any possibility of the name, surname, or address of a specific user being identified in the data exchange process.
