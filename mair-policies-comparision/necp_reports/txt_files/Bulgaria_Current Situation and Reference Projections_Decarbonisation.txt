  168  iv. Technology cost developments 4.2 Decarbonisation 4.2.1 GHG emissions and removals i. Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in each of these sectors In 2016, GHG emissions in Bulgaria amounted to 59 060 Gg CO2, excluding the LULUCF sector. Emissions have decreased by 49.41 % compared to 1988 (baseline) and by 4.4 % compared to the emissions in the previous year (2015). The main reasons for the reduction of GHG emissions in Bulgaria are:  the structural reforms in the economy that resulted from the transition from planned to market economy;  the reduced electricity generation by thermal power plants (and increased shares of water and nuclear energy);  the structural changes in industry (including the lower output of energy-intensive enterprises and the improved energy efficiency);  implementing energy efficiency measures in the housing sector;  shift from solid and liquid fuels to natural gas in energy consumption;  the decline in the populations of bovine animals and sheep and in the use of fertilisers.

Baseline year Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Industrial processes Energy Waste Agriculture    169   Source: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report  The Energy sector (GHG emissions from combustion of fuels) held the highest share in total GHG emissions in 2016: 71.8 %. The Agriculture sector ranked second, with 11.0 %, the Industrial Processes and Use of Solvents sector (IPUS) ranked third with 10.3 % and the Waste sector came next with 6.9 %. The share of emissions covered by the emissions trading scheme in total GHG emissions stood at 56.6 % in 2016, and the share of emissions outside the scheme stood at 42.2 %. Energy sector In 2016, the emissions from the Energy sector decreased by 47.9 % compared to the baseline year (42 386 Gg CO2eq in 2016 compared to 81 320 Gg CO2eq in 1988). Compared to the previous year, in 2016 the emissions decreased by 6.9 % due to the lower electricity output from fossil fuels. The main source of emissions in the sector is the incineration of solid fuels which accounted for 57.8 % of the emissions in the sector in 2016, followed by liquid fuels at 29.0 % and gaseous fuels at 12.2 %. GHG emissions between 1988 and 2016 were driven by the significant reduction in emissions from fuel combustion in the energy industries (35.7 %) and in the use of energy in the manufacturing industry and construction (83.4 %) and in other sectors (commercial, residential, forestry)  72.3 %, as well as by the clear increase in GHG emissions from transport by 30.2 %. Figure 20: GHG emissions from the Energy sector, 1989-2016, Gg CO2eq   Source: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report Baseline year   170  Energy industries Fuel consumption from the following sub-sections is included in this section:   electricity generation and transmission, including cogeneration;  heat generation and transmission for public needs;  natural gas transmission (maintaining the pressure of compressor stations). For 2016, the overall trend in category 1.A.1 is a reduction of emissions by 35.7 % as compared to the baseline year and by 10.5 % as compared to the previous year. Table 31: 2eq. Year 1988 1990 2016 Aggregated emissions, Gg CO2 eq. 42.179 38.677 27.128  Manufacturing industry and construction The Manufacturing industry and construction subsector includes the following groups:   Iron and steel;   Non-ferrous metals;   Chemicals;  Paper, pulp and printing services;   Food, beverages and tobacco;   Non-metallic mineral products;   Other.  sector, the general trend in this category shows a trend of reduction in emissions by 83.4 % as compared to the baseline year and a small increase by 1.7 % as compared to the previous year. Practically all sub-categories in the industry sector registered a continual decrease until 2009, remaining at the same level for several years, and registering a small increase after 2014. Table 32: Projected emissions in the Manufacturing industry and construction subsector, Gg 2 eq. Year 1988 1990 2016 Aggregated emissions, Gg CO2 eq. 17.503 17.768 2.910 Transport In the period between 1988 and 1991 fuel consumption in the transport sector fell by 48 % as a result of the collapse of the economy. Fuel consumption has been steadily increasing since 1991 mainly due to road transport. Despite the decline in 2013, since 2014 the use of road transport fuels once again started to increase.

Year 1988 1990 2016 Aggregated emissions, Gg CO2 eq. 6.918 8.103 1.915  Industrial Processes and Use of Solvents sector (IPUS) A steady downward trend in emissions in this sector has been observed since 1988. Emissions in 2016 decreased by 54.9 % as compared to the baseline year 1988. In 2016, the IPUS sector had a share of 10.3 % of total national emissions of greenhouse gases (excluding LULUCF) as compared to 11.5 % in the baseline year 1988. in 2016 GHG emissions from IPUS stood at 6 062 Gg CO2 as compared to 13 438 Gg CO2 in the baseline year 1988. In 2016, the most important category were mineral products (mainly production of clinker and lime) with a 40.44 % share in total emissions from IPUS. The second category was the chemical industry (production of ammonia and nitric acid) with 30.32 %, followed by the use of products intended as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances with a share of 23.1 % and the manufacturing of metals (steel) with a share of 3.69 %. The GHG emissions from the IPUS sector vary over time and reached a record low in 2009. The reduction in 2016 for the entire sector was 54.9 % of the baseline year value, with the highest reduction of 94.4 % in metals manufacturing. This was mainly due to the economic crisis and the 2009 global economic crisis in particular. After 1996, a process of privatisation began, which led to lower output of enterprises. This process was followed by restructuring and modernisation of production while some enterprises discontinued their operation. The overall decline in emissions over the years was also influenced by the deployment of better technologies at company level. Table 35  Year 1988 1990 2016 Aggregated emissions, Gg CO2 eq. 13.438 10.047 6.062  Agriculture sector The total reduction of emissions in the sector for the period since 1988 was 52.6 %. In 2016, agriculture generated 11.0 % to total GHG emissions in Bulgaria (excluding LULUCF). The emissions reduction was mainly due to the consistent decrease in agricultural land as a result of abandoned cropland and lower livestock population. The decreased use of fertilisers was another driver of emissions reduction.   172  Table 36: Projected GHG emissions in the Agriculture sector, Gg 2eq. Year 1988 1990 2016 Aggregated emissions, Gg CO2 eq. 13.768 12.462 6.583  Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector The LULUCF sector plays the role of greenhouse gas remover for Bulgaria through the CO2 2 emissions. Net CO2 removals from the LULUCF sector decreased by 57.1 % as compared to 1988 (baseline). The main reason for the drop in CO2 emission removals was the drop in removals by Forests and the small increase of emissions from the categories Cropland, Settlements and Wetland.  The key reason for the reduced removals by the Forests category was the reported decline in the growth of forests as the average age of forests has been consistently increasing during the reporting period. Despite the drop, the share of removals in total 2 eq) is still significant. This is because the emissions in the other sectors have decreased too. The share of removals in the baseline year was 15.01 % of 2 emissions, and in 2016 their share stood at 12.44 %. Compared to the baseline year, an increase in cropland, settlements and wetland is observed. Total emissions from cropland fluctuated throughout the period. Emissions from settlements increased in recent years due to changes from other land uses near to the EU. Figure 21: Emissions and removals in LULUCF 1989  2016, Gg  eq.  Baseline year LULUCF D.

Harvested wood products Source: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report   173  Waste sector The 24 and N2O emissions. The main share of CH4 emissions from the sector is due to municipal solid waste disposal. N2O emissions are generated in waste water treatment and biological treatment and incineration of waste. CO2 comes from waste incineration. The trends reflect the current state-of-play in waste management in accordance with applicable legislation with the aim of reducing the quantity of waste going to landfills and in line with the waste management hierarchy. Planned measures for GHG emission reduction in the sector involve mainly the management of municipal solid waste. Bulgarian waste management policy is implemented in strict compliance with the waste hierarchy principle: Prevention -> Preparation for re-use -> Recycling -> Other use -> Landfilling Good waste management lowers pressure from waste disposal and mitigates the effects of landfilling. The European Environmental Agency (EEA) has estimated that improved waste management significantly lowers annual net GHG emissions, with the greatest share of emissions reduction being achieved after 2000. The main factors contributing to this positive development are the lower methane emissions from landfills and the avoidance of emissions through recycling. An additional instrument for expanding recycling is that demand for certain materials is largely satisfied by recycled materials. Waste constitute a loss of material resources (through metals and other recyclable materials) as they have a potential as energy sources. Waste management is beset by major challenges. Waste treatment activities such as re-use and recycling are environmentally-friendly and lead to landfill diversion. In 2016, the total municipal waste produced per person in Bulgaria was 404 against the EU average of 483 kg) Figure 22: Progress achieved in waste management in Bulgaria as compared to EU average (1/2)  Municipal waste recycling Municipal waste landfilling EU target 2035 EU target 2035 EU target 2020   Bulgaria 2016 Bulgaria 2016  Source: Eurostat news release   174   Figure 23 Progress achieved in waste management in Bulgaria as compared to EU average (2/2)  Recycling of packaging waste Recycling of plastic packaging waste Electric and electronic waste EU target 2030 EU target 2030 EU target 2006 EU target 2008* EU target 2008*    Bulgaria 2016 Bulgaria 2016 Bulgaria 2016  *Bulgaria was expected to achieve its goals in 2014. Source: Eurostat news release  The measures to reduce GHG emissions in the sector are mainly related too solid municipal waste management and to the continual fall in population in the last 10 years. The respective measures are set out in two plans  the National Waste Management Plan and the Third National Climate Change Action Plan. Both plans have a time horizon until 2020. In 2016, emissions from the waste sector decreased by 50.39 % (4 081.82 Gg CO2 eq. in 2016 against 8 227.31 Gg CO2 eq. in 1988) as compared to baseline levels.  Table 37: Trend in 2eq.

Projections by sector with the existing national and Union policies and measures by 2040 (including 2030) (recast) Projected GHG emissions for the Energy sector Projected GHG emissions for the energy sector are based on an analysis of the change in existing measures planned and used as basic assumptions. The analysis is based on the (B)EST modelling software for long-term assessment of energy needs and energy planning. The projections take into account all existing measures for greenhouse gas emissions reduction and the existing measures to achieve the targets for energy from renewable sources and energy efficiency set out in detail in the relevant sections of this Plan. The general trends for the energy sector are as follows: Table 39: Projected emissions in the Energy sector, CO2 eq. ktoe Emissions 2015 2020 2025 2030 2 emissions, in ktoe CO2 eq.  45 428.60 44 516.48 43 590.16 37 923.98 CH4 and N2O emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 1 822.85 2 085.07 2 102.87 2 065.62 Total GHG emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 47 251.45 46 601.55 45 693.02 39 989.60 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling   176   The results of the modelling set out in the table above show that by 2030 GHG emissions will decrease by 15.4 % as compared to emission levels in 2015 (baseline). The main specifically the fact that during the period analysed primary energy production decreased by 8.5 TWh. This s largely due to the projected continual decrease in the production of energy from solid fuels in the period 2020-2030, which the main source of GHG emissions in the energy sector. The shares of wind, hydro- and geothermal power are projected to remain the same against an increase in the share of natural gas from 1.06 % in 2020 up to 2.34 % in 2030. Solar power is projected to increase from 1.18 % in 2020 to 3.95 % in 2030. In 2030, nuclear energy is expected to continue to play an important role in energy production. More information about the changes in the energy mix contributing to a reduction in the greenhouse emissions analysed in this section is set out in the sections on the increase in the use of energy from renewable sources, energy efficiency, the internal energy market and energy security.  Figure 25: Final energy consumption by sector, GWh  Industry Households Services Transport  Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling, Deloitte analysis The energy industries sub-sector covers the following:  electricity generation and transmission, including cogeneration;  heat generation and transmission for public needs;  natural gas transmission (maintaining the pressure of compressor stations). The sector of energy industries consists of large-scale electricity and heat generation plants. This sector generates the bulk of GHG emissions and according to projections the situation will persist in the future.   177  Table 40: Projected emissions in the Energy industries sector, CO2 eq. ktoe Emissions 2015 2020 2025 2030 2 emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 29 376.24 28 487.87 27,489.18 22 413.15 N2O emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 117.30 96.8 94.15 71.91 Total GHG emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 29 493.54 28 584.67 27 583.33 22 485.06 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling The table above shows that by 2030 the total quantity of GHG emissions from the energy industries is projected to decrease by approximately 23.5 % as compared to GHG emission levels in 2015 (baseline). Manufacturing industry and construction sub-sector The projections for this sector are based on the expectations and forecasts for economic development, the shares of individual subsectors, the projected use of fuels, and the general projections for the use of some primary energy sources. Table 41: Projected emissions in the Manufacturing industry and construction subsector, Gg 2 eq., ktoe Emissions 2015 2020 2025 2030 2 emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 2 817.40 4 933.75 4 920.45 4 753.33 N2O emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 26.69 28.84 32.11 33.22 Total GHG emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 2 844.09 4 962.59 4 952.57 4 786.55 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling The table above shows that by 2025 as compared to 2015 (baseline) an insignificant reduction of the GHG emissions from the Manufacturing industry and construction subsector is projected by approximately 2 %, which can be attributed to the expected positive development of the sector. A further reduction in emissions from the subsector is projected by 2030 as a result of the implementation of existing promote energy efficiency measures and the incentives for the use of renewable energy in industry. GHG emissions are projected to decrease by 5.3 % as compared to 2015 (baseline). In the period until 2040, the final consumption of energy by the different sectors of industry will remain at relatively constant levels as shown in the chart below.    178  Figure 26: Final energy consumption by the different sectors of the economy (GWh)  Iron and steel Construction materials Machine building Ferrous metals Paper and pulp Textile Chemistry Food, beverages and tobacco Other industries Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling, Deloitte analysis  Figure 27: Final energy consumption by type of fuel and energy in the Processing industry and Construction sectors, GWh  Solid fuels Gas Solar Hydrogen Electricity Liquid fuels Biomass Geothermal Heat  Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling, Deloitte analysis  Transport sector In the period between 1988 and 1991, fuel consumption in transport dropped by 48 % as a result of the collapse of the economy. Since 1991, fuel consumption has been steadily increasing mainly due to road transport and the transit traffic of heavy goods vehicles. Despite the decline in 2013, since 2014 the use of road transport fuels has been increasing.   179  The projection for the development of the Transport subsector is based on the projected use of fuels in the sector. The CO2 emissions from the Transport subsector are calculated on the basis of projected energy consumption in the transport sector. The transport sector is divided into four subsectors: road traffic, air traffic, rail traffic and navigation. Table 42: Projected emissions in the Transport subsector, Gg 2 eq.  ktoe Emissions 2015 2020 2025 2030 2 emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 8 903.71 8 983.93 9 179.60 8 868.88 CH4 and N2O emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 110.32 113.56 113.85 107.18 Total GHG emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 9 014.03 9 097.49 9 293.45 8 976.06 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling As regards GHG emissions from the Transport sector, by 2030 an insignificant reduction by approximately 0.4 % as compared to 2015 (baseline) is expected. Despite an overall increase in final energy consumption in transport owing to aviation, higher greenhouse gas emissions reductions by approximately 35 % are expected in 2030 as compared to 2020. [The volume of] private passenger road transport is projected to continue to increase throughout the period, remaining a major part of the sector. As regards the use of renewable energy in transport, diversification of sources is expected through the introduction of new generation biofuels (352 GWh in 2030) and hydrogen 34 GWh in 2030). In addition, by 2030 the share of electricity in renewable energy is expected to double as compared to 2020.

The increase of the share of motor vehicles using biofuels and electric vehicles is in turn expected to significantly contribute to a reduction in GHG emissions from the Transport subsector.   181  Projected GHG emissions in the Industrial Processes and Use of Solvents sector The projection for the development of the sector reflects expectations for recovery and a gradual growth after the decline driven by the economic crisis. The change in the industrial structure reflects the projected change in the structure of subsectors.

Projected GHG emissions in the Agricultural sector  This sector has not implemented any measures for emissions reduction. The reduction is the direct result of the overall decline in agriculture since 1988. Emission reduction from livestock breeding reflects the reduced number of cattle.

In addition to the decarbonisation measures set out in the Third National Climate Action Plan 2013-2020, which will continue to be implemented during the period 2020-2030 with a view to achieving the targets set in the INECP, the WEM scenario also takes into account the measures envisaged for the agricultural sector in the National Air Pollution Control Programme 2020-2030, which albeit primarily aimed at lowering air pollution, will also have a positive impact on GHG emissions. Projected GHG emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector Projections made have a time horizon until 2030 and take into account the targets set out in the following strategic documents:    182   Third National Climate Change Action Plan (20132020)  National Strategy for Development of the Forestry Sector in the Republic of Bulgaria 20132020  National Strategy for Development of the Forestry Sector in the Republic of Bulgaria 20132020  Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector 20142023  Common Agricultural Policy 20142020.  National Forest Inventory Report of Bulgaria 2021-2025 GHG removals are mainly attributable to forests. All other categories (Cropland, 2 emissions. The overall reduction of CO2 emission removals by the LULUCF is mainly due to the lower removals by the Forests category and the small increase of emissions from the Cropland, Settlements and Wetland categories. The reasons for the decrease in removals by the Forests category is the slowdown in forest growth due to the average age of forests. The increase in the use of biomass is projected to have a neutral impact on land and therefore the LULUCF sector because no significant increase in the land allocated to energy crop cultivation is projected. For biomass production, Bulgaria is expected to rely on the unutilised potential of biomass, which includes the biodegradable fraction of products, waste and residues from biological origin from agriculture (including vegetal and animal substances), forestry and related industries, fisheries and aquaculture, and biodegradable waste fraction, including industrial and municipal waste from biological origin that meet the sustainability criteria stipulated in Article 29 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Overall, no significant changes in land use are projected to occur in the next 10 years.

However, the projection based on the model and on the National Forest Inventory Report show that a decrease in the removals capacity of forests may be expected in Bulgaria.  Projected GHG emissions in the Waste sector  24 and N2O. The main share of CH4 emissions from the sector is due to municipal solid waste disposal. N2O emissions are generated in waste water treatment and biological treatment and incineration of waste. Projections take account of the current status of waste management in compliance with the effective legislation.  In order to achieve the targets set in the INECP, the respective measures set out in the National Waste Management Plan and the Third National Climate Action Plan will be extended until 2030 and will be updated and further developed, depending on the programmes achieved in their implementation. The main targets in the Waste sector are set out in detail in the National Waste Management Plan (NPUO) 2014-2020 and in the detailed programmes and measures put in place to ensure their achievement. The main targets are projected to significantly increase the share of waste for recovery and recycling over the years.  The NPUO plays a key role in achieving resource efficiency and sustainable waste management. This is so because current situation in Bulgaria reveals a significant potential for improvement in both waste prevention and waste management, better utilisation of resources, opening new markets and job creation in parallel to lowering the harmful impact of waste on the environment.  The fourth NPUO is a plan for the transition to efficient waste utilisation as a resource and sustainable development through waste prevention, to the degree possible. The successful implementation of the plan will help prevent and reduce the harmful effects of   184  waste on the environment and human health and will reduce the use of primary natural resources. The implementation of a Programme for achieving the targets and ensuring compliance with the requirements for biodegradable waste, including biowaste, has a significant contribution to the achievement of the targets for lowering GHG emissions in accordance with the Third National Climate Action Plan until 2020 because the achievement of the targets for biodegradable waste also contribute to the reduction of methane emissions from municipal waste landfills. The continued implementation of the National Waste Management Plan and the Third National Climate Change Plan will result in a significant reduction in GHG emissions.  Projected emissions in the sector entail the implementation of programmes for reduction of biodegradable waste going to landfills and landfill methane capture and incineration. However, the implementation of good practices may also contribute to the capture and combustion of approximately 50 % of gas emissions.

Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in each of these sectors14 In accordance with the requirements laid down in Directive 2009/28/EC, the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NPDEVR) sets a binding national target of a 16 % share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption in the country by 2020. In ted in the NPDEVR, the projected gross final energy consumption for 2020 is 10 738 ktoe, meaning that to achieve the binding national target, renewable energy consumption should be 1 718 ktoe.  tion and use of energy from renewable sources, which was submitted to the European Commission at the end of 2013, stated that in 2012 Bulgaria had overachieved the binding national target of a 16% share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption for 2020. The promotion and use of energy from renewable sources) indicate an ongoing growth of the energy use from renewable sources and in 2018 a 20.5 % share of energy from final consumption of energy from renewable sources exceeds the quantity estimate set out in the National Plan for 2020, having reached 2 230.1 ktoe in 2018. In 2018, an increase by 37.2 % compared to 2012 was achieved. Over the period 2012-2018 consumption in the heating and cooling and electricity sectors increased by 22.0 % and 42.0 %, respectively. The use of energy from renewable sources increased significantly in the Transport sector from 5.1 ktoe in 2012 to 151.1 ktoe in 2018.                                             14SHARES tool 2018 data.   186   Figure 32: Gross final energy consumption of energy from renewable sources for the period 2012-2018, ktoe The breakdown of energy from renewable sources by sector is as follows:   Heating and cooling; The sector has the highest contribution to the achievement of the binding national target, with gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources reaching 1 349.2 ktoe in 2018.

In 2018 as compared to 2012, a positive trend was that the use of renewable energy from heat pumps increased by 96.6 %, followed by solar energy with a 61.7 % increase and geothermal energy with a 3.6 % increase. Solid biomass continues to be the renewable source of highest importance to this sector and with the greatest application in the Household sector. In recent years the use of wood wastes, other plant wastes and biomass from agriculture and sewage sludge increased, although not at the expected rate.   electricity sector; In 2018, the production of electricity from renewable sources stood at 8 583 GWh15, which represents an increase by 42 % as compared to 2012. The increase is attributable to the commissioning of new solar plants, wind farms and biomass power plants and the transition of power plants using conventional fuels to biomass. The structure of electricity generation is shown in the figure below:  HPP WF PhvP Biomass-powered power plants  Figure 33: Gros generation of electricity from renewable sources in the period 2012-2018 (electricity generation by hydropower plants and wind farms has been normalised), GWh During the period 2012-2018 electricity generation by all plants registered an increase, which was most significant in biomass power plants (from 66 GWh to 1 492 GWh) and in solar plants (from 814 GWh to 1 343 GWh).                                             15Production of electricity by hydropower plants and solar plants has been normalised in accordance with the requirements laid down in Directive 2009/28/EC.   188  In the same period installed capacity also increased for all types of types using energy from renewable sources both on account of the rehabilitation of existing power plants (mostly hydropower plants) and the commissioning of new plans and the transition of thermal plants from conventional fuels to biomass. In 2018, installed capacity stood at 5 305.4 MW. As compared to 2012, this represents an increase by 8.6 % (from 4 885 MW). The consumption of energy from renewable sources in the electricity sector has a contribution of 33.1 % in gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources in 2018.

This is reason for the reported quantity of energy from renewable sources in transport in 2012 (5.1 ktoe), which only takes into account electricity consumption. In the period between 2013 and 2018, the final consumption of energy from renewable sources in transport increased significantly, reaching 151.5 ktoe in 2018.

Indicative development projections with existing policies for the year 2030 (with an outlook to the year 2040) The method used to calculate the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources is based on the requirements laid down in Directive 2009/28/EC and on the amendments introduced by Directive (EU) 2018/2001. During the period 2020-2030, the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption ranged from 20.18 % up to 24.73 %. In the period between 2020 and 2025 the increase will be mainly attributable to the commissioning of new plants and in the period between 2025 and 2030 to the implementation of measures to increase energy efficiency in final energy consumption. A further increase is expected in the period after 2030, with the share of energy from renewable sources reaching nearly 28 % by 2040.    190  Figure 34: Indicative trajectory of the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy in the period 2020-2040   Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling, Deloitte analysis The current policy measures have a positive impact on the share of energy from renewable sources in all sectors. The highest increase is expected in the electricity sector where the share of electricity from renewable sources may reach 29.60 % in 2030 and 32.02 % in 2040.  The continued implementation of existing policy measures over the period 2020-2030 will enable Bulgaria to achieve an annual increase of the share of energy from renewable sources in the heating and cooling sector of approximately 1 percentage point (calculated as the difference between the share of energy from renewable sources for the period 2020-2030, divided by the number of years), which is lower than the targets set in Directive (EU) 2018/2001. The cited Directive sets a target for a share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption in transport of at least 14 % to be achieved by each Member State. WEM scenario projections indicate that this share will not be achieved by 2030.  This means that additional policy measures are required to promote the consumption of energy from renewable sources in accordance with Directive (EU) 2018/2001.    191  Figure 35: Indicative trajectory of the share of energy from renewable sources in final energy consumption in the electricity and heating and cooling sectors and transport for the period 2020-2040 (%)  RS-Heating and cooling RS-Electricity RS-Transport Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling, Deloitte analysis With existing policy measures, in the period 2020-2030 installed capacity for electricity generation will increase by an annual average of 1.1 %, reaching total installed capacity of 13.9 GW in 2030. Projections for 2030 show a significant increase in the installed capacity of biomass-fired power plants (annual average growth rate of 11.5 % for the period 2020-2030 and solar plants (annual average growth rate of 12.4 % for the period 2020-2030). On the other hand, a decrease in the installed capacity of power plants fired by solid fuels at an annual average rate of 5.2 % over the period 2020-2030 is projected, with nuclear and hydropower plant capacity remaining relatively stable.  Figure 36: Indicative trajectory of net installed capacity for electricity generation for the period 2020-2040, GW  Nuclear power plant 0-0 % Wind farms +2.4 % Power plants fired by solid fuels -5.2 % Biomass-fired power plants +11.5 % Hydropower plants 0.0% Solar plants +12.4 % Power plants fired by gaseous fuels +2.8 %  Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling, (% in the key shows the annual average rate of increase for the period 2020  2030   192  As regards the production of energy for heating, installed capacity is projected to increase in 2025, followed by a significant decrease due to the decommissioning of cogeneration plants and heating plants. As a result, net installed capacity in 2030 is projected at a total of 5.7 GW. Until 2030 the ratio between heat and electricity cogeneration plants and district heating plants is expected to remain stable (80 % for cogeneration plants and 20 % for heating plants). In the period 2030-2040, cogeneration plants and heating utilities are expected to be decommissioned, which will result in a decrease of the net installed capacity of the two types of plants to 3.4 GW in 2040.

In the period 2020-2030, private passenger transport by road is expected to decrease. A small increase of the volume of rail transport is projected. After 2030, final energy consumption will decrease until 2040 as a result of the implementation of energy efficiency measures. A diversification of sources is expected in terms of the energy from renewable sources used in transport as a result of the use of new generation fuels (30.3 ktoe in 2030) and hydrogen (3 ktoe in 2030). The share of electricity from renewable sources is projected to increase threefold in 2030 as compared to 2020.   193  Figure 38: Projected final consumption of energy and energy from renewable sources in transport for the period 2020-2040, GWh   Final energy consumption New generation biofuels Electricity Conventional biofuels Hydrogen  Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling  The projected gross production of electricity is based on the following assumptions:  an increase in the consumption of electricity in Bulgaria to nearly 35 600 GWh in 2030;  a reduction of losses in transmission and distribution as a result of the implementation of energy efficiency measures;  a projected increase of losses in storage and supply and demand management by 12 % in 2030 as compared to levels in 2020;   a decrease in the own energy own needs of power plants as a result of the implementation of energy efficiency measures;  consumption of electricity for hydrogen production by Power to X plants of 47 GWh (the entire quantity is projected to be consumed in 2030).  export of electricity will remain relatively stable throughout the period at a level of 8 000 GWh per year. WEM projections for the use of energy from renewable sources take into account the expected construction of new wind farms and solar plants by 2030. Thus, electricity generation by wind farms is expected to reach 15 % of gross production of electricity from renewable sources, with the production of electricity from renewable sources by solar plants projected to exceed 37 %. In addition, new biomass-fired power plants are   194  expected to be commissioned, with the electricity they generate projected to reach 1 347 GWh by 2030. The electricity generated by hydropower plants is projected to remain at the same level until 2030. In the period leading up to 2040 an increase in electricity generation is projected solely for wind farms, with the electricity output of installed capacity relying on other renewable sources remaining at the same levels.

Despite the expected increase in solar plant installed capacity, the share of solar energy will remain low (approximately 2.6 % in 2040). The quantity of biomass used will continue to increase in absolute terms over the entire period, but its share in gross consumption of energy for heating from renewable sources will decrease, reaching 82 % in 2040 from 88 % in 2020. The use of heat pumps for heat generation will continue to develop, reaching 2 444 GWh in 2040.    195  Figure 40: Curve showing the production and consumption of energy from biomass disaggregated by origin and use for the period 2020-2040, TWh  Generation / Consumption 2020 Generation / Consumption 2025 Generation / Consumption 2030 Generation / Consumption 2035 Generation / Consumption 2040 Net import Steam generation Electricity generation   Domestic generation Heat Final energy consumption (all sectors)   Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling  During the period 2020-2040 the demand for energy from biomass is expected to increase on account of the increase in final consumption and in the use of biomass for the production of electricity. Meeting demand for biomass will require 9 % increase in biomass production in Bulgaria in the period 2020-2030. Net import should also increase from 58 GWh in 2020 to 835 GWh in 2030, reaching 1 168 GWh in 2040.  Figure 41 Final consumption of energy from biomass by sector for the period 2020-2040, TWh  Services Industry Transport Households Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling   196   In the period 2020-2040 final consumption of energy from biomass is projected to increase in all sectors of the economy, with the exception of the services sector where it is projected to remain relatively stable. The largest increase by 65 % is projected for the industry sector, followed by the transport sector (8 %) on account of the higher demand for biofuels. The households sector, which has the highest share of consumption of energy from biomass as compared to all other sectors (more than 66 % in 2020), is projected to see a slowdown in the rate of increase in consumption to result in an overall increase by 3.4 % in the period 2020-2040
