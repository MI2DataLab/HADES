Cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements resulting from national calculations, in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU The first minimum energy performance requirements for buildings have been adopted on the 21st of December 2007, and since then they have been revised three times. From 2013 and onwards any revision of the requirements is based on the results of calculating the cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements as it is foreseen by article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU. The following tables show the development of minimum energy requirements through time for new and existing buildings. 175  Table 4.11: Minimum energy performance requirements for new buildings  Minimum requirements of 568/2007) In effect from 21.12.2007 Minimum requirements of 2009  In effect from 1.1.2010 Minimum requirements 432/2013) In effect from 11.12.2013 Minimum requirements  In effect from 1.1.2017 Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) 366/2014) Walls maximum U - value 0.85 W/m2 K 0.85 W/m2 K 0.72 W/m2 K 0.4 W/m2 K Walls can be up to 0,6 W/m2K if windows up to 2,5 W/m2K 0.4 W/m2 K Roof and floor in contact with external environment maximum U - value 0.75 W/m2 K 0.75 W/m2 K 0.63 W/m2 K 0.4 W/m2 K 0.4 W/m2 K Floor above closed unheated spaces maximum U - value 2.0 W/m2 K 2.0 W/m2 K 2.0 W/m2 K - - Window maximum U - value 3.8 W/m2 K 3.8 W/m2 K 3.23 W/m2 K 2.9 W/m2 K .,25 W/m2 K Maximum average U - value of the building envelope excluding the horizontal elements - 1.3 W/m2 K for residential buildings 1.8 W/m2 K for non  residential buildings 1.3 W/m2 K for residential buildings 1.8 W/m2 K for non  residential buildings - - Maximum window shading factor   -  - 0.63 0.63  - Maximum average installed lighting power for office buildings  -  -  - 10 W/m2 10 W/m2 Renewable Energy - Installation of solar Installation of solar water At least 25% of primary For all buildings, at 176  Sources  water heater for Domestic Hot Water in residential buildings Provision for installing RES electricity system heater for Domestic Hot Water in residential buildings Provision for installing RES electricity system At least 3% of primary energy consumption must come from RES for non-residential buildings energy consumption must come from RES for single-family homes At least 3% of primary energy consumption must come from RES for residential apartment buildings At least 7% of primary energy consumption must come from RES for non- residential buildings least 25% of primary energy consumption must come from RES  Table 4.12: Minimum energy performance requirements for existing buildings   Minimum requirements 568/2007) In effect from 21.12.2007 Minimum requirements 446/2009) In effect from 1.1.2010 Minimum requirements 432/2013) In effect from 11.12.2013 Minimum requirements 379/2016) In effect from 1.1.2017 Major renovation  Walls maximum U - value 0.85 W / m2 K only for buildings above 1000m2  0.85 W / m2 K only for buildings above 1000m2 0.72 W / m2 K only for buildings above 1000m2 - Roof and floor in contact with the external environment maximum U - value 0.75 W / m2 K only for buildings above 1000m2 0.75 W / m2 K only for buildings above 1000m2 0.63 W / m2 K only for buildings above 1000m2 - Floor above closed unheated spaces maximum U - value 2.0 W / m2 K only for buildings above 1000m2 2.0 W / m2 K only for buildings above 1000m2 2.0 W / m2 K only for buildings above 1000m2 - 177  Window maximum U - value 3.8 W / m2 K only for buildings above 1000m2 3.8 W / m2 K only for buildings above 1000m2 3.23 W / m2 K only for buildings above 1000m2 - Maximum window shading factor - - 0.63 only for buildings above 1000m2 - Minimum energy class on the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) - above 1000m2 above 1000m2  Building elements that are replaced or retrofitted  Walls maximum U - value - - 0.72 W / m2 K for all buildings 0.4 W / m2 K for all buildings Roof and floor in contact with the external environment maximum U - value - - 0.63 W / m2 K for all buildings 0.4 W / m2 K for all buildings Floor above closed unheated spaces maximum U - value - - 2.0 W / m2 K for all buildings - Window maximum U - value - - 3.23 W / m2 K for all buildings 2.9 W / m2 K for all buildings Maximum window shading factor - - 0.63 for all buildings -   178   The results of the second calculation of cost-optimal levels, which took place in 2018, have clearly indicated that new residential buildings and offices should be Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB), as they are in the spectrum of cost-optimality. Exception appears to be hotels, though tightening of current minimum energy performance requirements for this type of buildings also applies. Considering existing buildings which are renovated, higher energy performance should be required than category B, but lower than the NZEB level. It has to be noted that the definition of NZEB is the same for new and existing buildings. Additionally, according to the calculation single measures that provide high economic benefit in the life cycle of the existing building are: 1) Roof insulation 2) Heat pumps for heating 3) Photovoltaics 4) High efficiency air conditioning units 5) LED lighting 6) Solar Water Heaters for hot water  7) Biomass boilers  and not the societal point of view.  MECI after finalizing the calculation results has prepared the new minimum energy performance requirements which have gone through public consultation. The new requirements are currently being legally vetted by the Legal Service of the Republic of Cyprus, and the aim is to be set in force by the 1st of January 2020. The table below shows the draft of the new requirements.

For hotels at least 9% of primary energy consumption must come from RES.
