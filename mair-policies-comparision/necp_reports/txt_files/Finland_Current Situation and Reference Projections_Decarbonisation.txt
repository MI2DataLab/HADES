1324.2 Dimension Decarbonisation4.2.1 GHG emissions and removalsi. Trends in current GHG emissions and removals in the EU ETS, effort sharing and LULUCF sectors and different energy sectorsii. Projections of sectoral developments with existing national and Union policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)TransportGreenhouse gas emissions from domestic transport totalled 11.3 Mt CO2 equivalent in 2017. Transport emissions account for approximately a fifth of Finland™s total greenhouse gas emissions and some 40 % of emissions in the effort sharing sector. Greenhouse gas emissions from domestic transport increased from the economic depression in the early 1990s until 2007. Since 2008, they have mainly been decreasing. From 2005 to 2017, greenhouse gas emissions from transport dropped by some 1.3 million tonnes in total, or by 10 %.The WEM projection for transport is based on the traffic performance projected until 2030 by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. According to the projection, road transport performance will increase by approximately 0.9 % a year in 2016Œ2020 and by approximately 0.8 % a year in 2021Œ2030. This rate would result in a total increase of 12 % in road transport performance by 2030. Another key assumption in the WEM projection is the replacement rate of cars and the average CO2 emissions of new vehicles. In the WEM projection, the annual replacement rate of cars is estimated at approximately 5 %. In 2020, the specific emissions of new cars would be close to the limit of 95 g/km that the EU has established for car manufacturers, but they would no longer decrease after 2020 without new (EU-level) measures. The third factor having a substantial impact on transport greenhouse gas emissions in the WEM projection is the share of biofuels in the total consumption of fuel in transport. In the WEM projection, the actual share of biofuels is estimated at 13.5 % in 2020 and beyond. The estimate is based on the Act on Promoting the use of Biofuels in Transport (laki biopolttoaineiden käytön edistämisestä liikenteessä 446/2007), which stipulates that biofuels must account for a calculated share of 20 % of all transport fuels sold from 2020. The quota obligation allows ‚double counting™, in 133which certain biofuels that do not compete with food production count double for compliance with the target. The WEM projection is based on the assumption that starting from 2020 the share of non-double counted biofuels will be 7 % and the share of double counted biofuels 6.5 %. Thus, the calculated share of biofuels would be 20 % while their actual share would be 13.5 % in 2020Œ2030.Agricultural sectorThe emissions reported by Finland in the agricultural sector in 2017 totalled about 6.5 Mt CO2 equivalent. The agricultural sector accounts for approximately 12 % of Finland™s total emissions and some 22 % of emissions from the effort sharing sector. Emissions from the agricultural sector remained at the same level between 2005 and 2017. According to the WEM projection, total emissions from agriculture are estimated to slightly increase from 2005 to 2020, but in 2030 they will be below the 2005 level.Building-specific heatingEmissions from heating buildings are divided between the EU ETS sector and the effort sharing sector. In the effort sharing sector, the main source of emissions was building-specific oil heating. Emissions from certain small heating plants are also included in statistics concerning the effort sharing sector. In 2017, the emissions from building-specific heating amounted to 2.6 Mt CO2 equivalent in the effort sharing sector, which is about 9 % of the sector™s total emissions. The majority of these emissions were generated by oil heating. Emissions from building-specific heating have declined in recent years, but there has been some fluctuation because of year-to-year temperature variations. The majority of emissions from building-specific heating are produced in the heating of residential buildings followed by the heating of commercial and public buildings.Waste managementGreenhouse gas emissions from waste management totalled 1.9 Mt CO2 equivalent in 2017, or 6 % of Finnish emissions in the effort sharing sector. The most significant greenhouse gas produced in waste management is the methane emitted from landfills. Waste management emissions in the effort sharing sector also include the greenhouse gases produced in the biological treatment of waste and in 134the disposal and treatment of waste water: CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. These emission sources are of limited importance and their emission volumes are stable. Greenhouse gas emissions from waste management have reduced by approximately a third from 2005 to 2017. The greatest reductions have been achieved in methane emissions from landfills following a decrease in the landfilling of organic waste. The increased use of digestion in the biological treatment of waste has slightly reduced CO2 emissions from biological treatment. However, CO2 is still being emitted from the digestion residue that will be composted and the remaining compost windrows. According to the WEM projection, emissions from the waste management sector will decrease by around 60 % by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.Emissions from waste used as energy are included in the energy sector. They are covered by the EU ETS when waste is being burned together with other fuels as ‚co-incineration™ for example in power plants at industrial facilities. In 2030, total emissions from waste incineration will amount to approximately 0.8 Mt CO2 equivalent, of which some 0.6 Mt CO2 equivalent will be emissions from waste incineration plants included in the effort sharing sector.F-gasesIn 2017, F-gas emissions totalled 1.3 Mt CO2 equivalent, which currently equals approximately 2 % of all greenhouse gas emissions and approximately 4 % of emissions in the effort sharing sector. Emissions peaked in 2014 at approximately 1.46 Mt CO2 equivalent. Fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) are used as refrigerants and extinguishing agents and in plastic foaming, for example.Measures under the original F-gas Regulation, applied between 2007 and 2014, and the new F-gas Regulation and the Mobile Air Conditioning Directive (MAC Directive) are estimated to reduce F-gas emissions to 0.59 Mt CO2 equivalent by 2030 and further to 0.24 Mt CO2 equivalent by 2040.MachineryVarious types of machinery currently account for a total of 8 % of emissions in the effort sharing sector. In 2017, total emissions from machinery were 2.4 Mt CO2 equivalent per year.135Machinery is used in industry and construction, trade, services, the public sector, households, agriculture and forestry. Machinery is usually equipped with combustion engines. Quantitatively, the most common fuel is gasoil but petrol is also used. Among machinery emissions, CO2 is the most significant greenhouse gas, but machinery also emits small quantities of methane and nitrous oxide.IndustryEnergy-related emissions from industry total 10.3 Mt CO2 equivalent, of which 0.9 Mt CO2 equivalent originated from non-ETS activities in 2016. Energy-related emissions are mainly CO2 emissions and originate from all branches of industry. These days, the EU ETS also covers more than 90 % of industrial process emissions. According to the WEM projection, industrial activities continue to grow. As a result, the energy-based and process emissions will also increase slightly, amounting to approximately 11 Mt CO2 equivalent in 2030. Industry is becoming more energy efficient and produces fewer emissions, which will offset the increase in emissions due to growth in industrial activities. Thus, in the WEM projection, energy-related emissions from industry will remain at their current level throughout the 2020s.Energy industryGreenhouse gas emissions from the energy industry were 18.7 Mt CO2 equivalent in 2016. Although the emissions vary considerably from year to year, the trend is a steady decline. District heating emissions vary according to heating demand (cold or warm winters), whereas emissions from condensing power vary depending on the hydro situation in the Nordic-Baltic electricity market. The projections assume future years to be standard years with respect to heating demand and hydro levels (i.e. long-term average plus impact of climate change).Emissions from the energy industry mainly fall within the scope of the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS). In addition to the EU ETS, the energy industry is strongly affected by other policy measures to reduce emissions, to enhance energy efficiency and to increase the share of renewable energy sources.In the WEM projection, the most significant future changes in electricity and heat production are the start-up in 2020 of a 1600 MW nuclear power plant unit currently under construction, one additional nuclear power plant unit in the late 2020s 136and the increase in the use of renewable energy sources, mainly wind power and biomass in CHP plants. All these changes reduce emissions.Small power plants and boilers are not included in the EU ETS. The total emissions of these plants, excluding waste incineration plants, amount to 0.2Œ0.3 Mt CO2 equivalent. In the WEM projection, the emissions from these plants are expected to slightly decrease in the future.Other fuel consumptionEmissions from the greenhouse gas inventory category 1.A.5 Other non-specified emissions of fuels amount to 1.1 Mt CO2 equivalent. The unknown consumption of light and heavy fuel oil, LPG and natural gas account for the largest share of consumption in this subcategory. In practice, the amounts consumed are determined as the difference between total sales and known consumption. The subcategory also includes the fuels consumed by the Finnish Defence Forces, statistical adjustments and smaller emission sources, such as helicopters. According to the greenhouse gas inventory report, uncertainty regarding emissions in this subcategory may be up to ±10Œ50 %, depending on the fuel, which is substantially higher than in other energy subcategories. In the WEM projection, emissions from this subcategory are expected to increase marginally to approximately 1.2 Mt CO2 equivalent by 2030 due to growing economic activity.LULUCF sectorThe annual net sink of the LULUCF sector reported by Finland to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change between 1990 and 2017 varied between -14 and -33.7 Mt CO2 equivalent. In 2017, the LULUCF sector was a sink of -20.4 Mt CO2 equivalent. As a whole, the LULUCF sector is expected to remain as a sink during the obligation period 2021Œ2030.Agricultural land, or arable land and grassland, are a net source of greenhouse gas emissions in Finland, sized at approximately 5.4Œ7.7 Mt CO2 equivalent per year in the reporting period 1990Œ2017. Of these, emissions from arable land account for approximately 90 %. After 2020, emissions from agricultural lands are expected to increase. The development of the surface area of grasslands and the emissions from 137these grasslands is expected to remain stable until 2030. The trend in emissions from grasslands has been declining since 1990.The reported sink of managed forest land varied between -18.4 and -47.4 Mt CO2 equivalent between 1990 and 2016. The size of the sinks varies from year to year, mainly as a result of the volume of commercial fellings. In 2017, managed forest lands were a sink sized at -27.0 Mt CO2 equivalents. According to the estimation of the Natural Resources Institute Finland, forests will continue to act as a sink in Finland also in future.With the exception of 2009, wood products in Finland were mainly a sink over the period 1990Œ2017. In 2017, wood products were a reported net sink sized at -4.0 Mt CO2 equivalent. Wood products are estimated to remain sinks during the period 2021Œ2030.About 72 % of the land area of Finland is forests. The change of forests to other land use purposes is estimated to continue for such reasons as the structural change in agriculture and urbanisation. Emissions from deforestation over the second period of the Kyoto Protocol have been approximately 3.3Œ3.9 Mt CO2 equivalent. Emissions from deforestation during the period 2021Œ2030 are expected to decline slightly. The most significant factor reducing the emissions from deforestation is the reduction of emissions from the clearing of fields when the oldest cleared sites become managed agricultural lands. During the second period of the Kyoto Protocol, afforestation has in Finland been both a small sink (about -0.2 Œ -0.4 Mt CO2 equivalent and a small emission in 2015 (0.3 Mt CO2 equivalent). According to the estimation of the Natural Resources Institute Finland, afforestation will be a sink until 2030, but the sink gained from afforestation is estimated to continue to decline mainly because of emissions caused by the afforestation of wetlands and agricultural lands.The decision to include wetlands in the calculations in accordance with the LULUCF Regulation for the period 2026Œ2030 will be made later. Annual emissions from reported wetlands were approximately 1.3Œ2.4 Mt CO2 equivalent during the period 1990Œ2017. The land area of the areas used in peat production and consequently also emissions from managed wetlands are expected to decline until 2030. However, the current estimations are very uncertain and do not include, for example, emissions or removals caused by the restoration of mires.138Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) is updating long term scenarios and greenhouse gas projections respectively for the LULUCF sector based on new data. The results will be available in early 2020. The estimated size of the forest sink depends on the chosen methodology and assumptions. There are two ways for estimating the net carbon sink of forests, namely through gains and losses or through stock change. The proposed FRL and the GHGI are currently based on the gains and losses approach, while the long-term scenarios are based on the stock change approach. The different methods yield different results, and it is not possible to state with certainty, which one produces more reliable future projections.Figure 10 shows the historical development of greenhouse gas emissions and removals and the estimated development based on current national and EU policies and measures until 2040.Œ40Œ30Œ20Œ10010203040506070809020002010202020302040Mt CO2 eq.1 Energy excl. transport1A3 Domestic transport2 Industrial processes and product use3 Agriculture4 Land use, land-use change and forestry5 WasteFigure 10.

Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in each of these sectors139ii. Indicative projections of development with existing policies for the year 2030 (with an outlook to the year 2040)Finland is one of the world™s leading users of renewable energy sources. The most important renewable energy sources are bioenergy wood and wood-based fuels in particular. In addition to that, also hydropower, wind power, air- and ground-source heat pumps and solar power are used. Renewable energy is one of the most significant means by which Finland™s energy and climate targets can be reached. The current high level of wood utilisation in forest industry forms a backbone in meeting renewable energy targets.The share of renewable energy in the gross final consumption of energy was 41 % in 2017. The EU target for the share of renewable energy in Finland in 2020 is 38 % of gross final energy consumption and this was reached for the first time in 2014. The share of renewable energy in Finland™s gross final consumption is the second highest in the EU countries.Table 17 shows the share of renewable energy in the gross final consumption of energy in 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2017. The shares have been calculated using coefficients and normalisations compliant with the ILUC Directive.Table 17.
