4.2. Dimension of decarbonisation 4.2.1. GHG emissions and removals i. Trends in current GHG emissions and removals in the EU ETS, in sectors falling within the scope of the Effort Sharing Regulation, LULUCF sectors and in different energy sectors The 2019 National Inventory Submission124 of Hungary provides details of historical changes in GHG emissions; this chapter provides a brief summary. In 2017 the (gross) GHG emissions of Hungary, not including LULUCF, equalled 63.8 million tonnes CO2 equivalent over the 93.7 million tonnes CO2 equivalent in 1990 (decrease of 31.9 %). Per capita gross emission is around 6.5 tonnes, which is below the EU average.                                                        124 https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/transparency-and-reporting/reporting-and-review-under-the-convention/greenhouse-gas-inventories-annex-i-parties/national-inventory-submissions-2019   Figure 8  Greenhouse gas emissions per sector, 1990-2017 (kt CO2eq)  Source: National Inventory Submission, 2019 HU EN Energia Energy IPPU IPPU  Agriculture Hulladék Waste  This significant decrease is attributable partly to the regime change that resulted in the sharp decline in national economic output. Production decreased in almost all economic sectors, including the GHG intensive energy sector, industry and agriculture. Thereafter, between 2005 and 2013, emissions declined by 25 % after roughly 14 years of stagnation. The global financial and economic crisis severely affected the performance of the Hungarian economy and thereby the level of GHG emissions, which fell by 8 % between 2008 and 2009. Following a moderate increase in 2010, emissions declined for 4 years. Meanwhile the downturn in economic performance reversed in the first quarter of 2010 and surpassed pre-crisis levels in 2015. Emissions again increased from 2013 to 2017 by 12 %, with all economic sectors contributing to the rise. CO2 is the most relevant greenhouse gas of anthropogenic origin, accounting for 77 % of total emissions. Carbon dioxide is mainly produced in the energy sector through the burning of fossil fuels. CO2 emissions decreased by 44 % overall since the mid-1980s. Energy sector Most of total emissions (72 %) are produced in the energy sector. Carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels accounts for the largest share (96 %) of GHG emissions in the energy sector. Natural gas is the  most important fossil fuel in Hungary, accounting for 44 % of fuel consumption emissions. In the middle of the past decade natural gas held an even larger share of 55 %. Liquid fuels and coal have a share of 30 % and 10 %, respectively. Within the energy sector, the energy industry accounts for the largest share with 30 %, closely followed by transport and categories of other sectors (e.g. trade, households) with 28 % each. Bleed emissions relating to the production, processing, conversion, distribution of oil and natural gas only contribute 2 % to sectoral emissions. Transport emissions increased by 31 % since 2013. In the past three years gross electricity generation increased by 3 %. The increase in natural gas based electricity generation was particularly high at 20 %, but still equalled only half of the figure measured in 2007 and 2008. As a basic feature of the Hungarian energy industry, half of electricity is generated from nuclear sources and only 40 % from fossil fuels. Hungarian electricity imports remain high at 30 %.

Household fuel consumption increased in 2017 by 2 %. In the same period biomass consumption declined by 6 % and natural gas consumption rose at the same rate. Coal consumption also increased. Notwithstanding that retail natural gas consumption increased by 27 % since 2014, it remains 16 % below the average for the past decade. Manufacturing industry emissions also increased in recent years. Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) Emissions under the ESD, covering sectors, not falling within the scope of the ETS, totalled 43.14 million tonnes in 2017. Most emissions under the ESD are attributable to transport, buildings, agriculture and waste management sectors, but emissions from industrial energy consumption and F-gases are also contributors.   Figure 10  Emissions under the ESD (2013-2017, kt CO2eq)125  Source: EUTL Transport emissions increased by 9.3 % since 2005. At the same time, emissions from fuel consumption in the service industry, agriculture and by households decreased by 29 % over the year 2005. Following the typically declining trend of recent years, however, household emissions increased in 2015, primarily as a result of the 13 % rise in gas consumption.                                                       125 AEA: Annual emission allocation  In 2017 agriculture accounted for 11 % of total emissions. Agricultural activities result in CH4 and N2O emissions; most of Hungary's N2O emissions (87 %) are produced in this sector. The GHG emissions of agriculture have been steadily increasing since 2011, mainly as a result of increases in fertiliser use, the bovine population and dairy production per cow. The waste sector accounts for 5 % of total emissions. The disposal of solid waste in landfills accounts for most of emissions (84 %), followed by waste water treatment (11 %), composting (4 %) and waste incineration not for energy purposes (1 %). The rise in emissions came to a halt in the past decade, followed by a 19 % decline between 2005 and 2017. F-gas emissions accounted for 3 % of total emissions in 2017. F-gas emissions were highest in 2015, followed by a significant decline, and an increase again in 2017. EU ETS The ETS GHG emissions (not including air transport) of Hungary amounted to 20.1 million tonnes CO2 equivalent in 2017, decreasing by 26 % over the year 2005. Hungary's EU ETS GHG emissions continuously declined between 2009 and 2014, with the exception of a minor shift in 2010. The trend again reversed after 2014, with total emissions increasing by around 10 % up to 2017.  Figure 11  Emissions under the EU ETS, 2008-2018 (kt CO2eq) Source: EEA Land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) The LULUCF sector is regarded overall as a sink, owing to the substantial CO2 capture of forests resulting from significant volumes of forestation and sustainable forest management in recent decades. A processes; results significantly fluctuate. The average sink rate equalled 3.5 million CO2 equivalent,  fluctuating between 0.4 million tonnes (2000) and 5.8 million tonnes CO2eq. In 2017, forests captured 4.9 million tonnes CO2. ii. Projections of sectoral developments with existing national and Union policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) Annex 4 contains the detailed results of GHG projections. In relation to the LULUCF categories, one scenario with existing measures (WEM) and one with additional measures (WAM) was drawn up. In relation to the agriculture and waste sectors, the WAM scenario does not include actual additional measures; the difference between the WEM and WAM is attributable to emissions reduction required in the sectors.126 Only a WEM scenario was prepared in relation to the other categories. The forecasting baseline is not uniform. In relation to the energy sector the base year is 2016, while the year is 2017 in relation to all other categories. Summary Under the WEM scenario, by 2030 the total gross GHG emissions of Hungary  without LULUCF  is expected to decrease to 62.8 thousand CO2eq, indicating a 1.5 % decrease over the year 2017, and a 33 % decrease over the year 1990, falling short of the minimum 40 % target. Total net emissions with LULUCF will fall to 62.3 thousand kt CO2eq.   Figure 12 - GHG emissions with existing policies and measures, 2016-2040 (kt CO2eq) Source of actual data: National Inventory Submission, 2019                                                       126 The forecasting baseline is not uniform. In relation to the categories of energy and disposal of solid waste in landfills, the base year is 2016, while the year is 2015 in relation to all other categories. The final version of the NECP - to be drawn up in 2019 - will apply a uniform base year.  HU EN Teljes bruttó kibocsátás Total gross emissions Teljes nettó kibocsátás Total net emissions  Under the WEM scenario, CO2 will remain the largest GHG. Its emission will increase by 1 % until 2030 over the year 2017. CH4 and N2O emissions will decrease by 3.5 % and increase by 3.2 %, respectively, while F-gas emissions will decrease by 74.65 %. We are not accounting for the appearance of NF3 in the Hungarian inventory. EU ETS emissions decrease by 9.3 % over the year 2017, while ESD/ESR emissions increase by 2.1 % under the WEM scenario.  Figure 13 - ETS and ESR emissions with existing policies and measures, 2015-2040 (kt CO2eq) Source of actual data: National Inventory Submission, 2019 The LULUCF sector will remain a net sink, but CO2 capture will decrease by 90 % by 2030. Energy Under the WEM scenario GHG emissions will significantly change by 2040. The initial substantial increase  by 7.7 % by in 2025 over the year 2017  will be followed by a decline, thus by 2030 emissions levels will fall back to the level of 2017, and will essentially stay at this level in 2040 as well. In 2017, mainly the energy industry (30.2 %), transport (28.5 %), households (18.6 %) and industry (10.7 %) contributed to energy emissions. significantly change. By 2030 transport will be the largest contributor among the above sectors, as it will maintain its level (28.7 %), whereas the energy industry will only account for 20.6 % of energy emissions. The highest increase in GHG emissions will be measured in industry by 2030 and 2040, thus at the end of  the analysed period this sector will produce 20.2 % of energy emissions. While emissions will increase by 88 % up to 2030 compared to the value for 2017, such increase will reach 119 % by 2040. The above is attributable to the forecast of rising demand, to be satisfied by the sector mainly with oil and coal. Non-energy emissions In 2030, emissions from industrial processes and product usage are expected to exceed the level in 2017 by 10.3 %. The increase is attributable to two different trends. In 2030, CO2 emissions from industrial processes are expected to exceed the level in 2017 by 11.7 %, while fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions will significantly decrease by 2030 as a result of prohibitions of relevant EU regulations and the hydro-fluorocarbon quota scheme. Emissions are expected to increase in agriculture. The sector is expected to emit 10 % more GHGs in 2030, mainly attributable to a growing animal population. Waste emissions will decline by 23 % by 2030. The decrease is mainly driven by the declining quantity of waste disposed in landfills. Due to the expected rise in demand, emissions from international air transport will be 15 % higher in 2030 than in 2017. 4.2.2. Renewable energy i. Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in each of these sectors In 2017 the share of renewables within gross final energy consumption127 already equalled 13.3 % in Hungary. Between 1994 and 2017 the share of renewable energy within gross final energy consumption increased from 2.2 % to 7.5 % in electricity consumption, from 0.9 % to 6.8 % in transport, and from 6.5 % to 19.6 % in heating and cooling, mainly resulting from the use of biomass. Hungary's possibilities for using renewable energy are mainly exploited in the heating sector; in 2016, 83 % of renewable energy was used for heating and cooling, 9 % for electricity generation and 8 % for transport. The actual use of biomass  providing the bulk of renewable energy  significantly depends on the price and consumption of other energy sources. The consumption of natural gas  as an alternative to household biomass  is steadily increasing in parallel with Hungarian GDP growth. Furthermore, the offer price of biomass for energy is to a major extent determined by demand for pulpwood and paper wood, in addition to import opportunities.                                                       127 Indicator of the share of renewable energy sources within gross final energy consumption, official indicator for monitoring the 2020 target defined in Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC.  In recent years the most dynamic increases were observed in solar power generation, renewable based district heating, heat pump systems and in the use of biofuels with mandatory blending ratios.

Indicative forecasting of development based on existing policies until 2030 (outlook up to 2040) Under the WEM scenario, the share of renewables will moderately increase in Hungary from around 14.1 % in 2016 to 14.7 % in 2030, followed by a stagnating trend until the mid-2030s. The increase, however, will reverse and equal a 13.3 % share in 2040. In 2016 the heating and cooling sector accounted for 82 % of total renewable energy consumption, followed by electricity consumption with 10 % and the transport sector with 7 %. By 2030 the share of renewable energy consumption within total renewable energy consumption in the electricity sector will significantly increase mainly as a result of the 2.5 GW PV capacity expected to be implemented by 2030. Renewable energy production in the electricity sector will increase to over 530 ktoe, accounting for 17 % of total renewable energy consumption. The share of renewables within the transport sector will also increase significantly to 13 % by 2030. By 2030 the use of renewables will increase by an overall rate of 23 % over the year 2016, which is more than the 18 % rise in gross final customer demand forecast up to 2030 under existing measures.

In 2016 biomass accounted for more than 80 % of total renewable energy consumption, which is predominantly based on the fuel wood consumption of the poorest population segment. Currently the use of geothermal energy accounts for around 7 % of renewables, which has three main sources. A significant amount of energy is used for heating, most of which is utilised in greenhouses and various bath establishments. A number of geothermal district heat generating facilities have also been built in recent years. In 2016 the use of biofuels contributed 7 % to the use of renewable energy. These ratios are expected to moderately change by 2030, resulting in more diversified use of renewable energy. The share of biomass use will remain dominant but decrease to 75 %. The share of solar energy within renewables will significantly rise, from the initial 1 % to around 8 % by 2030. A moderate increase in the use of geothermal energy is also expected.   Figure 15  Use of renewable sources of energy by fuel, ktoe Source of actual data: Eurostat HU EN  Biomassza és biogáz Biomass and biogas Nap Solar Egyéb Other Bioüzemanyagok Biofuels Geotermikus Geothermal  Renewable energy consumption in the electricity sector Under the WEM scenario  owing to already existing renewable aids  electricity generation from renewable sources will significantly increase in the electricity sector by 2040. Based on our forecast, the largest increase is expected in PV production; the installed capacity will increase to 3.5 GW in 2030 and to 4.3 GW in 2040. Capacities used for biomass based electricity generation, still operating today, will gradually be phased out until 2035, but the total capacity will again rise to around 500 MW by 2040. We cannot observe an increase in relation to hydroelectric power plants and wind power stations, but we expect an installed capacity of 59 MW for geothermal power stations by 2040.

These resources are followed by wind power stations (11.9 %), hydroelectric power plants (3.9 %) and geothermal power plants (3.5 %). Under the WEM scenario the share of renewables in this sector is steadily increasing from around 8 % in 2016 to 13.5 % in 2030 and to over 17 % in 2040.

By 2030 advanced (second generation) biofuels will account for most of renewable energy consumption (53 %), while the use of first generation biofuels will equal 14 % within renewable energy consumption in the transport sector. The share of electricity is expected to be 21 % in 2030. Hydrogen will also play a major role by the end of the 2020s.

Geothermal energy is the second most important source, with a 4 % share in renewable energy consumption in 2016. This value will not change by 2030, either. Based on our forecast, the spread of solar thermal collectors is not expected without additional measures. In summary of the trends, the use of renewable energy for cooling and heating will increase significantly by more than 11 % by 2030, although the share of renewables will nevertheless decrease to 19.4 % from the current 20.7 % value, followed by a continuing decline in the share of the use of renewable energy in this sector.
