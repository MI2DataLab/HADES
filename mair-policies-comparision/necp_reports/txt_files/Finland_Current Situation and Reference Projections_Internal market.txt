Key characteristics of the existing transmission infrastructure for electricity and gasElectricityThe Finnish electricity system is part of the Nordic synchronous power system along with the Swedish, Norwegian and Eastern Denmark systems. Finland is also connected to the Russian and Estonian power systems by direct current connections. The Nordic synchronous system is connected to the Central European power system and the Baltic power systems through direct current connections.The main grid is the primary electricity transmission network and includes the 400, 220 and 110 kV lines that are most important for power transmission, and substations. Table 22 shows the size of the main grid operated by Fingrid. Local transmission to small users takes place in distribution grids.The main grid serves electricity producers and consumers by enabling a functional electricity market throughout the country as well as cross-border trade. The majority of electricity consumed in Finland is transmitted via the main grid. Fingrid is responsible for main grid operation, planning and supervision.151Table 22.

Two transmission pipelines connect the gas pipeline system to the Russian system. The maximum import capacity is 24.1 million cubic metres per day (in 20 degrees Celsius). Finland™s gas pipeline system is located in the southeast and southern Finland and its length is 1,300 kilometres. The transmission system operator is the state-owned company Gasum Oy.ii. Projections of network expansion requirements at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)ElectricityFingrid has a EUR 1.2 billion investment programme for the years 2015Œ2025. In the latter half of the present decade and early 2020s, grid investments will focus mainly on renewing ageing transmission lines and substations. The most significant new cross-border interconnector will be the third AC interconnector between Finland and Sweden. This project is scheduled for completion in 2025.Existing subsea DC cables to Sweden and Estonia will be renewed in this timeframe (2040). When these interconnectors are replaced also their capacity will be reviewed. Also the DC interconnectors to Russia will be renewed but the capacity will remain the same.GasIn October 2016, Finnish Baltic Connector Oy and Estonian Elering AS made a decision to invest in the construction of the Balticconnector gas pipeline 152connection between Finland and Estonia. The Balticconnector gas pipeline will be enter commercial service on 1 January 2020. The capacity of the Balticconnector pipeline will be 7.2 million cubic metres per day.In 2020, a new LNG terminal currently under construction in the town of Hamina will be connected to the gas transmission network. The storage capacity of the Hamina LNG terminal will initially be 30,000 cubic metres. The entry capacity into the transmission system as well as into the local distribution system will be 0.5 million cubic metres per day.4.5.3 Electricity and gas markets, energy pricesi. Current situation of electricity and gas markets, including energy pricesElectricityFinland forms an integrated wholesale electricity market with Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. The Nordic-Baltic market has been price linked to the North Western European electricity market since 2013. There is currently one power exchange (Nord Pool AS) active in the Nordic market and another (EPEX SPOT) entering the market. In 2018, 72 % of the electricity supply in Finland was traded through the Nord Pool day-ahead market. Figure 16 and Figure 17 show the historical time series of monthly and hourly average day-ahead spot prices.Finland is heavily dependent on integrated European electricity markets as there is a significant deficit in generation capacity compared to peak load. Finland imports over 20 % of its annual electricity supply and around 30 % of power consumption during winter peaks.153010203040506070809010008˜-˜Jan09˜-˜Jan10˜-˜Jan11˜-˜Jan12˜-˜Jan13˜-˜Jan14˜-˜Jan15˜-˜Jan16˜-˜Jan17˜-˜Jan18˜-˜Jan19˜-˜Jan19˜-˜OctEUR/MWhFigure 16.

Hourly prices in Finland™s price area in 2018.GasUntil 31 December 2019, Finland applies a derogation for isolated markets in accordance with Article 49(1) of Directive 2009/37/EC. As regards natural gas, there has been no third party access to a pipeline network, so buyers of natural gas have 154been unable to hold a tendering process for their natural gas supply. Wholesale and retail sellers have bought their natural gas from Gasum Oy, the owner of the transmission system. Gas produced from renewable energy sources has had limited access to the pipeline network, however. In addition, buyers of natural gas can trade between themselves in the secondary market the natural gas they have bought from Gasum.Because of the natural gas supply monopoly, both the wholesale and the retail market prices have been regulated.Figure 18 and Figure 19 show the time series starting from 2001 of both the energy price and total price of natural gas for different type (T1 Œ T8) industrial size natural gas consumers. All prices exclude taxes, calculated according to gross calorific value and in EUR per MWh. The total price of natural gas includes both the price for transmission and energy.Three examples of different type of natural gas consumers, T1, T4 and T8, are given here. The detailed information about annual consumption, peak load time and contracted capacity are as follows.Table 23.

Projections of development with existing policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)ElectricityAccording to SMK Market Predictor™s study29, the Nordic countries will increasingly integrate into the Central European electricity market, and thus the importance of the Central European region as a price-driver for the Nordic electricity market is emphasised. Although the share of wind and solar power in the European electricity balance will significantly rise over the coming decades, fuel prices and emission allowance prices will remain important price-drivers for the Central European electricity market for a long time. Another important price-driver for Central Europe is the abandonment of nuclear and coal-fired power capacity because of ageing or political decisions.Despite the growth in wind and nuclear power, the rising central European price level keeps also the Nordic price level rising. The regional price of Finland follows the Nordic system price until the end of the 2020s, when the introduction of Hanhikivi 1 nuclear power plant and the new interconnection between Northern Sweden and Finland will lower Finland™s regional price to the price level in northern Sweden. The regional price of Finland follows the regional price of northern Sweden until the exit of Loviisa 1 and 2 nuclear power plant units increases the regional price of Finland closer to the Nordic system price after the mid-2030s (Figure 20).157.01020304050607020202025203020352040EUR/MWhSystem pricePrice Area FinlandFigure 20.

The price of gas energy will thus be determined on the basis of the reference price of the liquid gas hubs in Central Europe
