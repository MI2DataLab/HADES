3.5. Dimension 5: Research, innovation and competitiveness   i. Policies and measures related to research targets (including the 2050 targets for certain types of clean technology)  plan was laid down under the Climate and Energy Strategy (#mission2030) with the following priorities, financed through corresponding priorities set in the scope of the existing research budget. The budgetary resources provided for research, innovation and competitiveness could be Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 188 of 268  used for the already ongoing programmes or alternatively in a corresponding amount for new priorities.    Energy research initiative 1  Building blocks for energy systems of the future (Flagship 9 of the Austrian Climate and Energy Strategy  #mission2030)  Future energy systems will comprise connected sub-systems which will need to integrate several parties and types of technology. Under these measures, technology and solutions for particular challenges in the energy system will be developed on a targeted basis as part of mission-oriented research and development.  In addition to integrating energy sources and infrastructure, the interplay between different fields and sectors (mobility, business and industry, agriculture, etc.) in this mission-oriented approach is as important as the interaction between different innovation systems (e.g. regional players and global start-ups). Socio-economic and socio-technical issues will need to be solved in conjunction with technical issues. New business models, processes for gaining acceptance and user behaviour need to be better understood and taken into account. Involving future users in co-creation processes at an early stage will be crucial to long-term success.   of the future energy system will be developed:  Plus energy areas which, by optimising civil infrastructure, are able to cover all energy needs via renewable energy - the highest possible efficiency in all areas of end energy consumption and the development of suitable business models. They are an important prerequisite for CO2-neutral towns/cities and urban areas. In this way, energy generated locally will mainly be used locally by making end consumption more flexible whilst exploiting storage facilities and synergy effects from infrastructure.  Smart systems and grids which will enable the local and regional energy supply to become up to 100% renewable in the foreseeable future and help businesses and private individuals become part of regional value chains and inter-regional markets. Such systems and grids are key to making energy systems more flexible in the interests of integrating sectors, energy sources and infrastructure, and providing and using a noticeably high percentage of renewable energy. They enable municipalities and regions to set ambitious energy targets, create regional value chains and trade energy between regions.  Breakthrough technologies for industry which enable raw material and energy consumption to plummet, emissions to fall significantly and raw material and energy independence to increase whilst maintaining constant output. It is key to decarbonising industrial processes and products, in particular in energy-intensive industries. New products and processes will focus on energy and Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 189 of 268  resources being used in a highly efficient and, as far as possible, hierarchical manner and will enable the energy needs of industrial installations and the supply of energy from fluctuating renewable sources to be matched. Issues related to CO2-neutral steel production play just as important a role as processes and products using bio-based raw materials.  Energy-efficient mobility systems of the future: mandatory targets and avoid purchasing emissions allowances, intensive research into mobility is needed. At the same time, the competitiveness of the Austrian car and aeronautics industries will need to be safeguarded by promoting R&D as technology continues its revolution towards zero- and low-emission vehicles, lightweight construction and automated transport. Moreover, organisational and social innovation will also need to be applied. It is also important to support EU initiatives, such as battery cell production in Europe, through complementary national funding programmes so that e-mobility achieves its breakthrough. The domestic industry must also be integrated into international value chains across the entire battery/vehicle/energy supply system, from production to recycling.     Energy research initiative 2   (Flagship 10 of the Austrian Climate and Energy Strategy  #mission2030)  An additional package of measures on transforming the energy system will be implemented #mission2030. This programme was set up by the Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT) and the Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism (BMNT).  In order to increase the international visibility of Austrian solutions on global markets, to introduce incentives for investing in the domestic economy, to stimulate implementation on domestic European markets and to prepare as best as possible for new challenges posed by Horizon Europe and the SET Plan, large-scale testing of technology and solutions is essential in real operating conditions, with the involvement of users and building on previous R&D findings. t up by the Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism with the agreement of the Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology in preparation for the experimental stage in order to test the systematic application of new integration and market models for system integration of renewable energy technology, storage transformation of energy and mobility systems as research results often fail when implemented in real-world environments or when scaled up.  In large test areas, innovative energy technology from Austria will be used to develop and demonstrate model solutions for smart, safe and affordable energy and transport systems for the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 190 of 268  future. Projects will be developed with a wide range of innovators from business, science, regional actors and stakeholders. Model energy regions are intended to show that a 100% renewable energy supply using Austrian innovation is feasible. Innovative energy technology will be tested in model regions and subsequently rolled out nationwide through market programmes under the Climate and Energy Fund.  Three model regions (in place between 2018 and 2025) are already up and running. The Austrian anced by the Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology in the scope of the future budgetary resources, will invest up to EUR 120 million by 2021 in three model regions: WIVA P&G (hydrogen/methane), NEFI (100% renewable energy supply for domestic industry) and GreenEnergyLab (smart grids/demand side management/demand response).  These model regions will bring new technology and applications to market maturity through joint research, technology and innovation by stakeholders in the Austrian research field. Significant financing will also be provided by the private sector. More than 200 project partners from business, science and research (companies representing 60%) are working on how our energy will be in the future and are successfully positioning Austria at the forefront of international efforts. initiative:   Applying Austrian energy innovations which will enable energy to be 100% renewable;  Sector coupling and system integration;  Making Austria more of a leading market in innovative energy technology;  Achieving the greatest possible use and acceptance of the public.    Plan for implementing the energy research initiative in the Austrian Climate and Energy Strategy (energy research field)  A plan for implementing the energy research initiative was drawn up in 2019 for the 2020-2030 period together with experts from 63 Austrian companies and research facilities. (https://nachhaltigwirtschaften.at/de/e2050/highlights/mission-innovation-austria-fokusgruppen.php)  This includes   the formulation of three missions for developing essential components of the future energy systems for the priorities set out in the Climate and Energy Strategy; Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 191 of 268   the identification of 14 innovation targets for completing these missions;  the description of 39 specific development plans which will be driven forward in the next 5 years (prospectively in the next 10 years) by the companies involved using private and public funds, in order to achieve the formulated targets. The implementation plan was drawn up following and with reference to the development of the implementation plans in the European SET Plan. The missions set out in 1 and 2 are in particular virtually identical to missions in SET Plan Actions 3.2 and 4. The similar structure allows mapping  see SET Plan Implementation Plan Action 4) with the development targets formulated at both national and EU level. This firstly allows simple assignment of Austrian contributions to the SET Plan and secondly allows Austrian actors from particular fields to be integrated in a targeted manner with the respective stakeholder groups at European level27. Mission 1: Development of Plus Energy neighbourhoods which, by optimising civil infrastructure, the highest possible efficiency in all areas of end energy consumption and the development of suitable business models, are able to cover all energy needs via renewable energy and offer their residents the highest possible quality of life. Some of the renewable energy is generated in the neighbourhood itself. By making end consumption more flexible in connection with the use of storage facilities and synergy effects of infrastructures, this is predominantly used locally and Plus Energy neighbourhoods are at the same time integrated in an optimal manner at overall system level. The energy transition at district level is supported through transparent and forward-looking integrated planning, construction and operation processes. The exploitation of digitalisation options and the use of Plus Energy buildings plays an essential role in the development and implementation. Plus Energy neighbourhoods are a prerequisite for CO2-neutral towns/cities. The solutions developed will be realised and tested in three zero carbon model towns/cities by 2025. Mission 2: Development of integrated regional energy systems and grids which will enable the local and regional energy supply to become up to 100% renewable in the foreseeable future and help businesses and private individuals become part of regional value chains and inter-regional markets. Such systems and grids contribute towards making energy systems more flexible and make it possible to integrate sectors, energy sources and infrastructure, and to provide and use a noticeably high percentage of renewable energy. Effects of intermittent generation from solar and wind energy are only slightly passed on at overall system level through activation of flexibility                                                                     27 -Net Smart Energy Systems was used in adapted form for the development of the Austrian implementation plan, so that the assignment and integration of stakeholder groups could be correspondingly supported electronically at least in the scope of SET Plan Action 4. This instrument could be used particularly effectively if other countries were to follow the Austrian example. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 192 of 268  potentials. The systems promote system behaviour with regard to efficiency and costs and with regard to resilience and security under the amended framework conditions of high dynamics in the capture, distribution and use of energy and the increasing decentralisation and digitalisation of energy systems. They enable municipalities and regions to implement ambitious energy targets and create regional value chains. At the same time, they make a constructive contribution towards cross-regional balancing mechanisms and value chains. Mission 3: Breakthrough technologies for industry which enable raw material and energy demand to plummet whilst maintaining constant output, emissions to fall significantly and value to increase by means of the value chains in Austria overall. It is key to decarbonising industrial processes and products - particularly in energy-intensive industries - and strengthens Austria as a base for high-technology in the industrial sector. Industrial and commercial processes make an active contribution in an energy system with a high proportion of renewable and partly intermittent energies. In this case, in consideration of broad technology neutrality, use is made of a wide range of solutions, which include change of energy sources (such as with largely CO2-neutral steel production) or value chains based on sustainable (i.e. bio-based, recyclable, low-emission, etc.) raw materials.

Depo-to-       Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 196 of 268  Specific implementation measures:  With a view to mobilising the innovation potential of Austrian companies identified in the implementation plan, implementation measures focus on the following key factors:   Mission-oriented priorities  together with industry, focusing on areas in which Austria is strong and developing these areas in a goal-oriented way (successful examples: solar thermal power, passive house, smart grids, e-mobility, energy-efficient mobility systems);  Removing investment barriers so that innovative implementation projects can be implemented on a living lab scale from an early stage and so that Austrian solutions are frontrunners leading the way to market success;  Impact Network Approach  actively building bridges between interested parties/technology users and innovators/technology providers/entrepreneurs. The energy transition is a joint learning process that must be shaped. It requires new cooperation and funding formats that take into consideration elements such as co-creation, innovation procurement and innovation partnerships;  Multilateral cooperation  working with research partnerships to address the European domestic market, optimising internal development costs by sharing expertise and creating access to prosperous markets in other regions of the world.

Preparations are under way for the further development towards Co-funded European Partnerships as part of the post-2020 Horizon Europe initiative.      This forms an essential element for the implementation of Flagship Project 10 of the Climate and Energy Strategy. Over 200 organisations are involved in three subject-based model regions:  Vorzeigeregion Austria Power & Gas [Austria model region hydrogen initiative        Continuation and strengthening of the programme that aims to increase the competitiveness of -volume pilot projects.      This research, technology and innovation programme, which was launched in 2012 and focuses on surface transport, addresses both transport/environmental/technological and economic objectives, with a view to achieving multiple pay-offs. By stimulating R&D and implementing new technologies in the areas of vehicle technology, transport infrastructure and personal/goods mobility, the programme contributes to overcoming mobility-related, ecological and societal Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 199 of 268  challenges and develops the skills and international sectors. Research into alternative drives and fuels, materials, intelligent traffic systems, ICT and digital technologies form the central areas of research. Furthermore, the programme also addresses organisational and social innovations in the area of personal and goods mobility and the transformation of the mobility system towards sustainability. Cooperative research projects, relevant research infrastructures and innovation labs all receive funding to enable them to test innovative solutions in systemic and real-life traffic environments.  In 2016, a horizontal research priority focusing on automation was introduced to approach research into autonomous driving both on the roads and on the railways. The intention is to this important field of technology.  The research, technology and innovation programme has received around EUR 25 million per year for the last few years and will run until the end of 2020.  At present, work is being carried out as part of a research, technology and innovation strategy on mobility to further develop the programme, which will continue from 2021 with the same level of funding. This is on the assumption that the research budget framework for this programme remains at the current level.    Mobility Labs programme activity  The Mobility Lab initiative has enabled the development of six new innovation ecosystems in Austria (five urban mobility labs and one overarching transformation lab), which are making significant contributions to bridging the gaps between research and social practice. The labs offer processes and structures that run alongside the research to involve the public, establish networks with the necessary stakeholders and research (test) infrastructures, and form the required framework conditions for the diffusion of innovations and technology.  In future, the labs will form key elements for entrenching and supporting innovation measures for decarbonisation and relevant mobility research both nationally (Living Lab approach in LT10, #mission2030, following up with the Mobility of the Future programme), and internationally hips under Horizon Europe). Plans are in place to expand the lab activity portfolio to include decarbonisation measures and to transfer the lab structures to further cities/regions.  Battery initiative Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 200 of 268   Intensive research and support of future energy and mobility systems, such as batteries and hydrogen, are essential in order to establish Austria as an innovation leader on global technology markets. The development and production of batteries will secure the competitiveness of the Austrian vehicle industry. Furthermore, it is a critical factor in establishing a sustainable vehicle transition towards electromobility and therefore a priority for technological funding from the Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology and Austrian Federal Government. The national battery initiative is a complementary Austrian initiative implementing the European battery initiative. The goal of both initiatives is to prepare national vehicle industries for a technological upheaval in drive technologies in good time. In parallel to the battery initiative, European Interest), which aims to establish comprehensive European battery cell production.  Austrian hydrogen strategy  The objectives of the Austrian Climate and Energy Strategy (#mission2030) require huge expansion of renewable energies. In future, renewable hydrogen will play a critical role in achieving the conversion of the energy system. This strategy is being drawn up by the Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism, assisted by the Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology, in collaboration with business, industry and research and is set to be completed by the end of this year. Following a stakeholder consultation, the strategy is scheduled to be into a hydrogen-based society free of fossil-fuel energy. In parallel to the Austrian hydrogen strategy, an this key future issue of hydrogen with clarity on a global scale. Suitable resources will also be required for market launch and research.     TAKE OFF  The aviation research, technology and innovation programme supports the implementation of the research, technology and innovation strategy of the Austrian aviation sector. The aim is to strengthen the competitiveness and growth of this highly dynamic and innovative sector. This involves supporting research that contributes to reducing emissions in aviation and delivers important solutions for a user-friendly, sustainable and efficient aviation system. Over the last few years, around EUR 10 million has been invested annuallincluding drive systems, new materials, air traffic management and drones.  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 201 of 268  As is the case for all sectors, the aviation industry is also required to contribute to achieving the climate protection goals (see CORSIA). On that basis, plans are in place to include an additional research priority looking at CO2--programme from 2020.

Suggested subjects: innovative storage technologies, Plus-Energy demonstration buildings, innovative Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 202 of 268  materials for high-temperature applications in industry.  Scale Up - Austrian energy innovations from small series to market launch One of the goals of the Climate and Energy Strategy is to test innovative energy technology in model regions and subsequently roll this out nationwide through market programmes under the Climate and Energy Fund. Scale Up promotes Austrian innovations that show significant climate protection potential and which have, to date, only been produced on a small scale. The aim is to help selected technologies transition from small-series production and support Austrian companies in launching their innovations on the market.  --promoting public procurement for the climate - new technologies for our climate -sector by means of an investment subsidy under the Climate and Energy fund for the acquisition (public procurement) of innovative, climate-friendly mobility and energy technologies and solutions.  Research, technology and innovation for infrastructure transformation/climate change adaptation Supporting infrastructure operators (transport, energy, etc.) in transforming infrastructure in relation to climate change.   In future, more flexible energy systems will have to integrate different energy sources (solar, wind, biogenic sources) and various means of transport and storage (electricity, heating, gas) and make available different energy products for the corresponding domains in which they are applied (mobility, heating, industrial applications, etc.). To do so, Austria requires new energy storage technology with a capacity of some 5 TWh, in particular for electricity and heating in the housing, industry and mobility sectors.  The issue of storage systems (including hydrogen technology) is currently being treated as a top priority and cross-cutting issue, interwoven with mission-oriented priorities and broad implementation initiatives.  Austria already plays a key role in the field of storage, a role which needs to be developed and strengthened through research and development, through the creation of research infrastructure and pilot installations, and by providing market entry support to companies. Model projects which for individual buildings or seasonal large-scale storage facilities connected to district heating   Alongside the Climate and Energy Fund, the Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology has developed recommendations with respect to innovation and for the stages Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 203 of 268  ority. As part of this initiative, research, technology and innovation priorities are planned for stationary and mobile applications.    Priorities for Austrian participation in developing European value chains   IPCEI on batteries:  Against the backdrop of European efforts to develop European value-added chains and production capacity in strategically important areas, Austria is looking to take part in the IPCEI on batteries, headed up by Germany. Negotiations with Austrian companies have been resumed on the basis of a commitment from the Minister of Finance and the Federal Ministry for Transport,  50 million.  The development of a European value-added chain for batteries is not only strategically important for the European automobile industry, but is also an important component for the electrification of mobility and the associated CO2 reduction in road traffic. Alongside fuel cells, batteries are a core technology in the decarbonisation of road traffic.     IPCEI on hydrogen  Hydrogen, which is a core resource required for the decarbonisation of traffic and industry in Europe, is another strategically important European value chain. To highlight this, the Hydrogen Europe trade  October 2019 in Brussels together with EC representatives to mark the launch of the IPCEI initiative on hydrogen.  A total of eight projects requiring overall private and state investment of up to EUR 60 billion were contribution from 2021 to 2030 will total EUR 300 million. In future, the IPCEI may also include   The central themes of the projects presented to date revolve around the production and provision of hydrogen from renewable energies, the development of a European hydrogen infrastructure with a network of fuel stations, and the decarbonisation of delivery and heavy goods transport via hydrogen-powered trucks and transporters.  On 20 September 2019, the Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism held an informal discussion on the IPCEI on hydrogen to provide domestic industrial companies with information Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 204 of 268  on current developments in this field and explore national potentials.     ii. Where applicable, cooperation with other Member States and how the SET Plan objectives are being translated into national policy  Climate and Energy Strategy, European and international cooperation are key factors in, on the one hand, bringing Austrian stakeholders together and, on the other hand, joining forces and developing a range of comprehensive solutions. This is happening through international initiatives such as the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan), collaboration programmes organised by the International Energy Agency, and participation in Mission Innovation.     European cooperation through the SET Plan  The Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) is considered an essential mechanism within European energy technology policy aimed at developing low-carbon technology and improving its competitiveness. Financing is provided by the EU, Member States and the private sector -public-opportunities are being opened up for businesses.  Austria takes the view that an essential driver for implementing the SET Plan are the energy research calls for tender under the European Framework Programme for Research and Innovation -in energy-related areas of Horizon 2020 and the SET Plan by the Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology and the Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism.  Austria is actively involved in selected SET Plan key actions currently focused on:  new technologies and services for consumers  resilience and security of the energy system  new materials and technologies for buildings  energy efficiency for industry    Transnational cooperation  In view of the fact that more than 80% of research funding in Europe is provided publicly by Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 205 of 268  national authorities, mainly through national and regional research programmes, more coordination and agreement between national and regional research programmes is intended in -NET was developed under the 6th and 7th EU Framework Programmes and further enhanced under Horizon 2020 in order to continue facilitating cross-border cooperation in research and technology issues. The Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology is currently --initiatives and is involved in further energy-related action covered by ERA-NET.  One example of a successful international venture is the transnational Smart Energy Systems Joint Programming Platform based on an Austrian initiative. The Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology is coordinating a network of 30 national and regional research, technology and innovation grant schemes in 23 European or associated countries covering smart and digital energy systems and integrated regional energy systems. The Joint Programming Platform has already become discussions are continuing with industry. The SET Plan Action 4 Working Group, also organised by Member States, has developed a joint implementation plan in close cooperation with ETIP SNET, ETIP Renewable Heating and Cooling, ETIP PV and ETIP Geothermal.  The objective of the ERA-NET Smart Energy Systems Joint Programming Platform is to initiate and promote transnational research, technology and innovation projects in co-creation with regional operators and users in participating countries. Cooperation under transition-to-market programmes in participating countries and with private investors has begun.   100 million of public funds from participating countries. In 2019, a joint tender on storage solutions was organised, with first-time involvement of non-European countries in the global Mission Innovation initiative. For 2020, preparations for a digital transformation of energy systems are under way. Further development of the priorities and additional annual tenders are envisaged as part of budget made available for mming initiatives into Horizon Europe co-funded partnerships.  Global initiatives  towards increased international cooperation and coordinated research and development efforts. Together with the Austrian Chamber of Commerce, a governance structure was set up in Austria for the purposes of participating in Mission Innovation. With the agreement of Austrian stakeholders, participation in Mission Innovation will initially focus on Smart Grids Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 206 of 268  (IC1), Heating and Cooling of Buildings (IC7) and Hydrogen (IC8). The organisation of the first ordinator, to make an active contribution to the initiative in 2019, together with 30 funding partners from 23 countries.  Austrian experts and businesses are also active in numerous technology programmes organised committees. These are another important mechanism for Austria to assert its global position in the field of energy and environmental technology. Every year, approximately EUR 4 million in funding is currently provided by the Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology so that Austrian stakeholders are able to participate.
