2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 57 2.3 ENERGY SECURITY DIMENSION The INECP 2021- Security Strategy approved in 2015:   ensure the diversification of the national energy mix, achieving an adequate representation of energy sources;  guarantee security of supply in order to ensure access to the necessary resources at all times;  encourage the use of indigenous sources in order to diversify the energy mix. Furthermore, with reference to the changes in the energy mix that are proposed in this Plan, supplying safe, clean and efficient energy to the different consumer sectors will involve significant challenges and technological difficulties, which must be addressed on different levels:   reduction of energy dependency, especially the importing of fossil fuels;  diversification of energy and supply sources;  preparation to cope with constraints or interruptions in the supply of energy sources;  increase in the flexibility of the national energy system. With regard to the first aspect, Spain had an energy dependency ratio of 73% in 2015 (see Table 2.9) and the same in 2017, due to the prevalence of fossil fuels in the energy mix (coal, oil and gas), since Spain does not produce significant volumes of these fuels internally.  This dependence on primary energy has major economic repercussions. Thus, in 2017, Spain had a negative balance of foreign trade in energy of over EUR 20 billion. In this respect, this Plan reduces the energy dependency ratio by reducing the importation of fossil fuels, especially coal and oil.   2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 58 Figure 2.10.

In Annex D 2 Guarantee of Supply: Probabilistic analysis of coverage under the 2030 Target Scenario, REE provides the corresponding technical analysis. In addition, in Annex B (Models), the specific models used in the electricity sector are presented. The main purpose of the analyses performed by both models was precisely to confirm that the security of electricity supply with the generation mix presented is guaranteed under the most demanding conditions.  With regard to the security of electricity supply in relation to the phase-out of coal in electricity generation by 2030 as a result of market mechanisms (price per tonne of CO2 on the EU ETS market), as well as the orderly and phased closure of part of the nuclear fleet by that date (four of the seven existing reactors will be closed), as envisaged in the Target Scenario of this Plan, the following should be noted:  Firstly, this reduction in capacity is offset by the significant penetration of renewable electricity generation technologies, in particular solar and wind technologies (see Table 2.3). Evolution of the installed capacity of electricity).  Secondly, Spain has a fleet of 27,531 MW of combined cycle gas plants, which provide significant back-up capacity when it comes to evolving towards this transition in the electricity mix during the decade 2021-2030. In addition, large-scale development of storage and demand management is planned.  Finally, the aforementioned reports/models have exhaustively and thoroughly analysed the security of electricity supply and have concluded that the supply is fully guaranteed in the Target Scenario envisaged in this Plan.  an adequate primary energy mix that includes technically and economically viable sources for the period to 2030 in order to ensure the continuity of supply, as well as achieving the decarbonisation targets set by this Plan. Furthermore, their geographical origin must continue to be diversified in order to reduce possible risks of interruption to supply as much as possible.   Diversification Maximising the diversification of both energy sources and countries of origin of the supply.   Indigenous Imported Indigenous Imported 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 60 Thirdly, we must continue working to prepare to cope with potential limitations or interruptions to the supply of energy sources, in order to increase the resilience of the national energy system.   Resilience Further preparation in order to cope with potential limitations or interruptions to the supply of energy sources  Due to the low level of energy interconnection with the rest of the European continent, among other factors, Spain has a solid preparation system to deal independently with limitations or interruptions to energy supply, as well as preparation plans for the specific risks of the electricity sector.  It should be noted, in this respect, that one of the main functions of the operators of the electricity and gas systems is to guarantee the continuity and security of supply and the correct management of the different networks, carrying out their functions in coordination with all the agents involved.  The objectives corresponding to the three levels of energy security that have been presented respond to needs from the energy supply side.  However, it is also necessary to take advantage of the new possibilities presented by technologies to provide flexibility to the energy system, not only from the supply side but also from the demand side.   Flexibility Increasing the flexibility of the system while taking advantage of the possibilities from the demand side of the energy-consuming sectors.
