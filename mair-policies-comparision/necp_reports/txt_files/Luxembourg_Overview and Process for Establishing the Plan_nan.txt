 and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 7   1. Overview and process for establishing the plan 1.1. Summary The integrated national energy and climate plan is a new planning and monitoring tool for the EU and its Member States. It aims to improve the coordination of European energy and climate policies and is the key instrument for achieving the EU 2030 targets on climate action, renewable energy and energy efficiency. It is based on Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action (Governance Regulation). It requires each EU Member State to draw up an integrated national energy and climate plan for the period from 2021 to 2030. The Paris Agreement, which was unanimously adopted on 12 December 2015, established a new basis for global climate action. At the centre of the Paris Agreement is the target of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. There is broad scientific and political consensus that current contributions, including those of the European Union, are insufficient and many signs indicate accelerated and irreversible global warming. The IPCC Special Report on the consequences of global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius shows the scale of the challenge and the urgency to act.  The IPCC Special Report has led the European Commission to upw2030. The new President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has called for a 50-55% reduction target by 2030, and Vice-President Frans Timmermans, Commissioner for Climate Action and European Green Deal, will soon be presenting a climate law with new measures. The European Investment Bank is also currently being transformed into a climate bank. Luxembourg will continue to encourage the European Commission to introduce a credible and comprehensive strateEurope by no later than 2050 and will also continue to advocate a policy of not promoting nuclear power, coal, fracking, or the capture and storage of carbon dioxide1in greenhouse gases by 2030 is in line with the high ambitions of Luxembourg.   The Luxembourg Government considers that nuclear power is not one of the possible solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions due to its multiple risks, and it therefore strongly advocates a policy of not promoting nuclear power. There is support at European level for efforts to phase out nuclear power and for a fundamental reform of the Euratom Treaty, in particular with a view to abolishing public subsidies for nuclear power once and for all and making nuclear power operators liable for the full risk. In all relevant international forums, initiatives will be supported to ensure that extending the life of nuclear power plants                                                            1 This policy of non-promotion does not cover carbon sequestration in forest and agricultural sinks.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 8   is subject to the same safety and environmental impact assessments as new projects. The Luxembourg Government will also work at both European and national level to ensure that nuclear energy is excluded from future investments that are classified as sustainable, and welcomes the decision at EU level to exclude nuclear  It is clear that facing and overcoming the challenges identified in the Paris Climate Agreement will require a huge amount of investment. In order to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, Europe needs ne2. These investments can be financed by green bonds, inter alia. In 2007, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange listed the first green bond ever issued. Since then, it has been a leader in this class of investment. Now, more than 160 green bonds are listed. The issuers range from states, development agencies and banks to financial institutions and companies. The major challenge for energy policy will be to phase out fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas much faster  energy and mobility that reduces dependence on cars and trucks and converts the remaining cars and trucks to electric or hydrogen propulsion. Against this background, as part of the 2018-do its utmost to comply with this [Paris] agreement and to take into account the findings of the Intergovernmental energy and climate plan defin The energy transition has already been addressed in Luxembourg in recent years and is part of the Third Industrial Revolution process, which was initiated in 2015 and the cornerstones of which involve energy efficiency in new buildings, developing renewable energy on a large scale and incorporating it into the energy network, developing decentralised energy storage, digitalising the energy networks and using more sustainable means of transport. The Luxembourg Government intends to further speed up the energy transition that has already been set in motion. Its climate and energy policies are essentially based on improving energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy and promoting more sustainable public and individual mobility. Luxembourg wants to be actively involved in the European energy transition and to become a country of climate solutions.                                                            2 Information provided by the European Commission.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 9   The present plan offers new chances to strengthen the connection between energy and climate policies, on the one hand, and the scientific development of Luxembourg, on the other. The aim will in fact be to ensure the intelligent and sustainable development of the country in line with the conclusions of the strategic study on the Third Industrial Revolution, in particular in the areas of environmental technologies, mobility, climate action and digitalisation. Against this background, it is also important to intensify research and development in the areas mentioned, in order to bring about and develop modern, industrial activity in Luxembourg. The integrated national energy and climate plan will thus also have the potential to establish Luxembourg as a hub for climate-friendly start-ups and businesses. In addition to new instruments, the plan will also help to create the credibility needed to make Luxembourg a world leader in offering investment funds in the fields of energy efficiency and renewable energy and in climate financing. The two tables below present the central objectives, policies and meas2030 in order to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. The Paris Agreement also states that, due to historically high emissions of greenhouse gases, developed countries have a particular responsibility in this respect. This also applies to the EU and Luxembourg. With regard to compatibility with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, the Luxembourg government has decided at national level to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for sectors outside the EU emissions trading scheme by 55% by 2030 compared to the reference year 2005. The government has also decided to set an energy efficiency target of 40-44% by 2030 and to increase the share of renewable energy to 25% by 2030.

Overview of current policy situation When devising the energy and climate policies, a few speenergy consumption pattern need to be taken into account. First of all, Luxembourg is characterised by a highly dynamic demographic development of the population. In the last ten years, for instance, the population has increased from 493,500 residents in 2009 to 613,900 residents in 2019. In addition, the very open Luxembourg economy is characterised by dynamic development, reflected in an average annual growth rate of more than 2.5% in the last five years. A further atypical situation compared to its neighbouring countries is the high fuel consumption, which constitutes approximately two-thirds of the and to the low price level of fuel compared to the neighbouring countries. Moreover, Luxembourg does not have any large power plants, meaning that, in addition to its own electricity production, it relies mainly on imports (85%), which are not accounted for on the CO2 balance sheet. This pattern is also reflected in a relatively low consumption of electricity in Luxembourg, at just under 15%. It should also be taken into account that the pattern of industrial energy consumption is likewise considered atypical. For example, the share of electricity consumption in the steel industry alone amounts to about 40% of national electricity consumption. Some of the factors mentioned above have thus become significant drivers of energy consumption in recent years, and will remain so in the future. It is also important to consider that Luxembourg is characterised by a high level of energy dependency. In fact, Luxembourg is one of the few countries in the European Union that does not have any naturally occurring fossil resources and therefore has to import all of the energy it needs, whether oil or natural gas. Luxembourg also does not have any sea ports, any refining capacity, any gas reservoirs due to the lack of suitable geology, and limited storage capacity for oil products. Luxembourg thus has only limited opportunities to influence the overarching security of supply using national measures. In order to ensure its security of supply, Luxembourg, in close cooperation with neighbouring countries, has in the past relied on the diversification of sources and routes of supply in the framework of the Pentalateral Energy Forum (DE, FR, BE, NL, LU, AT, CH). Luxembourg has always been a proponent of a well-functioning and competitive internal energy market and advocates European approaches to energy infrastructure. These approaches are fully in line with the principles of the European Energy Union. In recent years, Luxembourg has made considerable progress in energy efficiency, renewable energy and climate action, and the digitalisation of the energy transition. These areas will be addressed briefly below.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 15    Energy efficiency Between 2008 and 2014, Luxembourg adopted three national energy efficiency action plans and implemented the measures contained therein. The current, fourth, National Energy Efficiency Action Plan was adopted by the government in 2017. It contains a large number of measures that are currently being implemented. In the field of new buildings, Luxembourg has continually tightened its energy efficiency requirements over the last ten years and is playing a leading role in Europe. The nearly zero-energy building standard applicable in the field of energy classes has been compulsory for every newly constructed residential building since the start of 2017, and corresponds approximately to the internationally recognised Passivhaus Standard [passive-house standard]. These nearly zero-energy buildings are generally identified as AAA buildings in the national certification of energy performance certificates. In 2014, Luxembourg presented its national building renovation strategy, which was praised by the European Commission in particular for its detailed overview of the building stock and for the national information and training programmes. In view of the significant potential for energy savings in existing buildings, the implementation of a national initiative for energy renovation was announced as part of the building renovation strategy. An extension of the building renovation strategy was developed in cooperation with the relevant players in the construction sector. This extension outlined guidelines for further-reaching strategic approaches and contains an action plan based on the currently existing obstacles. The strategic approaches and measures are currently being put into practice. A series of instruments has also been developed and introduced to support the energy renovation of buildings. These instruments include investment aid for private households (via the PRIMe House support scheme) and municipalities (via the environmental fund) and the launch of a climate bank that offers reduced-interest loans for energy renovation. In order to lend fresh impetus to energy efficiency, in 2015 Luxembourg introduced a mechanism obliging natural gas and electricity suppliers to make concrete energy savings each year by implementing energy efficiency measures in sectors of their choosing. In the industrial sector, the voluntary agreement between the government and industry was reformed in order to focus on increasing energy efficiency by means of binding targets. The investment aid schemes for companies in order to improve energy efficiency and promote renewable energy have also been reformed.   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 16   Renewable energy In the field of renewable energy, Directive 2009/28/EC of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources sets a target for Luxembourg of 11% renewable energy in the final energy consumption in 2020. Each Member State will also ensure that the share of energy from renewable sources in all forms of transport in 2020 is at least 10% of its final consumption of energy in transport.  Luxembourg is well on track to meet its targets for 2020. The share of renewable energy in the final energy consumption reached 6.38% in 2017, compared with 5.44% in 2016, 5.04% in 2015 and 4.51% in 2014. In order to be able to respect the indicative trajectory set out in Directive 2009/28/EC, Luxembourg must achieve an average share of 7.47% renewable energy in 2017 and 2018. In the field of new residential buildings, an implicit requirement for the use of renewable energy was introduced by the Regulation on the energy efficiency of residential buildings. The regulations on feed-in tariffs have been systematically adjusted in recent years to create interesting investment incentives, particularly in the areas of biomass, wind and photovoltaics, as well as for photovoltaics cooperatives. In addition, the feed-in tariffs for photovoltaics were increased in 2019 and a first national competitive procedure for photovoltaic systems on buildings or industrial or landfill sites was organised in 2018. A second invitation to tender was issued in autumn 2019. These measures have triggered a huge wave of investment and could swiftly increase solar production from the current 130 MW to over 200 MW. Finally, it should also be mentioned that the biofuel blending rate has been set at 5.85% for 2019 and 7.7% for 2020. In 2019, the minimum rate for biofuels made from non-food waste, residues and cellulosic ple was set at 35% and in 2020 was even increased to 50% (after double counting). In addition, the government programme stipulated that the use of first-generation biofuels should be limited to no more than 5% in order to promote the use of second-generation biofuels, which are considered more sustainable.  Sustainable mobility In parallel to the increased support for public transport and active mobility (Luxembourg has the largest investment programme in the EU for trains, trams and buses), recent years have seen the promotion of electromobility. Luxembourg has decided to set up a joint national infrastructure of public charging stations for electric vehicles. A total of 800 charging stations are to be installed in public areas and in park & ride car parks by 2020. Just under 280 charging stations had already been installed by the end of 2018. Relative  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 17   to population, Luxembourg is thus already in third place in the field of public charging infrastructure in Europe.  Digitalisation As part of efforts to digitalise the energy transition, Luxembourg legally requires electricity and gas network operators to replace current electricity and gas meters with smart meters by 2020 and 2021, respectively, and to manage the corresponding data using a joint central system.  Climate Pact In 2012, the Luxembourg Government concluded a Climate Pact with the municipalities, offering technical advice and financial support for climate action measures. The Climate Pact is a wide-ranging instrument for orienting and shaping communal climate and energy policies, which has been expanded to include the topics of air quality and the circular economy. It supports the municipalities in introducing an integrated een signed by all municipalities in Luxembourg, of which more than 86% had already achieved one of the three certification levels by the end of 2018. The 2018-2023 coalition agreement envisages the further development of the Climate Pact beyond 2020. As the above examples show, Luxembourg has managed to make significant progress in recent years in the field of energy and climate policies, thus laying the groundwork for a sustainable energy transition. The present national energy and climate plan picks up on this trend and sets out an ambitious route for Luxembourg to drastically reduce energy consumption in all sectors and rapidly develop renewable energy and electromobility.    and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 18   1.3. Consultations and involvement of national and Union entities and their outcome Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action provides for public consultations to be carried out. In addition, a multilevel climate and energy dialogue should be established, in which local authorities, civil society organisations, social partners and other relevant stakeholders come together to discuss the different scenarios envisaged for energy and climate policies. -2030 was prepared in the course of intensive consultations under the leadership of the two responsible ministries (Ministry of Energy and Spatial Planning and Ministry of Environment, Climate and Sustainable Development).  Involvement and consultation of the national Parliament Following the adoption of the draft national energy and climate plan by the Government Council, the draft 27 February 2019. Following the adoption by the Government Council of the draft composition of the final energy and climate plan, an exchange of views took place on 6 and 17 Environment, Climate, Energy and Spatial Development. This exchange between members of Parliament, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Energy also served as preparation for a consultation debate in Parliament. During the consultation debate on 19 December 2019, the spokespersons of the political groups expressed their views on the objectives, policies and measures envisaged under the national energy and climate plan. 3.  Involvement and consultation of stakeholders and the public Stakeholders and the public were given the opportunity to participate in the preparation of the present national energy and climate plan at an early stage. As early as 2018, participatory processes took place during the preparation of the draft national energy and climate plan, the results of which were included in                                                            3 https://www.chd.lu/wps/portal/public/Accueil/Actualite/ALaUne/?current=true&urile=wcm%3Apath%3Aactualite.public.chd.lu/ST-www.chd.lu/sa-actualites/c96b8d5e-613c-42a7-bb1a-7f4fee350509  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 19   the draft plan where useful and possible. Further details on the above processes (strategy study on the Third Industrial Revolution and long-term climate strategy) are provided below. Following the adoption of the draft plan in early 2019, it was presented in a one-day workshop on 21 May 2019  society, social partners, business, academia, Parliament and other stakeholders, with the involvement of the relevant ministries and administrations as well as local authorities. Almost 200 participants took part in the discussions. The preparation of the final energy and climate plan involved developing, prioritising and specifying measures on the basis of approaches that have already been identified, which should make it possible to achieve the 2030 targets. The participatory process was led by experts and was divided into seven thematic areas:   housing and sustainable buildings   mobility   industry and entrepreneurship  agriculture  energy  changing lifestyles  governance, sustainable finance and taxation. In addition, the Ministry of Energy and Spatial Development and the Ministry of Environment, Climate and Sustainable Development held a series of bilateral discussions with civil society organisations and social partners in autumn 2019. The aim of the discussions was to reach the broadest possible consensus among the various stakeholders on the planned policies and measures of the energy and climate plan. In response to the mobilisation of students for climate action, the government has also actively involved students in the consultations. In order to better understand their expectations, ideas and proposals, four regional workshops were held in lyceums (ClimateXchange) in May 2019, in collaboration with the CNEL National Conference of Schoolchildren. A total of around 500 students participated in the workshops, which were also attended by the Minister for Education, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Agriculture. The workshops addressed in particular sustainable schools, mobility, waste, energy and agriculture (sustainable consumption and production).  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 20   Process  strategy study on the Third Industrial Revolution In 2015, at the initiative of the Ministry of the Economy and in cooperation with the Chamber of Commerce and IMS Luxembourg, Luxembourg commissioned the American social theorist, sociologist, economist and public speaker Jeremy Rifkin, who developed the concept of the Third Industrial Revolution and has presented it in a number of his publications and books, to conduct a strategy study on the Third Industrial Revolution (TIR process). The study pursued the aim of making the existing economic model more sustainable and interconnected for future generations. The preparation of the strategy study was linked to an open, participatory and long-term process, with the aim of identifying the megatrends, drawing the necessary conclusions and introducing these in a suitable form into democratic institutions. The TIR process also sought to make use the concept of open social innovation. In the follow-up to the study, the government stated that the participatory approach should be continued via existing platforms. In relating to the energy transition at several events. On 12 March 2018, an open workshop on the energy transition was held in the context of the developments in the European Energy Union, with presentations and discussions on the main pillars of the Energy Union, the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, the modelling for the development of the 2030 energy and climate strategy, the renovation potential in Luxembourg looking ahead to 2070, the potential of renewable energy in Luxembourg looking ahead to 2030, and security of supply issues and competitiveness in the areas of electricity, natural gas and oil. Process  long-term climate strategy With a view to developing a long-term climate strategy, the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Infrastructure organised several consultations with civil society, business, science and public administration representatives during 2018. These consultations were also attended by Prof. Reinhard Loske. At a first co-creation workshop on the weekend of 3 and 4 February 2018, around 100 participants identified social innovations for mitigating climate change. A second workshop took place on 15 March 2018. There, above all the main principles of governance of the national climate policy were developed with the interest groups. On 5 June 2018, the preliminary draft strategy was presented and discussed with the stakeholders. This is intended to serve as the basis for developing the long-term strategy that must be prepared pursuant to the Paris Climate Agreement and Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action. In addition, the main findings of the above workshops have, where possible, been taken into account in the present national energy and climate plan.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 21    Public consultation Following the adoption of the draft final national energy and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 by the Government Council on 7 February 2020, the draft was submitted to the public and all stakeholders in a final public consultation. Neighbouring countries were also included in this process. From 12 February to 29 March 2020, the aforementioned draft and the draft of the associated environmental impact report were available on the Environment Portal (www.emwelt.lu) of the Ministry of the Environment, Climate and Sustainable Development. During this period, interested citizens and stakeholders were able to submit their opinions, suggestions and comments by email or by post. A total of 328 citizens took advantage of this opportunity. Some 30 stakeholders from civil society and business, including social partners, as well as public institutions, submitted comments. All contributions and comments, including those received after the deadline of 29 March 2020, were evaluated and duly considered. A lot of the feedback relates to the implementation of measures contained in the plan and will therefore be taken into account in the implementation process. At the same time, a functioning dialogue between all national stakeholders is an important prerequisite for the successful implementation of the energy and climate plan. The bodies provided for in the draft framework law on climate change make it possible to structure this dialogue.     and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 22   Iterative process with the European Commission Luxembourg submitted its draft integrated national energy and climate plan 2021-2030 to the European Commission on 18 February 2019. The draft was assessed by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. On 18 June 2019, the Commission sent nine recommendations to Luxembourg based on the above assessment. In drawing up the final national energy and climate plan, Luxembourg has taken these recommendations into account and acted on them where possible.    and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 23   1.4. Regional cooperation in preparing the plan  Pentalateral Energy Forum Luxembourg is an integral part of the energy markets for electricity and gas in Western Europe. As part of these markets, it benefits  as do the other Member States  from significantly better conditions in terms of economic efficiency, security of supply and sustainability of energy supply. A key element of regional cooperation in the context of energy and climate policy is the Pentalateral Energy Forum. Under the Luxembourg presidency, the following joint chapter was adopted at a conference in June 2019: Introduction Within the framework of the Pentalateral Energy Forum for regional cooperation, which has been in existence since 2005, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and, since 2011, Austria have been working together on a voluntary basis  countries which together are home to more than one third of the EU population and which account for more than 40% of electricity generation in the EU. Switzerland joined as a permanent observer in 2011 and actively contributes to technical and decision-making work. In close cooperation (upon invitation) with the European Commission, the Pentalateral Energy Forum strengthens cooperation between all relevant stakeholders and thus pursues the objective of creating a regional electricity market as an intermediate step towards establishing a single European electricity market. The cooperation is steered by the energy ministers, who meet regularly. The continuous monitoring of the activities is ensured by the Penta Coordinators and the Penta NECP Committee, under the leadership of the relevant directors-general for energy in the participating countries. The work programme is implemented by the transmission system operators (TSOs), ministries, regulatory authorities, the European Commission and market players, who meet regularly in three working groups (support groups). The great success of the past 15 years has been that the perspective of the participating countries in terms of energy policy has evolved from a purely national focus to a regional approach. The participating countries have set concrete regional milestones in various areas that are still relevant today:  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 24   Internal electricity market/market integration: Penta Support Group 1 (SG 1) focuses on the coupling of the electricity markets in the region. SG 1 set itself the goal of the flow-based market coupling (FBMC) of day-ahead markets, which was achieved when the Penta region became the first region in the European Union to introduce this in May 2015. Since then, flow-based market coupling has been continuously optimised to achieve higher welfare gains and now serves as the basis for a fully EU-based market coupling for day-ahead markets. In order to increase the transmission capacity available for cross-border trading on the intraday market, SG 1 promoted a coordinated process for calculating intraday capacities, which was implemented in March 2016 after the flow-based market coupling of day-ahead markets for all borders in the region as a first step towards coupling the European intraday markets. The Support Group was able to gain a privileged insight into the drastic changes in the electricity landscape and the governance of the electricity markets. While in 2005 electricity operators were still operating mainly independently of each other, over the years the working group has promoted cooperation between stakeholders, leading, inter alia, to the formation of regional groupings of TSOs within their associations, the merging of power exchanges and TSOs and the emergence of new regional players (TSCNet, Coreso, formerly CASC-CWE, SSC). In view of action. Internal electricity market/flexibility:  Support Group 3 (SG 3) focuses on flexibility issues in the region. So far, the work of SG 3 has focused on balancing energy, intraday and the role of demand-side management  three key areas for regional cooperation to improve the flexibility of our electricity markets. A number of technical background papers have been prepared, identifying the main obstacles to greater use of flexibility in the Penta region. SG 3 is open to traditional participants (regulatory authorities, TSOs) as well as other stakeholders such as distribution system operators (DSOs), major consumer associations and renewable energy producers. In the area of balancing energy, the Pentaforum evaluated existing approaches and exchanged best practices. The Pentaforum also plays an important role in the implementation of the European Union guidelines on balancing energy. In terms of demand-side management, a separate group of  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 25   experts has prepared a report outlining the current situation in the Penta region, focusing in particular on the rules and responsibilities of new market players in each country of the region. With regard to further cooperation between the participating countries in the field of hydrogen, a workshop was held to identify possible topics for cooperation in this field. Security of supply: Support Group 2 (SG 2) deals with issues surrounding security of supply in the region. In June 2017, the countries involved signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on cooperation with regard to security of supply. On this basis, and in light of the new EU Regulation on cooperation in the field achieve a better common understanding of national concerns, to identify potentially relevant (cross-border) crisis situations in the region and to assess various measures to reduce the impact of possible crises. The first regional Generation Adequacy Assessment (GAA), carried out by the TSOs of the participating countries and published in March 2015, was an important milestone. The methodology of the assessment was based on a probabilistic and chronological approach with hourly resolution for the years 2015/2016 and 2020/2021 and thus represented a significant improvement over the existing deterministic approaches. Furthermore, the TSOs of the participating countries used a common regional data set based on the same scenarios and assumptions, such as a temperature-dependent load model for the whole region and harmonised probabilistic hydrological data. The governments of the Pentaforum countries are convinced that these parameters will remain relevant in the future. In addition to continuing work on the above areas, the countries participating in the Pentalateral Energy Forum will focus in the coming years on: Decarbonisation of the electricity sector Shared vision of a decarbonised electricity supply in the participating countries by 2050: The participating countries will discuss their ideas on how to achieve a decarbonised electricity supply by 2050 (and intermediate targets for 2030 and 2040) based on a highly efficient energy system strongly influenced by renewable energy, a gradual phase-out of fossil power generation and efficient end-use of electricity. The first step is to compare national scenarios on a possible design of the electricity system in 2050 and to identify commonalities and differences between  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 26   these scenarios and how security of supply is ensured in the scenarios. This will serve as a basis for developing a common understanding of the expectations and challenges in the development of the future electricity system.  North Seas Energy Cooperation Luxembourg is part of the North Seas Energy Cooperation and thus belongs to the wider North Sea region, which has great potential in the field of renewable energy. According to the European Commission, consumption by 2030. Offshore power generation and transmission infrastructure projects can have cross-border implications for energy prices, security of supply and the environment, including the availability of marine space and the speed of innovation. As a result, Luxembourg and the countries bordering the North Sea can greatly benefit from cooperating with one another. The North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC) was established in 2016. It is an initiative of voluntary, bottom-up and market-oriented regional cooperation. The aim is to create synergies and avoid incompatibilities between national policies, exchange knowledge on best practices and promote common strategies where possible and useful. It also aims to coordinate and promote the further cost-effective use of offshore renewable energy, in particular wind energy, in order to ensure a sustainable, secure and affordable energy supply for Luxembourg and the countries bordering the North Sea through an increased and better coordinated use of offshore wind energy and through potential joint or cluster projects. The NSEC primarily follows a step-by-step approach, with the longer-term prospect of further integration and increasing the efficiency of wholesale electricity markets, while contributing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and average wholesale price ranges and improving security of supply in the region. The North Seas Energy Cooperation comprises 10 countries, with the participation of the European Commission: Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Regional cooperation With regard to the development of this plan, the NSEC countries took full advantage of the NSEC, where experts in the working groups shared knowledge and experience on specific aspects, such as obstacles and best practices in the area of national offshore wind energy use, and in particular  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 27   the coordination of national renewable energy plans for offshore wind energy by 2030 and market integration.  The working groups (WGs) that are part of the Cooperation focus on the following topics:  WG 1: maritime spatial planning and environmental impact, WG 2: development and regulation of offshore pipelines and other offshore infrastructure, WG 3: support framework and financing of offshore wind energy projects, WG 4: standards, technical requirements and regulation in the field of offshore wind energy. Maritime spatial planning and environmental impact Within the framework of the North Seas Energy Cooperation, the NSEC countries contribute to the development of a joint environmental impact procedure. In order to achieve our energy and climate objectives within the EU, we need to better understand the potential environmental limitations of large-scale wind energy use in the North Sea. Further work on maritime spatial planning and environmental impact is needed to realise the potential of the North Sea. In order to increase their knowledge and support the use of offshore wind energy in the North Sea, Luxembourg and the countries bordering the North Sea will continue to work closely together on maritime spatial planning, environmental research and cumulative environmental impact assessment of wind farms by energy, maritime spatial planning and environmental authorities.  Offshore pipelines and other offshore infrastructure The NSEC serves as a platform to work together on concepts for potential joint offshore wind energy projects and for coordinated electricity infrastructure, including transmission infrastructure.  Luxembourg is working with the other North Seas Energy Cooperation countries to explore the possibilities of specific cooperation projects. In addition to joint offshore wind energy projects connecting and supported by several Member States, this includes work on possible hybrid solutions that would exploit cross-border solutions to connect offshore wind farms to the grid and seek synergies with country interconnection capacities, and on appropriate market rules.  The NSEC countries therefore contribute to the development of opportunities for cooperation in the field of hybrid projects, identifying and addressing legal, regulatory and commercial barriers. Coordinating increased interconnection in the NSEC countries would also allow more surplus  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 28   energy to flow to other countries where it could meet the demand in a well-functioning internal energy market.  The NSEC has drawn up a list of possible areas and projects in the region where joint projects could be particularly useful. These include: (1) IJmuiden Ver  offshore wind farm to UK, (2) CGS IJmuiden Ver  Norfolk, (3) COBRA Cable, (4) the DE-NL offshore wind farm and (5) the North Sea Wind Power Hub. NSEC is working to develop concrete approaches for the implementation of selected projects from the above list. The NSEC will continue to work on the action plans for the specific hybrid projects, which can also be further developed at national and regional level. In addition, the Cooperation will continue to serve as a forum for reflection on how to deal with uncertainties regarding the regulatory treatment of hybrid projects at EU and national level, and as a forum for discussing options to address these issues.  Support framework and financing of offshore wind energy projects In terms of measures, Luxembourg benefits from the NSEC in several ways: the work of the NSEC provides a platform for the exchange of best practices in designing support programmes and developing and refining new concepts to meet new challenges in the field of promoting offshore wind energy and developing possible options for future joint wind energy projects. The work of the NSEC countries within the NSEC includes coordinating the timing of calls for tenders, exchanging best practices in designing support programmes for offshore wind energy and, where possible, establishing common principles and possible options for aligning support.  As regards the coordination of tenders, the NSEC countries regularly exchange information on their national tendering schedules. The aim is to identify potential time overlaps and to ensure that the North Sea region is as even as possible in terms of the tendering process in order to optimise competition and achieve the best value for money for consumers. The NSEC countries are prepared to take into account, among other criteria and where possible, the tendering schedules in their future tender planning in order to avoid unnecessary bottlenecks and to ensure a steady flow of capacity without interruption cycles for the parties involved. Within the NSEC, the NSEC countries exchange information on and discuss their prospective national policy in respect of offshore wind energy, their national offshore utilisation plans and best practices regarding the design of tenders for offshore wind energy.   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 29   At the ministerial meeting in Esbjerg on 20 June 2019, the North Sea states and Luxembourg agreed to cooperate to achieve total installed capacity in the NSEC member states of at least 70 GW by 2030 on the basis of national planning. In order to reflect the dynamics of offshore wind energy use in the region, the long-term planned aggregate capacity of at least 70 GW by 2030 can be achieved with indicative milestones for the region of around 25 GW in 2020 and 54 GW in 2025. Within the NSEC, Luxembourg also contributes to analysing and developing options for mobilising investments in joint projects, for example through EU funds such as the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) infrastructure fund, as well as through institutional investors. Such future joint projects could be cross-border renewable energy projects in line with the CEF proposal. Harmonising rules, regulations and technical standards The North Seas Energy Cooperation is working to harmonise standards and technical requirements that could contribute to further reducing the costs of using offshore wind energy. The harmonisation of rules, regulations and technical standards focuses on five areas. These include: (1) aeronautics, labelling and lighting, (2) health and safety, (3) certification of regulatory requirements, (4) design of wind farms and site exploration, and (5) research approaches. The NSEC works to develop proposals and recommendations for implementation in close cooperation with industry. The aim of these recommendations is to reduce costs while maintaining feasibility. The Cooperation will continue to work to harmonise standards and technical requirements and exchange best practices to reduce unnecessary regulation and cut costs for industry.   European Union Luxembourg will also continue to support ambitious goals and their implementation at European level. In particular, the following objectives are being pursued.  presents a concrete roadmap on how this will be implemented.  2) As an important first intermediate step, the EU has committed to a binding target of a 55% reduction of greenhouse gases in the EU by 2030.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 30    3) The European Commission is expected to present by summer 2020 a concrete plan on how to adapt the relevant EU targets for greenhouse gas reductions and energy, as well as existing EU measures (EU emissions trading scheme for CO2 allowances for industry and power plants, EU effort sharing (ESR), land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), EU Energy Efficiency Directive, EU Renewable Energy Directive, or regulation of CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light- and heavy-duty vehicles). The Commission is also proposing the following additional measures: - in order to prevent unfair competition from imports that are not made in a way that protects the climate, the EU sho2 border adjustment); - in order to accelerate the phasing-out of fossil fuel drives/engines from new cars and vans, all vehicles should be fossil-free (electrical, hydrogen) from 2031 onwards; - the EU should also introduce standards for new trucks, ships and aircraft.  4) The EU presents a financial framework on how the EU budget will proactively support the climate and energy transition (GHG emissions in the industrial sector: zero carbon steel, cement or glass, major EU housing renovation programme, support to build 400 GW offshore wind farms in the North Sea, infrastructure development for zero- or low-emission transport, and conversion to climate-friendly agriculture and land use). Progress will be measured by a credible and transparent system and a methodology for verification, traceability and monitoring of expenditure and its impact on climate action and the energy transition. The European Investment Bank will be transformed into a climate bank that will no longer lend for fossil fuel projects. It is also important that no common funds are wasted on the further development or maintenance of nuclear energy in Europe.  5) Before summer 2020, the EU is expected to present a new law to ensure that all batteries sold in the EU (in cars, buses, but also in other electronic devices) are 100% recycled and produced from materials that meet high environmental and human-rights standards.  6) The EU should not only tax the big internet companies, but also commit them to high energy efficiency standards (immersion cooling) and 100% renewable energy.  7) The EU should establish the industrial basis for a radical energy transition through large-scale research projects (zero carbon steel, cement, glass, green batteries programme, hybrid electric aircraft/ships) and prevent dumping by imports through binding climate clauses in trade agreements.
