12 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA  SECTION A: NATIONAL PLAN 1 OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action (Regulation), which entered into force on 24 December 20181, requires Member States to draw up and submit the following to the European Commission (the Commission):  by 31 December 2018: a draft of the integrated national energy and climate plan (NEPN) for 2020-2030 (with a view to 2040),  by 31 December 2019: the final NEPN,  by 1 January 2020: a long-term climate strategy for reducing emissions by 2050. The NEPN is a strategic document that must set goals, policies and actions up to 2030 (with an outlook to the year 2040) for the five dimensions of the Energy Union:  1. decarbonisation (greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and renewable energy sources (RES)), 2. energy efficiency, 3. energy security, 4. the internal energy market, and 5. research, innovation and competitiveness. Slovenia started drawing up the NEPN in October 2017 when, by Decision of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia, an inter-service working group on preparing the NEPN was set up, headed by the Ministry of Infrastructure, which was competent for energy. In spring 2018 the inter-service working group reviewed the current situation and this summer reviewed the targets under the individual dimensions of the Energy Union. Pursuant to the Regulation requirement that Member States submit an initial draft NEPN to the Commission by 31 December 2018, the Ministry of Infrastructure, in cooperation with the inter-service working group, drew up a first draft of the NEPN, which included a cross-section of the targets, policies and measures adopted for all five dimensions of the Energy Union up to 2020 and, in part, up to 2030. Slovenia was one of 22 Member States to submit a draft NEPN to the Commission by the deadline set by the Regulation, i.e. 31 December 2018. The draft document was based on previously adopted documents and decisions because, on account of early parliamentary elections, Slovenia did not adopt any new decisions in 2018 concerning higher requirements for reducing GHG emissions, the use of renewable energy or energy efficiency. The documents and decisions that formed the basis of the draft NEPN were thus based on the following targets: of at least a 27% share of RES in gross final energy use, at least a 27% improvement in energy efficiency compared to the baseline scenario of 2007 (in line with the Energy Efficiency Directive) and the sharing of GHG emission reduction burdens, as confirmed by the EU Heads of States at the European Council in October 2014. In the first draft of the NEPN (December 2018), the target for renewables is taken from Slovenia's Development Strategy 2030, in which Slovenia set a target of 27% of RES by 2030, while the target of 15% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030 was officially confirmed by the EU Effort Sharing Regulation in 2018. The target for energy efficiency [EEU] for Slovenia by 2030 was set on the basis of an assessment drawn from the then existing expert bases, which showed that by 2030 Slovenia could achieve a 30% improvement in energy efficiency compared to the baseline scenario in 2007. This first draft of the NEPN, drafted in December 2018, was the starting point for the preparation of the final NEPN, which includes a comprehensive update of the expert bases, the establishment of a multi-level climate and energy dialogue, and the updating and adoption of the NEPN. In parallel                                                            1  The Regulation can be accessed at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/SL/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32018R1999&from=SL#d1e2221-1-1. 13 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA  with the drafting of the NEPN, the Ministry of Infrastructure successfully carried out a procurement procedure to obtain external expert and technical support. On the basis of this procedure, in November 2018 a contract was concluded with a consortium of institutions headed by the Jozef Stefan Institute (JSI). In 2019, the Ministry of Infrastructure and the consortium of institutions under the leadership of the JSI, in cooperation with the inter-service working group, carried out a number of activities:  there was a multi-level climate and energy dialogue, the following components of which inter alia should be highlighted: o design and upgrade of NEPN website2, o preliminary public consultation on the drafting of the NEPN3, o many activities organised in coordination with the preparation of the long-term Climate Strategy, including in the form of participation in targeted communication workshops4, o an open call to young persons in favour of climate justice to be actively involved in drafting the NEPN5, o extensive preparation for a comprehensive environmental impact assessment6, o reporting to the Government of the Republic of Slovenia and informing the National Assembly7,  the first update of NEPN expert bases and projections8,  continuous cooperation with the Commission and updating of the original draft NEPN in line with the Commission's recommendations9,  regional meeting and consultation of experts and representatives of neighbouring countries involved in the preparation of the draft NEPN from Italy, Austria, Hungary, Croatia and Slovenia and the Commission, held in July 2019 in Ljubljana10,  preparation of the updated draft NEPN (Version 4.0) and its public presentation in September11,  a complete update of the updated draft NEPN (4.0) as a new version of the NEPN (4.1)12,                                                            2  The NEPN website is accessible at: https://www.energetika-portal.si/dokumenti/strateski-razvojni-dokumenti/nacionalni-energetski-in-podnebni-nacrt/. 3  The results of the preliminary consultation are available on the NEPN website: https://www.energetika- portal.si/dokumenti/strateski-razvojni-dokumenti/nacionalni-energetski-in-podnebni-nacrt/dogodki-predhodno-posvetovanje/. 4  Information on communication workshops is available on the NEPN website: https://www.energetika- portal.si/dokumenti/strateski-razvojni-dokumenti/nacionalni-energetski-in-podnebni-nacrt/dogodki-komunikacijske-delavnice/. 5  The open prompt is available on the NEPN website at: https://www.energetika-portal.si/nc/novica/n/poziv-ministrstva-mladim-in-gibanju-mladi-za-podnebno-pravicnost-4210/. 6  Information on the Comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment is available on the NEPN website: https://www.energetika- portal.si/dokumenti/strateski-razvojni-dokumenti/nacionalni-energetski-in-podnebni-nacrt/cpvo/. 7  A report on the process of drawing up and adopting the integrated national energy and climate plan, August 2019, is available on the NEPN website . 8  The presentation of the first results is available on the NEPN website: https://www.energetika- portal.si/fileadmin/dokumenti/publikacije/nepn/dokumenti/nepn_predstavitev_MZI_maj_2019.pdf. 9  The Commission recommendations are published and available on the NEPN website: https://www.energetika- portal.si/dokumenti/strateski-razvojni-dokumenti/nacionalni-energetski-in-podnebni-nacrt/dokumenti/#c965. 10  Regional meeting information is available on the NEPN website:  https://www.energetika- portal.si/dokumenti/strateski-razvojni-dokumenti/nacionalni-energetski-in-podnebni-nacrt/regionalno-posvetovanje/. 11  Information on the presentation of the completed NEPN draft is available on the NEPN website https://www.energetika- portal.si/nc/novica/n/predstavitev-dopolnjenega-osnutka-nepn-ter-posvet-o-pripravi-celovite-presoje-vplivov-na-o-4268/. 12  More information on the updated draft NEPN (4.1) is available on the NEPN website: https://www.energetika- portal.si/nc/novica/n/dopolnjen-osnutek-nepn-41-in-dopolnjen-osnutek-okoljskega-porocila-poslana-v-mnenje-na-4305/. 14 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   public discussion of NEPN version 4.1 together with the environmental report13,  a comprehensive update of NEPN 4.1 and the Environmental Report, taking the greatest possible account of the comments and suggestions made in the public hearing, and drafting of NEPN 5.014. In parallel with the preparation of the draft NEPN, on 22 November 2018, the Ministry of Infrastructure, in accordance with the Environmental Protection Act, informed the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning of the intention to draw up the NEPN and on 4 January 2019 the latter issued Decision No 35409-412/2018/9 to the effect that a comprehensive environmental impact assessment, including an assessment of acceptability with regard to protected areas, should be carried out as part of the NEPN preparation process. In November 2018, through the EU Structural Reform Program, the Ministry of Infrastructure asked the Commission for technical assistance in drawing up the draft environmental report. Following the timely submission of the NEPN draft report, Slovenia obtained the technical assistance and the Ministry of Infrastructure, together with the Commission services, coordinated the call for a draft environmental report, on the basis of which the Commission independently managed the process and, on 12 July 2019, signed a contract to draft the environmental report with a consortium of institutions under the direction of the Milan Vidmar Institute of Electrical Engineering [EIMV]. The Integrated Environmental Impact Assessment process (IEIA), which also included numerous non-governmental organisations as concerned parties, was carried out in accordance with Slovenian law in several steps: i) preparation of starting points for content and consultation, ii) preparation of the draft environmental report and consultation, obtaining the opinion of the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning [MOP] on the appropriateness of the draft environmental report, public presentation of the draft environmental report, public consultation and updating of the draft environmental report, participation of the Member States in the event of significant cross-border impacts and the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning decision on the acceptability of the updated environmental report. Four scenarios of future energy use and supply were discussed and analysed as part of the preparation of the NEPN:  a scenario with the existing measures (EM [OU]) - further development is based on continuation of the implementation of all measures already adopted or carried out by 1 October 2018,   a scenario with additional measures (AM [DU]), which takes into account measures in addition to the existing measures,   a scenario with additional ambitious measures (AMA [DUA]), taking into account a more demanding implementation of additional measures in all sectors,   a scenario based on recommendations received from the European Commission (REC), which inter alia takes into account a more intense rate of construction of new hydro-electric power plants (HPP) and more intensive implementation of energy efficiency improvement measures. Under the Integrated Environmental Impact Assessment process, starting points were drawn up for the content (i.e. the content report) and the Report on the process of public involvement in the content process15; the environmental report was then drafted and expert opinions16 were consulted.                                                            13  More information on the public reading of the updated NEPN draft and the environmental report is available at: https://www.energetika- portal.si/nc/novica/n/zacetek-javne-obravnave-dopolnjenega-osnutka-nepn-in-okoljskega-porocila-4308/. 14  More information on the end of the public reading of the updated NEPN draft and the environmental report and preparation of the updated version NEPN 5.0 is available on the NEPN website: https://www.energetika-portal.si/nc/novica/n/konec-javne-obravnave- dopolnjenega-osnutka-nepn-in-njegovega-okoljskega-porocila-4319/. 15  More information on drawing up baselines for content and consultation is available at: https://www.energetika- portal.si/dokumenti/strateski-razvojni-dokumenti/nacionalni-energetski-in-podnebni-nacrt/cpvo/cpvo1/. 16  The updated version NEPN 5.0 is available on the NEPN website: https://www.energetika-portal.si/nc/novica/n/konec-javne-obravnave- dopolnjenega-osnutka-nepn-in-njegovega-okoljskega-porocila-4319/. 15 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA  After receiving the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning opinion that the environmental report and NEPN should be supplemented, the Ministry of Infrastructure, together with both consortia, comprehensively supplemented and upgraded both documents, as far as possible taking into account the opinions received and mitigation measures proposed, and re-submitted the document to the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning for its opinion. After receiving a favourable opinion from the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning, the NEPN and the environmental report underwent public presentation and public consultation17. Both documents were comprehensively updated in the light of the comments received and re-submitted to the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning for a decision on admissibility. Upon receipt of the decision confirming the acceptability of the environmental impacts of the implementation of the NEPN, the NEPN was submitted to the Government of the Republic of Slovenia for adoption. In drawing up the NEPN, Slovenia reviewed all the targets set previously and, on the basis of the updated professional bases, prior public consultation, comprehensive environmental impact assessment and taking into account all the recommendations, except in the determination of the share of RES due to specific national circumstances, set development-oriented and demanding targets for 2030, stemming from an ambitious scenario of additional measures, further enhanced by some feasible measures from the REC (European Commission recommendations) scenario. The following ambitious scenario is referred to as the NEPN scenario with additional measures.  A comprehensive assessment of the environmental impact of the NEPN was carried out, in parallel with the drafting of the NEPN. The NEPN drafting and comprehensive impact assessment process also addressed the scope of the 2030 targets and contributions. There was far-reaching and structured discussion of the expert bases, which was key to achieving broad stakeholder consensus on Slovenia's challenging but feasible 2030 targets, which will take account of significant national circumstances and mark an appropriate step towards a climate-neutral Slovenia by 2050.  The projects and measures set out in the NEPN will, in accordance with the Energy Act, be in the public interest in terms of energy and climate policy.  The adoption of the NEPN and its submission to the European Commission are also a condition enabling the enlistment of cohesion funds under the new multi-annual financial framework.                                                               17  More information on the public hearing of the updated NEPN draft and the environmental report is available on the NEPN website: https://www.energetika-portal.si/nc/novica/n/zacetek-javne-obravnave-dopolnjenega-osnutka-nepn-in-okoljskega-porocila- 4308/. 16 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA  1.1 Summary Political, economic, environmental and social framework of the plan On 7 December 2017, the Government of the Republic of Slovenia adopted the Slovenian Development Strategy 2030 (Strategija razvoja Slovenije - SRS 2030), a framework document on national development that places quality of life for all18 at the forefront. The strategy incorporates globally agreed sustainable development goals as well as five strategic orientations and twelve interrelated development goals that lay down new long-term development foundations for Slovenia. As is emphasised in SRS 2030, Slovenia's future development will depend greatly on its ability to respond and adapt to trends and challenges in the global environment. Trends point to profound changes, especially in demographic trends, pressures on ecosystems, competition for global resources, and economic development. Co-operation and cohesion at global, European and national levels and cross-border co-operation are thus increasingly important. Slovenia is making steady progress in terms of quality of life and economic development and some environmental pressures have been reduced. Nonetheless, in many areas of economic, social and environmental development, it lags some way behind the most developed countries, with backlogs that vary from one region to another. In the decade preceding the outbreak of the 2008 crisis, Slovenia had achieved high economic growth; during this, however, many structural deficiencies indicated even before the crisis that the development model was unsustainable. During the crisis, GDP underwent a steep decline, which severely undermined economic stability and had a negative impact on the well-being of the population. In 2014, five years on, Slovenia started catching up with economically more developed countries, and the stability of the banking system and public finances, damaged in the crisis, was restored. Slovenia faces demographic changes that will have a major impact on the future development of society and the quality of life, namely the increase in the number of people over 65, the low fertility rate and the decrease in the population in the age group 20 to 64. The demographic changes also increase pressure on the financial sustainability of the social protection and pension systems. In recent years positive shifts have been achieved in reducing the burden on the environment, which is still overburdened by the Slovenian population through their lifestyle and production processes. Although greenhouse gas emissions declined in the context of lower economic activity during the crisis, nonetheless per unit of GDP their level remains higher than the EU average. Increased transit road traffic and overall non-sustainable mobility are particularly problematic for the environment. Total energy consumption is reduced on account of lower consumption in households and industry but remains relatively high per unit of GDP due to the high proportion of energy-intensive activities. Consequently, taking into account the dimension of the Energy Union, Slovenia will actively strive by 2030 to gradually decarbonise the energy-intensive industry and provide financial incentives for restructuring production processes with the introduction of green technologies. The Slovenian economy is above the EU average on the basis of its consumption of raw materials, which is reflected in its lower material efficiency and reduces its competitiveness. In some areas, such as the share of renewables and organic farming, Slovenia is more successful than the EU average. Slovenia also has favourable natural resources, coastal and marine resources and diverse biodiversity, but due to the inappropriate use of natural resources (especially in the areas of urbanisation, agriculture and water management), the conservation of species and their habitats is deteriorating.                                                            18  Strategy development of Slovenia 2030: http://www.vlada.si/fileadmin/dokumenti/si/projekti/2017/srs2030/Strategija_razvoja_Slovenije_2030.pdf. 17 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA  Adapting to climate change, the transition to a climate-neutral and circular economy that would enable competitiveness and the quality of life of the population while preserving natural resources calls for changes in production and consumption to more sustainable forms. A strategy addressing the five dimensions of the Energy Union In accordance with SRS 2030, Slovenia's central 2030 target is to ensure quality of life for all; which can be achieved through balanced economic, social and environmental development that respects the limitations and capabilities of the planet and creates the right conditions and opportunities for present and future generations. At the individual level, quality of life is reflected in good opportunities for work, education and creativity as part of a decent, safe and active existence in a healthy, clean environment while being included in democratic decision-making and the co-management of society. Slovenia's strategic orientations for achieving quality of life by 2030 are:  an inclusive, healthy, safe and responsible society,  learning for life and lifelong learning,  a highly productive economy that creates added value for all,  conservation of a healthy natural environment,  a high level of cooperation, competence and efficient management. Slovenian will implement the five strategic orientations for achieving the central target by means of activities in various interrelated and interdependent fields covered by the twelve development targets. Each target also relates to the sustainable development goals of Agenda 2030 and identifies key areas that will need to be addressed with a view to achieving quality of life for all. The targets provide the basis for the formulation of priorities and actions of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia, regional development actors, local communities and other stakeholders. In accordance with SRS 2030 and taking into account the dimension of the Energy Union, Slovenia's development guidelines up to 2030 will be transition to a low-carbon circular economy and sustainable management of natural resources. The long-term climate strategy (analysis period 2020 to 2050) will include a comprehensive analysis of various scenarios to contribute to EU and Member State commitments under the United Nations Framework Agreement on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, including the scenario for achieving zero net GHG emissions in the Union by 2050 and negative emissions beyond that year, and the impact of these scenarios on the rest of the global and EU carbon budget as a basis for discussing cost-effectiveness, efficiency and fairness in reducing GHG emissions. The NEPN update in 2023 and 2024 will also take into account new EU strategic and legislative decisions that will be drawn up and adopted under the European Green Deal. The expert bases for the Long-Term Climate Strategy up to 2050 and the NEPN have been drawn up in Slovenia in a coordinated manner. Slovenia will also draw up the Energy Concept of Slovenia (ECS) as a fundamental long-term development document in the area of energy that will set targets, on the basis of the country's economic, environmental and social development projections and international commitments, for achieving a secure, sustainable and competitive energy supply for the next 20 years and for a framework of 40 years. On the proposal of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia, the ECS will be adopted by resolution of the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia. The renewed ECS will have to be drawn up in accordance with the adopted long-term climate strategy, as it covers only part of the measures to achieve the objectives of the long-term climate strategy. A transparent table with key objectives, policies and measures of the plan The first draft of the NEPN was based on updated medium- and long-term forecasts of energy consumption up to 2020 and 2030 and all the action documents adopted by Slovenia prior to 2018. The final NEPN was drawn up in accordance with the comprehensively updated professional bases, consultations with a broader professional base and the general public, the findings of the 18 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA  environmental report and the results of regional consultation. As far as possible Slovenia also complied with the recommendations of the Commission or duly explained the parts of the recommendations that were not taken into account in the preparation of the final NEPN adopted by the Government of the Republic of Slovenia following the completion of the comprehensive environmental impact assessment in accordance with the Energy Act. The key objectives and contributions of NEPN across the five dimensions of the Energy Union are set out below. In the second chapter, the key objectives (GHG, RES and EEU) are broken down in more detail in accordance with individual scenarios. Table 1: Key objectives and contributions of Slovenia by 2030 KEY OBJECTIVES AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF SLOVENIA UP TO 2030 Improving energy and material efficiency in all sectors (and therefore REDUCING CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY AND OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES) is the first and key measure for the transition to a climate-neutral society. Decarbonisation: climate change mitigation and adaptation Reduce GHG emissions in sectors not covered by the trading scheme by 2030 as laid down by the Effort Sharing Regulation for Slovenia, i.e. by at least 20% compared to 2005, achieving the following sectoral targets: - transport: + 12 %, - general consumption:  76 %, - agriculture  1 %, - waste management:  65 %, - industry*:  43 %, - energy*:  34 %. * Only part of the sector not covered by the ETS. Ensure that LULUCF [Land Use Land Use Change and Forestry] sectors will not produce net emissions by 2030 (after applying accounting rules), i.e. emissions in the LULUCF sector will not exceed sinks. In the area of adaptation, reduce  exposure, sensitivity and vulnerability to climate change, and increase resilience and adaptive capabilities. To reduce the use of fossil energy sources and dependence on importing them by: - phasing out consumption of coal: by at least 30% by 2030, and the decision to phase out coal consumption in Slovenia in line with the principles of just transition by 2021, - a ban on the sale and installation of new fuel-oil boilers by 2023, - support for the implementation of pilot projects for the production of synthetic methane and hydrogen (the indicative target is a 10% share of renewable methane or hydrogen in the transmission and distribution network by 2030). Decarbonisation: renewable energy Reach at least a 27% share of renewables in energy end-use by 2030, i.e. (indicative): - at least 2/3 of energy consumption in buildings to come from RES by 2030 (the share of RES in end-use of energy products excluding electricity and district heating), - at least a 30% share of RES19 in industry, - 43% share in the electricity sector, - 41% share in the heating and cooling sector, - 21% share in transport (with a share of biofuels of at least 11%).                                                            19  Taking surplus heat  into account. 19 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA  Efficient energy use Improving energy and material efficiency in all sectors (and therefore reducing energy and other natural resources) as first key measure in the transition to a climate-neutral society. By 2030 improve energy efficiency by at least 35% compared to the 2007 baseline (in line with the Energy Efficiency Directive). Ensure systematic implementation of the policies and measures adopted so that the energy end-use does not exceed 54.9 TWh (4 717 ktoe). When converted to primary energy level, 2030 usage will not exceed 73.9 TWh (6 356 ktoe). Reduce final energy consumption in buildings by 20% by 2030 compared to 2005 and ensure the reduction of GHG emissions in buildings by at least 70% by 2030 compared to 2005. Energy security and the internal energy market Provide additional financial, human and technical resources to expedite the integrated development and management of the electricity distribution network to increase capacity, reinforce resistance to disruption and future development potential, boosting connectivity and adaptability, making it possible to exploit flexible sources and loads and expedite the incorporation of heat pumps, the roll-out of e-mobility and the integration of renewable electricity production and storage facilities. Slovenia's other energy security and internal energy market targets for 2030 are: - to ensure a reliable and competitive energy supply, - to maintain a high level of electricity interconnection with neighbouring countries, - at least 75% of electricity supply from sources in Slovenia by 2030 and by 2040, and ensuring an adequate level of security of electricity supply, - to continue to exploit nuclear energy and maintain excellence in the operation of nuclear facilities in Slovenia, - to reduce fossil fuel import dependency, - to increase electricity distribution network resilience to disruption - increase the share of the underground medium-voltage network from the current 35% to at least 50%, - further development of system services and the active role of clients, - development of energy storage technologies, infrastructure and services, - to establish a development-oriented regulatory framework to determine the amount of the network charge for the transition to a climate-neutral society, - to support the development of an efficient and competitive market for full use of the flexibility of the energy system and new technologies - support for cross-sectoral integration and implementation of new cross-sectoral system services, - to encourage development and research cooperation between companies in and outside the sector, - to ensure the further development of the pipeline system in accordance with the gas flows and system performance, including new sources of renewable gas and waste, - to prepare a regulatory and support environment for renewable gas alternatives in the natural gas network, while analysing and determining the maximum possible share of hydrogen in the natural gas network, - to support the implementation of pilot projects for the production of synthetic methane and hydrogen (with an indicative target 10% share of renewable methane or hydrogen in the transmission and distribution network by 2030), 20 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA  - to provide appropriate conditions to maximise the share of renewable energy stored and used, when and where necessary, and to maximise the capacity of RES generating facilities, - to enable the mitigation and reduction of energy poverty by accelerating the implementation of social policy measures, general housing policy measures and existing targeted measures. Research, innovation and competitiveness 2030 targets in the research, innovation and competitiveness dimension are: - to increase investment in R&D - at least 3% of GDP by 2030 (of which 1% of GDP is public funding), - to increase investment in human resources and new knowledge needed to move to a climate-neutral society, - to support businesses for an efficient and competitive transition to a climate-neutral and circular economy, - to stimulate targeted research projects and multidisciplinary R&D programmes and demonstration projects with the goal of achieving a climate-neutral society, in line with the direct interest of the economy or public sector, and meeting the country's development goals, in particular in the areas of energy efficiency, the circular economy and green energy technologies, - to incentivise businesses to finance and become involved in R&D programmes and demonstration projects by means of an active tax policy, - to promote new and bolster existing R&D programmes in line with the objectives of the NEPN and the Long-Term Climate Strategy, - to promote the use of digitisation for climate action and increase cyber security across all strategic systems, - to promote public and private sector R&D cooperation, - to create competitive conditions for innovative research work in public companies.     21 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA  1.2 Overview of current policy situation The goal of Slovenia's energy and climate policy is to ensure a reliable, secure and competitive energy supply in a sustainable way in such a way as to ensure the transition to a climate-neutral society and achieve sustainable development goals by, among other things, establishing an environment that stimulates economic development and creating jobs with high added value, improving the quality of life, increasing environmental responsibility and providing acceptable energy services for population and economy. The key challenges for Slovenia in the area of energy and climate policy are:  gradual reduction of energy consumption and increasing energy and material efficiency in all sectors,  accelerated development of the electricity distribution network for greater strength, resistance to disruption and future development potential, which will enable accelerated exploitation of resource and load flexibility, integration of heat pumps, fulfilment of requirements related to accelerated deployment of e-mobility and accelerated integration of renewable electricity generation facilities; it will be necessary to ensure financial resources for the additional investments of distribution companies and to ensure the sustainable setting of network charges,  efficient placement of infrastructure projects contributing to the goal of a climate-neutral society,  phasing out of fossil resources in all sectors,  sustainable transport management and transition to alternative fuels,  accelerated development of district heating and cooling systems,  decarbonisation of the natural gas supply and integration of the gas and electricity sectors,  maintaining the excellence and safe operation of nuclear facilities in Slovenia and drawing up guidelines for deciding on the future use of nuclear energy and the possible construction of a new nuclear power plant,  technological development and commercial breakthrough of RES, advanced technologies and services, including storage and efficient use of energy,  reducing the implementation deficit for all actors and at all levels for comprehensive and successful management and implementation of measures for the transition to a climate-neutral society. The main task of the future development of energy in Slovenia is to ensure a balance between the three fundamental pillars of energy policy, which are inextricably linked: climate sustainability, security of supply and competitiveness of the energy supply. Slovenia has undertaken in the long term to uphold the Paris Agreement commitments and, by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, to keep the global temperature rise below 2°C and to limit the rise in temperature to 1.5°C compared to the pre-industrial era. Slovenia ratified the Paris Agreement in 201620. In May 2019, the Government of the Republic of Slovenia endorsed the goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 2050. In terms of adaptation to climate change, in December 2016, Slovenia adopted a strategic framework for adaptation to climate change containing guidelines for adaptation to climate change in Slovenia. With this document, Slovenia established the vision that by 2050, society in Slovenia will                                                            20  Act ratifying the Paris Agreement, UL RS No 77/16. 22 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA  adapt and become resilient to climate change impacts with high quality and safety of life, fully exploiting the opportunities in a changing climate on the basis of sustainable development. The vision aims to reinforce the capacity to adapt to climate change, manage risks and exploit the opportunities presented by climate change, and its overall objective is to reduce exposure and vulnerability to the impact of climate change and to increase  resilience and adaptability. The objective of reducing GHG emissions is reflected in setting an ambitious and development-oriented share of RES in final use. The NEPN reaffirms the national target of at least a 27% share of RES by 2030 set by the SRS 2030 and actively seeks to create an appropriate structural environment and to stimulate the necessary changes that will enable Slovenia when updating the NEPN (2023 and 2024) to set a more ambitious target for the share of renewables by 2030. In the area of transport and transport infrastructure up to 2030, the fundamental document in Slovenia is the Transport Development Strategy in the Republic of Slovenia up to 203021. In recent years, many measures have already been carried out to develop rail infrastructure and public transport as well as in the area of sustainable mobility (measures detailed in Chapter 4). Energy efficiency measures have positive effects both for final consumers and the economy and also for the environment, while at the same time having particularly favourable macro-economic effects, such as stimulating economic growth, creating jobs and reducing dependency on fossil fuel imports. Promoting energy efficiency will reduce consumption and thus energy costs for consumers, will have a positive impact on human health and the economy, and the more efficient use of energy will boost competitiveness. Increasing energy efficiency (and hence reducing consumption) is Slovenia's first key measure for the transition to a climate-neutral society. Security of supply is one of the three fundamental pillars of energy policy and is inextricably linked to climate sustainability and competitiveness of the energy supply. To create a secure energy supply, Slovenia will, in a well-founded sustainable and economical fashion, ensure a sufficient supply of energy resources and sufficient capacity and diversification of supply routes, sufficiently powerful and regularly maintained networks, appropriate cross-border connections, and operationally reliable and efficient cooperation between energy systems, diverse sources of electricity and energy storage. Considering the size of Slovenia and EU energy policy, the integration of supply routes and resources in the region is very important for Slovenia. Having regard to climate change, maintaining the security of supply will be particularly emphasised in the electricity system. To achieve its ambitious energy and climate policy targets, Slovenia will ensure better conditions for accelerated development of the electricity distribution network conferring greater intensity, resistance to disruption, future development potential and exploitation of the flexibility of resources and loads, as the network represents a cornerstone of the future transition to a climate-neutral society, which alone will enable accelerated connection of heat pumps and the fulfilment of requirements related to accelerated deployment of e-mobility and accelerated integration of renewable energy generation facilities. Slovenia will endeavour as far as possible to reduce the use and importation of fossil energy sources by gradually phasing out fossil energy sources while focusing on increasing energy efficiency use and greater use of renewable and low-carbon sources. In accordance with decarbonisation projections, the share of renewables in the energy balances will increase. Slovenia's electricity connectivity was 83.6% in 2017, well above the 10% target for 2020 and the 15% target for 2030. Slovenia has several projects of common interest in the area of electricity and natural gas transmission. The natural gas transmission project is a transmission link between Slovenia and Hungary, which will create the missing pipeline connection between the two systems and enable the                                                            21  Available on the website: http://www.MZI.gov.si/si/dogodki/strategija_razvoja_prometa_v_rs/. 23 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA  transfer of gas from Hungary via Slovenia to Italy and vice versa, affording access to LNG terminals and underground storage facilities. A second project is to increase the bilateral capacity of the transmission link between the Slovenian-Croatian and Slovenian-Austrian interconnection for access to LNG terminals. In the area of research and innovation, in 2010 the Slovenian Government adopted the target of achieving by 2020 joint public-private investment in R&D amounting to 3% of GDP (with a target of 1% of GDP for the public investment). In the SRS 2030, whereby Slovenia also committed itself to implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Slovenia set itself two targets related to the research, innovation and competitiveness dimension in Slovenia:  a competitive and socially-responsible enterprise and research sector, including, among other things, a focus on environmentally-friendly technologies and eco-innovation, which as an important factor in the competitiveness of enterprises also contributes to reducing environmental burden as an important factor;  transition to a low-carbon circular economy as a priority development trajectory for the whole economy, breaking the link between economic growth and the growth in the use of raw materials and non-renewable energy sources and the associated increased environmental burden. Key issues of cross-border importance Slovenia is a small country, and its energy system is highly connected with those of neighbouring countries, in particular Italy, Austria and Croatia and, in terms of the construction of missing electricity and gas infrastructure, also with Hungary. With a view to increasing the volume of energy transmission within the energy system, a well-functioning integrated energy market at regional and EU level is essential for Slovenia. In addition, it should be noted that joint freight transport management in Slovenia and the wider region is one of the key issues of cross-border importance that Slovenia will address at neighbourhood, regional and EU level with the aim of seeking to limit freight traffic on roads also through inter-state cooperation. Knowledge of targets, energy policies and measures in neighbouring countries, as well as consultation and constructive cooperation on regional infrastructure issues, is extremely important for Slovenia. The administrative structure of the implementation of national energy and climate policies In Slovenia, the Ministry of Infrastructure is competent for energy matters and the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning for the environment, climate change and spatial planning. Many other ministries are involved in the implementation of the measures, especially in the area of climate policy. In order to support the drafting of the NEPN, an inter-departmental expert group of different ministries was therefore formed. The NEPN also provides for the establishment of an Energy and Climate Council as a government advisory body to monitor the implementation of the NEPN, i.e. the achievement of NEPN targets and the roll out of policies and instruments established therein, drawing up positions and recommendations for the Government of the Republic of Slovenia with regard to improvement of the implementation of the NEPN.    24 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA  1.3 Consultations and cooperation of national and Union entities and their outcome National parliamentary cooperation In May 2019, the Ministry of Infrastructure presented the starting points and first results of the NEPN projections to the members of the National Assembly (NA) Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Spatial Planning. In August 2019, in accordance with the decisions of the National Assembly Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Spatial Planning adopted on 10 April 2019, the Government of the Republic of Slovenia submitted a report to the National Assembly on the preparation and adoption of the NEPN. The Government of the Republic of Slovenia, which in accordance with the Energy Act adopts the NEPN, will keep the National Assembly informed as appropriate regarding the adopted NEPN. Cooperation of local and regional authorities Organisations representing local communities were invited, in the same way as other stakeholders, to the preliminary and final rounds of consultation on the drafting of the NEPN. In the first round of consultation, in March and April 2019, comments were submitted by the Community of Municipalities of Slovenia22 and, in the second, also by some municipalities, e.g. the Municipality of Ljubljana23. The National Council, comprising 40 council members including 22 local community representatives, is also kept informed of the preparation and adoption of the NEPN. Consultations with stakeholders, including social partners, and involvement of civil society and the general public In accordance with the Regulation, in Slovenia the NEPN is drafted in such a way as to enable the public to participate effectively in the process24. To that end, an NEPN website was set up, where for public information purposes all information on the drafting of the NEPN is published. Reasonable deadlines for the public to participate and express their views are set. A multi-level climate and energy dialogue has also been set up in which local authorities, civil society organisations, the business community, investors and other stakeholders and the general public can actively participate. The public consultation on the drafting of the NEPN comprised three phases: 1. the preliminary consultation on the drafting of the NEPN was held in March and April 2019: all interested stakeholders, i.e. local authorities, civil society organisations, the business community, investors and other stakeholders and the general public, were invited to a public consultation and dialogue, with contributions on prepared questions25;  2. communication workshops aimed at targeted consultation and expert dialogue on specific NEPN content were conducted in 2019 in coordination with the LIFE CLIMATE PATH 2050 project and                                                            22  The Community of Municipalities of Slovenia contribution is available at: https://www.energetika- portal.si/fileadmin/dokumenti/publikacije/nepn/predhodno_posvetovanje/11-sos.pdf. 23  All comments received and suggestions made in the framework of the public consultation on NEPN 5.0 and the environmental report relating to it are available on the NEPN website at: https://www.energetika-portal.si/dokumenti/strateski-razvojni-dokumenti/nacionalni-energetski-in-podnebni-nacrt/dogodki-zakljucno-posvetovanje/pripombe-jo/. 24  The NEPN website is available at: https://www.energetika-portal.si/dokumenti/strateski-razvojni- dokumenti/nacionalni-energetski-in-podnebni-nacrt/. 25  Further information on the preliminary consultation is available at: https://www.energetika- portal.si/dokumenti/strateski-razvojni-dokumenti/nacionalni-energetski-in-podnebni-nacrt/dogodki-predhodno-posvetovanje/. 25 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA  the preparation of the Long-Term Climate Strategy led by the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning26;  3. the final consultation on the drafting of the NEPN was held after obtaining the favourable opinion of the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning on the acceptability of the NEPN and the environmental report, i.e. in January and February when both documents were publicly presented, and public consultation was held with all interested stakeholders, whose opinions and comments were then taken into account as far as possible in drawing up the final NEPN (Version 5.0) and the environmental report27.  Consultation with the other Member States On 4 July 2019 in Ljubljana, Slovenia organised a regional consultation with neighbouring countries on the preparation of the NEPN. Representatives from Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Slovenia and the Commission attended the regional meeting of experts involved in the preparation of the NEPN, while representatives of Italy participated via video conference. Slovenia set the goals of the first regional consultation in agreement with the representatives of the neighbouring countries:  meeting and networking between experts from different countries and different ministries actively involved in the preparation of the NEPN,  overview of the status and progress of NEPN preparation, exchange of information and views,  identification of the central challenges and opportunities for regional cooperation with neighbouring countries in the preparation and implementation of the NEPN. The national representatives and experts involved in the preparation of the NEPN confirmed their interest in further regional consultation and cooperation. In particular, they indicated as a particular aim of consultation: the exchange of good practices and cooperation in the area of alternative fuels, in particular synthetic gases, in the area of joint transport management, RES projects and energy efficiency, small islands as laboratories for RES deployment, smart grids, cross-border infrastructure projects, soft education and awareness measures, efficient integration of electricity markets and governance and energy poverty. Slovenia drew up a summary of the exchange of views and consultations and collected and briefly outlined the common challenges and opportunities for further regional consultation and cooperation, which will also serve as a starting point for future bilateral and multilateral consultations and the promotion of regional cooperation between participating countries.28 Cooperation with the Commission Slovenia actively participates in the work of the NEPN Technical Preparation Team under the guidance of the Commission and strives for constructive cooperation with both the Commission and the other EU Member States in the preparation of the draft NEPN, with fair distribution of burdens and respect for relevant national obstacles and circumstances. In its ongoing cooperation with the Commission on several levels and on multiple occasions, including bilateral exchanges, Slovenia has emphasised that one of the most important areas of NEPN is the determination of the share of renewables, noting the Commission's obligation in assessment of the                                                            26  More information on communication workshops is available at: https://www.energetika-portal.si/dokumenti/strateski- razvojni-dokumenti/nacionalni-energetski-in-podnebni-nacrt/komunikacijske-delavnice/. 27  More information will be available on the NEPN website at: https://www.energetika-portal.si/dokumenti/strateski-razvojni- dokumenti/nacionalni-energetski-in-podnebni-nacrt/zakljucno-posvetovanje/. 28  More information on the regional consultation and all materials are available on the NEPN website: https://www.energetika-portal.si/dokumenti/strateski-razvojni-dokumenti/nacionalni-energetski-in-podnebni-nacrt/regionalno- posvetovanje/. 26 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA  share of renewables in accordance with the Regulation (Article 31(2)) to also take into account the indicative formula as well as the specific circumstances indicated by Member States in the draft NEPN. On 18 June, the Commission published an assessment of the Member States' draft NEPNs up to 2030, examining the projected joint contribution of the Member States towards achieving the 2030 targets of the Energy Union and the EU29. Whereas, on the one hand, Slovenia finds that the Commission has given Slovenia a clear and particularly welcome recommendations that contributed significantly to the comprehensive updating of the NEPN draft, on the other Slovenia finds that, in its assessment, the Commission recommends a greater share of renewables, namely 37%, based solely on application of the formula in Annex 2, which is only indicative, while clearly the Commission did not take into account specific circumstances as recorded in the draft NEPN, despite the fact that, under Article 31(2) of the Regulation, the Commission should make its recommendations based not only on application of the formula but also taking into account the specific national circumstances indicated by Slovenia in the draft NEPN. The Commission also highlighted certain aspects of Slovenia draft NEPN as an example of good practice, singling out, among other things, the area of transport, as Slovenia identified specific measures in the draft NEPN, including quantification of the required charging infrastructure, and the area of adaptation, where the draft NEPN also identifies adaptation targets and measures. Slovenia has thoroughly examined the Commission's recommendations and in the update of the NEPN has taken them into account almost in their entirety or, in the event of non-compliance, has, in accordance with the Regulation, provided due justification.                                                             29  The Commission Recommendations are available on the NEPN website: https://www.energetika-portal.si/dokumenti/strateski- razvojni-dokumenti/nacionalni-energetski-in-podnebni-nacrt/dokumenti/#c965.
