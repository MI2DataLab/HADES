422 NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS2.1 Dimension decarbonisation2.1.1 GHG emissions and removalsi. The elements set out in point (a)(1) of Article 4ii. Where applicable, other national objectives and targets consistent with the Paris Agreement and the existing long-term strategies. Where applicable for the contribution to the overall Union commitment of reducing the GHG emissions, other objectives and targets, including sector targets and adaptation goals, if availableAccording to the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), Finland should, by 2030, reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in the effort sharing sector by 39 % compared to 2005 levels. This corresponds to a permitted amount of a 20.6 Mt CO2 equivalent in 2030. However, if flexibility measures are used, the emissions may be higher. The binding target imposed by the EU will be achieved following a linear trajectory established for cutting emissions over the period 2021Œ2030. The need to reduce emissions will increase towards the end of the period. The starting point of the emissions reduction trajectory is determined on the basis of the average emissions between 2016 and 2018, and calculation of the trajectory will begin from June 2019. Final certainty about the starting point will be obtained in 2020. Based on the current estimation, the starting point is at the level of about 30.2 Mt CO2 equivalent. The annual emissions allocations in tonnes will be determined in a delegated act issued later.43Finland will take advantage of the 2 % one-off possibility to cancel ETS allowances towards the target in the effort sharing sector. The maximum annual flexibility set for Finland is 0.7 Mt CO2 equivalent. The LULUCF flexibility mechanism included in the Commission™s proposal has not been taken into account because of the uncertainty related to it. Finland will include the reporting information on utilising LULUCF flexibility as soon as it becomes available. Finland may use the other flexibility mechanisms such as transfers between years and emissions trading between the Member States if necessary.Under the regulation concerning the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector, a Member State must ensure that the accounted total emissions in the sector will not exceed the accounted sinks over the periods 2021Œ2025 and 2026Œ2030. The accounting is applied to the following land-use categories: deforestation, afforestation, managed forest land, managed cropland and grasslands. By 15 March 2027 and by 15 March 2032, Finland will submit the LULUCF compliance report including the balance of total accounted emissions and removals for the period from 2021 to 2025 and from 2026 to 2030 and, where applicable, details on the intention to use or on the use of the flexibilities and related amounts. The Commission will make an assessment of the inclusion of wetlands in the LULUCF sector for the period 2026Œ2030. Over the period 2021Œ2030, Finland will be able to use the country-specific flexibility of 10 Mt CO2 to reach the target.For the managed forest land category, Member States shall calculate a Forest Reference Level (FRL), against which the net removals or accounted emissions from managed forest land are accounted. The FRL consists of a projection of the managed forest land sink assuming that the forest management practices of the reference period (2000Œ2009) are continued during the compliance period (2021Œ2025). Based on the feedback from the LULUCF Expert Group and the recommendations of the Commission (Commission Staff Working Document SWD(2019) 213 final), Finland recalculated its FRL and revised its National Forestry Accounting Plan (NFAP) submission, paying particular attention to the consistency of the model estimate with the data in the GHG inventory. The proposed FRL for managed forest land for the period 2021Œ2025, as detailed in the revised NFAP submission, is -21.16 Mt CO2 equivalent, excluding harvested wood products (HWP) and 27.64 Mt CO2 equivalent including HWP.44The Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) has updated the long-term scenarios and greenhouse gas projections for the LULUCF sector based on new data on forest growth and revised growth model assumptions. According to the revised WEM estimate, the LULUCF net sink would be -20.1 Mt CO2 equivalent in 2025. Retaining the LULUCF net sink on this level could enable reaching carbon neutrality by 2035.Other national objectives and goals aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions include the objectives outlined in the National Energy and Climate Strategy to ban the use of coal in energy production by 2030 and to halve the domestic consumption of mineral oil (petrol, diesel oil, light and heavy fuel oils and aviation fuels) compared to 2005 levels by 2030. On 1 April 2019, an Act banning the use of coal for energy generation in 2029 was passed. The ban will apply as of 1 May 2029 and incentives for energy utilities to implement the change already by 2025 are being prepared. Halving the use of oil, in turn, will support the reduction of emissions in the effort sharing sector.The objectives and measures for promoting the use of transport biofuels and other renewable energy sources in transport have been included in the National Energy and Climate Strategy, the Medium-term Climate Change Policy Plan and in Finland™s plan compliant with the Directive on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure (2014/94/EU). The aim is to increase the share of transport biofuels in all transport fuels consumed in Finland to 30 % by 2030. Another objective is to bring the number of electricity-powered cars in Finland to at least 250,000 and the number of gas-powered cars to 50,000 by 2030.Figure 2 shows Finland™s greenhouse gas emissions in 2000Œ2017 and the projected development in the With Additional Measures (WAM) projection until 2040. The WAM projection includes a set of cost-efficient additional energy and climate policy measures that are included in the Energy and Climate Strategy and in the Medium-term Climate Change Policy Plan in order to reach the targets specified in the 2015 Government Programme and adopted in the EU for 2030. The WAM projection includes new measures in addition to the existing measures implemented by 1 January 2018. Measures implemented after the 1 January 2018 are WAM measures.45Figure 2.

The government resolution on a National Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2022 was adopted in 2014. The objective of this plan is for Finnish society to have the capacity to adapt to climate change and manage the associated risks. The measures introduced by the plan help to mitigate the adverse consequences of climate change, including those impacting human safety and living conditions, the natural environment, livelihoods and functions vital to society. Climate change adaptation policy is implemented cost-effectively by mainstreaming adaptation into normal planning and decision-making processes in different sectors. The objective of the Plan is to provide actors with access to the requisite methods for assessing and managing climate risks and that society™s ability to adapt is improved, innovative solutions promoted and awareness of climate change adaptation disseminated by means of research and development, communications and training. The National Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2022 14 https://mmm.fi/documents/1410837/5120838/MMM-_193086-v1-Finland_s_National_climate_Change_Adaptation_Plan_2022.pdf/582041ee-3518-4a63-bf60-7133aed95a9c/MMM-_193086-v1-Finland_s_National_climate_Change_Adaptation_Plan_2022.pdf46is part of the climate change policy planning system complying with the Climate Change Act.Adaptation to climate change has been taken into consideration in the energy modelling efforts related to policy preparation. Due to climate change, rainfall and average outdoor temperature are expected to increase. Higher precipitation will lead to increased potential of hydropower production. The projections assume a hydropower production increase of 5 % in 40 years due to higher precipitation. One drawback of higher rainfall in the summer is that it can hamper peat extraction.It is estimated that increasing windiness will also increase Finland™s wind power potential. There is little information about how climate change will affect solar energy, although some estimates suggest that solar energy may be reduced as a consequence of greater cloudiness.In relation to bioenergy production, it is essential to examine the changes and risks in the availability of bioenergy. In Finland, biomass supply is estimated to increase due to a longer growing season and improved potential productivity, hence increasing e.g. the potential for forest biomass both for industry and energy production. On the other hand, climate change is expected to increase the prevalence of heavy rain and shorter periods of snow and frost, which affect forest management. As a whole, varying weather conditions pose challenges to forest harvesting. Variable weather conditions may also affect the availability and transport of energy wood. Similarly, weather conditions might affect, for example, the quality of forest chips used in energy production, i.e. the moisture content of forest chips. From the point of view of preparedness, the adequacy and availability of solid wood fuels is particularly important in winter, when the demand for heating is greatest.Average temperatures will increase in the future as winters become milder and summers become hotter. It is estimated that the amount of energy needed for heating in winter will decrease more than the increase in energy needed for cooling in summer. Consequences of increasing temperature on the heating need in buildings have been estimated by the Finnish Meteorological Institute and Finnish 47Environment Institute 15 and are included in the projections. In total for the whole building stock, the net heating energy need is projected to decreases by 0.3Œ0.4 % a year, being 3.7 % less in 2030 and 6.7 % less in 2040 compared to 2020.Chapter 3.3 on energy security describes one measure to adapt to climate change, namely making the electricity distribution network more resilient against extreme weather conditions.2.1.2 Renewable energyi. The elements set out in point (a)(2) of Article 4The national renewable energy target set for 2030 in the National Energy and Climate Strategy (2016) is 50 % of the gross final energy consumption. However, according to the Commission recommendation, this is slightly below the share of 51 % that results from the formula in Annex II of the Governance Regulation. Based on the Commission™s feedback, Finland has assessed the recommendation and the market development in the energy sector. Due to recent good development in the field of renewable energy and especially in wind power, the slightly higher target could be achieved. Therefore, Finland sets a 51 % share for Finland™s national contribution to the Union™s binding target of 32 % of renewable energy in compliance with the Renewable Energy Directive.Table 3 shows the indicative minimum levels for intermediate years concerning the renewable energy target until 2030. The indicative development meets the minimum requirement for the national development of renewable energy described in point (a)(2) of Article 4 of the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union.15 Rakennusten energiankulutuksen perusskenaario Suomessa 2015Œ2050.

Estimated trajectories for the sectoral share of renewable energy in final energy consumption from 2021 to 2030 in the electricity, heating and cooling, and transport sectorFigure 3 and Table 4 show the estimated development in the WAM projection of the overall renewable energy share (RES overall) as well as sector-specific shares of final energy consumption for the electricity (RES-E), heating and cooling (RES-H&C) and transport sectors (RES-T). For the calculation of the numerator of the indicator RES-T, renewable electricity supplied to road vehicles is considered to be four times its energy content and 1.5 times when supplied to rail transport. When calculating the numerator of RES-T, the amount of biofuels for transport produced from feedstock listed in Annex IX of the Renewable Energy Directive is considered to be twice its energy content. In the WAM projection, the total share of liquid biofuels in road transport increases from 18 % in 2021 to 30 % in 2030 in accordance with the quota obligation set in national legislation16, where double counting ends after 2020. In 2020, the total share of liquid biofuels is assumed to be 13.5 %. In the WAM projection, the amount of biofuels produced from feedstock listed in Annex IX is assumed to increase linearly from 6.5 % of all liquid road transport fuel in 2020 to 10 % in 2030. As stipulated in the Renewable Energy Directive for indicator RES-T, the average share of electricity from renewable sources of the two years prior to the year in question is used in the calculation of the share of renewable electricity in the electricity supplied to road and rail vehicles.16 Laki biopolttoaineiden käytön edistämisestä liikenteessä annetun lain muuttamisesta (419/2019) https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2019/20190419 https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2019/20190419490 %10 %20 %30 %40 %50 %60 %70 %2021202220232024202520262027202820292030RESRES-ERES-H&CRES-TFigure 3.

Estimated trajectories by renewable energy technology that the Member State projects to use to achieve the overall and sectorial trajectories for renewable energy from 2021 to 2030, including expected total gross final energy consumption per technology and sector in Mtoe and total planned installed capacity (divided by new capacity and repowering) per technology and sector in MWiv. Estimated trajectories on bioenergy demand, disaggregated between heat, electricity and transport, and on biomass supply by feedstocks and origin (distinguishing between domestic production and imports). For forest biomass, an assessment of its source and impact on the LULUCF sinkTable 5 describes the production and use of renewable energy, grouped by technology and by sector. The figures in the table represent the estimated amounts of gross final energy consumption in the WAM projection, not that of total primary energy or fuel amounts. The estimates for the transport sector correspond to the actual energy content of the energy source without any coefficients. Table 5 also shows the estimated development of bioenergy in the heating, electricity and transport sectors.The electricity and heating markets are competed industries and the central government does not therefore have a plan on how the installed capacity of each technology will develop in the future. However, assuming 3,200 peak load hours, the wind power volume in the WAM projection in 2030 would equal an installed capacity of 5,500 MW. This is 2.7 times the installed capacity at the end of 2018. Equally, assuming 900 peak load hours for solar power, the WAM projection generation volume in 2030 would equal an installed capacity of 1,200 MW, which is tenfold the installed capacity at the end of 2018. The installed hydropower capacity is currently 3,200 MW and no significant change is expected in the coming years.51Table 5.

Bioenergy production is largely integrated into forestry and forest industries. In recent years, energy derived from wood fuels has accounted for around one fourth of Finland™s total energy consumption. A major share of wood fuels is derived from wastes and residues of the forest industry, including black liquor originating in the pulp-making process and bark, sawdust and other industrial wood residues. Also forest chips Œ or in other words logging residues or other low value biomass from silvicultural and harvesting operations Œ are used for energy production. Table 6 shows the amounts of biomass by type used as primary energy in the WAM projection.As a result of the positive trend in the forest industries, more wastes and residues (black liquor, sawdust, bark, etc.) are available for energy production. In recent 52years, the growth in the consumption of wood fuels in Finland has been based especially on an increase in burning forest industry by-products and wood residues.Wood-based fuels are predicted to be black liquor and other concentrated liquors, sawdust, bark and other industrial wood by-products created in connection with the forest industries and wood processing. Based on this, the share of wood-based fuels based on imports in all wood-based fuels in Finland is predicted to remain small, only a few per cent.The energy and climate projections estimate that, at the level in 2030, the amount of forest chips in heat and electricity production will rise to about 24 TWh, which corresponds to about 12 million cubic metres per year, about 1.5 times the current level. We can assume that most of the forest chips will consist of small-diameter stems gathered in connection with the management of young forests. The remainder is expected to consist of logging residues from regeneration felling and, to a minor extent, of stumps.Table 6.

LULUCF accounting in the period of 2021Œ2030 is based on IPCC guidelines, respectively assuming instant oxidation of forest management residues.v. Where applicable, other national trajectories and objectives, including those that are long term or sectorial (e.g. share of renewable energy in district heating, renewable energy use in buildings, renewable energy produced by cities, energy communities and self-consumers, energy recovered from the sludge acquired through the treatment of wastewater)53Article 24 in the Renewable Energy Directive encourages Member States to increase the share of renewable energy and waste heat and cold in district heating and cooling. Figure 4 shows the historical as well as expected future development of district heat from renewable energy sources and waste heat. Today, fossil fuels are used to produce slightly more than half of the district heating.Article 24.10 states that Member States shall not be required to apply paragraphs 2 to 9 of Article 24 if its share of efficient district heating and cooling systems constitutes over 90 % of total sales of its district heating and cooling. According to current calculations, the share of efficient district heating systems of total sales will exceed the threshold of 90 % in Finland, which means that Finland will be obliged to implement only paragraph 1 of Article 24. However, Finland considers the aim of increasing the share of renewable and waste heat in district heating important and measures are addressed towards this end. Also the district heating companies are actively seeking new opportunities to cut down on their use of fossil fuels.A quota obligation has been introduced for light fuel oil used for heating. The obligation for bio liquids will be a 10 % share in 2028. With the exception of light fuel oil used for heating, no other sector-specific targets have been set for heating and cooling produced using renewable energy.The Government Programme sets the target of phasing out fossil fuel oil in heating by the beginning of the 2030s. Oil heating will no longer be used in properties owned by central and local governments after 2024. There are plans to adopt a separate action plan to encourage properties using oil heating to switch to other forms of heating during the 2020s.On 1 April 2019, an Act banning the use of coal in energy production as from 1 May 2029 was passed. The ban will reduce the use of coal by an estimated 3 TWh compared to market-based development without the ban. Phasing out coal will have a notable impact on the district heating sector, because in Finland coal is used mainly in combined heat and power (CHP) plants. A special incentive package to support replacement investments is under preparation for those district heating companies in towns and cities that phase out the use of coal as early as 2025.The Government Programme indicates that heat pumps generating heat for district heating networks will be transferred to the lower category of electricity tax, which 54is mainly applied to energy intensive industries. This change should have a positive effect on the utilisation of waste heat.Together with already existing measures and the new abovementioned plans, Finland will increase the share of renewable energy and waste heat in the heating and cooling sector in line with Article 23 in REDII.2005201020152020202520300 %10 %20 %30 %40 %50 %60 %70 %80 %90 %100 %District heat by energy sourceNon-renewableWaste heatRenewableFigure 4.
