2.4. Dimension internal energy market 2.4.1. Electricity interconnectivity i. The level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030 in consideration of the electricity interconnection target for 2030 of at least 15%, with a strategy with the level from 2021 onwards defined in close cooperation with affected Member States, taking into account the 2020 interconnection target of 10 % and the following indicators of the urgency of action: 1) the price differential on the wholesale market exceeding an indicative threshold of EUR 2/MWh between Member States, regions or bidding zones; 2) the nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30 % of peak load; 3) the nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30 % of installed renewable energy production capacity. According to the assessments of the Romanian transmission system operator, Romania meets the indicators for peak load (recording between 66 % and 75 % in the ratio between current interconnection and peak load capacities depending on the projection scenario) and installed renewable energy capacity (indicator ranging between 30 % and 44 % depending on the RES scenario). Romania proposes to supplement the interconnection capacities by 2030 having regard to the cost-benefit analyses from the social-economic and environment viewpoint and projects where potential benefits exceed costs are to be implemented. At the same time, Romania will also provide for the maximisation of the offered interconnection capacities under the primary and secondary law and by completing the projects related to the closure of the 400 kV national ring (internal lines). The implementation of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and the completion of the other electricity transmission grid development projects, which are included in the Electricity Transmission Grid (ETG) Development Plan for 2018-2027, will significantly contribute to the achievement of an electricity grid interconnection rate of at least 15.4 % by 2030.  Moreover, CNTEE Transelectrica has developed an action plan in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electricity, which provides for a minimum available capacity for cross-border trade of 70 % of the transmission capacity, within the allowances of safety in operation after consideration of contingencies.  Therefore, having regard to the projects included in the ETG Development Plan for 2018-2027 and to the resulting estimations, Romania will reach an interconnection rate of at least 15.4 % of the total installed capacity by 2030.   The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         2.4.2. Power transmission infrastructure i. Key electricity and gas transmission infrastructure projects, and, where relevant, modernisation projects, that are necessary for the achievement of objectives and targets under the five dimensions of the Energy Union Strategy The key electricity and gas transmission infrastructure projects are set out in Chapter 4.5.2.ii.  ii. Where applicable, main infrastructure projects envisaged in addition to Projects of Common Interest (PCIs)23 The main grid development projects (with the exception of PCIs), as communicated by CNTEE Transelectrica, are the following:       Arad);  connection of OPL of 400 kV Stupina  Varna (Bulgaria) entry to  exit from the 400kV station in Medgidia through a 400 kV d.c.

OPL St창lpu   The development of smart energy systems, grids and storage outside the TEN-E will be sought for the optimum operation of the energy system. In this context, the following investment priorities have been identified:  the digitisation of the national energy system on the transmission, distribution and consumption segments and the introduction of smart management systems and support measures for the gradual implementation of the smart city concept;  strengthening of the electricity transmission and distribution grids in order to ensure the required technical parameters for good interconnection with the trans-European energy infrastructure for electricity;  smart equipment and systems to ensure the quality of electricity;  the implementation of digital solutions to contain breakdowns and to re-supply power to the rural and urban area;                                                  23 In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2013 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and repealing Decision No 1364/2006/EC and amending Regulations (EC) No 713/2009, (EC) No 714/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 (OJ L 115, 25.4.2013, p. 39). The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          digitisation of transformer stations and solutions for remote grid control - integration of stations in SCADA;  implementation of solutions for storage of electricity in order to improve consumption and to recover major output fluctuations;  increase in the available capacity for cross-border trade;  measures to increase the adequacy of the national electricity grid in order to enhance the integration capacity for the energy produced from renewable sources, which is variable in nature. The selected fields (applicable at transmission and distribution network level) will also be supported by providing for access to structural funds under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF) under the new Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. 2.4.3. Market integration i. National objectives related to other aspects of the internal energy market such as increasing system flexibility, in particular related to the promotion of competitively determined electricity prices in line with relevant sectoral law, market integration and coupling, aimed at increasing the tradeable capacity of existing interconnectors, smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, and real-time price signals, including a timeframe for when the objectives shall be met Objectives concerning the promotion of competitively determined electricity prices Romania aims at deregulating the internal energy and gas markets in order to ensure harmonisation with the Community acquis. The calendar proposes staged liberalisation to ensure that the impact of transition on the consumer is low, as much as possible. Moreover, the liberalisation measures are purposed to develop a legislative framework that is favourable for investments that will contribute to energy security, also enhancing the flexibility of the national energy system. Therefore, Romania plans to complete the liberalisation of the electricity market by the end of 2020, and of the natural gas market by 30 June 2020.  Market integration and coupling Aiming at achieving the priority objective of integration in the internal market, Romania will continue the process of integration of the day-ahead and intra-day electricity markets under the pan-European Single Day-Ahead Coupling - SDAC and the Single Intra-Day Coupling - SIDC, having regard to the methodology of implicit allocation of the cross-border flow-based capacities applicable to the CORE region (implementation term: according to the roadmaps of the projects implementing the provisions of relevant EU regulations), to which it belongs, and without opting out the early implementation of the NTC-based single coupling of electricity markets.  day-ahead and intra-day coupling of markets (SDAC and SIDC) as a Member State, such approach emerging from the need to ensure compliance with EU regulations.  Moreover, Romania will continue to collaborate with the contracting parties of the Energy Community in the context of their accession to SDAC and SIDC, however this process will The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         depend on the evolution of the process of determination of market mechanisms in the Balkan area.  Smart grids The digitisation of the Romanian energy system, including transmission and distribution grids (smart grids), plays an essential role in reducing own technological consumption (OTC) and in -for-of integration of additional renewable energy production). In order to achieve this objective, Romania aims at implementing the smart grid concept, including by large-scale introduction of smart meters. The introduction of smart measurement systems in the energy sector is a national priority as a first step in the digitisation of the infrastructure. Smart metering is recognised for its benefits for final consumers, utilities companies and the whole energy system, including benefits for the environment, by enhancing energy efficiency and the RES integration in the NES.  Aggregation From 2020 onward, the day-ahead and intra-day markets are organised such as to ensure that all market participants can have access to the market individually or by aggregation. Final consumers may thus participate in organised electricity markets either directly or by aggregation if they have power above 500 kW approved in the connection certificate. If they have such approved power up to 500 kW inclusive, final consumers may participate in organised electricity markets excluding aggregation. Mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment As regards the objectives concerning dispatchable consumption (demand response), Romania has already introduced a secondary legislative framework regarding:  the obligation of TSO to offer dynamic transmission tariffs, at the request of final consumers connected to the ETG, from 2019 onward;  the obligation of DSO to offer dynamic distribution tariffs, at the request of users or their suppliers, from 2020 onward. ii. National objectives with regard to ensuring electricity system adequacy, as well as for the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met The abovementioned objectives have been approached in Chapter 2.3. iv. The deadlines for achievement of the objectives depend on the updating and accuracy of the available information (in particular as regards the feasibility of proposed projects) and the timeframe for most of them is the trajectory set in the Governance Regulation (2022, 2025, 2027 and 2030). iii. Where applicable, national objectives to protect energy consumers and improve the competitiveness of the retail energy sector Romania has implemented all the legislative provisions entitling final consumers to choose/change their supplier without additional costs with prior notice of 21 calendar days. At the same time, suppliers are prohibited from withdrawing from the supply contracts.  As regards the treatment of complaints, the regulatory authority has implemented a series of legislative acts (e.g. performance standard for supply of electricity and natural gas) regarding The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         the management of relevant conflicts arising at the pre-contractual stage and during the implementation of contracts.  2.4.4. Energy poverty i. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to energy poverty, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met objectives for energy poverty in accordance with the national specificity. Member States having a significant number of households in energy poverty must include in their integrated national energy and climate plans an indicative objective to reduce energy poverty.   According to the Eurostat data for 2019, Romania is listed in the lower third of the electricity price for household consumers in the EU. However, considering the relatively low purchase power, the affordability of the price is a prime issue that leads to a high rate of energy poverty. In order to measure the energy poverty rate as accurately as possible at EU Member State level, the EU Energy Poverty Observatory provides for the use of main indicators and values are sourced in the Eurostat databases. The indicators for which sufficient data exists at country and EU level are the rate of arrears on utility bills and the inability to keep home adequately warm. In Romania, 14.4 % of the households recorded arrears on utility bills in 2018. By comparison, the EU average was 6.6 % in the same year. The trend in the indicator for Romania and the EU for the period 2010-2018 is presented in the below table. Table 13 - Arrears on utility bills [%], 2010-2018  2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 EU average 9.1 9.0 9.9 10.2 9.9 9.1 8.1 7.0 6.6 Romania 26.5 27.3 29.7 29.7 21.5 17.4 18.0 15.9 14.4 Source: Eurostat, Arrears on utility bills - EU-SILC survey [ilc_mdes01] The inability to keep home adequately warm is another indicator that quantifies the share of 2010-2018 in the below table. Table 14 - Inability to keep home adequately warm [%], 2010-2018  2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 EU average 9.5 9.8 10.8 10.7 10.2 9.4 8.7 7.8 7.3 Romania 20.1 15.6 15.0 14.7 12.9 13.1 13.8 11.3 9.6 Source: Eurostat, Inability to keep home adequately warm - EU-SILC survey [ilc_mdes01] The comparison of indicators shows, on the one hand, the progress of Romania in the combating of energy poverty and outlines, on the other hand, the need to recover the lagging behind the EU average. The national objective in this regard is thus to reduce the energy poverty rate and to ensure the protection of the vulnerable consumer in order to safeguard human rights, considering that the EU average rate for 2015 was achieved.
