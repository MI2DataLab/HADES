Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030     3.2 Energy-efficiency dimension Policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy-efficiency contribution for 2030, including planned measures and instruments to promote the energy performance of buildings, specifically with regard to the following: i. Energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative policy measures under Article 7a and 7b of Directive 2012/27/EU and to be established in accordance with Appendix III For the period of 2014-2020, the Netherlands opted to take an alternative approach to meeting the requirements of Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED).86 During the 2021-2030 period, the Netherlands also aims to take an alternative approach and use various policy instruments in order to meet the national energy savings target. This is explained in more detail in Appendix 3, in accordance with Appendix III to the Regulation. Below is a description of the most important policy measures. A number of existing policy measures will be continued after 2020:  Introduction of the Environment and Planning Act as the successor to the Environmental Management Act: obligation for companies and institutions with an annual consumption as of 50,000 kWh electricity or 25,000 m³ natural gas or equivalent, to take all energy saving measures with a payback period of five years or less. The implementation of the Environment and Planning Act is currently being elaborated as part of the Climate Agreement. In updating the Environmental Management Act (Wet Milieubeheer), the government is focusing on an integrated climate approach, in which both energy-saving measures and other CO2 reduction measures are possible.  Energy tax and the Surcharge for Sustainable Energy (ODE):tax on electricity and gas consumption within all sectors. The ODE is levied on top of the energy tax.  Energy investment deduction: (EIA):continuous tax scheme for tax deduction of investments in energy efficiency. Agreement has been reached with the Climate Agreement on the proposed package of measures to achieve a 49% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.87 This concerns both new policy measures and adjustments to existing policy measures, which will be further elaborated in the coming period. The most important proposed policy measures (in the built-up environment, industry and agriculture and land use sectors) for achieving the energy saving requirement in Article 7 are listed below. Other measures have been included in Chapter 3.1.1. Built-up environment Policy for the built-up environment sector follows the broad lines described below: (a) Sliding-scale energy taxation The energy tax will be adjusted to create a greater incentive for increased sustainability because investments in sustainability will pay for themselves faster. Tax on natural gas is rising, while tax on electricity is falling. Additional funds collected in this way are returned via the tax reduction and a lower energy tax rate of the first tranche of electricity. Households will benefit more from this than companies, thus providing a reduction in the burden on households. This also applies to households that are not yet able or willing to invest in increased sustainability. In 2023, we will consider whether the proposed increase in the energy tax on natural gas, in view of the autonomous development of market prices, is still necessary to maintain the desired sustainability incentives. (b) Funding The availability of appealing financing instruments is an important condition for making the built-up environment more sustainable.                                                  86 https://www.ecn.nl/publications/ECN-E--13-061 87 https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/kamerstukken/2019/06/28/kamerbrief-voorstel-voor-een-klimaatakkoord https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2019/06/28/klimaatakkoord   New instruments are being developed to produce a wide range of financing instruments:  The Heat Fund and building-related financing: attractive pre-financing for everyone (including those who currently have no financing options). The basic principle is that over-crediting is prevented and the technical lifetime of installation and insulation measures will be taken into account. For this purpose, up to and including 2030, the government will provide 50-80 million euros in (non-revolving) resources annually. The heat fund can, depending on choices made in the implementation, be supplemented with private funds and thus grow to a financing portfolio of more than a billion euros.  Energy taxation and energy bills: A number of aspects are going to change with regard to the energy tax and Surcharge for Sustainable Energy (ODE) that will have an effect on energy bills. The tax on gas will increase. Additional funds collected in this way are returned via a higher tax reduction and a lower energy tax on electricity. Increased sustainability will be encouraged as a result. In addition, the burden arising from the ODE is distributed differently between households and companies and the government will make resources available to ensure that the tax component of the energy bill for a household with an average consumption level, is reduced by 100 euros in 2020, does not rise in 2021 and rises to a limited extent after 2021. The government is structurally allocating 425 million euros for this purpose.  Investment Grant for Sustainable Energy: The Investment Grant for Sustainable Energy (ISDE) currently focuses on sustainable installations such as heat pumps. The ISDE is being expanded so that a subsidy can also be requested for insulation. A hundred million euros will be available for the ISDE annually up to 2030.  Subsidy for Energy Savings at Home (SEEH): In order to facilitate owner-occupiers in the short term in making their home more sustainable, a total of 90 million is available for 2019 and 2020 through the Subsidy for Energy Savings at Home (SEEH). The SEEH merges into the broader Investment Grant for Sustainable Energy (ISDE).  Programme for small-scale energy-saving measures: With small measures, such as better control of the heating system and application of radiator foil, you can achieve major savings on your energy bill at little cost and immediately reduce CO2 emissions. An Energy-saving Measures Programme (PRE) will start this autumn in cooperation with municipalities and market parties. 93 million euros are available for this. Ongoing existing policy: There is a reduced VAT rate for applying insulation material and (insulation) glass. VAT has been reduced from 21% to 6%. (c) Making homes more sustainable A number of measures are aimed at accelerating the increased sustainability of rental homes owned by corporations and private property owners. In addition, an amendment to the Gas Act is relevant for new construction. District-oriented approach The district-oriented approach is aimed at making the built-up environment more sustainable district-by-district. As a result, both residents and building owners (such as bakers, schools and others) can be involved in making the district more sustainable. The district is also the easiest scale to apply an alternative to natural gas step by step and at natural moments and to limit costs. The municipality manages the district-based approach. To learn how to implement the district-based approach, testing grounds for natural gas-free districts have already been started in 2018. The testing grounds are intended to provide information in the 2019-2021 start-up period about how the district-based approach works and what preconditions are needed. Leading municipalities in the Natural Gas-Free Districts Programme are working on the testing grounds. A total of 400 million has been made available for this purpose. In addition, the Association of Dutch Municipalities has launched a knowledge and learning programme to support all municipalities in the Netherlands, providing knowledge and sharing experiences. Rental properties Within the rental sector, housing associations play an important role in the first step to make their housing stock more sustainable. Other major landlords are also going to make agreements about interim goals.  Housing associations often own large numbers of similar properties. This makes them a suitable party to act as a starter motor and set the process in motion to make the built-up environment more sustainable. The starter motor is the first scale-up in the process to increase the sustainability of the housing stock. By connecting 100,000 homes to heat in the short term (heat grids or heat pumps), a first step can be made in reducing the cost of renovations and reducing CO2 emissions. For this purpose among other things 200 million will be made available for the period 2020 up to and including 2023. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030     Associations can rapidly take steps due to their large scale and standardisation. Associations can apply for financial resources that support them in making their housing stock more sustainable. For example, there is financial support via the Renovation Accelerator and there is a discount on the Landlord Levy for associations that want to become more sustainable. The renovation accelerator ensures scaling up. The renovation accelerator is an instrument for bundling demand (similar homes and buildings of landlords) and linking it to the supply of construction parties to achieve cheaper renovation on a large scale. 130 million has been made available for this purpose up to 2024.  The regulation - including the rental points system - will be amended in such a way that it provides the right incentives to renovate homes in accordance with the standard. Owner-occupiers An insight into the possibilities (including technical) and financial support are important to support individual homeowners and unburden them with regard to making their homes more sustainable. A standard per housing type which includes sustainability requirements will provide people with an idea of the efforts involved in making their home more sustainable. This standard will be translated into target values per insulation measure. Other measures, such as a digital platform that provides homeowners with information about sustainability measures and the associated indicative energy savings, also contribute to this. For financial support, homeowners can make use of schemes such as the Investment Grant for Sustainable Energy (ISDE) and the Subsidy for Energy Savings at Home (SEEH). New constructions The Gas Act was amended on 1 July 2018. It means that most new buildings no longer have a gas connection. The amendment to the law applies to new buildings in the category of small consumers, whose building permits were applied for on or after 1 July 2018. New buildings must also be delivered as Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (NZEBs). Ongoing existing policy  People who implement energy-saving measures in their own home with a mortgage can borrow a higher amount for the investment concerned. An amount can also be disregarded if it concerns the purchase of a house with a valid energy label of at least (A++) issued before 1 January 2015 or a house with an energy index or an energy performance coefficient of at most 0.6. An amount can also be disregarded if a mortgage is provided to finance a "zero-on-the-meter" home (NulopdeMeter-woning). The scheme is updated on an annual basis.  The Netherlands promotes solar panels among small consumers by means of a VAT refund on the purchase of solar panels and a net-metering scheme (see 3.1.2.vi)  In the first energy tax bracket, members of these associations are no longer required to pay tax on the share of the jointly generated renewable electricity allocated to them. It is currently being examined how this scheme could be structured in the future when the net-metering scheme is phased out. The government is also examining whether a development facility could be set up that allows energy cooperatives to fund development costs.  The Energy Performance Fee Bill (EPV) was adopted on 17 May 2016 and entered into force on 1 September 2016. Landlords who renovate their properties so they are zero-energy (or nearly) or "zero-on-the-meter" homes can request an energy performance fee from their tenants to recoup the substantial investments made in the rental property. The landlord and the tenant must agree on the amount of the fee. (d) Making non-residential buildings more sustainable  Standardisation: In the case of non-residential buildings, we are looking into making existing commercial and social real estate more sustainable, such as office buildings, schools and care institutions. A coherent package of standards and supporting instruments is used for this in collaboration with umbrella organisations. The most important measure is the setting of a legal energy performance standard for buildings as of 2021. This concerns a target standard for 2030. A statutory final standard will apply for 2050. At that time all non-residential buildings must be low CO2.  Road maps: Social sectors use road maps to explain the steps they are going to take towards a low CO2 real estate portfolio by 2050. The Sustainable Social Real Estate Knowledge and Innovation Platform will support the social sectors. Ongoing existing policy As of 1 January 2023, any office larger than 100 m² must have at least an energy label C. If the building does not satisfy the requirements, it may no longer be used as an office from 1 January 2023.    (e) Sufficient renewable heat supply Agreements will be made with social organisations to ensure that there is a sufficient sustainable heat supply. The Sustainable Energy Production Incentive (SDE) is being expanded so that sustainable heat is also eligible for these resources. Central government will contribute in a number of ways. In particular by amending the Heat Act, supporting the ambitions of the Green Gas sector (Green Gas Road Map) and focusing on the safe and responsible development of geothermal energy using a coherent package of reinforcement and acceleration measures (in the form of additional technical requirements; financial support assessment; changing mining regulations; continuity of knowledge and experience; increasing knowledge of the subsurface; and focusing on the required innovation). Industry In addition to the measures cited in 3.1.1, this concerns the following policies: Energy savings requirement and information requirement In 2019, in addition to the energy savings requirement, an information requirement was also introduced. Installations that use 50,000 kWh of electricity or 25,000 m³ of natural gas (or an equivalent thereof) per year or more must not only take all energy-saving measures with a five-year payback period, but must also report before 1 July on the measures they have taken. Businesses subject to the EED audit obligation have an extension to 5 December 2019. The Recognised Lists of Measures (EML) form the basis. This contains sector-specific energy-saving measures with a payback period of 5 years or less. An EML has been drawn up for 19 sectors. If a company has taken all the applicable recognised measures, it is assumed that it complies with the energy saving requirement. The report is submitted electronically to the RVO.nl eLoket, and the competent authority (municipality or authorised environmental service) has access to these reports. This means that not only is the energy saving requirement for entrepreneurs clarified, but the competent authority can also implement information-driven supervision and enforcement. The four-yearly requirement to provide information will continue to exist after 2020 and will be included in the Environment and Planning Act. The multi-annual agreements (MJA and MEE) will not continue after 2020. Agriculture and land use In addition to the measures cited in 3.1.1, this concerns the following policies: Making greenhouse horticulture more sustainable In the Energy Agreement, a CO2 ceiling was agreed with the greenhouse horticulture sector. This system will continue until 2030. It is being investigated whether individualisation of CO2 emission allocations is possible. The transition is actively supported by the "Greenhouse as an Energy Source" (Kas als Energiebron) programme. This includes a wide range of instruments from knowledge and innovation development and knowledge dissemination to grants. In the Climate Agreement, the greenhouse horticulture sector has set the ambition to be completely climate neutral by 2040. The transition in the greenhouse horticulture sector is partly dependent on external parties who must make it possible to supply captured CO2 and residual heat to the sector. ii. Long-term renovation strategy to support the renovation of the national housing stock and non-residential buildings (both public and private) in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU (EPBD). In the long-term renovation strategy, the Netherlands will provide a description of the strategy, goals and various measures to improve the energy performance of existing homes and non-residential buildings towards nearly zero-energy and low CO2 in 2050. This long-term renovation strategy will be based on the Climate Agreement and will include both existing and new policies. The long-term renovation strategy will take into account the requirements of Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU. The long-term renovation strategy will also be aligned with this Integrated National Energy and Climate Action Plan. The long-term renovation strategy will be presented to the European Commission by 9 March 2020 at the latest. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    iii. Policies and measures to promote energy services in the public sector and measures to remove regulatory and non-regulatory barriers to the use of energy performance contracts and other models for energy efficiency services Energy performance contracts have not yet been widely used in the Netherlands, although the market is growing. Central government encourages EPCs by sharing good examples and it offers, by means of the Guidelines for the Procurement of Energy Performance Contracts, tools for producing an energy performance contract. As part of the European GuarantEE programme, RVO.nl developed an EPC facilitator pool together with 14 European partners. In collaboration with financial institutions and the installation sector, options for promoting ESCO constructions are also being examined. Clarifying the use of the EIA and any other instruments in ESCO constructions is being considered. iv. Other planned policies, measures and programmes Part of the Netherlands' energy efficiency policy focuses on raising awareness and making joint agreements with the sector and fellow governments:  Agreements: In recent years, various agreements and green deals have been concluded between central government and other parties, such as companies, social organisations or other governments. With a green deal, parties strive to find solutions to work in a sustainable manner. The government helps these parties with various bottlenecks such as ambiguous or conflicting regulations. More than 200 green deals have been signed since 2011. Various green deals reinforce energy efficiency such as the zero emission urban logistics green deal, the maritime shipping green deal, the inland waterway shipping and ports green deal, the participation of the environment in sustainable energy projects green deal and "Het Nieuwe Draaien" green deal focusing on mobile machinery. Other agreements (aimed at energy efficiency) between central government and other parties are e.g. the 10 petajoule energy saving built-up environment agreement and the More with Less agreement for energy saving new constructions. The Netherlands will continue to focus on green deals and agreements.  Campaigns: the Dutch government creates energy awareness with public campaigns such as the "Energiebesparing doe je nu", (Now's the time to make energy savings!), "Kies de beste band" (Choose the best tyre) and "Watt je moet weten over de informatieplicht energiebesparing" (Watt you need to know about the energy saving information requirement).  Regional approach: Dutch municipalities, provinces and water boards work together with stakeholders on a Regional Energy Strategy (RES) within the region. The RES is an instrument for jointly arriving at choices for the generation of renewable electricity, the heat transition in the built-up environment and the required storage and energy infrastructure. Among other things, the RES offers insight into the possibilities for regional generation and savings. A number of energy-saving measures are mandatory under the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive:  Energy label: A valid energy label is mandatory for the sale, rental and delivery of homes and non-residential buildings.  Energy performance requirements: The Building Decree imposes requirements for the energy efficiency of new homes and non-residential buildings. The most important requirement in this regard is the Energy Performance Coefficient (EPC). In addition to energy performance requirements for new constructions, the Building Decree imposes requirements on conversions and renovation.  Second revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2018/844): The Netherlands is currently still working on the implementation of the second revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. This revision also contains new and amended provisions aimed at energy savings for buildings, such as system requirements for technical building systems, documentation of energy performance of technical building systems, self-regulating equipment and inspections of heating and air-conditioning systems. v. Description of policies and measures to promote the role of local energy communities in implementing policies and measures referred to in points i, ii, iii and iv Energy communities can contribute to energy efficiency through bottom-up initiatives. The Netherlands encourages knowledge development and dissemination of energy communities. In addition, the development and growth of energy communities is promoted through targeted subsidies (tax benefits), in particular in the field of local energy generation. This policy is namely aimed at promoting support for the energy transition.   vi. Description of measures to develop measures for using the energy-efficiency potential of gas and electricity infrastructure The Electricity Directive requires the regulation method of electricity grid operators to provide appropriate incentives for energy efficiency. ACM regulates energy tariffs. The costs for grid losses for electricity and gas are part of the total costs that ACM includes in the regulation. Because grid operators achieve more returns if they reduce their costs, they have an incentive to reduce the costs for grid losses. The costs of grid losses are formed by the volumes and the purchase price of the electricity/gas. If a grid operator manages to reduce the volumes of grid losses, this contributes to energy efficiency. vii. Potential regional cooperation in this field See Chapters 1.3 and 1.4 viii. Financial measures in this field at the national level, including European Union support and the use of EU funds Not applicable
