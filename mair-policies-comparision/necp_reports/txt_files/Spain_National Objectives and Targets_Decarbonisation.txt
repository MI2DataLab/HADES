1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 34 through a non-competitive call that is open all year round.  Eurostars, for R&I-intensive SMEs. The CDTI provides funding via subsidies in a competitive call for applications. It has set closing dates.  ERA-Net Cofund scheme, which allows different types of entities to participate in competitive calls for proposals and funds them through grants. It has set closing dates.  Horizon 2020, open to participation by all types of entities. Annual competitive calls for proposals with set closing dates and funding via grants.  Research and innovation policies are proposed and implemented by the units responsible for funding activities proposed by the Ministry. The Spanish Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation and its State Plans for RDI are used in implementing them. These include activities such as:  The AEI, which was created by Royal Decree 1067/2015 of 27 November 2015 with the aim of being the instrument used to modernise public management of state R&D policies in Spain, is responsible for financing, evaluating, awarding and monitoring scientific and technical research activities. The AEI manages the following programmes of the State Plan: the State programme for the promotion of talent and its employability; the State programme for knowledge generation and institutional and technological strengthening; and the State RIC Programme aimed at societal challenges.  The CDTI, a public business entity, which also functions under the MCI, aims to increase the competitiveness of Spanish companies by raising their technological level. It carries out activities to finance business RIC projects (State Programme for Business Leadership), as well as projects to manage and promote Spanish participation in international technological cooperation programmes and support for the creation and consolidation of technology-based companies.  In addition, the main bodies focused on implementing actions subsidised by the AEI are the Public Research Bodies, such as the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) or the CIEMAT, which are attached to the MCI. Among the actions of the AEI, Technological Platforms are particularly important. These are forums for teamwork, led by the industry, which integrate all the agents of the Science-Technology-Innovation system (companies, technology centres, public research organisations, universities, R&I centres, associations, foundations, etc.), with the main objective of defining the short, medium and long-term vision of the sector and of establishing a strategic RIC path. Their objectives include:   encouraging competitiveness, sustainability and growth in the industrial sector and the Spanish scientific-technological sector;  being a mechanism of RIC transfer to the national and international market;  directing the creation of jobs and innovative companies through projects and actions.  Finally, the non-profit energy initiative, ALINNE, should be mentioned. This initiative was created to combine and coordinate efforts among all the agents in the energy RIC value chain, in order to respond to the main challenges for RIC policy in the energy sector, thereby contributing to the definition of work guidelines at national level and a European position. 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 35 2 OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 2.1 DECARBONISATION DIMENSION -term objective is to become a carbon-neutral country by 2050. For this purpose, a target was set to mitigate at least 90% of gross GHG emissions compared to the reference year 1990. In this sense, the emissions mitigation target for the year 2030 is at least 20% compared to 1990. As a result of the measures mentioned in this Plan, there will be a reduction from 340.2 MtCO2-eq emitted in 2017 to 221.8 MtCO2-eq in the year 2030, which means that approximately one third of current emissions will be removed between the two years.  To be specific, in the decade between 2021 and 2030, and as a result of the application of the measures of this National Plan (see Chapter 3), the gross total emissions will decrease from 319.3 MtC2-eq predicted for the year 2020 to 221.8 MtCO2-eq in 2030. The sectors of the economy that will reduce their emissions most in absolute terms during that period are the following:   electricity generation, 36 MtCO2-eq  mobility and transport, 27 MtCO2-eq  residential, commercial and institutional sectors, 10 MtCO2-eq  industry (combustion), 7 MtCO2-eq Table 2.1.

Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019  The planned decarbonisation in the electricity sector reduces emissions by 36 MTCO2 equivalent. This reduction is the result, firstly, of the substantial decrease in the importance of coal in electricity generation during the Plan period. It is possible that nine of the fifteen coal-fired power plants currently in existence (2019) will not be operational at the beginning of the Plan in 2021. This will be as a result of the decision adopted by the companies owning them not to make investments that meet EU requirements regarding polluting emissions. This means that it is 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 36 expected that at the beginning of the Plan six coal-fired power stations will still be active.  -fired power stations will no longer be competitive given the expected increase in the price of a tonne of CO2 in the European emissions trading system (EUR 35/tonne), the continued reduction in the costs of using renewable technologies to generate electricity and the relative price of gas. In any case, the transition in the sector will need to be accompanied by support measures for the affected regions in order to ensure that the process is carried out in a fair and supportive manner.  Secondly, the envisaged decarbonisation of the electricity sector will be the result of the significant penetration of renewable technologies set out in the Plan, which will gradually replace fossil fuel energy generation. Renewable electricity generation in 2030 will represent 74% of the total consistent with a path towards a 100% renewable electricity sector by 2050.  In the mobility-transport sector, the planned reduction is 27 Mt CO2-eq. Above all, this result is a consequence of the important modal shift from the conventional combustion vehicle to public, shared and non-emitting modes of transport, and as a result of the widespread creation of low-emission zones in cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants starting from 2023, in which it is planned that access for the most highly emitting and polluting vehicles will be limited. As a consequence of the implementation of the measures to promote the modal shift, it is estimated that 35% of passenger-kilometres that are currently travelled in conventional vehicles will shift to non-emitting forms of transport by 2030. The expected result of the significant presence of electric vehicles by 2030 is: 5 million units, including cars, vans, motorcycles and buses, as well as the use of advanced biofuels.  In the industry sector, all the emissions improvements are achieved in combustion processes, as there has been a slight increase in processes. Mitigation of 7 Mt CO2-eq will be achieved and is a consequence of the expected changes in the fuels used in the combustion processes, as well as the continuation of energy efficiency improvements. In the longer term, in the period to 2050, the decarbonisation of industry will require new technological advances that will come from RIC policies; such advances are envisaged in the 2050 Long-Term Low Emission Strategy.  The analysis of decarbonisation foreseen in the INECP is also addressed from the perspective of emissions that are part of the EU ETS system and the non-ETS emissions (residential, transport, agriculture, waste, fluorinated gases and industry not subject to emissions trading). As has already been mentioned, the gross GHG emissions for 2017 were 340.2 million tonnes of CO2-eq. 39% of these corresponded to sectors covered by emissions trading and 61% to non-ETS sectors. 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 37 Figure 2.1. Spain GHG emissions (inventory) 2005-2017 (ktCO2-eq)   Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019  The goals established in terms of GHG reduction in this National Plan not only meet the binding objectives set out in EU regulations, but also increase the level of ambition, thereby contributing to the achievement of the emissions reduction target in the European Union as a whole, as well as international commitments which the European Union and Spain have undertaken.   As already indicated above, the measures contained in this INECP allow a 23% emission reduction to be achieved compared to 1990 levels. The non-ETS sectors contribute with a 39% reduction by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, while the sectors subject to emissions trading contribute with a reduction of 61% by 2030 compared to 2005.

Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 provides that if a Member State exceeds its annual emission 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 39 allocation, it may make additional use of a quantity up to the sum of total net removals and total net GHG emissions from the combined land accounting categories of afforested land, deforested land, managed forest land, managed cropland, managed grassland and managed wetland (LULUCF categories set out in Regulation EU 2018/841).  In the case of Spain, the total amount of LULUCF that could be used over the period 2021-2030 amounts to 29.1 MtCO2-eq, which is 2030 under this Plan; this does not prevent ambitious policies and measures from being proposed in the sector.  Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry in the 2030 climate and energy framework establishes th-emissions may not exceed removals in the land accounting categories in the period 2021-2030. The Regulation then sets out the accounting rules for emissions and removals in the categories of afforested land, deforested land, managed forest land, managed agricultural land and managed grassland, including managed wetland from 2026.  The removals on managed forest land, which account for most of the land use removals, depend on a number of natural circumstances on the one hand and on past and present management practices on the other hand, which differ substantially between Member States. The relevant FRL) in each Member State to exclude the effects of natural and country-specific characteristics from the accounting of GHG emissions and removals.  In this respect, Regulation (EU) 2018/841 requires Member States to submit to the Commission their national forestry accounting plans, including a proposed FRL for the period from 2021 to 2025. Spain presented the draft National Accounting Plan on 31 December 201825, with a proposed FRL of -30.7 MtCO2-eq26. This proposal is under review and the Commission will have to be approve it, if applicable, by adopting a delegated act by 31 October 2020; the final FRL could therefore change.                                                                    25 Accessible at: https://www.miteco.gob.es/es/cambio-climatico/temas/mitigacion-politicas-y-medidas/Estrategia.aspx 26 Annual average from 2021 to 2025. 2.

NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 41 2.1.1 Electrification and decarbonisation of the energy system  Three of every four tonnes of GHG originate in the energy system; their decarbonisation is therefore key to achieving the objectives of this Plan. In order to achieve this goal, a transition from fossil fuels to efficiency and renewable energy is necessary. Furthermore, it will be necessary to electrify a significant part of the thermal demand and the demand for transport.  As a result of the measures envisaged in this Plan aimed at reducing the use of fossil fuels and promoting renewable energy sources in the three uses of energy  transport, heating and cooling and electricity  renewables will account for 42% of the total energy end-use in 2030.   Figure 2.6. Contribution of renewable energy to final energy consumption with the planned set of measures  Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019    Transport As a result of the measures adopted in this Plan, a 28% share of renewable energy sources is achieved in transport through electrification and biofuels, above the 14% required by the European Union in 2030.  The main aspects of decarbonisation in the transport sector are the modal shift, the deployment of electric mobility and the boost to the manufacture and use of advanced biofuels. The first two aspects are included in this Plan as energy efficiency measures.   Heating and cooling  Electrification and growth in the use of thermal renewables. In the heating and cooling sector, it is expected that, in addition to continuous technological improvement, new players and investment models will emerge to drive decarbonisation. In this respect, the National Plan focuses on renewable energy communities and proposes regulatory development that allows them to exercise their right to generate, consume and sell renewable energy. It also focuses on the promotion of a set of administrative and economic measures. An 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 42 increase in electricity use for heat generation is also proposed.  -2030 period will be very significant in all sectors of the economy, as can be seen from the following data:   electricity generation: increases from 10,208 to 21,792 ktoe;  heat pumps: increases from 629 to 3,523 ktoe;  residential: increases from 2,640 to 2,876 ktoe;  industry: increases from 1,596 to 1,779 ktoe;  transport (biofuels): decreases from 2,348 to 2,111 ktoe;  services and other: increases from 241 to 435 ktoe;  agriculture: increases from 119 to 220 ktoe. Ultimately, the presence of renewables in energy end-use will increase from an expected 20% for the year 2020 to 42% in 2030.     Electricity generation  By implementing the measures in the Plan, it will be possible to achieve a 74% share of generation from renewable sources   The transition to a decarbonised electricity system involves a significant and sustainable incorporation of renewable sources.  The achievement of ambitious targets in the field of electricity from renewable energy sources involves a three-pronged strategy: the promotion of large generation projects, the deployment of own consumption and distributed consumption, and measures to integrate renewables into the electricity system and market.  At an international level, the large-scale development of renewable energy in the last decade has led to a substantial reduction in their relative cost to the extent that, currently, in the vast majority of situations, renewable sources  mainly wind power and solar  generate the most cost-efficient electricity when it comes to developing new capacity.  The Plan envisages a total installed capacity in the electricity sector of 161 GW by 2030. With a view to the deployment of renewable technologies planned for the electricity sector, the INECP 2021-2030 considers auctions to be the main tool for the development of these technologies, in accordance with Directive 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 43 The design of the auctions is based on the predictability and stability of the revenues in order to facilitate the investment decision and its financing, and priority should be given to those installations that facilitate a more efficient energy transition. In any case, the design of the auction system should take into account, inter alia, the following elements:   the effect of lower wholesale market prices at times of high renewable generation;  the existence of discharges during times of high renewable generation;  a potential increase in social opposition in some locations, due to a high concentration of projects in areas with greater resources, in addition to a possibly inefficient sharing of co-benefits.  In order to achieve these objectives in the development of renewable energy technologies, it is important to work together with the autonomous communities and economic and social stakeholders in order to identify and eliminate together the barriers to the implementation of renewable energy on the territory, thus guaranteeing viable and efficient development.  The deployment of renewable own consumption is also envisaged, facilitated by the existence of renewable resources throughout the national territory, the modularity of the installations, the reduction of costs and a new regulation that simplifies the activity, eliminates tariffs and charges for self-generated energy and allows economic compensation for the surpluses fed into the grid. The Target Scenario proposed by the Plan represents a considerable increase in renewable generation capacity compared to the current situation.  Figure 2.7.

Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019  In the case of cogeneration, the capacity reflected in Table 2.3 corresponds to installed capacity. This heading therefore includes both active and inactive facilities.  In any case, specific distribution by means of renewable technologies between 2021 and 2030 will depend on their relative costs, as well as on the viability and flexibility of their implementation. Therefore, their relative weight may vary, within some margins, with respect to the figures presented here.27 The path marked out to achieve the objectives set for 2030 is based on the principles of technological neutrality and cost efficiency. To this end, the energy modelling carried out takes into account the developments in the performance and costs of all the technologies and is based on minimising costs, respecting the boundary conditions for meeting the objectives of the five dimensions of the INECP (see Annexes A and B).  In summary, the Plan proposes a balanced and diverse development of the renewable generation stock, providing medium-term visibility for each technology.  2.1.2 Adaptation to climate change  In 2006, Spain approved its National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (PNACC), which is the basic planning tool for promoting coordinated and coherent action against the effects of climate change. Since its approval, the National Adaptation Plan has been implemented through successive work programmes that specify the activities to be carried out at each stage. The first one covered the period between 2006 and 2008, and the second one between 2009 and 2013. The Third Programme, covering the period 2014-2020, is currently in full swing. The Third Programme has been structured into four strategic areas:                                                            27 With regard to the possible actions in the hydroelectric and hydraulic pumping systems envisaged in this section, the potential hydromorphological effects on rivers, as well as the functioning of the river system and the contributions in the affected sections Water Framework Directive and the corresponding river basin management plans. In accordance with Article 4(7) of the WFD, the exceptional nature of the action shall be justified. 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 45   generation and analysis of knowledge on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation;  integration of climate change adaptation into legislation;  mobilisation of key stakeholders in the sectors included in the Plan;  signs, evidence and indicators of impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change.  The outline also includes two complementary pillars: (i) administrative coordination and (ii) strengthening of RDI. These pillars acknowledge, firstly, the existence of various territorial levels and sectoral areas in which public administrations must act in a coordinated manner and, secondly, the essential role of research and innovation in the development of adaptation policies.  In 2019, the process of drawing up a new National Adaptation Plan (PNACC-2) began; it will define the objectives, criteria, scope and measures for promoting resilience and adaptation to climate change in Spain for the period 2021-2030. The general objectives for the PNACC-2 include:   offering a series of tools to facilitate the exploration of future climate scenarios;  promoting the assessments of impacts and risks arising from climate change and the identification of adaptation measures to minimise them;  promoting access to available knowledge on the impacts and risks arising from climate change and on mitigation and adaptation measures aimed at limiting them, facilitating training and capacity-building on the subject;  continuing to promote the integration of adaptation to climate change into the regulations and planning of the different areas of public and private management;  facilitating the coordination of actions between the different Public Administrations (national, regional and local) while promoting complementarity and efficient use of public resources;  encouraging the active involvement of Spanish society and mobilising key actors in the development of adaptive responses to climate change.  Furthermore, in its implementation phase the new PNACC-2 will:   include objectives, commitments and recommendations set out in the Paris Agreement (2015), in the evaluation of the EU Adaptation Strategy (2018) and in the Energy and Climate Governance Regulation.  consider the recommendations arising from the evaluation of the PNACC-1, which ended in 2019;  provide guidelines for its implementation through two successive work programmes (2021-2025 and 2026-2030), in which the actions to be carried out will be defined in detail;  include more than fifty measures, defining compliance indicators for each of them;  broaden the field of analysis and action, to consider the impacts and vulnerability in Spain due to the effects caused by climate change beyond our borders;  include a specific section on financing.   2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 46 As in the first Adaptation Plan, the PNACC-2 will define a set of areas for action on adaptation, including those relating to the energy system. In this field, action will be taken on the risks affecting the various components of the energy system:   primary energy supply;  electricity generation;  transport, storage and distribution of energy;  electricity demand. The following table shows a series of risks or threats caused by climate change for the Spanish energy system and some of the measures planned to address them:  Table 2.4.

NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 47 The analysis above of the risks on the energy system emphasises the close relationship between the adaptation of the energy system and the adaptive management policies relating to a series of resources or economic sectors that are vulnerable to climate change, such as water, the forestry sector, the coasts or transport infrastructure. Table 2.5 gives some examples:  Table 2.5. Examples of interlinkages between the energy system and some areas of work of the PNACC     Water  The river flow system influences hydropower generation.  Water is a key resource in cooling processes in thermal and nuclear plants.  Water is a resource used in solar thermoelectric production in the thermodynamic cycle, as well as for cleaning mirrors.  Biofuel cultivation requires the use of water.  Water is necessary in the process to obtain hydrogen.  The extraction and mining industry uses water.  The water temperature increases due to the discharge of flows from the cooling of thermal power plants. Forestry sector  The main source of biomass production is the forestry sector; its performance is closely dependent on how well forest areas adapt to climate conditions. Coasts  Some strategic energy infrastructure is located in coastal areas, such as offshore wind farms and associated electricity extraction infrastructure. Transport  Port infrastructure, the operation of which is influenced by factors related to the weather and climate, play an essential role in imports of energy products (fossil fuels and biofuels).  Land  Land use for renewable technologies, such as solar photovoltaic, energy crops for biofuel production, wind.  Opencast and closed-pit mining for fossil fuels.  Drilling and use of the subsoil for the extraction of hydrocarbons.

Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019  Adaptation measures included in the INECP  Several of the measures introduced in this Plan also involve a transformation of the energy system into a model that is more resilient to climate change. The establishment of this Plan is, in this respect, one of the first steps aimed at building adaptive capacity and providing actions for better adaptation of the energy system. Data collection and projections are a necessary approach to transforming the energy system so that action and policy guidelines can be drawn up, with the aim of achieving a carbon-neutral economy.  In particular, the measures contained in the decarbonisation dimension, and the design of an energy mix with a higher share of renewable energy, improve adaptation as they reduce the negative effects related to the intensive water consumption by thermal and nuclear power plants, and their response to temperature increases. In addition, measures to increase storage capacity 2.

This Plan includes the implementation of measures in industry that will initiate changes in production processes and a move towards those that have the best technical improvements available.  The other dimensions also include complementary measures that contribute to better adaptation. Improved security of supply, reduced dependence on fossil fuels, together with measures for improving research and competitiveness in low-carbon technologies, contribute to the implementation of an energy system that is resilient to climate change.  Finally, it should be noted that, in order to meet the reporting objectives under the Paris Agreement and international and European regulations, MITECO, in collaboration with other ministerial departments and the autonomous communities, will prepare and publish regular reports on the evolution of the impacts and risks resulting from climate change, as well as on the policies and measures aimed at increasing resilience and reducing vulnerability.  2.1.3 From generation to demand management and storage  The large-scale development of renewable generation makes it necessary to plan its integration into the system. The paradigm of base and peak generation becomes a new one of variability versus flexibility. The Plan seeks to make the system flexible by allowing demand and storage management to contribute to the security and quality of supply, reducing dependence and improving security of supply.   Electricity generation Both the development of storage and demand management are promoted to support the integration of renewables in the electricity sector.  Electricity demand management is the series of actions performed directly or indirectly by consumers themselves, Public Administrations, energy distribution and marketing companies, to modify the configuration over time or the level of their energy demands. This contributes to cost reduction, a lower impact on the environment, an improvement in the competitiveness of consumers and efficiency in the use of generation, transmission and distribution systems. The instruments to promote demand management can be economic incentives, the introduction of more efficient technologies and techniques, or influence on consumer habits. For this reason, we propose developing the figure of the aggregator and demand management plans, through which different players can participate in services that are essential to the system.  With regard to storage, the National Plan foresees that by 2030 there will be an additional capacity of 6 GW (pumps and batteries). The precise composition and operation of these will be developed according to technological advances and availability. In addition, the application of new pumping operation procedures will be taken into account.  2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 50 2.1.4 The role of citizens in the energy transition  At at the centre of the energy transition. In this connection, Directive 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources provides that the Member States must guarantee consumers the right to produce, consume, store and sell their own renewable energy, and assess both the barriers and potential of development of renewable energy communities.  The proliferation of renewable projects and their possible concentration in locations that have the best resources requires social acceptance. For this purpose, it is necessary for citizens to perceive the benefits of the deployment of renewable energies directly. In this respect, including the social perspective in the set of measures proposed and promoting a proactive role for citizens in the energy transition is necessary. The transition towards a model based on renewable energies also democratises the energy system and offers new opportunities to citizens, corporations and local authorities, who were only consumers in the conventional model and today can be proactive agents. This participation of new players and the development of own consumption encourage new sources of investment in decarbonisation, better integration and acceptance of energy infrastructures in the territory, the reduction of losses due to transport and distribution, the use of urban space for renewable generation, greater energy awareness in society and the emergence of new business models.  The right of access to energy is also another fundamental aspect of the change in the energy model. In this connection, the potential of energy upgrading of buildings and own consumption systems  in particular shared own consumption  to mitigate situations of vulnerability and energy poverty is particularly significant.  Furthermore, knowledge and information are the basis for greater involvement of citizens in the understanding of their relationship with energy, as well as, for example, the right of access to their own energy consumption data in a quick and understandable way. The INECP 2021-2030 proposes instruments and measures to facilitate and reinforce the role of local energy communities and the role of new players in the energy transition, as well as guaranteeing the right of access to energy.
