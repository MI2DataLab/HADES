2.2 Energy efficiency dimension i. The elements set out in point (b) of Article 4 Indicative national energy efficiency contribution In 2030, Bulgaria plans to achieve a decrease in the consumption of primary energy by 27.89 % and a decrease by 31.67 % in final energy consumption as compared to the PRIMES 2007 reference scenario.  As regards [the target for] energy consumption in 2030 expressed in absolute terms, Bulgaria has set a target of 17 466 ktoe for primary energy consumption and a target of 10 318 ktoe for final energy consumption.

Indicative milestones for 2030, 2040 and 2050, domestically established progress itargets as included in the roadmaps set out in the long-term renovation strategies for the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both private and public, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU In accordance with Directive (EU) 2018/844 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 amending Directive 2010/31/EU each Member State is to establish a long-term renovation strategy to support the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, into a highly energy efficient and decarbonised building stock by 2050, facilitating the cost-effective transformation of existing buildings into nearly zero-energy buildings. The provisions of the Directive are to be transposed into national law by 10 March 2020. To this end, a long-term strategy to support the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings with a time horizon until 2050 must be developed. The strategy must include:  indicative interim targets for 2030, 2040 and 2050;  indicative description of financial resources to support strategy implementation;  effective mechanisms for promoting investments in building renovation.    69  The table below sets out information about the indicative interim targets for the ten-year periods from 2021 to 2050.

The analysis of available data about certified buildings shows that in order to achieve the quantitative target indicators, renovation policy should focus primarily on building stock in the energy classes E, F and G. iii. Where applicable, other national objectives, including long-term targets or strategies and sectoral targets, and national objectives in areas such as energy efficiency in the transport sector and with regard to heating and cooling The achievement of the higher energy efficiency targets has a strategic link to building stock renovation and priority will be given to energy efficiency in combination with the use of renewable energy sources in buildings. Priority will also be given to the introduction of high-efficiency cooling and heating systems and innovative technologies using geothermal, hydrothermal and solar energy, and waste heat and cold.  In addition, the use of efficient district heating and cooling will be promoted. There are plans to upgrade public buildings and buildings used in the services sector that do not have district heating supply by building new district heating networks  either local or extensions of existing ones. The potential for energy efficiency of the central heating and cooling infrastructure can be achieved through the rehabilitation of heat transmission networks and replacing obsolete direct subscriber district heating stations with modern highly efficient automated indirect   70  2 emissions. The best practices associated with the use of pre-insulated pipes in district heating systems help reduce losses to 3 %. A similar loss level can be achieved for high-power density systems. Taking into account the specific national conditions, it is assumed that the average power density of district heating systems will allow heat losses to be reduced to 10 % in a scenario where the best available technology is used. The development of high efficiency electricity cogeneration contributes to fuel use reduction, greater efficiency of electricity generation and better environmental protection
