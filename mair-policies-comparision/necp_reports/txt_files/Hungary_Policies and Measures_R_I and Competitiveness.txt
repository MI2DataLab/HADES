3.5. Dimension of research, innovation and competitiveness i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.5. The Energy Innovation Council (EIC) set up by the Minister for Innovation and Technology in October 2018 has defined possibilities of intervention in the following areas: 1. Innovative system balancing (flexibility storage and demand management, active system operation by distributors); 2. Encouragement of the market launch of innovative energy supply solutions; 3. Energy efficiency innovation programme; 4. Facilitation of the use of Hungarian natural gas reserves; 5. stributors and suppliers in innovation; 6. Transport greening; 7. Encouraging use of renewable energy sources; 8. Support of nuclear innovation; 9. Encouraging innovative seasonal electricity and heat storage solutions. To ensure the system balance we are planning to encourage the spread of innovative technologies and operating modes that support improvement of the dispatchability of the electricity system by also minimising the necessity of network development investments and allow the integration of decentralised energy production based on renewable energy sources to the extent possible. The proposed programme focusses on  encouraging energy storage, enhancing the options/obligations of weather-dependent producers supporting the system balance, encouraging the demand side adaptation of consumers, and on the reconsideration of the competencies of the TSO and DSOs. Encouraging innovative methods of energy supply aims at the local consumption of electricity produced (from renewable resources). This effort could reduce costs associated with network loss and simplify the integration of renewable sources of energy. In terms of regulation, the energy community  as a separate prosumer unit and settled entity  should be clearly defined in regulation. The key technological task is the introduction of smart metering equipment that are also capable of managing time zone dependent tariffs. Although there are mainly legal and technological barriers to introducing the programme, the reduction of licensing/administrative burdens relating to the establishment and connection of renewable energy producers may result in a substantial decline in costs. The energy efficiency innovation programme aims to reduce the unit energy consumption of the building stock and industrial production. The energy efficiency programme will build on the enhancement of knowledge-sharing, readily comprehensible advice provided by the easily accessible advisory network, and on the priority of investments based on results of Hungarian innovation and pilot projects ensuring expected energy investments, producing a positive impact on employment and economic performance. To support retail investments we will establish a testing centre that drafts modern and cost-effective one-size-fits-all solutions for the energetic modernisation of Hungarian building groups defined in the National Building Energy Performance Strategy (NBEPS). Innovation can also target building automation, and the development and promotion of building supervision and control systems. By facilitating the use of Hungarian natural gas reserves we plan to maintain or even increase the level of extracted natural gas quantities in Hungary, thereby improving the security of supply and reducing Hungary's dependence on imported primary energy sources. Intervention is mainly directed at encouraging the production of unconventional natural gas and enabling the use of natural gas not in conformity with current gas standards. The establishment of  aims to positively encourage distributors to introduce new products and innovative technologies, and to expand options of suppliers for prioritising digital administration. Use of innovative solutions enables a more firm encouragement of reducing the quantity of consumed electricity, establishment of energy communities and implementation of energy efficiency and own energy production investments. The reduced quantity of distributed electricity with constant distributor costs, however, entails growing burdens for the tariff community, therefore the complex reform of the tariff scheme is necessary. To of innovative  The transport greening programme aims to reduce the rise in GHG emissions in the sector by encouraging  the spread of electric vehicles and car-sharing, and increased use of biofuels. We also aim to promote the Hungarian manufacture of electric vehicles and to support national research relating to the secondary (industrial) use of used car batteries. Special support is recommended for the use of second generation biofuels; the related pilot project would serve the testing of such fuel production technologies (and empirical determination of the national production cost and competitiveness). By encouraging the use of renewable sources of energy it would be possible to increase non-weather-dependent renewable energy production (geothermal, biomass, biogas, heat pumps) for both electricity and (district) heat supply. With regulation expanding the market for technologies supporting the integrated and local use of produced renewable energy, it is possible to also promote the Hungarian manufacture of heat pumps, biogas technologies and biomass-fired boilers. Within the framework of a State research programme, areas should be identified where geothermal energy production projects can be implemented. The exploitation of adequately researched areas can be encouraged by setting up a guarantee fund aimed at self-financing. By supporting nuclear innovation, innovative services can be developed in Hungary that enhance the competitiveness of nuclear energy production, and contribute to maintaining and expanding Hungarian experience in nuclear energy. The encouragement of innovative, seasonal electricity and heat storage solutions aims at facilitating the development of technologies capable of the extensive storage of large quantities of energy (even for months), feeding in of methane, biogas produced with power-to-electricity storage, the programme can also be extended to storing thermal energy and cold energy. Use of the particular technologies can be tested within the framework of pilot projects, subject to review of regulation concerning the feed-in of hydrogen, and biomethane and biogas produced with power-to-gas technology.   ROLE OF HYDROGEN IN THE FUTURE ENERGY SYSTEM Over the period of the strategy, hydrogen can play a major role in integrating the production of renewable electricity, strengthening the security of supply in Hungary and in achieving our decarbonisation targets. With the rising use of renewable sources of energy, namely, the daily, weekly or even seasonal storage of electricity  not possible with battery technology  will become an increasingly critical issue. With electrolysis technology it is possible to store surplus quantities of produced electricity at a given time in the form of hydrogen and to use it later based on a number of options. Most of the cost of electrolysis (over 90 %) is made up of the price of consumed electricity, thus the production of hydrogen is already one of the cheapest technologies for storing otherwise unusable energy, and with the smallest ecological footprint based on the entire production cycle. Although the high investment cost and low useful efficiency of fuel cells serving the reconversion of hydrogen into electricity remains a barrier to the market-based spread of the technology, based on forecasts a substantial (up to 90 %) cost decrease and significant efficiency improvement is expected. Taking into account the increasing flexibility needs of the electricity system, as an important aspect of energy policy and a factor supporting financial recoverability, both electrolysis and reconversion can be implemented along the lines of rapidly changing load curves, thus both technologies are suitable for frequency regulation. Obviously, fuel cells are also used in transport, therefore hydrogen produced from surplus renewable electricity generation is also environmentally friendly in mobility, although it still remains an uncertain alternative in terms of economy. Beyond the use of fuel cells, hydrogen can also be used for electricity generation in units based on the model of conventional gas engines. Dozens of turbines are operating around the world that partly recover hydrogen, including those with hydrogen as the primary fuel. New prospects open up in the future efficient use of existing gas-fired power plants with innovations enabling the conversion of the operating turbines of gas power plants for purely hydrogen operating mode. Beyond its reconversion into electricity, hydrogen can also be used in other forms. When blended with natural gas, it can contribute to satisfying the energy demand of industrial customers and even of households if Hungary's security of supply by reducing import requirements. By feeding hydrogen produced from electricity into the natural gas network103, its storage will also become possible, which is particularly important in view of the size of Hungarian gas storage capacities. There are a number of open points as regards the technical possibilities for feeding hydrogen into the gas network, such as the resistance of gas pipelines against corrosion or the behaviour of final customer equipment; we will support the review of these points within the framework of pilot projects.                                                       103 Regular tests are conducted regarding the feed-in of hydrogen into the natural gas storage facility; a pilot project is implemented as a first step. A possible goal is to store hydrogen blended with methane.  Electrolysis can offer a solution to the partial satisfaction of hydrogen demand in non-energy producing sectors, mainly in oil refining, fertiliser production and in the pharmaceutical industry. Hydrogen is traditionally produced from natural gas; the replacement of the latter is desirable both in terms of the security of supply achieved through reduced import requirements and climate protection. The steam reforming of natural gas often produces CO2 emissions, and high-pressure water vapour  necessary for the process  is also most often produced through the burning of fossil fuels. link between the electricity and natural gas sectors; sector coupling can support the electricity sector in integrating renewable energy production and enhancing system flexibility, and support the natural gas sector not only through its greening, but also by reducing import requirements and thereby strengthening the security of supply. ii. Where applicable, cooperation with other Member States in this area, including, where appropriate, information on how the SET Plan objectives and policies are being translated to a national context  Cooperation between V4 countries in RDI Participants of regular consultations are working on raising awareness of economic and science diplomacy in the region. Regional cooperation between the V4 countries allows members to participate in joint international programmes more effectively, to better make use of their resources and to enhance their appeal to foreign partners to establish long-term cooperation. A V4 Innovation Task Force was established and a Memorandum of Understanding signed. The Task Force aims to develop closer, coordinated cooperation between V4 countries in innovation. Its main objectives include the encouragement of V4 start-ups, sharing of experience and best practices relating to national SME/start-up support programmes in the field of regional cooperation, implementation of joint promotional and networking campaigns, and joint participation in foreign workshops, start-up events and fairs. As a result of the work of the Task Force, an agreement was concluded between the V4 countries on 1 October 2015, which focuses on regional cooperation relating to start-ups and innovation, and on the promotion of the innovation potential of the region (Memorandum of Understanding for Regional Cooperation in the Areas of Innovation and Start-ups). As regards cooperation between V4 countries, it is worth noting the think. BDPST conference, which is held each year since 2016 with the collaboration of the Antall József Knowledge Centre, the Ministry of Foreign y objectives is the strengthening of cooperation between V4 countries in the field of research, innovation and future technologies.  RDI cooperation platform of V4 countries in the field of energy   We have launched consultations with our V4 partners on options for establishing a specifically energy based innovation platform. The member states are expected to hold consultations in early 2020 on this topic.  Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan) The European Commission plans to encourage the Energy Union to carry out research and development and to achieve its leading role in renewable energy technologies by implementation of the revised SET-Plan, which was drawn up by the European Commission in 2008 to encourage technology based climate and energy policies for 2020. Hungary is currently only represented in two of the 10 technical working groups (TWG): - SET Plan  CCUS104 TWG, TWG 9), - SET-Plan  Nuclear safety TWG, TWG 10).  Other nuclear RDI cooperation - Participation in the work of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) Hungary joined the CERN105  based in Geneva  in 1992. In recent years Hungary has become very engaged in the preparation, operation of experiments conducted at the CERN, in the evaluation of obtained data and in the interpretation of physical results. According to the Wigner Institute for Particle and Nuclear Physics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences % of the CERN is a H106 - Research and innovation in thermonuclear plasma physics within the framework of EURATOM Research and innovation in thermonuclear plasma physics is carried out within the framework of EURATOM, through international cooperation, mainly with and in relation to European large equipment. Hungarian researchers have achieved important results even by international standards in the research of the turbulent state of plasma and the behaviour of macroscopic pieces of matter added to plasma.107 - Participation of the Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority (HAEA) in the European Safeguards Research and Development Association The European member organisations of the European Safeguards Research and Development Association, established in 1969, operate in the field of nuclear safeguards. The main goal of the organisation is to                                                       104 Carbon capture, utilisation, storage. 105 The world's largest particle physics laboratory. 106 http://www.rmki.kfki.hu/kutatas/CERN.html 107 http://www.rmki.kfki.hu/plasma/rolunk.html  coordinate and promote research and development in the field of nuclear safeguards.  International cooperation within the framework of Horizon 2020108 Up to 29 October 2019, 253 Hungarian tenderers participated in the relevant energy and climate protection categories within the framework of Horizon 2020. In the various international projects Hungarian project members were awarded Union funds in the total value of 51 million EUR (see details in point i. of Chapter 4.6). The FutureFlow109 international research and innovation project  in the value of 13 million EUR  is noteworthy among these projects, which is implemented with involvement of the Hungarian transmission system operator (MAVIR Zrt.).110 The FutureFlow project will link the cooperating regulatory areas of system operators in four Central and Southern European countries (ELES  Slovenia, APG  Austria, MAVIR  Hungary, TRANSELECTRICA  Romania) to maintain security of the transmission system. The project is implemented between 2016 and 2020.  Participation in the QUANT-ERA, FLAG-ERA and M-ERA-NET programmes The main objective of the ERA111-NET programmes is to enhance the coordination of publicly funded research programmes implemented at national and regional levels, organise national and regional research within a network and to mutually open up research programmes at national and regional levels. - Participation in the M-ERA-NET programme: The M-ERA-NET programme aims to strengthen coordination of European research programmes in the field of materials science and engineering through joint calls. (There are three Hungarian projects  all in the field of physics.) - Participation in the FLAG-ERA II programme: The European Union provides long-term support for promoting research aimed to pursue grand interdisciplinary scientific and technological challenges through FET (Future and Emerging Technologies) and flagship initiatives. (There are five Hungarian projects, two of them are related to energy112.) - Participation in the QuantERA programme: Within the framework of the FET programme of Horizon 2020, in May 2016 the European Commission announced the launch of its new flagship research initiative in the field of quantum technology. The flagship initiatives will be implemented with projects supported with EU, national and own funds, enabling cooperation in international                                                       108 To lay the groundwork for implementing the SET-Plan on the demand side, the energy priorities of the RDI framework programme (Horizon 2020) for the 20142020 budgetary period were defined on the basis of the SET-Plan. 109 Full name of the project: FutureFlow  Designing eTrading Solutions for Electricity Balancing and Redispatching in Europe 110 http://www.futureflow.eu/?page_id=214 111 European Research Area 112 Both projects are implemented by the Centre for Energy Research (Institute of Technical Physics and Materials Science) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.  research with a yearly budget of 100 million EUR for 10 years. The annually launched calls for proposals of the QuantERA Consortium provide support for international research projects relating to the flagship initiatives. (So far Hungary has not been involved in energy related projects.)  European Institute of Innovation and Technology The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) of the EU operates in the field of (higher) education, research and innovation, coordinating education, industry, business and research in a given field to promote a knowledge-based economy and enhance competitiveness in Europe. With its organisation aimed at integrating the three sectors, the EIT operates as a centre of excellence. The seat of the EIT is in Budapest in accordance with Decision 2008/634/EC. The activity of the institute focusses on the establishment of knowledge and innovation partnerships across Europe. The basis of cooperation is provided by the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs)  with participating higher education institutions, research organisations and undertakings  and their cooperating partners. The EIT covers 25 % of the expenditures of such long-term R&D cooperation. The remaining amount is financed by the communities. Hungarian institutions are not participating as a core partner, but are involved in all KICs: - Climate-KIC (Climate change mitigation and adaptation): Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME), - Bioenergy Competence Centre, Public Foundation for Industrial Development, University of Debrecen, - KIC InnoEnergy (Sustainable energy): Bay Zoltán Alkalmazott Kutatási Non-profit Kft.  Intergovernmental cooperation in science and technology (SaT)113 Hungary signed intergovernmental and interinstitutional agreements on cooperation in science and in technology (SaT) with 36 and 10 countries, respectively. The National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NRDIO) is responsible for their implementation. The Office and its predecessor institutions signed interinstitutional agreements on cooperation with organisations of an additional 9 countries in charge of R&D policies and financing. A key objective of bilateral SaT relations is to support RDI cooperation between the two participating countries through tendering. International SaT relations are also supported by SaT attachés posted at 11 locations (Berlin, Brussels (EU), London, Moscow, New York, San Francisco, Paris, Beijing, Seoul, Tel Aviv, Tokyo and New Delhi), who are responsible for collecting information on the RDI policies of host countries, promoting Hungarian scientific and technological achievements, assisting the development of relations                                                       113 https://nkfih.gov.hu/hivatalrol/nemzetkozi-kapcsolatok  between the research and innovation communities of the two countries, and for supporting the launch of cooperation. The NRDIO operates  jointly with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade  the SaT attaché network responsible for scientific and technological diplomacy. Beyond the foregoing the NRDIO is also involved in a number of international SaT cooperation projects and represents the interests of Hungary (EUREKA), and ensures participation in ESFRI and its working groups to coordinate the research infrastructure. It also coordinates professional tasks and representation relating to Hungarian participation in specific international research infrastructures (ITER, CERN etc.), and coordinates expertise. Cooperation in R&D policy-making (OECD) supports the development of Hungarian policies. necessary to encourage more international cooperation in relation to energy technologies and RDI in the field of energy, and to develop new relations. Accordingly, international RDI cooperation is also successful at international level and important in terms of Hungarian priorities, but new opportunities should also be explored. iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds The National Research, Development and Innovation Fund (NRDI Fund) managed by the NRDIO plays an important role in Hungarian RDI financing; it is a State extra-budgetary fund exclusively providing national public funding for RDI. The source of funding is the innovation levy paid by undertakings and supplemented with budgetary funds. It aims to ensure foreseeable financing for encouraging R&D and value-adding innovation based on Hungarian and foreign research results. The NRDI Fund has the function of supplementing and balancing EU funding based on national or even geographical criteria. The NRDI Fund provides balanced incentives for blue-sky research, targeted development and innovative enterprises. There are no Hungarian thematic invitations to tender yet; energy RDI projects can be supported within the framework of market-driven RDI invitations to tender. Such an invitation to tender has already been launched in May 2019114, and is expected to be relaunched in early 2020. We are also exploring the possibility of encouraging Hungarian RDI in energy with thematic tenders launched specifically in the field of energy. When approving the Annual Development Budget  based on the proposal of the NRDIO, the body responsible for policy at the time  the Government decided on the schedule and budget of non-refundable and refundable RDI tender schemes of operational programmes financed by the EU (EDIOP, CCHOP). Pursuant to Government Decree No 106/2018 of 15 June 2018 amending Government Decrees concerning certain development policies in relation to governmental structural reform, as of 16 June 2018, in relation to the priorities of EDIOP and CCHOP 2, the MIT is the ministry responsible for policy-making instead of the                                                       114 https://nkfih.gov.hu/palyazoknak/nkfi-alap/piacvezerelt-kfi-projektek-2019-111-piaci-kfi/palyazati-felhivas-2019-111-piaci-kfi  NRDIO. We are also launching pilot projects to promote energy innovation with financing from carbon credit revenues. We will decide on the extension of innovative solutions based on the findings of the pilot projects, and plan financing with use of funds of operational programmes in the 2021-2027 period and the Modernisation Fund. The Government also plans to play an active role in promoting options for direct EU tenders among Hungarian market participants, universities and research establishments, e.g. within the framework of the CEF, Horizon Europe, InvestEU, EUROSTAR and EURATOM programmes, advancing their participation in international consortiums. The European Investment Bank (EIB) can provide credit for financing efforts combating climate change. The European Investment Fund (EIF, member of the European Investment Bank Group) can support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in innovation, R&D, entrepreneurship, growth and job creation with venture capital and risk financing instruments. The aim is to exploit opportunities offered by the Innovation Fund to the full extent. In relation to projects focussing on highly innovative technologies and on large projects representing European added value, resulting in a substantial emissions reduction, the fund can offer options for sharing risks and thereby support implementation of highly innovative ideas. An even higher investment of foreign private capital is also justified. The Hungarian Investment Promotion Agency (HIPA)  established to support working capital investments  can play an important role in this area.
