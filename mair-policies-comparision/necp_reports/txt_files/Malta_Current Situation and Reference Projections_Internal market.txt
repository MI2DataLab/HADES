 158  4.5 DIMENSION INTERNAL ENERGY MARKET 4.5.1 Electricity interconnectivity  Current interconnection level and main interconnectors At the end of 2017, Malta had an interconnection level of 31%, well above the 2030 interconnection generation capacity in 2017 was 650MW. Malta aligned its methodology for the calculation of the factsheets of the Third State of the Energy Union report, whereby the interconnection level is calculated as a ratio between import interconnection capacity and net installed generation capacity. The details of 200MW HVAC interconnector are outlined in Table 26. Table 26  Malta-Sicily Electricity interconnector details. Characteristics Details Starting point Substation in Sicily  Ragusa Landing point in Sicily Marina di Ragusa On-shore route (Sicily Marina di Ragusa to Ragusa) 18.992km Off-shore route  98.735 Landing point Malta Qalet Marku End point Malta Maghtab substation On-shore route Malta Included in the offshore route length Average depth 110m Voltage rating 220 kV AC Nominal capacity 200MW Total length of interconnector 117.727 km   Projections of interconnector expansion requirements (including for the year 2030) interconnection target for 2030 required by the Governance regulation. Currently, there are no plans for a second interconnector, although this is subject to the outcome of the in-depth study on power generation covering the period 2019-2040 commissioned by the Government.     159  4.5.2 Energy transmission infrastructure  Key characteristics of the existing transmission infrastructure for electricity and gas  As described in Section 2.4.2 related to national objectives and targets in the area of energy transmission infrastructure, in Malta there is no electricity transmission system. Details on the planned gas pipeline project are described in detail under the Energy Security dimension.    Projections of network expansion requirements at least until 2040  The local distribution grid network has three voltage levels, i.e. 132kV, 33kV, and 11kV. Reinforcement of the 11kV network is a continuous process following increase in demand. The seasonal peak load on transformer capacity, so that the necessary expansions (installation of additional transformers, or affected before the N-1 threshold is reached. Reinforcement of the 33kV network is affected to sustain these DC expansions. With regards to the 132kV network, while this network presently caters for N-1 requirements, Enemalta is planning for reinforcement of the 132kV network in view of future normal demand increase as well as planned large-scale infrastructural investments which will entail a substantial stepped increase in localised demand. Enemalta is also studying the reinforcement of the 132kV network -sufficient in the eventuality of long-term unavailability of the Malta-Sicily Interconnector.  4.5.3 Electricity and gas markets, energy prices  Current situation of electricity and gas markets, including energy prices As noted in previous sections, there are no wholesale electricity or gas markets in Malta. Enemalta performs the functions of a DSO and constitutes the sole electricity supplier to final consumers. Wholesale electricity prices are reported by REWS as the proxy for the market price94, that is, as the average cost of meeting the demand forecast through local generation and, as of 2015, electricity imported over the interconnector excluding generation from RES. Following recent significant investments in the energy infrastructure, the proxy for the market price has followed a steady decline since 2011 (Figure 76) from 0.12                                                             94 As there is no liquid wholesale market in Malta, the proxy for the market price is used to establish a reference price for electricity -in Tariffs Scheme (Electricity Generated   160  Figure 76  Trends in the proxy for the market price from 2011-2017, EUR (2016)/kWh.    Projections of development with existing policies and measures until at least 2040 (including for the year 2030)  are included under the internal energy market part of Section 5.1.i.
