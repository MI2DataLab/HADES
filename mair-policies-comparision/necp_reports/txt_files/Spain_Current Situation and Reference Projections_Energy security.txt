ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  250 A.4 ENERGY SECURITY DIMENSION The consumption of hydrocarbons (oil and natural gas) in primary energy accounts for approximately 60% of the total at present. For this reason, and considering that indigenous hydrocarbon production is residual, the supply of these types of fuels is fundamental for the   To reduce the exposure to risks that could represent a decrease in the supply of these fuels, two routes have been followed that are complementary to the other targets in this Plan:   y demand, and therefore less energy will be needed to meet this demand.  Secondly, and to increase the effect of the above, in the Target Scenario there is significant replacement of fossil fuels with other indigenous fuels (almost entirely renewables). It has been possible to see these two effects in the sections above that have explained the Spanish   On the other hand, this section also analyses the external dependency of the electricity generation sector. This sector is also dependent on hydrocarbon consumption, although to a lesser extent than the rest of the economy.  A.4.1 Current energy mix, domestic energy resources, import dependency The sections above have presented the different primary sources that form the origin of the energy supply to Spain, as well as the breakdown and future projection. The following observations can be made regarding security of supply based on these sources:   The presence of natural gas in the Spanish energy mix is slightly lower than in other EU Member States, which can be explained, inter alia, by the following reasons: o a milder climate, resulting in lower penetration of natural gas among domestic consumers and central heating; o greater significance of natural gas in the generation of electricity, which means that its presence in final energy is clearly lower than the share in primary energy.  As for petroleum products, their presence in the national energy mix is higher than the EU average. This can be explained by the following reasons: o a high development of freight transport by road at the expense of rail transport (2% on average in Spain, compared to 17% in the EU); o significant consumption for maritime transport compared to inland Member States; o significant consumption for air transport due to the importance of the tourism sector.   ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  251 With reference to the national production of hydrocarbons, it should be noted that this is practically non-existent. Data for 2017 are as follows:  Domestic production of natural gas (2017): 400 GWh (0.11% of total requirements). Domestic production is considered to be not only production from hydrocarbon deposits, but also the injection of biogas into the transmission network.  Domestic crude production (2017): 0.12 tonnes (0.21% of requirements). The main countries of origin for the different sources of energy are the following:   Electricity: Spain has electricity interconnections with France, Portugal, Andorra and Morocco. Details of the imports and exports with these countries can be found in the table below.  Table A.37.

The breakdown by country of origin of natural gas imports in 2017 was as follows: o Algeria (48%) o Nigeria (12%) o Peru (10%) o Qatar (10%) o Norway (10%) o Others (10%) In light of the above, the relative dependence on the importation of natural gas from Algeria can ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  252 be highlighted as a possible risk, which is offset by the high level of imports by methane tankers from a wide range of countries of origin.   Petroleum products: the main countries of origin of crude oil in 2017 were the following. As can be seen, the diversification in the sources of oil origin is much higher than the diversification for gas: o Mexico (15%) o Nigeria (14%) o Saudi Arabia (10%) A.4.2 Projections of development for the energy mix, domestic energy resources, import dependency with the existing policies and measures The projection to 2030 is presented below for the breakdown of primary energy according to indigenous production and imports for the Baseline and Target Scenarios.

Progress will thus be made in reducing one of the most important structural weaknesses of the national energy system.  In addition, the importing of fossil fuels decreases by an even greater percentage than energy dependency. This effect is achieved due to the combination of the two effects mentioned at the beginning of this section: the reduction in overall energy consumption through the use of energy efficiency, and the replacement of the use of hydrocarbons with indigenous fuels (especially renewables and largely thanks to an increased electrification of the sectors).  With all of the above, a substantial improvement is projected on the 2030 horizon for the trade balance, provided that the policies and measures included in the Plan are complied with. Specifically, there is a shift from a net importation of 95,945 ktoe between coal, natural gas and oil in 2017 to 67,020 ktoe in 2030 (a 30% reduction).  With regard to electricity, the increase in the installed capacity from renewable energy sources increases security of the supply due to the use of indigenous sources and the increase in the diversification of sources. The Target Scenario achieves a figure of 74% of electricity generated using renewable energy sources. In terms of its relationship with security of supply, note should be taken of the increase in interconnections with France. This increase is planned to progressively move towards the targets set by the EU of an interconnection capacity of at least 15% of the installed capacity of each Member State. This point is analysed in greater detail in the next chapter. ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  254 A.4.3 Cybersecurity  The definition of the cybersecurity objective in the Annual National Security  ensure the secure use of information and communication networks and systems by strengthening capacities to prevent, detect and respond to cyberattacks by enhancing and adopting specific measures to help promote a secure and reliable   An area of strategic relevance for National Security is Critical Infrastructure. In the 2013-2018 period, a clear upward trend was observed in the number of incidents recorded in this area, mainly malware and exploitation of system vulnerabilities, with more than 2,300 incidents in critical operators, with the financial, energy and transport sectors being the most affected, accounting for more than 50% of the cases.  An important step in the field of cybersecurity in Spain was the reform of the Criminal Code in 2015. This included important amendments on the crimes related to computer sabotage, in compliance with Directive 2013/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 August 2013, on attacks against information systems and replacing Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA.  The existence of regulations for the Protection of Critical Infrastructure in Spain since 2011 has also made it possible to transpose Directive 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union (the NIS Directive), in a quick and simple manner due to having used the same procedures and accumulated knowledge to carry out this implementation. The entry into force of Royal Decree-Law 12/2018 of 7 September 2018 on network and information system security has transposed the aforementioned NIS Directive into Spanish law, giving a significant boost to the cybersecurity of essential services in the energy field.  In addition to this regulatory update, in April 2019, Spain approved its National Cybersecurity Strategy, the function of which is to develop the provisions of the 2017 National Security Strategy in the field of cybersecurity. This replaced the previous one, approved in 2013. It should also be noted that Spain has had a National Energy Security Strategy since 2015. In view of the major regulatory, technological and energy policy changes that have taken place in recent years, it is expected to be updated shortly.  This strategy has also strengthened and reinforced public-private collaboration with the various energy operators, a task that has been coordinated by the Cybersecurity Coordination Office (Oficina de Coordinación Cibernética  OCC) of the National Centre for the Protection of Critical Infrastructure and Cybersecurity (Centro Nacional de Protección de Infraestructuras Críticas y Ciberseguridad  CNPIC). Likewise, the designated critical operators in the field of energy and nuclear industry have presented their respective Operator Security Plans (OSP), checking their adjustment to the current situation of the threats and challenges to which critical infrastructure in the energy sector and nuclear industry are subject, and updating the information contained in these plans. ANNEX A. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS:  BASELINE SCENARIO AND TARGET SCENARIO  255 Finally, Spain has taken note of the Commission Recommendation to Member States on Cybersecurity in the Energy Sector dated 3 April 2019, and is preparing to systematically implement the recommendations on real time requirements for energy infrastructure, on what are referred to as cascade effects and on the appropriate combination of legacy and state-of-the-art technology.
