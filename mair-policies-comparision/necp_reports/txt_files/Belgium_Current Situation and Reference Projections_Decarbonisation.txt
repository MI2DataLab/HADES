Decarbonisation 1.1.1. GHG emissions and removals i. Current trends in GHG emissions and ETS, ESD, LULUCF and various energy sector targets According to the inventory submitted in March 2019, in 2017 Wallonia emitted 35.3 Mt CO2eq, or 31% of excluding the forestry sector). This inventory is drawn up in accordance with the 2006 IPCC guidelines and the applicable global warming potential (GWP) for the period 2013-2020 (41).                                                            37 Federal Planning Bureau. 38 Fairly conservative assumptions. 39 Values recommended by the European Commission.

The GWPs for fluorinated gases are also audited. 76 The Walloon inventory of GHG emissions is combined with the inventories for the Flemish Region and the Brussels Capital Region to make up the Belgian inventory, which is reported by Belgium on an annual basis under the Kyoto Protocol and European commitments (Effort Sharing Decision No 406/2009/EC). Figure 1 shows the breakdown of total GHG emissions by type of gas and by main sector.  Figure 1: Breakdown of GHG emissions by sector in Wallonia in 2017 (source: AwAC)   Residentiel Residential Tertiaire Tertiary Agriculture Agriculture Déchets Waste Autres Other Energie () Energy (electricity generation) Industrie Industry Transport Transport  CO2, which accounts for 82% of total GHG emissions, is emitted in particular during combustion processes in various sectors: industry, transport, tertiary and residential heating, and power plants. CH4, which accounts for 8% of total emissions, is emitted by agriculture (78%), the waste sector (10%) and natural gas distribution systems (compressors and leaks; 7%), with the remainder being emitted by combustion processes as a whole. N2O, which accounts for 8% of total emissions, is chiefly emitted by agriculture (81%), the chemical industry (4%) and combustion processes (9%). Finally, fluorinated gases account for 2% of total emissions and are emitted during the manufacture and use of certain products (refrigeration, insulating foams, etc.).  Figure 2: Breakdown of GHG emissions by type of gas in 2017 (source: AwAC)  Based on the latest available estimates, anthropogenic GHG emissions (excluding the forestry sector) in Wallonia in 2017 were 36.9% lower than in 1990. 77  Figure 3: Trend in total GHG emissions in Wallonia, including the ETS and ESD sectors (source: AwAC)  Source: AwAC Source: AwAC Evolution des émissions en % de 1990 Trend in emissions (in %) compared with 1990 1995: année froide mais augmentation limitée des émissions - [text missing] 1995: cold year, but limited increase in emissions due to the closure of a [blast furnace] à partir de 2001 : développement de la combustion de biomasse en cimenterie et de la récupération du biogaz dans les  from 2001: development of biomass combustion in cement works and of biogas recovery at landfill sites 2002 - 2002: shutdown of a blast furnace and a coking plant 2006 et 2007 : hivers très doux, diminution importante de la consommation dans les secteurs résidentiel et tertiaire 2006 and 2007: very mild winters; significantly reduced consumption in the residential and tertiary sectors 2009 : la crise économique résulte en des émissions exceptionnellement basses au niveau industriel (arrêt quasi complet de la sidérurgie à chaud) 2009: the economic crisis leads to exceptionally low industrial emissions (the hot working steel industry comes to a virtually complete halt) 2010 : certain secteurs industriels se redressent, mais la sidérurgie à chaud connaît toujours un niveau de production très faible 2010: some industrial sectors recover, but the hot working steel industry still produces very little 2011 : Amélioration des procédés de production e année la plus chaude observée en Belgique, après  2011: improvement in nitric acid production processes and low heating emissions (2nd hottest year observed in Belgium, after 2014). 2012-2013 : Fermeture définitive de la phase à chaud en sidérurgie, ralentissement des centrales électriques, fermeture de 2 lignes de verre 2012-2013: permanent shutdown of the hot working phase in the steel industry, slowdown at power plants, closure of 2 float lines 2014 : Année la plus chaude observée en Belgique. Hivers très doux 2014: hottest year observed in Belgium. Very mild winter  78 The overall trend conceals significant differences in the various sectors. The industrial and electricity generation sectors have seen reductions in total emissions of 28% and 7% respectively, while the increase in transport-related emissions has caused total emissions to rise by 3%. The main factors behind these sectoral trends are as follows:  energy: switch from coal to natural gas or wood, closure of coking plants;  industry: closures in the steel industry, increased use of gas or alternative fuels, sectoral and ETS agreements, increase in value added despite this reduction;  residential and tertiary: increase in building stock, higher consumption of electricity, limited switch to natural gas, insulation, milder climate;  transport: increase in the number of cars, engine size and vehicle-kilometres;  agriculture: reduction in and changes to livestock, reduction in mineral fertilisers;  waste: recovery and use of biogas at landfill sites.

Projections of sectoral developments with existing national and Union policies and measures at least until 2030 The projections set out below are based in particular on work carried out by a consultant (ECONOTEC) using the Emission Projection Model (a technical and economic model) in the second half of 2016. The aim was to update the projections made in early 2015 for the energy generation, industrial, residential and tertiary sectors. The projections for the transport sector were modelled using the COPERT tool and may change depending on the 79 context or the availability of new tools (42). The model does not cover all the dimensions of the Energy Union (market, network, etc.) or take account of all impacts (jobs, prices, etc.). Policies and measures taken into account Only the main measures that generate investments are taken into account (e.g. the effects of soft measures such as communication are not directly included). This choice may mean that consumption and emissions are overestimated, but ensures that the resulting baseline scenario is conservative. Existing policies and measures are included in the model using an analysis of existing data (databases, regulatory texts, etc.). Where the end date of a measure is known, this is taken into account (e.g. green certificates). Otherwise, the measure is continued linearly to 2030 (e.g. incentives). All the graphs below are based on historical data from the energy balances for the years 2005, 2010 and 2015 (where intermediate years are shown, they have been linearly extrapolated and do not therefore represent official data). The years 2020, 2025 and 2030 are the result of modelling and the intermediate years are extrapolated. Greenhouse gas emissions The graph below shows the trend in GHG emissions for all sectors since 2005, with constant-policy-based projections.

However, there may be some increases in the energy generation, industrial and transport sectors. Emissions in the energy generation sector will increase in 2025 due to the end of nuclear power and its partial replacement by gas-fired plants. There will be an increase in the industrial sector between 2015 and 2020, as it is expected that the sector will return to a level of activity comparable to the pre-crisis level in 2008. The transport sector is also expected to continue its previous growth.  1.1.2. Renewable energy i. Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in each of these sectors  are non-fossil renewable energy sources used for both electricity generation and also heat production and transport (43). The most well-known, given that they form part of our everyday landscape, are wind power, solar power and wood. However, biogas and biofuels are also included in this list. The renewable energy sources available in Wallonia can be grouped into three categories:                                                            43 Refer to Directive 2009/28/EC for a full definition. 81  Electricity source (RES-E)  Hydroelectric  Wind  Solar PV  Biogas  Liquid biofuel  Solid biomass  Organic waste Heat source (RES-H)  Solar thermal  Heat pumps  Geothermal energy  Biogas  Liquid biofuel  Sold biomass  Wood Transport (RES-T)  Biodiesel  Bioethanol  RES electricity  Several European Directives promoting the use of energy produced using renewable sources have been successively adopted in recent years: 2001/77/EC, 2003/30/EC, 2009/28/EC and more recently (EU) 2015/1513. Their aim is to define a minimum renewables target for each country and also the rules for calculating that target. Belgiums renewable energy commitment at EU level (13% by 2020) was broken down between the regions and the federal level in December 2015, with Wallonia being set a target of producing 14,850 GWh from renewable energy sources by 2020. Wallonia has, however, adopted a decree enshrining a more ambitious target of 15,600 GWh of production from renewable energy sources by 2020. This target incorporates generation of renewable electricity, production of renewable heat and consumption of biofuels in the transport sector. The denominator takes account of final energy consumption, including grid losses and own consumption in heat or power plants. The following figures show the trend in the share of renewables in Wallonia and the target set for 2020. It should be noted that the share of renewable electricity is increasing (under 1% of the total before 2007; 3.9% in 2017), that the share of renewables in the transport sector slowed in 2015 but accelerated again in 2016 and 2017, and finally that renewable heat makes the largest contribution to the overall total at 7.2%.  Figure 7: Trend between 2000 and 2016 in the share of gross renewable energy in total gross final energy consumption within the meaning of Directive 2009/28/EC  82  p-SER dans le total Share of RES-E in the total part du T-SER dans le total Share of RES-T in the total part de la C-SER dans le total  Share of RES-H in the total  % énergie SER/Consommation CFB % Renewable energy/Gross final consumption  Having achieved 12.6% in 2017, Wallonia has exceeded the Burden Sharing targets set for Belgium as a whole, i.e. 15,341 GWh with a target of 14,850 GWh.  ii. Indicative projections of development with existing policies and measures for the year 2030  The share of renewable energy sources (RES) increases from 10.74% (44) in 2015 to 12.98% in 2030 in a constant-policy scenario. The rate of development varies by sector and subsector.  Figure 8: Trend in the share of renewable energy sources in the WEM scenario   Share of renewable energy sources WEM WEM  With regard to the generation of renewable electricity, the green certificates mechanism is taken into account up to 2024 and results in increasing renewable electricity generation up to that year, after which it stabilises (if the green certificates support mechanism is not continued after 2024), except for small-scale photovoltaic systems. All existing renewable installations in 2014 are assumed to continue operating over the projection period, except for the AWIRS 4 biomass plant, which is expected to shut down after 2020.                                                             44 12.6% in 2017. 83 Figure 9: Renewable electricity generation by subsector (WEM)  Electricité renouvelable (GWh)  par filière Renewable electricity (GWh)  by subsector Biomasse  cogeneration Biomass  cogeneration Biomasse  électricité uniquement Biomass  electricity only Géothermie Geothermal energy Hydraulique Hydroelectric power Photovoltaique Photovoltaics Eolien on shore Onshore wind WEM WEM  Renewable electricity generation mainly involves wind power, biomass (whether or not through cogeneration) and photovoltaics. The production of renewable heat increases slightly in each subsector. Cogeneration is encouraged through the green certificates mechanism, with the other subsectors also being developed through existing support mechanisms and energy performance obligations.
