Analysis  electricity sector Reliability of supply The quality of the electricity supply in Luxembourg is very high, even when compared to Europe. The average outage duration per point of use and per year was 21.8 minutes in 201718.  Gross electricity production The data on gross electricity production based on (small-scale) gas-powered cogeneration plants in the past were gathered from the monitoring conducted by ILR19. The expected electricity production from gas was updated to 220 GWh/year in accordance with the status quo. Other data are from the reference scenario.

Together with the domestic electricity production on the basis of decentralised gas-fired power plants, it amounted to around 690 GWh in 2015. In 2020 to 2040, an increase of around 2.55 TWh is expected according to the reference scenario. In addition to the types of production listed in Table 14, the Vianden pumped storage power plant is also worth mentioning. With a production capacity of 1.3 GW and a storage capacity of around                                                            18 , Année 2017 - Partie I 19 - Partie I  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 152   5,000 power plants and it makes a significant contribution to system flexibility and security of supply in the wider region. It serves, inter alia, as a valuable compensation tool for production ratios and forecasting errors in renewable energy production, as well as for network stabilisation measures.  Import dependency The import dependency is the result of gross electricity consumption minus domestic production. Table 15 shows the projections regarding gross electricity consumption, both in ktoe and TWh20. Since it is expected that there will be a considerable increase in renewable energy production in Luxembourg by 2040, with only a minor increase in gross electricity production, the import dependency is expected to reduce accordingly from just under 90% in 2015 to 60% in 2040. Luxembourg mainly imports electricity from Germany; more than 75% of its electricity is sourced from there.  In terms of electricity consumption, this presentation does not take account of the fact that larger electricity consumers could settle in Luxembourg in the near to medium term.

The security of supply in Luxembourg therefore also depends on the security of supply in the rest of Europe. Various studies, such as the Generation Adequacy Assessment (GAA) of the Pentalateral                                                            20 In principle, the EU Commission templates stipulate ktoe as the unit.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 153   Energy Forum or the Mid-Term Adequacy Forecast (MAF) of the ENTSO-E (see Section 3.3.ii.), are currently under way, which draw conclusions about security of supply not only for individual countries but also for the entire model region. Since the security of supply in Luxembourg depends in particular on the available production capacities of neighbouring countries, this approach can also be used to directly predict the security of supply in Luxembourg. This involves mapping probabilities, including the availability of renewable energy production installations, unplanned failures of equipment or lines or the temperature dependency of the demand. One key result is the determination of country-specific LOLE (Loss Of Load Expectation) values. The LOLE values indicate the number of hours in a year that supply cannot be covered by capacities and imports. Depending on the scenario and the model, low, although positive, LOLE values have been calculated for Luxembourg. This positive starting point is linked in particular to the fact that measures are also planned in Germany in the medium to long term to ensure security of supply (e.g. through the development of renewable energy and, if necessary, reserve capacity). In contrast, the recent situation has been rather tense for France and Belgium, but this has had comparatively less impact on Luxembourg. When comparing the results of these studies, no considerable risks are expected for Luxembourg in terms of security of supply over the short term. In the long term, too, the expected LOLE values are below the limit values normally set in Europe, but this situation should be kept under close observation. This is particularly the case since the security of supply situation in the region as a whole could become more critical during this time than it is at present. This is because it is not possible to entirely rule However, it should be noted that state measures for safeguarding the security of supply (in particular the capacity market that has been introduced in France and the recently announced capacity market in Belgium) may have an impact in the period up to 2023 or 2025. It should also be noted that the development of renewable energy will also contribute to security of supply, for example through relatively stable offshore wind injections in the North Sea region. In addition, an actual scarcity of options to cover demand is also likely to be met with market reactions such as the tapping of load flexibility potential. Since the tapping of such potential is possible over the relatively short term, it is not yet or at least not fully included in the studies mentioned above.  4.4.2. Analysis  gas sector Gas extraction and storage Luxembourg does not extract any of its own gas. It covers its gas demand via the transport networks of the upstream network operators in Belgium and Germany, which in turn provide access to the production sites in the North Sea, Russia, Qatar, the Netherlands, etc. The supplies are handled via the network operators  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 154   and/or via trading and supplying companies. Precise details on the commercial fulfilment of demand are not available. Luxembourg likewise has no domestic gas reservoirs. Therefore, the required working gas volume and the corresponding injection and withdrawal capacities in other countries are used, in particular in the supply and transit countries from which or via which the gas is also procured.  Import dependency Since Luxembourg does not extract or store any gas, it is completely reliant on imports. The amount imported depends exclusively on the gas consumption. While in 2014 Luxembourg procured the gas in nearly equal shares from Germany and Belgium, in 2017 the majority, at 81%, was imported from Belgium 21.  Table 16: Gas import dependency of Luxembourg  2017 2020 2030 2040 Gas consumption [ktoe]  770.2     773.5     784.5    795.6    Gas consumption [TWh]  8.96     9.00     9.12    9.25    Import dependency [%] 100% 100% 100% 100%   Relevant risks The high import dependency means that security of supply in Luxembourg is highly dependent on the neighbouring European countries. Supply bottlenecks in neighbouring countries and Europe as a whole therefore also directly affect Luxembourg. In the neighbouring countries of Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and France, there are, in principle, sufficient gas storage capacities to also cover the storage requirement for supplying the customers in Luxembourg, at least in the event of short-term supply bottlenecks. By contrast, the line capacities are of a sufficient size to maintain the supply of particularly protected customers even in the event of a disruption to the largest network connection point. On account of the currently low demand for natural gas, in particular due to the decommissioning of the GuD power plant, the technical capacities  at least at the German border  are not being fully booked by Creos and are therefore available as guaranteed, uninterruptible capacities. According to Creos, however, it is possible                                                            21; ILR, Chiffres Clés du Marché du gaz naturel, Année 2017 - Partie I  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 155   that these capacities may need to be booked again in the event of changes to gas demand in order to safeguard security of supply. The reduction in gas consumption by 2040 and beyond will also implicitly improve the security of supply situation.  On the basis of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Luxembourg forms regional partnerships with its direct neighbours in order to safeguard security of supply and draws up risk assessments and prevention and emergency plans on a rolling basis. In addition, the regulation provides for coordination and solidarity measures beyond the mechanisms of the gas market on the basis of bilateral intergovernmental agreements in the event of supply crises. Although Luxembourg is already pursuing close intergovernmental coordination through the joint gas market with Belgium, additional intergovernmental agreements could further increase security of supply by means of coordinated emergency measures.    Since gas, like other fossil fuels in Luxembourg, is also used extensively for heating and cooling, Luxembourg is pushing for an increase in energy efficiency as well as the increased use of renewable energy for heating and cooling. Among other things, this should also reduce the import dependency of third countries.
