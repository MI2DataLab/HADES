2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 61 2.4 INTERNAL ENERGY MARKET DIMENSION for the Internal Energy Market dimension respond to the need for a more competitive, transparent, flexible and non-discriminatory energy market with a high degree of interconnection that promotes cross-border trade and contributes to energy security.  At the same time, this market must be focused on consumers and their protection while establishing the necessary conditions to ensure a just transition and address situations of energy poverty.  These objectives are addressed in the following areas (the electric and gas markets are specifically dealt with in each one):   interconnectivity;  energy transmission infrastructure;  integration of the internal energy market;  implementation of the National Strategy against Energy Poverty. In relation to the interconnectivity of the electricity market, the interconnections not only improve efficiency of the systems by contributing to a more efficient allocation of generation installations, thus reducing the need for duplicate installations on both sides of the borders, but they are essential for security of supply  particularly in a scenario of high penetration of electricity generation from non-dispatchable renewable sources.  They are also the essential element for achieving an internal electricity market with competitive and homogeneous prices, since they allow supply to be increased (through imports) to those markets where, at a certain time, and depending on existing weather, technical and economic conditions, the price is relatively high, thus moderating prices and bringing them closer to those in export markets at that time.  The economic benefits derived from an adequate degree of electricity interconnection include the following:  o savings in investments to reinforce the transport and distribution network; o lower costs derived from the guarantee of immediate services through balancing energies that are mobilised effectively; o minor discharges of renewable energy (loss of income for producers due to energy being generated that is not consumed, nor can it be exported); o lower cost of risk coverage compared to the higher volatility of the market price. In this regard, the level of interconnection of the Iberian electricity system with the rest of the European continent is below the targets established by EU legislation. Currently, the interconnection ratio of Spain is less than 5% of the generation capacity installed in our system. Moreover, if one considers that the Iberian Peninsula can only actually be supported by the Central European system through the French border, the interconnection ratio is 2.8% (after the last interconnection between Spain and France through the eastern Pyrenees, which was put into   2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 62 Additional and more specific thresholds that serve as indicators of the urgency of the necessary networks (COM(2017) 718) (see Figure 2.12), and recalled in Regulation 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, are also not met. These thresholds are:  1. annual price differential exceeding EUR 2/MWh; 2. nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30% of peak load; 3. nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30% of installed renewable generation capacity.  Figure 2.12. Situation regarding the three thresholds included in document COM(2017) 71833   meets all three thresholds  meets two of the thresholds  meets one threshold or none Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019  In short, in 2020 and with the planned interconnections, Spain will be the only country in continental Europe falling below 10% (a target set by the Barcelona European Council in 2002). Subsequently that target was raised to 15% for 2030.   Electricity interconnection  Achieving an interconnection level of 15% by 2030  Apart from the measures proposed in Chapter 3, it is important to remember the role of indicative planning, which is a basic tool for safeguarding security of supply, increasing the penetration of renewables and reducing technical restrictions on networks. Its main objectives include increasing the level of interconnections.                                                            33 threshold of EUR transmission capacity of interconnectors is below 30% of their peak load should urgently investigate options of further renewable generation capaci 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 63 In the electricity system, the integration of a significant volume of renewable generation capacity, both on the mainland and in non-peninsular territories, requires reinforcing and expanding the transmission and distribution lines in Spanish territory. This includes existing connections between the mainland and non-peninsular systems and interconnections between island systems. In addition, submarine electricity transmission infrastructure to planned offshore wind farm locations should be considered and planned, in coordination with the Marine Strategies, Maritime Spatial Planning Plans and the applicable sectoral administrative procedures. Likewise, it is necessary to develop management and storage mechanisms for non-dispatchable renewable energies in order to allow the reduction of the discharge of renewable generation.  In the specific case of island territories, the increase in interconnections within their electricity systems will have a direct impact, since coal, fuel or diesel power plants make a greater contribution to the generation mix in these systems than in the mainland mix.  Finally, it is important to highlight the role of the specific control centre of the electricity system operator (Red Eléctrica de España), which optimises the proper integration of renewable energies, cogeneration and waste, allowing them to be monitored in the face of possible variability in predictions and their integration into the balancing services.   Electric transmission infrastructure Integration of renewables and reinforcement in non-peninsular territories.  Integration of the electricity market  Making the market work optimally.  This objective is to be achieved through the storage of electrical energy, the optimisation of the use of water resources and providing information to consumers.  With reference to the gas market, the focus is also on strengthening and developing the market while at the same time protecting the consumer. In this market, optimising the use of the existing interconnection capacity in order to facilitate access to other gas sources and move towards price convergence before developing new infrastructures is considered a priority. This objective will contribute to a reduced gas bill for consumers.  The measures envisaged to optimise the use of interconnections include developing coherent methodologies at regional level for calculating fees for their use, thereby eliminating the current lack of uniformity. In this respect, ACER analyses the use of the interconnection between France and Spain in its Market Monitoring Report tariffs at VIP [Virtual Interconnection Point] Pyrenees are among the highest in the EU. This is the Spanish gas system is 2.5 times higher than the exit tariff from the Spanish gas system. 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 64 Figure 2.13.

VIP Pyrenees/Iberian Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019  Gas transmission infrastructure: Tariffs and fees  Considering the maturity of the gas system infrastructure, the main objective is to maintain the submitted for public consultation the Circulars through which it will approve, firstly, the methodologies for calculating the payment of the operators of the installations and, secondly, the tariffs and fees to be paid for their use. The energy policy guidelines previously adopted by MITECO   Electricity sector expenditure structure: gradual elimination of outstanding debt  With regard to the status of the outstanding debts in the electricity system from previous years, it should be noted that Article 19 of Law 24/2013 of 26 December 2013 on the Electricity Sector establishes that in the event of a shortfall in income during a financial year, the corresponding tariffs or charges must be revised.  In this regard, work is being done on the new structure and methodology for tariffs, to be implemented by the CNMC and the new structure and methodology for charges, to be implemented by the Government, and which will be subject to the provisions of Law24/2013.  Therefore, the economic balance of the electricity system is expected to be maintained throughout the course of the INECP, and the payment of annuities for the deficit from previous financial years to end completely in 2028. The evolution of charges in the electricity system, which include the outstanding deficit annuity, are shown in the following graph:   2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 65 Figure 2.14. Evolution of electricity system charges 2018-2030   Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019    Integration of the gas market  Strengthening the market, ensuring the protection of gas consumers  This general objective, in turn, is translated into specific objectives for gas logistics, consumer information and streamlining of administrative procedures.  In relation to the integration of the Spanish and European markets, one of the main tools is optimising the use of interconnections by means of a homogeneous methodology for calculating tariffs for using them, as well as achieving an organised gas market covering the Iberian region, through the conclusion of an international agreement between Spain and Portugal.   Protecting vulnerable consumers  implementation of the National Strategy against Energy Poverty.  The National Strategy against Energy Poverty, which was approved in 2019, is an instrument that enables the phenomenon of energy poverty to be addressed with an integrated approach and a medium- and long-term vision.  The Strategy provides a definition of energy poverty and, in relation to it, of a vulnerable consumer. It has made an initial diagnosis and has characterised the problem by designing official measurement indicators in line with those used by the European Observatory on Energy Poverty (EPOV), which will allow comparison with other Member States. The indicators are available from the consolidated surveys prepared by the National Statistics Institute (Family Budget Survey and Living Conditions Survey). The key indicators are: EVOLUTION OF CHARGES 2018-2030 (BAU scenario)   RENEWABLES, COGENERATION AND  TOTAL 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 66 Disproportionate expenditure: percentage of households whose energy expenditure in relation to their income is more than double the national average. 1. Hidden energy poverty (HEP): percentage of households whose absolute energy expenditure is less than half the national average. 2. Inability to maintain the home at an adequate temperature. 3. Delayed payment of bills for household supplies.  Additionally, the analysis of these indicators is supplemented with others based in the climatic zone, as well as by variables that characterise the selected populations (size and type of household, income quintile of the consumption unit, activity status of the members of the household unit, etc.).  The IDAE, a public business entity attached to MITECO through the State Secretariat for Energy, has been designated as the body responsible for monitoring and updating the indicators for measuring fuel poverty in Spain.  By 15 October each year, the IDAE will publish the result of the primary indicators in the year in question and a comparative analysis with the other EU Member States.
