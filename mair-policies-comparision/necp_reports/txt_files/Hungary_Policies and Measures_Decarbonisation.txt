 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES Annex 1 includes detailed information relating to the policies and measures; this chapter only provides a summarised overview. 3.1. Dimension of decarbonisation 3.1.1. GHG emissions and removals i. Policies and measures to achieve the target set under Regulation (EU) 2018/842 as referred in point 2.1.1 and policies and measures to comply with Regulation (EU) 2018/841, covering all key emitting sectors and sectors for the enhancement of removals, with an outlook to the long-term vision and goal to become a low emission economy and achieving a balance between emissions and removals in accordance with the Paris Agreement GHG emissions in the energy industry (generation of electricity and heat, petroleum processing, production of solid energy resources) are determined by the quantity of energy used in processes and the unit emission factor of energy sources. GHG emissions can be reduced by decreasing the quantity of consumed energy, increasing the use of renewable energy sources, and by replacing fossil energy sources - with a higher emission factor - with nuclear energy or with other energy sources with lower emission factors. Chapters 3.1.2 and 3.2 present measures aimed specifically at increasing use of renewable energy and improving energy efficiency, while Chapter 3.1.3 describes measures relating to the decarbonisation of transport. Among the instruments financed with the Economic Development and Innovation Operational Programme (EDIOP) and the Competitive Central Hungary Operational Programme (CCHOP), the credit scheme of the Hungarian Development Bank, in the exclusive ownership of the Hungarian State, is worth noting, which aims to provide funds necessary for building energy performance investments serving the improved energy performance of buildings in the retail sector. The credit is offered to private persons, apartment blocks and housing co-operatives, subject to a minimum 10 % own contribution, serving, inter alia, the upgrading, insulation of heating systems, the replacement of doors/windows, and the installation of renewable sources of energy, i.e. PV panels, solar thermal collectors, heat pumps and modern wood gasification equipment. The repayable amount of credit is minimised at HUF 500 000 and maximised at HUF 10 million for private persons, and HUF 7 million for apartment blocks and housing co-operatives, per dwelling. The credit has a maturity of maximum 20 years, with 0 % interest. In addition to programmes supporting energy efficiency and renewable energy, the maintaining of nuclear capacities plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Pursuant to the intergovernmental agreement between Hungary and the Russian Federation, two new nuclear power plant units will be built in Hungary by 2030, each with a capacity of 1 200 MW (Paks 2 project). Point iii. of Chapter 3.1.3 covers transport measures.   We currently plan to reduce agricultural emissions by prescribing correct agricultural practices and with various aid schemes. Act CLXXXV of 2012 on waste sets out general rules of waste management. The currently prepared new waste management strategy will define waste management targets and measures for the post-2020 period. To increase CO2 sink capacities we will significantly increase the share of areas covered by forest and other tree stock consistently with the National Forest Strategy; to maintain the CO2 sequestration capacity of forests we will improve the resilience of forests against environmental factors. Beyond the foregoing, fulfilment of our objectives will also be served by the programme aimed at establishing an energy and climate literate society, based on energy and climate literacy enhancing campaigns targeting different age groups and educational awareness raising measures focussing on younger generations. Within the framework of adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change, the National Adaptation Strategy (NAS)  referred to in above Chapter 2.1.1.i.  plans to integrate climate change, as an absolute boundary condition, in the following policy and action areas up to 2030, taking into account aspects of nature conservation and landscape protection: - human health, - water resources management, - disaster management and security policy, - agriculture and rural development, - landscape protection and nature conservation, - forest management, - built environment (spatial and urban development, spatial and urban planning, municipal infrastructure), - energy management, - tourism.  ii. Regional cooperation in this field, if applicable Supporting the implementation of Hungary's National Climate Change Strategy The project under preparation consists of two elements, both of which serve implementation of the National Climate Change Strategy of Hungary. The first element focusses on the national monitoring, evaluation and  reporting framework related to energy and climate policy, while the second one deals with aspects of environmental impact assessment. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency is participating in the project in cooperation with the Mining and Geological Survey of Hungary and the MIT.  Western Balkans Green Fund Project leading role in the development of projects of Western Balkan countries52 related to their Nationally Determined Commitments and climate adaptation objectives, and allows Hungarian undertakings to access more tender opportunities within the region. The Western Balkans is an emerging region of Europe where economic growth exceeded the average EU rate in 2017. Notwithstanding the positive trends, some of the challenges and risks are still rooted in extreme climatic events and environmental pollution. Such risks, however, may also encourage the introduction of new, efficient technologies and methods to ensure a greener and more sustainable future in the Western Balkan region. The project supports the transformation process, aims at the inclusion of Hungarian companies, and may provide assistance in meeting the EU accession obligations of countries in the Western Balkan region, in addition to enhancing the provision of services with high added value and the trade in goods. The Project approved by way of Government Decision No 1770/2018 of 21 December 2018 consists of two phases. The Hungarian-financed Nyugat-Balkáni Zöld Központ Nonprofit Kft. was established in the first phase in 2019, which aims to finance preparation of low-budget projects and create tender opportunities for Hungarian companies in areas where Hungarian companies are traditionally strong (e.g. preparation of large-volume projects, technical design, engineering works, drafting of business plans etc.). In the second phase of the project, in 2021, a fundonors, operating with a significantly larger budget, offering financial instruments considerably more refined than the non-refundable aids. Upon the Hungarian initiative, beyond the offers of other governments involved, the Multidonor Fund will also mobilise market capital to finance green technology transfers and low-emission, climate-friendly investments that support adaptation. The Multidonor Fund can operate effectively mainly in fields and in medium-scale investments that fall outside of the focus of major international  e.g. EBRD, Green Climate Fund, World Bank, European Investment Bank  and national funds active in the region, by seeking synergies with them. iii. If applicable, without prejudice to the applicability of State aid rules, financing measures, including EU support and the use of EU funds, in this area at national level                                                        52 Republic of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of Kosovo, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Republic of Serbia.  Decarbonisation efforts are currently significantly supported by operational programmes implemented with EU funds, including the Environmental and Energy Efficiency Operational Programme (EEEOP), Economic Development and Innovation Operational Programme (EDIOP), Competitive Central Hungary Operational Programme (CCHOP), Integrated Transport Development Operational Programme (ITDOP) and the Rural Development Operational Programme (RDOP). The goals of the programmes include increased use of renewable energy, improvement of energy efficiency, support of sustainable mobility, development of waste management and waste water treatment, and supporting protection of forest resources and forestation. In the third trading period (2013-2020) of the EU emissions trading scheme, a specific share of revenue from the sale of emission allowances (50 % of EUA III allowance sales, 100 % of EUAA aviation allowance sales) is used for budget appropriation managed under the Green Economy Financing Scheme chapter. The REAS scheme  described under point 3.1.2  plays a key role on the Hungarian energy market by supporting electricity produced from renewable energy sources.  3.1.2. Renewable energy i. In relation to renewable energy, policies and measures necessary for implementing the national contribution to the mandatory EU target set for 2030, the trajectories referred to in subpoint (2) of Article 4(a), and - if applicable or available - elements referred to in point 2.1.2, including sector and technology specific measures53 Beyond information provided in point 3.1.1, the following policies and measures support fulfilment of the renewable energy objectives. The increase in electricity generation for the grid in Hungary was primarily boosted by the feed-in system (FIS) until the end of 2016, which provides operational support (guaranteed feed-in tariff higher than the market price). This system was replaced by the Renewable Energy Aid Scheme (REAS) in 2017, which also provides operational support and supports the market integration of renewable energy generation as well. In addition supporting the construction of new units, the REAS also supports the use of renewable energy (so-called brown bonus). To ensure cost-effective levels of aid, in the future aid within the REAS framework will only be available through technology-neutral renewable capacity tenders; production aid will be available within the conventional feed-in system only for experimental technologies and model projects. The funds we plan to offer to electricity producers using weather-dependent renewable resources are competitive with credit products available to foreign producers.                                                       53 When planning these measures, Member States must take into account the end of the life-cycles of existing installations and the potential for repowering.  REAS aid is provided for the generation of renewable electricity, except for the brown bonus, which is related to new investment, and implementation is not commenced before application for the aid. Multi-fuel firing power plants and waste incinerator power plants are eligible for aid only for the share of electricity generated from renewable energy sources (in proportion to fuel heat). Under the REAS scheme, aid aimed at the installation of capacities of at least 1 MW is awarded only under artificially established competition. Within the framework of the REAS green bonus tender, aid is available not only to newly invested power plant units, but also to existing power plant units undergoing major overhaul or an upgrade in excess of 50 % of the original initial investment cost. The amount of aid available under the REAS scheme depends on the production capacities of the given power plant. Within the REAS category of feed-in aid (REAS-FIS), power plants with a capacity of less than 0.5 MW are eligible (except for wind). In relation to these power plants, produced energy is received by MAVIR Zrt. from producers (feed-in) and sold on the regulated electricity market operated by HUPX Zrt. Pursuant to legislation in force on the date of the NECP, a maximum annual amount of HUF 45 billion in new aid may be allocated within the framework of the REAS up to 2026. To increase electricity generation based on renewable energy sources, it is necessary to ensure the cost-effectiveness of integrating renewable investment, to maintain the security of supply and system dispatchability, and to prepare the electricity grid for the cost-effective integration of decentralised capacities. The nearly zero energy building performance level applicable after 2020 to newly built immovable property prescribes an average 25 % share of renewable energy, thus production facilities currently defined as a household-scale power plant are expected to further grow at an exponential rate. As regards individual heating, the solutions using heat pumps and efficient biomass. Hungary encourages the installation of PV systems to partially supply private electricity consumption. We aim to have at least 200 000 households with roof-mounted PV panels with an average capacity of 4 kW by 2030. -benefit analysis of high-sent to the European Commission on 24 October 2017, the replacement of existing natural gas based district heat generation with renewable heat generation is justified. The above project cannot be implemented in Hungary on a market basis  it can only be supported with substantial investment aid. In the 20142020 period, the construction of heat generating facilities based on renewable energy sources receives investment aid in Hungary, which contributes to the significant increase in biomass based and geothermal generation of district heat. In the future the construction of new biomass and geothermal district heat generation capacities will be encouraged in this field with high-intensity non-refundable aid after the 20142020 programming period as well. Hungary also aims to facilitate the use of energy from non-recyclable waste for district heat generation.  Implementation of the Green District Heating Programme and increased consumption of energy recovered from waste water treatment, landfill gas and agricultural biogas play a key role in replacing natural gas and increasing use of renewable energy on the Hungarian heat market (greening of the district heating sector by increasing recovery of geothermal energy, biomass and waste for heating/cooling). Encouraging use of these resources will be developed for each larger district heating zone, based on a detailed analysis, in consideration of local characteristics. To implement the programme it is necessary to review current district heating price controls. The review of price controls will be followed by the establishment of conditions of competition on the district heat market. Hungary will encourage use of heat pumps and the burning of biomass in efficient individual heating equipment to satisfy the heating and cooling needs of modern buildings. We encourage the establishment of biogas plants processing agricultural waste to both satisfy local heat demand and to feed in purified biomethane to the natural gas network. Point iii. of Chapter 3.1.3 covers transport measures. ii. Where relevant, specific measures for regional cooperation, as well as, as an option, the estimated excess production of energy from renewable sources that could be transferred to other Member States in order to achieve the national contribution and trajectories referred to in point 2.1.2 Within the framework of the EU budget for the period between 2021 and 2027, the CEF54 programme supports investment in European infrastructure networks in the transport, energy and telecommunications sectors. Synergies between the three sectors and growing cross-border competition in the field of renewable energy are key areas of the CEF after 2020 that aim to speed up digitalisation and decarbonisation in the EU economy.  Five EU Member States neighbour Hungary, therefore we are focussing on exploring the potential for joint projects implemented within the framework of the CEF and are open to cooperation with neighbouring countries. iii. Specific measures on financial support, where applicable, including Union support and the use of Union funds, for the promotion of the production and use of energy from renewable sources in electricity, heating and cooling, and transport The REAS scheme  taking effect 1 January 2017  plays a key role on the Hungarian energy market by supporting electricity produced from renewable energy sources.55 (Point i. of Chapter 3.1.2 provides details on                                                       54 Connecting Europe Facility 55 HEA (2017): Information on the new Renewable Energy Support Scheme (REAS). Hungarian Energy and Public Utility Regulatory Authority (HEA). November 2017   the REAS scheme.) Support of the installation of PV panels aimed at replacing electricity consumption for private purposes and at community level is planned jointly with refundable aids of operational programmes in the 2021-2027 programming period. In relation to local cooling and heating, encouraging the use of heat pumps, burning of biomass in efficient individual heating equipment, and the establishment of decentralised community heating plants producing renewable energy is implemented with non-refundable aids. The supply of district heating based on renewable energy and its energy efficient upgrade can be encouraged with non-refundable aid of operational programmes in the 20212027 period, carbon credit revenues and revenues of the Modernisation Fund launched in 2021. We are also planning to introduce heat storage aid (and possibly FIS-type aid during the heating period) for efficient co-generated district heating. The establishment of biogas plants processing agricultural waste should be encouraged with refundable aids in the 2021-2027 period. The further spread of solar power stations and biomass power plants is supported by the operating aids of the REAS scheme, while the spread of geothermal power plants may also be encouraged by the pilot project relating to the Geothermal Guarantee Fund to be launched in 2020 during the period of the Swiss-Hungarian Cooperation Programme II. In case of positive experience relating to the pilot project, investment aid may also be considered with non-reimbursable funds of the relevant operational programmes in the 2021-2027 programming period. From 2021 the Modernisation Fund could provide some of the funds not covered by network access fees, necessary for the system integration of weather-dependent renewables; carbon credit revenues will finance the implementation of a reliable meteorological forecasting system  covering a large area  for efficient scheduling of weather-dependent renewables producers. From 2021 the non-refundable funds of the operational programmes and the Modernisation Fund will support the spread of seasonal electricity storage and battery energy storage, network upgrades and implementation of smart networks. Demand-side regulation and related funding of smart metering promoting network flexibility will be implemented with non-refundable aids under the relevant operational programmes of the 2021-2027 period. The energy development  based on renewable energy, aimed at reducing natural gas consumption  of power-to-gas production (biomethane, hydrogen), municipalities, parts of municipalities, pilot projects planned for testing complex consumer DSR solutions, independent aggregators and renewable communities, and for promoting the flexibility of the distribution network and integration of renewable producers can be implemented with carbon credit funds.                                                                                                                                                                                   (mekh.hu/download/e/fc/40000/mekh_metar_tajekoztato_2017_nov.pdf)  In the transport sector, implementation of the necessary electric charging infrastructure, development of second generation biofuels and promotion of carriage of goods on road with alternative propulsion, and the replacement of the light commercial vehicle fleet of the postal service or other (public) services with clean vehicles is possible with non-refundable aids of relevant operational programmes in the 2021-2027 programming period. Transport electrification and implementation of the infrastructure necessary for development could also be financed with credit offered on the market and by the European Investment Bank. The funding of public transportation by road with alternative propulsion could be implemented with carbon credit revenues, while the government electric fleet could be expanded with national budgetary funds. Funds of the European Clean Mobility Fund (as part of the CEF) are also available to fund sustainable and innovative transport. iv. Where applicable, assessment of the support of electricity from renewable energy sources which Member States are to provide pursuant to Article 6(4) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 The REAS scheme supporting production of renewable electricity  presented in the above point  is continuously evaluated; new tenders are launched on the basis of such evaluation. The first invitation to tender was published in September 2019. The successful REAS tender demonstrated that the amount of necessary aid is adjusted to declining investment costs. v. Specific measures to introduce one or more contact points, rationalise administrative procedures, provide information and training, and to facilitate energy purchase agreements Summary of policies and measures within the support framework to be established by Member States to promote and facilitate the development of autoproduction and renewable energy communities pursuant to Article 21(6) and Article 22(5) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 Hungary will encourage initiatives that ensure the local consumption of electricity. In this regard the support of developing energy communities is a priority; the energy community  as a separate consumer-producer unit and settled entity  should be clearly defined in regulation. In relation to the above it is also necessary to define in regulation a community metering point in addition to the metering point of production-consumption. It is a priority to extend net metering (or an equivalent incentive programme) to apartment blocks, as the means of the distribution of produced energy beyond the sole connection point is irrelevant in terms of the distribution network. The programme also contributes to reducing network losses. Laying the groundwork for establishing communities within the transformer zones is a second-lev-level goal.  As regards the establishment of renewable energy communities, the question of vulnerable consumers and the security of supply is assigned a priority; the legal environment should allow even a miniature-scale district heating zone to fulfil these two criteria.   vi. Assessment of the necessity to build new infrastructure for district heating and cooling produced from renewable sources The role of economical and environmentally friendly district heating should be enhanced. As a first step, it is necessary to rationalise the existing district heating system by optimising production capacities. Hungary aims to establish the infrastructural conditions necessary for increasing the utilisation rate and heat output of district heating generating facilities based on renewable energy sources. It is also important to complete the modernisation of the consumer side. The transition of energy production to biomass or geothermal heat sources can be achieved with the introduction of incentives after professional consultations. In parallel with existing district heating systems typically operating in large cities, with favourable legal and economic conditions it is necessary to promote the implementation new, small-scale, local systems based on self-supply. within the framework of energy communities. In addition to enhancing self-supply and energy independence, it is also important to guarantee economy and energy security to connecting entities (institutions, private persons, undertakings) when developing local district heating zones.  vii. Where applicable, specific measures on the promotion of the use of energy from biomass, especially for new biomass mobilisation, taking into account:  biomass availability, including sustainable biomass: both domestic potential and imports from third countries  other biomass use by other sectors (agriculture and forestry-based sectors); and measures aimed at the sustainability of biomass production and use The Forest Act ensures by law and requires that the forest owner replace its cleared forest in the quality and by the deadline prescribed for such forest, thereby guaranteeing the sustainability of forests and the continuous provision of their services at national level. Hungarian forest management is essentially compliant with criteria prescribed in the RED II Directive56. Beyond the obligation of forest regeneration, the legality of logging is grounded in forest planning and the forest supervision system. Most protected natural areas of national priority were declared protected decades ago. Pursuant to the statutory provision in force from 1997, their nature conservation management plans must be promulgated by law. The nature conservation management requirements of ministerial decrees setting out the nature conservation management plan must be included in the district forest plans comprising the basis for forest management. Competent (forestry, nature conservation) authorities verify enforcement of the forest plan                                                       56 Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (recast) (text with EEA relevance).  (including measures aimed at preventing damage to soil). Since the place of production serves as a basis for choosing tree species, in the course of regenerating forests, tree stocks suitable for and preferably most effectively utilising the place of production (capable of adaptation to future changes) are used to ensure the long-term maintenance of forests, and the conservation and repair of their productivity.  3.1.3. Other elements of the dimension i. Where applicable, national policies and measures affecting the EU ETS sector and assessment of the complementarity and impacts on the EU ETS Currently Hungary is not applying additional policies complementing the EU ETS.  10c. (in 2013 and between 2021 and 2030) and Article 27(a)(3) (from 2021) of Directive 2003/87/EC. Hungary is also eligible for funds of the Modernisation Fund.  ii. Policies and measures to achieve other national targets, if applicable iii. Policies and measures to achieve low emission mobility (including the electrification of transport) We plan to reduce GHG emissions in the transport sector by increasing the blending ratio of biofuel, supporting the spread of electric motor vehicles and by encouraging the use of low-emission transport solutions. The Electromobility Act enacted in 2019 aims to regulate electromobility services. The act defines electromobility services, related licensing, and reporting obligations and rules. Hungary is currently also supporting the spread of electric vehicles with financial instruments. Private persons and undertakings are offered aid for purchasing electric cars and goods vehicles under 3.5 tonnes. Aid is maximised at 21 % of the price or HUF 1.5 million. Additionally, funds of the Green Economy Financing Scheme are used to implement other programmes promoting the use of electromobility. The substance of programmes and form of financing instruments changes year to year. In addition, fully electric cars, cars partially rechargeable in electrical networks, and zero-emission cars are exempt from motor vehicle tax, company car tax and registration tax. The rate of motor vehicle tax levied on buses, trucks and goods vehicles is also determined by the environmental classification of the vehicle. Goods vehicles are eligible for additional tax advantages when carrying out combined goods transport. The environmental classification of motor vehicles also determines the rate of the company car tax and registration tax. In conformity with the Jedlik Ányos Plan 2.0, in the future we also plan to promote the spread of electric vehicles and implementation of the necessary infrastructure by means of regulatory, tax policy and financial aid instruments.  The new regulation57 adopted by the Government ensures that by 2020 the share of biocomponents in fuels will increase to 8.2 % (to 6.1 % in petrol). In the future we plan to encourage both the use and domestic production of advanced, second generation biofuels. To reduce increasing energy consumption in transport, it is also essential to develop and increase the use of public transportation, and to offer the carriage of goods by rail as a realistic option for freighting. Within the framework of the Green Bus Programme adopted by the Government, around 1 300 environmentally friendly local buses are expected to enter service by 2029. In the initial years the programme will a-6 modern diesel buses, and will subsequently focus on electric vehicles. Beyond public transportation, natural gas and biogas could play a greater role in the carriage of goods. The Policy Framework for Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Development of Hungary defines measures concerning the development of infrastructure for alternative fuels. iv. Where applicable, national policies, timelines and measures planned to phase out energy subsidies, in particular for fossil fuels
