4.4 Dimension energy securityi. Current energy mix, domestic energy resources, import dependency, including relevant risksFinland is dependent on imported fuels. Accordingly, the cornerstones of Finnish energy policy are a diversified and reliable supply of energy and improved self-sufficiency. Energy-intensive basic industries, the cold climate and long distances 53 Report by Finnish Energy in 2015: https://energia.fi/ajankohtaista_ja_materiaalipankki/materiaalipankki/rakennusten_jaahdytysmarkkinat_-_tutkimushanke.html#material-view144underline the significance of energy for the wellbeing of Finland™s inhabitants and competitiveness.Until the 1960s, Finland™s energy policy relied on the electricity produced by hydropower stations and the extensive use of wood. Due to limited hydro resources, the use of coal and oil started to increase rapidly and the need to find new energy sources became clear. A gas pipeline from Russia to eastern Finland was completed in 1973 and later extended to the capital area and to some other cities. The first nuclear power plant unit was taken into use in 1977, followed by three other units in 1979 to 1982. A fifth unit is currently under construction and is expected to be completed in 2020 and sixth towards the end of 2020s. The 1970s also brought peat into the Finnish energy mix.In 2018, the total energy supply was 384 TWh. Finland™s domestic energy sources are wood-based fuels, hydropower, wind power, waste and peat. Its energy dependence, calculated as the proportion of imported net energy in the total primary energy supply (TPES), was 44 % in 2017. Figure 13 shows the current distribution of the different energy sources in the total energy supply.Nuclear energy27 %22 %17 %8 %6 %5 %5 %5 %5 %Wood fuelsOilCoalNatural gasPeatHydro and wind powerOthersNet import of electricityFigure 13.    The distribution of different energy sources in the total energy supply in 2018. Source: Statistics Finland.145Domestic electricity generation was 67.5 TWh in 2018. This consisted of combined heat and power production (32 %), both in connection with district heat production and by industry for its own use, nuclear power (32 %), hydro power (19 %), conventional condensing power (7 %) and wind power (9 %). Total electricity consumption was 87.4 TWh.The power system is interconnected with the power systems of Russia, Sweden, Norway and Estonia. Net imports from the Nordic countries, Baltic states and Russia vary considerably from year to year, mainly due to variations in hydropower production in the Nordic countries. Between 1990 and 2018, maximum net imports were 20.4 TWh (2017) while minimum net imports were 3.7 TWh (1996).The share of net imports of electricity has grown in recent years and about 2,000 MW of generation capacity has been shut down since 2010. The high share of net imports is not a problem in itself. Well-functioning regional and European electricity markets and sufficiently strong cross-border connections are the most efficient and cost-effective way of guaranteeing competitive electricity prices and security of supply. However, generation adequacy during winter peak hours is a concern before the commercial operation of Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power unit starts in 2020. Two simultaneous large failures over 1,200 MW (e.g. the largest generation unit and significant interconnector) on an especially cold winter day would create a situation where curtailment of demand could be needed54.In Finland, renewables accounted consistently for around 30 % of gross final energy consumption for the period 2000 to 2007, but the figure has increased in recent years, reaching 41 % in 2017. In 2010, an extensive package of specific targets concerning different renewable energy sources was launched in order to reach the EU 2020 renewable energy target set for Finland, i.e. 38 % of its gross final energy consumption. The package promotes the use of forest chips and other wood-based energy in particular, alongside wind power, the use of transport biofuels and increased utilisation of heat pumps. Since 2010, measures have been strengthened and adjusted when needed. Wood energy and wood pellets are exported and 54 Suomen sähkötehon riittävyys ja kapasiteettirakenteen kehitys vuoteen 2030, Pöyry Management Consulting Oy, 23.1.2015. https://tem.fi/documents/1410877/2717655/Suomen_sahkotehon_riittavyys_ja_kapasiteettirakenteen_kehitys_vuoteen_2030_2015.pdf/56b3f402-31fa-48a7-a6ef-d750e4665f78/Suomen_sahkotehon_riittavyys_ja_kapasiteettirakenteen_kehitys_vuoteen_2030_2015.pdf.pdf146imported to some extent, the net amount depending on the year is typically between -1 and +1 TWh.Combined heat and power production (CHP) provides opportunities for the cost-effective use of renewables both by industrial producers and at district heating plants. The amount of energy Finland saves annually through CHP approximately corresponds to one-tenth of all primary energy used in the country. CHP accounts for more than one third of all electricity production compared with the EU average of 12 %. Installed wind power capacity has been steadily increasing in Finland since 1990 as a result of the Government™s support measures. The capacity was only about 1 MW in 1992, whereas it had climbed to 82 MW in 2005 and reached 630 MW at the end of 2015. By the beginning of 2019, the installed wind power capacity had increased to 2,041 MW.For several decades the use of primary energy, as well as electricity increased and reached their peak values in 2006 to 2007. Demand rose faster than GDP until 1994. Thereafter, both the energy intensity and the electricity intensity of the economy have decreased. The decrease reflects the structural change in the economy from basic industry towards services and less energy-intensive industry. Furthermore, increased energy efficiency has contributed to the positive development of energy intensity. Figure 14 shows the historical development of the different energy sources in the period 2000 to 2018.ii. Projections of development with existing policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)As described in Chapter 4.2, the most significant future changes in the WEM projection in electricity and heat production are the two nuclear power plant units currently under construction and in the planning phase, respectively, and the increase of renewable energy sources, mainly wind power and biomass. District heat production from heat-only plants is expected to slightly increase its share at the expense of combined heat and power production, which is struggling with the feasibility due to low electricity prices. Figure 12 outlines the primary energy supply by energy source in the WEM projection until 2040.Figure 15 shows the projected development of self-sufficiency in total energy supply. Self-sufficiency is 55 % today and is expected to exceed 70 % by the end of 147the 2020s. The positive development is mainly due to increased use of domestic renewable energy and new nuclear power that reduce the need for imported fossil fuels and electricity imports.05010015020025030035040045020002010202020302040TWhNet import of electricityOthersPeatNatural gasCoalNuclear energyOilWood fuelsHydro and wind powerFigure 14.

Historical self-sufficiency in energy supply 2000 - 2017 and the projected development in the WEM projection until 2040.SKM Market Predictor estimates in its study29 that the projected electricity demand at peak load increases from 15,300 MW in 2020 to 16,200 MW in 2030. After the start of Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant unit, the margin between electricity supply and demand in terms of capacity decreases to about 1,620 MW in 2020. In the mid-2020s, generation adequacy may decline temporarily when some conventional condensing and CHP plants are likely to shut-down. The investment of Fennovoima Hanhikivi nuclear power plant is expected to increase generation adequacy again in the late 2020s despite constantly growing electricity consumption and peak demand. The operation permits of Loviisa 1 and 2 nuclear power units are in force until 2027 and 2030 respectively. Unless the operation permits of Loviisa nuclear power units are extended, the generation adequacy margin will again clearly decrease. In the projections, these two units are decommissioned in the late 2030s.
