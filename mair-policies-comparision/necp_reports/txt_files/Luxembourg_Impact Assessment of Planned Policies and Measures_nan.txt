Impact assessment of planned policies and measures In order to provide an impact assessment of the planned policies and measures described in Section 3, the Luxembourg government commissioned a consortium of consultants from the Fraunhofer Institute for System and Innovation Research (Fh-ISI), Consentec GmbH, the Institute for Resource Efficiency and Energy Strategies (IREES) and TU Wien  Energy Economics Group. The consortium supplemented and adapted the models already applied in previous projects concerning energy demand and energy supply to the given requirements in order to establish an analytical basis that is as robust as possible.  The model-based impact assessment of the planned policies and measures resulted in the target scenario presented in this section. In general, it should be noted that such modelling and the resulting projections do indeed serve as guidance, but are always subject to uncertainty. This is especially true in the case of small open economies, such as that of Luxembourg. As a result, individual decisions or decisions taken abroad or at European level can bring about significant changes to the target scenario sought.  This reservation must also be applied to the results of the macroeconomic assessment of the present energy and climate plan presented in Section 5.2.    and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 165   5.1. Impacts of the planned policies and measures described in Section 3 on the energy system and greenhouse gas emissions and removals The measures planned in Luxembourg show a very high level of ambition in terms of energy efficiency and therefore lead to a significant reduction in both final energy demand and CO2 emissions from the relevant sectors or applications, as this is accompanied by a shift away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy sources in addition to energy efficiency progress.  In the following, we look at the target scenario and discuss the resulting impacts on the energy system and greenhouse gas emissions, broken down into changes on the energy demand side, the contribution of renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions. The focus here is on the package of measures described in Section 3. It should be stressed that it is always the full package of measures that is analysed here in terms of the impacts caused, since an individual assessment would be methodologically inconsistent and would not be considered appropriate. The impact is illustrated by a comparison with developments in the reference case. Section 5.1.1 looks at the evolution of greenhouse gas emissions, Section 5.1.2 looks at the evolution of energy demand and Section 5.1.3 looks at the evolution of renewable energy.  5.1.1. GHG emissions and removals Projections of greenhouse gas emissions and removals with the planned policies and measures for the years 2020 to 2040 are summarised in Table 20. Energy-related GHG emissions result from the interaction between the development of energy demand and renewable energy.   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 166   Table 20: Greenhouse gas emissions by ETS and non-ETS for 2020 to 2040, in the event of the target scenario (with additional measures), in kt CO2eq  2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 ETS emissions excl. internat. air transport 1,376 1,238 1,074 966 861 Total non-ETS emissions 7,677 6,032 4,726 3,717 2,739 Energy-related non-ETS emissions 6,787 5,262 4,095 3,098 2,130 Energy sector 145 95 68 62 62 Industry 176 150 119 108 75 Transport 5,077 4,004 3,289 2,548 1,865 Private households 933 685 418 248 46 Trade, commerce and services 403 287 172 108 62 Others* 25 18 12 12 12 Diffuse emissions 29 24 17 13 8 Non-energy-related non-ETS emissions 890 770 632 619 609 Industrial processes 112 106 80 70 64 Agriculture and forestry 699 607 515 508 503 Waste 79 57 37 40 42 LULUCF -390 -393 -401 -399 -397 * Other emissions relate to combustion in construction and agriculture Source: Own illustrations, 2019  In 2030, a total of around 4.7 million tonnes of CO2eq will be emitted by the non-ETS sectors in the target scenario. This corresponds to a reduction of around 55% when compared with the reference year 2005, with emissions that are exclusively energy-related falling even more sharply by just over 57%. Non-energy-related emissions from non-ETS sectors will decrease by about 22% by 2030 when compared with the reference year 2005. By 2040, total non-ETS emissions in the target scenario are expected to fall to 2.7 million tonnes of CO2eq.  Emissions from ETS installations based in Luxembourg in 2030 are estimated at around 1 million tonnes of CO2eq, a decrease of almost 60% when compared with 2005.  In the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector, removals are expected to stagnate at around 0.4 million tonnes of CO2eq.  In Table 21, the projections of the target scenario are compared with those of the reference scenario (see Table 9 and Table 20). By 2030, the planned policies and measures therefore lead to a reduction in emissions in the non-ETS sectors of around 45% when compared with the reference scenario. The  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 167   difference for the ETS sectors is -11%. It should be reiterated here that in the target scenario, the reduction in emissions by 2030 compared to the reference year 2005 is 55%.

Energy demand and 2040 by just under 40% (18.2 TWh) to just under 27.4 TWh (see Table 22). In 2030, the final energy demand of the various sectors in Luxembourg totalled 35,568 TWh (-22% when compared with 2020). The trend in the impact of energy efficiency measures will continue until 2040, meaning that between 2030 and 2040 the total final energy demand for Luxembourg will be reduced by almost 8.2 TWh (-23% when compared with 2030). Within the target scenario, the reduction in final energy demand achieved in 2040 is accounted for by households with a decrease in final energy demand of almost 58% when compared with 2020 (3.7 TWh), industry with a decrease of 33% (2.4 almost 37% (around 1.5 TWh) and the transport sector with a decrease of around 48% or 10.5 TWh (see Figure 17). In the target scenario, the final energy demand of the transport sector falls to just over 11.2 TWh by 2040; the projected decline in tank tourism also makes a significant contribution to this. The final energy  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 168   demand (kerosene) of air transport is maintained at a constant level throughout the period, even in the case of the target scenario, in line with the assumed development in the case of the reference scenario.

In contrast to the reference scenario, the share of the transport sector is increasing at a significantly faster pace. In 2040, the transport sector will account for 29% of total electricity demand. Accordingly, the shares of the  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 169   remaining sectors (trade, commerce and services; private households; industry) will decrease to a greater or lesser extent (see Figure 18). The largest savings in absolute terms (-10.5 TWh when compared with 2020) are achieved by the transport sector throughout the period, followed by household savings, savings in the trade, commerce and services sector and reductions in energy demand in industry (see Figure 19).

The impact of all measures significantly reduces the final energy demand of the target scenario when compared with the reference scenario and, in the case of the target scenario, amounts to a total of 35,568 GWh (see Table 22).   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 171   The last part of Table 22 presents the percentage deviations in final energy demand in the target scenario compared to the corresponding development in the reference scenario. This will allow for a clear presentation of the savings made possible by the planned policies and measures. Finally, it should be noted that the future development of energy demand for both the reference and target scenarios is based on comprehensive modelling and a subsequent discussion and reflection process.  and the transport sector formed the common basis for both scenarios, which, by their very nature, show differences in future development. Accordingly, the target scenario shows a much stronger decline in demand, which essentially reflects the impact of the additional measures presented in Section 3 (when compared with the reference case). With regard to recent developments in the years up to 2020, the differences indicated reflect the uncertainty inherent in the modelling process. Statistics on different types of motor vehicles or different types of fuels (petrol, diesel, natural gas) were available for the transport sector until 2016. Based on the emerging trend of demand for each type of fuel in the period 2012 to 2016, the transport sector has modelled future demand for fuel up to 2040. Contrary to the weakening demand trend derived from this period, the most recent figures for 2017 (slight increase) and, above all, the market data for 2018 and 2019, which have not yet been statistically verified, indicate that demand for individual types of fuel in the transport sector is now rising strongly. If these trends prove to be correct, this should be seen as a sign that further tightening of the planned additional measures would be necessary to achieve the 2030 energy and climate targets.           and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 172   Table 22: target scenario Reference scenario Sector Unit 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Total final energy demand GWh 49,483 49,412 50,506 51,279 52,065 Private households 7,287 7,561 7,689 7,662 7,658 Industry 7,684 7,601 7,314 7,359 7,355 Trade, commerce and services 4,576 4,375 4,191 4,050 3,903 Transport  total 23,999 23,940 25,377 26,273 27,213 Transport  domestic transport 6,745 6,814 7,304 7,870 8,185 Transport  transit traffic 17,254 17,126 18,073 18,404 19,029  Target scenario Paris Article 2.1a Sector Unit 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Total final energy demand GWh 45,538 40,429 35,568 31,543 27,381 Private households 6,438 5,533 4,611 3,651 2,715 Industry 7,382 6,873 6,088 5,529 4,948 Trade, commerce and services 4,046 3,624 3,205 2,883 2,557 Transport  total 21,736 18,463 15,728 13,544 11,225 Transport  domestic transport 6,115 4,604 3,832 3,305 2,753 Transport  transit traffic 15,621 13,859 11,896 10,239 8,472 Air transport  5,936 5,936 5,936 5,936 5,936   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 173   Change from target scenario to reference scenario Sector Unit 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Total final energy demand1 %  -8%  -18%  -30%  -38%  -47% Private households  -12%  -27%  -40%  -52%  -65% Industry -4% -10% -17% -25% -33% Trade, commerce and services -12% -17% -24% -29% -34% Transport  total  -9%  -23%  -38%  -48%  -59% Transport  domestic transport  -9%  -32%  -48%  -58%  -66% Transport  transit traffic -9% -19% -34% -44% -55% Source:  Own illustration 2019  Table 23 summarises, in the same way as Table 22 in the case of final energy demand, the effects of the demand, while at the same time allowing for a percentage assessment of the effects of the planned policies and measures in the target scenario over the period 2020 to 2040.           and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 174   Table 23: of the reference and target scenarios Reference scenario Sector Unit 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Heat demand (excluding electricity) GWh 13,463 13,472 13,234 13,251 13,205 Electricity demand 6,141 6,260 6,314 6,367 6,441 Target scenario Paris Article 2.1a Sector Unit 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Heat demand (excluding electricity) GWh 11,868 10,223 8,371 6,961 5,544 Electricity demand 6,112 6,457 6,416 6,553 6,568 Change from target scenario to reference scenario Sector Unit 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Heat demand (excluding electricity) % -11.8% -24.1% -36.7% -47.5% -58.0% Electricity demand -0.5% 3.2% 1.6% 2.9% 2.0% Source:  Own illustration 2019  5.1.3. Renewable energy Renewable energy is making and will continue to make a substantial contribution to the decarbonisation of the energy sector in Luxembourg. The target scenario presented in Section 2 shows a pathway towards achieving a renewable energy share of 25% of gross final energy demand in 2030. This implies a significant increase when comparing the quantities achieved today (6.4% in 2017) and the 2020 target (11%). In addition to the massive expansion of renewable energy, this requires a clear increase in energy efficiency as well as an accompanying reduction in demand, as outlined in the previous section. This section focuses on the impacts on the energy system of the additional measures aimed at further boosting the development of renewable energy and increasing its contribution to meeting demand. More specifically, we look at the energy supply side and look at the contribution of renewable energy sources, which would also result according to the target scenario when compared with the reference case.  Table 24 provides a comprehensive overview of this. For example, this table shows renewable energy production for the years up to 2040, both for the reference and target scenarios, at sectoral level and as a  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 175   total balance. The table also allows direct comparison, i.e. consideration of the induced change if the target scenario is sought instead of the reference development. It also sets out the relative share of renewable energy in terms of (sectoral) demand, in addition to absolute energy.  At first glance, it may seem surprising that there is only a slight difference in the total national balance in terms of the amount of energy produced: if, for example, one compares the total national renewable energy production in the focus year 2030 in absolute figures, an increase of only 1.6% (target vs reference scenario) can be observed here. At sectoral level, however, there are significant differences: while renewable energy production shows a significant increase in the electricity sector (+ 30% in 2030) and in the heating sector an increase of + 3.6%, biofuels in the transport sector show a significant decrease (- 25.5%) despite an increase in the admixture rate (10% rather than 8%). This is due to the significant decrease in demand for fuels in the transport sector according to the target scenario (when compared with the reference case). However, if account is taken of the contributions of innovative solutions, such as e-mobility, a significant increase in the contribution of renewable energy can also be observed in the transport sector as a whole (+ 6.9%).25  A comparison of the reported relative shares of renewable energy sources for the focus year 2030, i.e. the shares of renewable energy in relation to the respective energy demand (see Table 24), reveals the large differences between the target and reference scenarios. Instead of the marginal increase of 1.6% in the national total balance of absolute energy, when comparing the shares of renewable energy in the gross final energy demand26, an increase of 51.5% can be observed. The most significant changes are in the heating sector, with an increase of 63.8%. The share of renewable energy in the transport sector, according to the total balance, also rises significantly by 59.3%, while developments in the electricity sector appear somewhat more subdued (+ 26.4%). In general, it illustrates the significant changes on the demand side, as discussed in the previous section. In summary, it can be said that a significant increase in the share of                                                            25 It is important to note that multiple counting is used here with regard to the contributions of innovative solutions, as per the revised calculation logic for determining the share of renewable energy in the transport sector.  26 Gross final energy demand is the relevant indicator for determining the renewable energy target. In simplified terms, it is derived from the final energy demand values shown in Table 22, which, in addition to the final demand, which amounts to 35,568 GWh in 2030 across all sectors se of electricity and grid-connected heat  these amount to 291 GWh in the target scenario.  framework imposes a cap on the extent to which the energy demand for air transport can be taken into account to ensure that there is no distortion or penalisation in the case of smaller Member States. According to the target scenario, the energy demand for air transport in 2030 is 5,936 GWh; however, due to the cap, only 2,216 GWh is taken into account for the calculation of the gross final energy demand. In the case of Luxembourg, this therefore entails a noticeable reduction in the gross final energy demand used as a reference value for the total share of renewable energy  without the air transport cap, which would be set at 35,861 GWh. When the cap is taken into account, Table 18 shows 32,141 GWh in 2030 for the target scenario.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 176   renewable energy requires clear intervention on the energy efficiency side in addition to direct measures to increase the expansion of renewable energy.                       and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 177   Table 24: Comparison of the expansion of renewable energy (energy production and shares of (sectoral) demand) between the reference scenario and the target scenario  Reference scenario  Renewable energy production, absolute energy Renewable energy share measured by (sectoral) demand   Unit 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Unit 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Renewable energy  electricity GWh 752 1,249 1,731 2,071 2,332     % 11.9% 19.4% 26.5% 31.3% 34.7% Renewable energy  heat 1,626 2,070 2,462 2,699 2,896 12.1% 15.4% 18.6% 20.4% 21.9% Renewable energy  biofuels 1,855 1,892 1,993 1,450 1,450 7.7% 8.0% 8.0% 5.6% 5.5% Renewable energy  transport, total* 2,784 3,438 4,463 4,355 5,390 11.1% 13.5% 16.1% 15.1% 17.6% Renewable energy  total, national 4,232 5,211 6,187 6,221 6,679 9.2% 11.2% 12.9% 12.8% 13.5% Renewable energy  cooperation needs 1,000 2,917 4,833 4,833 4,833 2.2% 6.2% 10.1% 9.9% 9.7% Renewable energy  total incl. cooperation  5,232  8,128  11,020  11,054  11,512  11.3%  17.4%  23.0%  22.7%  23.2% Comparison: Gross final energy demand** 46,119  46,717 47,913 48,773  49,650     Target scenario Paris Article 2.1a  Renewable energy production, absolute energy Renewable energy share measured by (sectoral) demand   Unit 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Unit 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Renewable energy  electricity GWh 748 1,563 2,251 2,680 3,150 % 11.9% 23.5% 33.6% 38.8% 45.4% Renewable energy  heat 1,626 2,030 2,551 2,495 2,609 13.7% 19.9% 30.5% 35.8% 47.1% Renewable energy  biofuels 1,632 1,563 1,485 1,738 1,749 7.5% 8.8% 10.0% 14.4% 18.7% Renewable energy  transport, total* 2,581 3,755 4,769 7,391 9,587 11.3% 18.4% 25.6% 40.4% 54.3% Renewable energy  total, national 4,006 5,156 6,287 6,914 7,508 9.4% 13.9% 19.6% 24.8% 31.9% Renewable energy  cooperation needs 1,000 1,374 1,748 1,748 1,748 2.3% 3.7% 5.4% 6.3% 7.4% Renewable energy  total incl. cooperation  5,006  6,530  8,035  8,662  9,257  11.8%  17.6%  25.0%  31.0%  39.3% Comparison: Gross final energy demand** 42,587 37,203 32,141 27,926 23,526    Change from target scenario to reference scenario  Renewable energy production, absolute energy Renewable energy share measured by (sectoral) demand   Unit 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Unit 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Renewable energy  electricity % change based on the reference scenario -0.5% 25.2% 30.0% 29.4% 35.0% %, change based on the reference scenario -0.1% 21.1% 26.4% 24.0% 31.0% Renewable energy  heat 0.0% -1.9% 3.6% -7.6% -9.9% 13.4% 29.2% 63.8% 75.6% 114.6% Renewable energy  biofuels -12.0% -17.4% -25.5% 19.8% 20.6% -2.5% 10.1% 25.6% 155.2% 242.3% Renewable energy  transport, total* -7.3% 9.2% 6.9% 69.7% 77.9% 1.9% 36.2% 59.3% 168.1% 208.9% Renewable energy  total, national -5.3% -1.1% 1.6% 11.1% 12.4% 2.5% 24.2% 51.5% 94.1% 137.2% Renewable energy  cooperation needs 0.0% -52.9% -63.8% -63.8% -63.8% 8.3% -40.8% -46.1% -36.8% -23.7% Renewable energy  total incl. cooperation           -4.3% -19.7% -27.1% -21.6% -19.6% 3.6% 0.9% 8.7% 36.9% 69.7% *incl. multiplication factors according to the calculation logic regarding the share of renewable energy in the transport sector  **Taking account of the cap on energy demand for air be taken into account to ensure that there is no distortion or penalisation in the case of smaller Member States.

Impacts of the planned policies and measures described in Section 3 on the economy, employment and social conditions, environment and health 5.2.1. Estimation of macroeconomic consequences The macroeconomic assessment of the present energy and climate plan shows slightly positive effects of the planned package of measures on the key economic indicators up to 2030. The effects are based on the technological and behavioural changes identified in the bottom-up demand and supply models for the target scenario (see Section 5.1.). Only the changes resulting from the planned policies and measures in the target scenario that differed from the reference scenario were included in the assessment. The stimulus in the form of additional, less avoided, energy efficiency and renewable energy investments, changes in energy expenditure, changes in primary energy imports, support programmes and regulatory measures were assessed using the system dynamic ASTRA model27. It examined both the direct effects of the stimulus (e.g. direct employment effects of investments in construction measures), the indirect effects (e.g. the effects via the other industries linked to the direct activity via intermediate consumption) and induced effects (the second-round effects of improved economic growth) on the national economy.  According to the model assessments, the planned policies and measures lead to an additional increase in  million2016 or 1.1% by 2030 when compared with the reference scenario. The positive impact on the economy as a whole is mainly due to the kick-starting of investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy, the reduction of household and business energy expenditure, and the avoidance of imports of fossil fuels. There is a positive macroeconomic effect despite the fact that the financing of the measures is taken into account, which is reflected in an increase in employment of 0.3% or 1,470 employees by 2030 when compared with the reference scenario. It should also be borne in mind that the reduction in household and business energy expenditure will of course continue to have a significant positive impact on the economy as a whole after 2030.  The results of the macroeconomic impact assessment indicate that the introduction of a minimum CO2 price from 2021 could also partly compensate for additional government expenditure through the support programmes and subsidies under the target scenario. Therefore, only marginal new borrowings would have to be accepted until 2030. It should be noted that the revenues generated by the CO2 minimum price are used pecific climate measures and targeted social relief                                                            27 Krail Michael, Sievers Luisa (2019), NECP Luxembourg  macroeconomic impact assessment.

In terms of annual real GDP growth rates, this means an increase in annual GDP growth of about 0.08 percentage points by 2030. Over the period up to 2030, the NECP already allows for  million2016. GDP growth is driven, on the one hand, by increasing final demand but also by higher potential output in the target scenario when compared with the reference scenario. In terms of final demand, household  million2016 in 2030 when compared with the reference level. This increase results from an increase in household income and direct investment stimulus for households. The disposable income of households increases due to the resulting GDP growth and the additional subsidies and support granted in the target scenario (e.g. the premium for the purchase of zero-emission vehicles). In 2025, the difference in household final consumption when compared with the reference level is slightly higher than in 2030. This slight decli-financing of additional investment by households. This means that, after the investment, part of the income previously available for the consumption of other products and services must be raised for the repayments and interest payments of the loans. As a result of this effect and the investments continually stimulated and initiated by the planned measures until 2030, the annual payments for counter-financing will increase until 2030, thereby reducing the growth in consumption. Due to the dependence of endogenous investments on consumption, which is anchored in the model logic,  million2016 higher than in the reference scenario. The increase in investment is therefore a combination of the direct stimulus provided by the investment stimulated in the target scenario and the slight increase in household consumption. The increase in investment of around 0.8% in 2030 is largely influenced by the increase in household consumption. The results of the macroeconomic impact assessment indicate that carbon pricing could partially compensate for the increased government expenditure due to the support measures in the target scenario  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 182   and the decrease in tax revenues. The annual new government debt in the target scenario therefore only  million2016 in 2030 when compared with the reference scenario. Meanwhile, revenues from carbon pricing and additional government revenues from the improved economic situation even exceed the increase in government expenditure. This results in a marginally higher cumulative public  million2016. A major driver of GDP growth when compared with the reference is the decrease in imports of fossil fuels due to the decrease in fossil fuel consumption. As a result, the trade balance up to 2030 increases by around  million2016 when compared with the reference value. This already takes account of the fact that the import of technologies, for example in the field of renewable energy, results in an increase in imports in the target scenario when compared with the reference scenario. On the other hand, the slightly higher economic growth also results in a slightly higher export activity.  Employment Effects The effects on gross value creation are the result of a combination of the changes brought about by the stimulus and the interaction effects caused by the interaction between investment, consumption and intermediate consumption. Since the development of labour productivity for each sector of the economy does not differ between the target scenario and the reference scenario, the effects on employment result directly from the changes in gross value creation. Gross value creation is calculated as the total output of a sector less intermediate consumption purchased. This means, for example, that value creation can also increase if energy or material efficiency measures mean that fewer inputs are needed for production. The effects on employment are positive in line with the value creation effects. In the target scenario, the higher gross value creation when compared with the reference results in an additional labour demand of about 1,400 employees in 2025 or 1,470 employees (total, including cross-border commuters) in 2030. This represents a relative increase of 0.3% in 2030 when compared with the reference.  Analysis of external climate costs saved External costs saved also play a role in the economic analysis; these are taken into account separately here. A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of energy and climate protection measures includes information on the level of external costs saved, as these represent a benefit over inaction.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 183   UBA (2018)28 provides a set of detailed cost rates to quantify external environmental costs. The costs saved are determined here solely in relation to avoided greenhouse gas emissions29. Based on a real discount rate of 1%, the Federal Environment Agency recommends cost rates for carbon dioxide emissions ranging from 2016/t CO2 2016/t CO2 for the medium term (2030). If the discount rate is set lower, the 2016/t CO2 without discounting). As data were only available for avoided CO2 emissions, the quantification of external costs saved is limited to these. The resulting value should therefore be regarded as a lower limit, as it can be assumed that further external environmental costs saved will be added. The distribution of emissions savings is also reflected accordingly in the distribution of external costs saved. The total cumulative CO2 savings by 2030 amount to just under 32 Mt, which can be converted into external environmental costs saved (cumulative by 2030) of  billion2016.  5.2.2. Environmental/health impact A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been carried out for the integrated national energy and climate plan. The objective of the SEA is to avoid planning that could lead to significant environmental problems. Its purpose is to identify, describe and assess the environmental impacts of the programme of measures as a whole in advance of and in addition to the project-related environmental impact assessments for the individual measures. The SEA considers the impacts (including possible interactions) on the following protected assets:  People, population and health  Plants, animals and biodiversity  Soil  Water  Climate and air  Landscape  Cultural and material goods The results of the SEA are compiled in an environmental report.                                                             28 UBA (2018): Methodological convention 3.0 for the determination of environmental costs.

This will ensure the greatest possible coherence between the integrated national energy and climate plan and the air pollution control programme. Where necessary, the air pollution control programme will lay down specific implementing provisions for the measures set out in this plan (e.g. for the use of biomass for energy).    and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 185   5.3.

A distinction can be made between investments for:    public and semi-  public fast charging points with an average inves The expansion of charging points increases significantly between 2020 and 2040 and peaks in 2030. During that year, just under 34,000 new recharging points will be installed. By 2040, the number of new charging stations added each year will drop again to around 21,200 charging points or charging stations, as a relatively well-developed infrastructure network will by now exist. By way of comparison, the number of new charging stations per year in 2020 will be around 5,200.  In 2020, the total public investment in the area of newly added charging infrastructure facilities for e-mobility will constitute around 6% of the total investment for the charging infrastructure, which amounts   million  million in 2040.

Investment and support requirements for renewable energy This analysis focuses on the need for investment in renewable energy technologies and the need for support (where necessary) for the development and operation of renewable energy installations. Both parameters are taken into account in the economic studies carried out since, on the one hand, in the case of investments, a relevant stimulus is created in the complex economic fabric from a macroeconomic perspective and, on the other hand, in view of the support requirements, there are often direct costs associated with the performance of the measures implemented and those planned for the future. Table 26 provides a comprehensive overview of this. The investment and support requirements for energy production based on renewable energy are given for the period up to 2040, broken down by energy sector (electricity, heat, transport (limited to biofuels)). This is presented for both the reference and target scenarios. The table also allows direct comparison, i.e. consideration of the induced change if the target scenario is sought instead of the reference development.  While the total annual investment requirement in new renewable energy plants over the coming decade  million according to the reference scenario, in the target scenario it   million  implying an increase of around 40%.30 In the focus year 2030, the differences are smaller (+ 21.9%), while in 2025 they reach a peak of 93.4%. The electricity sector is dominant in terms of investment: on average, 64% of the total investments are accounted for by the latter over the decade according to the target scenario, while the remainder (36%) is accounted for by renewable energy installations in the heating sector. Biofuel refineries are located in neighbouring countries, so there is no investment in Luxembourg. The same applies to renewable energy cooperation, as this involves renewable energy production abroad. The annual support requirement for renewable energy, calculated on a net31  million on average over the coming decade according to the target scenario. In the reference case, it would be 7 million), since achieving the target in 2030, although lower (23% share of renewable energy rather than 25%), would result in significant costs for renewable energy cooperation. In the target scenario, expenditure for the electricity sector dominates  approx. 46% of the total renewable energy support                                                            30  million, while cumulative investment  million is expected under the target scenario. 31 The need for funding characterises the necessary direct financial support from the company associated with the expansion or operation of renewable energy plants. Market revenues, e.g. from the marketing of electrical energy on the electricity market, are not included in this figure on a net basis.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 188   requirements for the coming decade (2021 to 2030) are accounted for by electricity from renewable sources, while in the reference scenario, expenditure for renewable energy cooperation would make up the lion Table 26:  Investment and support requirements for renewable energy  a comparison between the reference and target scenarios  Reference scenario  Renewable energy investment needs Renewable energy support needs  Unit  2020 2025 2030 Cumulative  2035 2040  Unit  2020 2025 2030 Cumulative  2035 2040 21-30 21-30 Renewable energy  electricity      95.5 73.0 73.0 860.4 53.4 57.3      73.7 93.2 66.9 917.7 31.0 16.5 Renewable energy  heat 59.2 57.3 81.2 666.5 69.2 99.4 28.5 21.6 33.8 263.2 32.4 44.6 Renewable energy  biofuels 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 102.8 75.6 82.8 859.2 55.6 51.3 Renewable energy  total, national 154.8 130.3 154.3 1,526.9 122.6 156.6 205.0 190.4 183.5 2,040.0 119.0 112.4 Renewable energy  cooperation needs 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 31.7 85.8 153.3 925.1 153.3 153.3 Renewable energy  total incl. cooperation  154.8  130.3  154.3  1,526.9  122.6  156.6  236.7  276.2  336.8  2,965.1  272.3  265.7  Target scenario Paris Article 2.1a  Renewable energy investment needs Renewable energy support needs  Unit  2020 2025 2030 Cumulative  2035 2040  Unit  2020 2025 2030 Cumulative  2035 2040 21-30 21-30 Renewable energy  electricity      89.6 191.9 76.3 1,380.9 64.0 92.1      73.9 146.8 92.0 1,239.8 32.0 22.7 Renewable energy  heat 59.2 60.0 111.7 761.6 38.8 57.6 28.5 28.7 51.5 352.8 15.4 15.2 Renewable energy  biofuels 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 79.6 62.4 61.7 673.4 66.6 61.9 Renewable energy  total, national 148.9 252.0 188.1 2,142.5 102.7 149.7 182.0 237.9 205.2 2,266.0 114.1 99.7 Renewable energy  cooperation needs 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 31.7 41.2 53.0 423.8 0.5 0.0 Renewable energy  total incl. cooperation  148.9  252.0  188.1  2,142.5  102.7  149.7  213.7  279.1  258.3  2,689.8  114.6  99.7  Change from target scenario to reference scenario  Renewable energy investment needs Renewable energy support needs  Unit  2020 2025 2030 Cumulative  2035 2040  Unit  2020 2025 2030 Cumulative  2035 2040 21-30 21-30 Renewable energy  electricity  %, change based on the reference scenario -6.2% 163.0% 4.5% 60.5% 19.9% 60.8%  %, change based on the reference scenario 0.3% 57.5% 37.6% 35.1% 3.4% 37.4% Renewable energy  heat 0.0% 4.8% 37.5% 14.3% -44.0% -42.0% 0.0% 33.0% 52.6% 34.1% -52.4% -65.9% Renewable energy  biofuels       -22.6% -17.4% -25.5% -21.6% 19.8% 20.6% Renewable energy  total, national -3.8% 93.4% 21.9% 40.3% -16.2% -4.4% -11.2% 25.0% 11.9% 11.1% -4.1% -11.3% Renewable energy  cooperation needs       0.0% -52.0% -65.4% -54.2% -99.7% -100.0% Renewable energy  total incl. cooperation  -3.8%  93.4%  21.9%  40.3%  -16.2%  -4.4%  -9.7%  1.1%  -23.3%  -9.3%  -57.9%  -62.5% Source: own calculations 2019 5.3.3. Impact on network costs in the distribution network The electricity network is of particular importance in the context of the energy transition and the associated shift from fossil to renewable energy sources. Changes in the height and spatial distribution of loads and production installations connected to the distribution networks are the main drivers of the development  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 189   needs of distribution networks. In both the reference and target scenarios, there is large-scale expansion of renewable energy installations. At the same time, the load is largely increased by an increase in heat pumps and e-mobility, which can overcompensate for the efficiency-related reduction in load and can therefore lead to some network expansion needs. In total, renewable energy installations with a capacity of just over 300 MW were installed during the initial year, 2017; PV installations with a capacity of around 185 MW and wind turbines with a capacity of around 75 MW make up the largest share of these. By 2040, the target scenario predicts an increase in renewable energy production to a total of around 2,500 MW, with the contribution from PV installations expected to grow to just over 1,800 MW and wind installations to around 550 MW. This means that the total installed capacity of renewable energy installations is almost eight times higher than today (when compared with a total of just 1,500 MW in the reference scenario due to lower PV plant capacities). In addition to the installed production capacity, load increases are expected from electric vehicles, connection of electric heat pumps, and also from the construction of new apartments. The biggest driver for the peak load caused by consumers connected to the distribution network is the increase in electric scenario and to a doubling of peak load in the baseline or reference scenario. This development is reflected in corresponding annuity distribution network costs, which increase by around 30% in the reference scenario and by around 70% in the target scenario by 2030. At the same time, the total cost burden is spread over a much larger number of end consumers and there is also a slightly higher demand for electricity, which in turn reduces the specific costs accordingly. In addition, the development of peak load depends crucially on flanking measures in network operation and market design, which could not be taken into account in their entirety in the quantification due to their complexity. For example, the planned further development of flexibility options (see Section 3.4.3.ii), such as smart charging management for electric vehicles or market-based incentives for systemic demand, should significantly reduce peak loads. In principle, network expansion needs arising from an increase in demand can be dampened by a simultaneous increase in distributed production capacity, but only if load and production are in close proximity and correlated over time or integrated via decentralised storage solutions. It should also be noted that the network expansion requirement for PV installations is generally higher than for wind turbines, as the latter are usually connected directly to higher network levels. This also provides a plausibility check for the higher network expansion requirement in the target scenario, in which considerably more PV installations are expected.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 190    5.4. Impacts of the planned policies and measures described in Section 3 on other Member States and regional cooperation In a small open country like Luxembourg, climate and energy policy objectives also have a cross-border dimension. Ultimately, only the implementation of the measures described in Section 3 will shed light on their exact impact on neighbouring countries and other Member States. However, it should be noted that   Transport infrastructure projects designed to cope with commuter traffic will certainly have a cross-border impact. The agreement between Luxembourg and France, which provides for such investments, amounting   million from France (Lorraine), will contribute to this. Currently, as is well known, fuel exports to the border region have resulted in an increase in the GHG balance in Luxembourg. The planned CO2 pricing, or the increase in excise duties on diesel and petrol, is expected to lead to a gradual reduction in the differential in fuel prices between Luxembourg and its neighbouring regions.  As regards cooperation mechanisms, Luxembourg has stipulated in existing contracts with Lithuania and Estonia (see Section 3.1.2.ii.) that the financial compensation will be invested in specific new projects in the field of renewable energy and energy efficiency. Luxembourg will continue to focus on the need for cooperation mechanisms to achieve its objectives. The planned future cooperation on specific projects, whether iproject areas.
