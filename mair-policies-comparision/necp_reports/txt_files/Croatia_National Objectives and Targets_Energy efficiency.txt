The building stock and the possibilities for its renovation have also been analysed in the document "Analyses and backgrounds for preparation of the Energy Strategy of the Republic of Croatia", which was prepared in October 2018 for the purpose of adopting the Energy Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia by 2030 with an outlook to 2050. The conclusions in this document related to construction of buildings are presented below, which need to be implemented in order to achieve the national energy efficiency targets shown in Table 2-8. 63  After 2020, in accordance with the Technical Regulation on Rational Use of Energy and Thermal Insulation in Buildings, all newly constructed buildings will be nearly-zero energy (nZEB). It is expected that the total residential stock will grow at an average rate of approximately 6,600 residential units from 2021 to 2030, 6,300 from 2031 to 2040 and 6,050 ected in the period from 2021 to 2030 (around 30,000 new and renovated housing units per year, with a very high rate of abandonment and demolition of old poor-quality units of about 11,200 units per year). From 2031 to 2040, the area of newly-built residencorresponds to the annual rate of renovation of 1.6%, with a gradual increase from 1% in 2021 to 3% in 2030.  -built and renovated buildings, and it is expected that there will be no significant variations for the non-residential sector.  It should be noted that, pursuant to Article 2a of Directive 2018/844 amending Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings, the Republic of Croatia will adopt a new Long-term strategy for promotion of investments in the renovation of the national building stock with a plan of measures and indicators for 2030, 2040 and 2050, which will be aligned with the Energy Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia.  The total area of public administration buildings that are being renovated or equivalent savings in the period 2021-2030 pursuant to Article 5 on the leading role of the public sector of Directive 2012/27/EU A total of 13.8 million m 2 of useful heated area of public sector buildings was recorded in the Republic of Croatia in 2010, according to the data from the National Information System for Energy Management. In order to meet the obligation to renovate 3% of the total floor area of heated and/or cooled buildings owned and managed by the central government, in the period until 2020 the Republic of Croatia has chosen an alternative approach, i.e. it has set the target  of 0.00489 PJ per year15in equivalent savings. This approach will also be applied in the period until 2030.     15 Source: 4th National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for the period until the end of 2019, MEE, January 2019. 64  ii. The indicative milestones for 2030, 2040 and 2050, the domestically established measurable progress indicators, an evidence-based estimate of expected energy savings and wider benefits, and their contributions to the Union's energy efficiency targets as included in the roadmaps set out in the long-term renovation strategies for the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU Pursuant to Article 2a of Directive 2018/844 amending Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings, the Republic of Croatia will adopt a new Long-term strategy for promotion of investments in the renovation of the national building stock with a plan of measures and indicators for 2030, 2040 and 2050, which will be aligned with the Energy Development Strategy and Low-Carbon Strategy of the Republic of Croatia.  iii. Where applicable, other national objectives, including long-term targets or strategies and sectoral targets, and national objectives in areas such as energy efficiency in the transport sector and with regard to heating and cooling Estimates made in the framework of the development of analytical backgrounds for the purposes of development of the Energy Development Strategy show that a significant reduction in direct consumption in transport may be expected in the long term ([2], [4]). Energy consumption estimates in the transport sector by 2050 are shown in Figure 2-9..    2020 2030 Figure 2-9. Energy consumption estimate in the transport sector 65  It is expected that the total energy consumption will be reduced by one quarter compared to 2016, and the structure of used energy-generating products will change. It is expected that, in 2050, electricity will account for around 20 percent and liquid fuel for around 35 percent in the structure of energy-generating products. 2.3  Dimension energy security i. The elements set out in point (c) of Article 4  The most important objective within the dimension of energy security is to ensure a lasting, secure and quality supply of all energy-generating products. In order to achieve this objective, it is necessary to introduce integral and systematic planning of supply of all energy-generating products and forms of energy. Other national energy security objectives are:  diversification of supply routes of energy and energy-generating products
