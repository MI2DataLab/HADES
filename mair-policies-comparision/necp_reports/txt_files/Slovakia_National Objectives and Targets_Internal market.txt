2.4. Dimension: internal energy market; 2.4.1. Electricity interconnectivity  i. The level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030 in consideration of the electricity interconnection target for 2030 of at least 15%, with a strategy with the level from 2021 onwards defined in close cooperation with affected Member States, taking into account the 2020 interconnection target of 10% and the following indicators of the urgency of action: The SR will fulfil the 10% target for EU Member States transmission interconnection level by 2020 adopted by the EU Council in 2002, as well as the 15% interconnectivity level by 2030 set by the EU Council in 2014 as the share of net import transmission capacity to total installed electricity generation capacity in the Member State. Based on the Commission communication on Strengthening Energy Networks16, the Slovak Republic achieved a 43% transmission system interconnection level in 2017, and in 2020  according to the 2016 ten-year pan-European network development plan (TYNDP 2016)  it will reach a 59% interconnection level in 2020. In 2030, according to the TYNDP 2016 assumptions, the level of SR interconnection will decrease to 52%, mainly due to the projected increase in installed electricity generation capacity. The Slovak Republic will also fulfil the indicative indicators of the target for interconnection of the transmission systems of the Member States of the European Union to 2030, according to the Commission report17 of November 2017, which states that the nominal transmission capacity, i.e. the thermal capacity of a Member States cross-border interconnection, should amount to at least 30% of the maximum load in the import direction and 30% of the installed renewable energy output in the export direction, while the average annual difference in the marginal cost of trading zones should be no greater than EUR 2/MWh. According to the TYNDP 2018 analysis18, in the first two criteria the Slovak Republic achieves a level of interconnection of over 60% for all the considered scenarios, i.e. a thermal import capacity at 230% to 250% of the assumed maximum load and a thermal export capacity at the level of 160% to 282% of the projected installed RES output. The difference between the average annual marginal cost and the neighbouring trading zones except the Czech Republic is over EUR 2/MWh. The average annual marginal cost in trading areas is represents variable costs, and thus is dependent on the variable costs of the Member States source mix. The price difference in neighbouring areas indicates the degree of market deformity caused by restricted transmission. If there is sufficient capacity on all profiles, the average annual marginal price difference should not be higher than EUR 2/MWh.                                                  16 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/communication_on_infrastructure_17.pdf  17 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/report_of_the_commission_expert_group_on_electricity_interconnection_targets.pdf 18 https://tyndp.entsoe.eu/Documents/TYNDP%20documents/TYNDP2018/consultation/Main%20Report/TYNDP2018_Executive%20Report.pdf   According to analyses by the TSO (SEPS) presented in the Ten-Year Plan of the Transmission System for 2020 to 2029, by 2030 the implementation of cross-border interconnection projects with Hungary (see Chapter 2.4.2) will increase the maximum transmission capacities on the Slovak-Hungarian profile compared to the present situation in the export direction by approximately 85% to 3 489 MW and in the import direction by approximately 47% to 2 610 MW. The implementation of cross-border pipeline projects with the Czech Republic will increase the maximum transmission capacity on the Slovak-Czech profile in the import direction by 35% to 2 862 MW by 2030. There will be no significant increase in capacity in the export direction, which will thus remain at approximately the current 2 950 MW. 2.4.2. Energy transmission infrastructure i. Key electricity and gas transmission infrastructure projects, and, where relevant, modernisation projects, that are necessary for the achievement of objectives and targets under the five dimensions of the Energy Union Strategy  As regards the electricity transmission infrastructure, the priority of the Slovak Republic is to complete the construction of new Slovak-Hungarian cross-border interconnections (2x400 kV SR)   (HU)   SR) and 400 kV R. Sobota (SR) - Sajóivánka (HU)). On the Slovak side, both lines have been completed. In cooperation TS operator (SEPS) requested the inclusion of the planned 1x400 kV Ladce (SR) - Otrokovice (CZ) connection on the list of projects of common interest (PCI). This is a link that would replace the 220 kV transmission system (TS) which is gradually being replaced on both sides of the SR/CZ border. This strengthening also includes a planned increase in the transmission capacity of the V404 Varín (SR) - The project was not included in the 4th PCI list. As regards gas transport infrastructure, the Slovak Republics priority projects are the completion of the Slovak-Polish interconnection, which was started in September 2018, and the implementation of the Eastring gas pipeline, included on the list of projects of common interest and for which the results of a feasibility study giving its optimal route were presented in September 2018. SR) - - SR) 2 x 400 kV line SR)   (HU) - SR) electric - line SR) - - SR)) cross-border interconnection. The aim of the project is to increase transmission capacity between the transmission systems of Slovakia and Hungary as well as to increase the security and reliability of the operation of the transmission system of the Slovak Republic on the highly exposed cross-border transmission profile in the eastern region of Central Europe. The justification and importance of construction of this project was demonstrated through the acquisition of PCI status. At the request of SEPS, at the beginning of 2016 the project was awarded a financial contribution from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) of 50% of the requested amount for engineering and project activities for the part of the line inside Slovakia (around EUR 0.46 million, which was drawn in 2019). Rimavská Sobota (SR) - Sajoivánka (HU) 2 x 400 kV line  This project is for the construction of 2 x 400 kV lines between the Rimavská Sobota (SR) and Sajoivánka (HU) electric stations. As the line on the Hungarian side will temporarily only have one branch, there will one double line branch on the Slovak side before entering field No 3 at the Rimavská Sobota electric station and connected to the second branch at the last anchor mast. The aim of the project is to increase transmission capacity between the transmission systems of Slovakia and Hungary, as well as to increase the security and reliability of the operation of the transmission system of the Slovak Republic on the highly exposed cross-border transmission profile within the eastern region of Central Europe. The justification and importance of construction of the project was demonstrated by the acquisition of PCI status. At the request of SEPS, at the beginning of 2016 the project was awarded a financial contribution from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) of 50% of the requested amount for engineering and project activities for the part of the line in the territory of Slovakia (around EUR 0.64 million, which was drawn in 2019). ACON smart grid project The main objective of the ACON (Again COnnected Networks) cross-border smart grid project between the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic is to strengthen the integration of the Czech and Slovak electricity markets and to effectively unify the behaviour and activities of the users of the electricity systems in order to create an economically advantageous, sustainable electricity system with small losses and high quality and security of supply. In November 2017, the project was included in the third list of EU Projects of Common Interest (PCI). E.ON Distribuce, a.s. The estimated project costs are EUR 221 million and the anticipated implementation period is 2018-2024. received EUR 91.2 million in co-financing from the European Commission for the international ACON Smart grid project. This is the first ever project in Slovakia to feature massive deployment of state-of-the-art smart technologies that will enable the emergence of new energy based on local renewable sources. The project will not only modernize existing infrastructure, but also build new infrastructure. Examples are the new power station in Borský Svätý Jur and the digitization of over 200 kilometres of 22kV lines. The benefits of the ACON project include a significant improvement in grid performance parameters, in particular the failure rate and maintenance downtime, as well as the reduction of electricity transmission losses. The ACON project is implemented in the border regions of western Slovakia, but its benefits will have an impact both throughout Slovakia and in neighbouring states. The implementation of smart elements will provide adequate capacity for all grid users and allow for better monitoring. Easier identification of potential failures will reduce the time it takes to clear them. This will provide customers with a more stable distribution system with minimum downtime and high supply quality. The possibility of co-financing the development of the distribution system from EU sources is an opportunity to significantly contribute towards the digitization of the Slovak distribution system and to offer new technological solutions to network users. The total value of the supported ACON project  is around EUR 182 million, while co-financing from European sources is EUR 91.2 million, meaning 50% of the project value, and the costs of each project partner account for 50%. Projects of common interest are key cross-border EU energy infrastructure projects necessary for the creation of a single energy market and to achieve affordable, secure and renewable energy. The ACON project, one of the most important Slovak-Czech energy projects and one that also promotes European energy goals, is , and e Czech Republic. Both ministers, together with the project partners, signed the Declaration of Support for the ACON project in Bratislava on 24 June 2019 to ensure the smooth implementation of the individual project objectives. The ACON project has several smart and innovative features and is one of the first smart grid projects on the PCI list. Intelligent technologies will provide new communication features as well as intelligent load management with automatic algorithms, which will increase awareness, ensure better interconnection, and allow the future use of distribution systems for the wider deployment of renewable sources as well as access to digital infrastructure. Work on the ACON project will involve several activities, namely: a new cross-border 22kV Hodonín; a new transformer station and the modernisation of existing transformer stations; cabling; and the installation of IT equipment and smart solutions. Danube InGrid smart grid project ZSD has initiated another similar project, this time in cooperation with a Hungarian company from the E.ON group and the national transmission system operators SEPS and MAVIR. The main goal of the Danube InGrid (Danube Intelligent Grid) project is to increase the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid through the use of intelligent technologies at transmission and distribution level, including their smart management. While ACON will mainly be implemented primarily cover the Nitra region and part of the Trnava region. The inclusion of the project in the upcoming list of PCI projects was also supported by the EU Member States. Slovak-Polish gas interconnection The project has received support from the CEF for the implementation of the project itself of approx. EUR 57 million, and pipeline construction is currently under way in the Slovak Republic. The project envisages a transfer capacity of about 5.7 billion m3/year towards the Republic of Poland and 4.7 bn. m3/year towards the Slovak Republic. The total length of the interconnection should be 165 km (in Slovakia a maximum of 106 km and in Poland 59 km). The project involves building a compressor station in Strachocine, Poland, and modifying an existing compress-South Gas Corridor, linking LNG terminals in Poland and Croatia. Its implementation will contribute towards increased security of supply and will support market integration through diversification of sources and routes not only in the Slovak Republic and the Republic of Poland, but also in the whole region of Central and South-Eastern Europe. Eastring Eastring is a project for a new gas pipeline for central and south-eastern Europe, which represents an important step towards achieving a single European gas market, a common vision of the European  Union. Eastring is a project for a two-way gas pipeline between the Slovak Republic and the south-east European border (Black Sea or more exactly Turkey) with an annual capacity of 208 000 GWh to 416 000 GWh (about 20 billion to 40 billion cubic m3). Eastring will connect existing gas infrastructure across Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. The European dimension of the project has been highlighted through its multiple inclusion in the PCI project list. ii. Where applicable, main infrastructure projects envisaged other than Projects of Common Interest (PCIs)19 Electricity The phase-out of the 220 kV transmission system (TS) by about 2026 is a long-term strategic objective of the TS operator. New TS equipment is already being built for a voltage of 400 kV. The phased-out 220 kV equipment is cancelled either without replacement or is replaced with new 400 kV equipment - depending on the agreement with the TS operator. Major 220 kV TS phase-out Bystrica electric stations and electric station. Regarding the construction of new power stations, or the reconstruction of existing 400 kV substations (R), the TS operator is switching to a uniform technical solution concept, including the transition to the remote control of electric stations without the presence of a permanent operator. This also relates to the replacement of 220 kV electric stations with 400 kV electric stations. The major projects to 2030 include the reconstruction of R400 kV (including switching to remote control and, if necessary, the replacement of the transformers) and the replacement of end-of-life transformers, potentially increasing their installed capacity (in agreement with the respective DS operator). In terms of the construction of new power lines, the TS operator does not plan to build new interconnections except those intended to connect the new electric stations (after the switch from the 220 kV voltage level) to the grid and except for those mentioned above (connections to Hungary and Czech Republic). However, cross-border lines will only be built after a bilateral agreement with the neighbouring TSO. This means that it is an ongoing process and the situation may change. Gas sector In the gas sector we anticipate several measures to strengthen the internal gas market with the aim of, for example: a) enabling and facilitating a liquid and competitive environment in the internal gas market, b) enabling and strengthening the diversification of routes and sources, thereby increasing the security of gas supply through increased gas network flexibility, c) contributing towards improving sustainable development in Europe, as natural gas plays a key role in the European Unions energy mix, in particular with regard to economic development and environmental protection. 2.4.3. Market integration                                                  19 In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2013 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and repealing Decision No 1364/2006/EC and amending Regulations (EC) No 713/2009, (EC) No 714/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 (OJ L 115, 25 April 2013, p. 39).  i. National objectives related to other aspects of the internal energy market such as increasing system flexibility, in particular related to the promotion of competitively determined electricity prices in line with relevant sectoral law, market integration and coupling, aimed at increasing the tradable capacity of existing interconnectors, smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, and real-time price signals, including a timeframe for when the objectives shall be met The national intentions of the Slovak Republic in connection with building the single electricity market within the EU are primarily determined by directly applicable European legislation (i.e. the relevant market network regulations and decrees). The prospective targets and target values for market integration are conditional in particular on Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 laying down guidelines for capacity allocation and congestion management (CACM Regulation), supplemented by Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the internal market in electricity. Within the daily and intraday market time frames this is mainly about the full integration of the Slovak Republic as part of a unified solution based on the principles of the implicit allocation of inter-area capacities, Single Day Ahead Coupling (SDAC) and the unified interconnection of intra-day markets based on the principle of continuous allocation of inter-area capacities, or Single Intraday Coupling (SIDC). For the time frame of the daily electricity market, a project was launched at the turn of 2018/2019 for the timely implementation of the merger of the interconnection of Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania (4M MC) with the connected Western Europe MRC region (DE-AT-PL-4MMC project) based on the Net Transmission Capacity (NTC) method20. At the same time, all the project stakeholders, including the Slovak parties and the national regulatory authority, confirmed their commitment to implementing the European target solution and methodologies resulting from legally binding EU legislation on the principle of coordinated flow-based capacity calculation. The intraday electricity market could be unified within the European Union by 2021. The basis for the target solution for the integration of the intraday electricity market should be the XBID project, which sets up the accession process and also includes the Slovak Republic. Slovak stakeholders are currently considering the position of Slovakia in relation to the XBID project with probable accession in the third wave after 2020. With regard to balancing markets, it is assumed that at the turn of 2021/2022 the Slovak Republic will become an integral part of the unified centralised European platforms for the provision of performance balancing services. The involvement of the Slovak Republic in these platforms, based on current European legislation, is a response to the needs for increased flexibility in managing the interconnected electricity system, increased liquidity of the balancing market and transparent pricing for performance balancing services. Under the appropriate conditions set by the relevant legislation, it is possible to anticipate an increase in the liquidity of European platforms through the promotion of new technologies and entities delivering performance balancing services. In terms of wholesale market integration and increasing tradable capacity, the Slovak Republic and Slovak parties will act in coordination with other Member States and stakeholders in the CORE region                                                  20 http://www.urso.gov.sk/?q=node/598    when implementing the principles of capacity allocation and congestion management under Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the EP and of the Council on the internal electricity market (Article 16). An important contribution to the integration of wholesale electricity markets in terms of reducing the price differential between market areas (Chapter 2.4.1 in connection with interconnection indicators, an indicative threshold of EUR 2/MWh) will be the implementation of two new cross-border interconnections between Slovakia and Hungary included in projects of common interest (PCI) with anticipated completion by the end of 2020 (Chapter 2.4.2). The aim is to increase cross-border transmission capacity on the Slovak-Hungary profile, which has long been a structural bottleneck and a significant barrier to market integration in the region. The plans and form of the national legislation in the field of increasing the flexibility of the Slovak electricity system, including the management of consumption and aggregation, energy storage, consumer participation in the energy market and the benefits of own energy generation arise inter alia from the method of the transposition of Regulation (EU) 2019/944 of the EP and of the Council into Slovak legislation within the transposition deadline of the end of 2020, and the related provisions of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the Clean energy for all Europeans package. One basic condition for the integration of flexibility sources in the future will be, in addition to effective nationwide SMS deployment, the creation of a suitable regulatory and legislative framework for the flexibility market, inter alia enshrining a new market entity  an aggregator  that will enable market access for distributed flexibility sources and the creation of a technological model for the development of distribution systems from the perspective of flexibility utilisation. The national plans of the Slovak Republic in terms of building a single gas market will concentrate, in addition to supporting the implementation of infrastructure projects, on promoting the proper and timely implementation of network systems in gas transport. For example, the transmission system operator is currently able to sell transit capacities at cross-border transmission points through all existing platforms (PRISMA, RBP and GSA). Looking ahead to 2030, it will be necessary to focus on the anticipated internal gas market package that should, in addition to integrating the gas markets, significantly strengthen the sustainability aspect. ii. Where applicable, national objectives related to the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met Since the autumn of 2019, there has been intensive debate with market players on how to implement the new electricity market design (in particular Directive 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for the internal market in electricity and Regulation 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the internal market), which will fundamentally regulate relations between market players and will need to be implemented by the end of 2020. The rights and obligations of individual market participants, including non-discriminatory RES participation, demand-side response and aggregation will, after the results of the negotiations with the stakeholders, be regulated through the Energy Act and related legislation. Installed capacity of 43 MW for 2019 and 34 MW for 2020 has been stipulated for renewable energy sources, including a local source. At the same time, the Ministry of Economy is planning to launch an auction for new sources using renewable energy sources, where additional capacity will be released for the construction of the least costly facilities.  It is assumed that after the construction of a new cross-border transmission line between Slovakia and Hungary in 2021, there will be no reasons to limit the connection of sources in terms of security and reliability of electricity system operation, and the ME SR will be able to determine higher capacities for both local sources and auctions. iii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to ensuring that consumers participate in the energy system and benefit from self-generation of energy and from new technologies, including smart meters; The plans and form of national legislation with regard to ensuring the participation of consumers in the energy system and the benefits of own electricity generation and new technologies, including smart meters, will arise, inter alia, from the transposition of Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the EP and of the Council into Slovak legislation with a transposition deadline of the end of 2020, in particular the provisions on active consumer participation in the market in Chapter III (Dynamic price contract - Article 11, Active customers - Article 15, Citizen Energy Communities - Article 16, Consumption management through aggregation - Articles 13 and 17 and smart meters - Articles 19 to 21 and Annex II) and other related EU legislation on the Clean Energy for All Europeans package, in particular Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the EP and of the Council on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. The Slovak Republic has implemented legislation promoting own electricity generation by introducing the local source institute through an amendment to Act No 309/2009 on the promotion of renewable energy sources and high-efficiency cogeneration (Act No 309/2018). The main measures in the development of smart metering systems (SMS) and smart networks (SN) are summarized in the Energy Policy of the Slovak Republic, 2014 (section 3.5.10). The SR is in the initial construction phase of basic SN infrastructure. It has fully transposed the provisions of Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council in the area of SMS (Annex I point 2). The SR is currently focusing primarily on the selective implementation of SMS pursuant to the relevant Decree of the Ministry of Economy No 358/2013 with a schedule to 2020 (offtake points with annual consumption over 4 MWh with anticipated penetration of about 23% low voltage OP by the target year 2020). Further SMS development steps will be reviewed after 2020 following the transposition of the related provisions of Directive 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for the internal electricity market (Articles 19 to 21 and Annex II), the Clean Energy for All Europeans package. An important contribution towards the development of smart networks in view of the future development of distributed and renewable energy sources will be the implementation of the cross-border ACON smart grid project between Slovakia and the Czech Republic (Chapter 2.4.2), which has been placed on the Projects of Common Interest list and has obtained support from the Union through the Connecting Europe tool (CEF Energy). The project will improve the efficiency and security of the distribution system and the readiness to integrate distributed renewable sources, especially in the common border regions of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The project is anticipated to be completed by 2024. At the same time, a joint Slovak-Hungarian smart grid project called Danube InGrid is being prepared. Intelligent measuring systems are essential parts of intelligent networks. The introduction of smart measuring systems in the electricity sector is currently in the mandatory selective implementation phase within the meaning of the procedure and conditions of the Decree of the ME SR. As of 30 June 2019, a total of 273 862 SMS out of a final number of 390 849 devices that should be installed by 31  December 2020 were installed by regional distribution systems operators (a further several thousand SMS were installed under MDS conditions). Further steps in SMS implementation in the SR will continue until 2020 according to the schedule and conditions determined in Decree No 358/2013. Smart grids are bringing about changes to help strengthen the position of the customer, facilitate greater integration of renewable energy sources into distribution systems, enable and support the development of electromobility and electricity storage, increase energy efficiency and reduce losses, while also making significant contributions towards environmental protection, supporting technological development and creating new jobs. These networks are able to manage direct interaction and communication between consumers (households and enterprises), network operators, energy producers and suppliers. An intelligent network can flexibly respond to the distribution of electricity generation and consumption, even in environments where electricity flows in both directions. Better and more targeted management will mean the network is characterised by higher operational safety, higher efficiency, lower losses and lower operating costs. IN deployment is anticipated to manage distribution networks optimally and more accurately, allowing multiple consumers to be connected without the need to invest in new network construction. The input of electricity into the electricity system by a large number of decentralised generation sources through different distribution systems cannot be regulated without the use of modern telecommunication technologies, which make operation more efficient. An intelligent network, continuously monitored by SMS, should be able to respond optimally to the current distribution of generation and consumption capacities at all times. Experience from European countries with widespread use of SMS technology, the cornerstone for building smart grids, shows that the scale of interruptions in electricity supply to customers has diminished and that system losses have also fallen. Another way to safely integrate green energy into the system is to develop energy storage. Such a system allows the storage of locally produced energy and its consumption based on demand. Integrating local energy storage in accumulation appliances, energy storage facilities and electric vehicles with their storage capabilities is therefore an important element of the smart grid. In addition to energy storage, local power consumption management concepts are being developed based on good mapping and analysis of the ratios in the system so that electricity is not transformed to a higher voltage at the generation site and then back to a lower voltage at a remote location. It is anticipated that a detailed understanding of consumption will lead to changes in the behaviour of SMS-enabled customers and, together with the development of IN, will become a tool for more efficient consumption management, which should lead to general benefits and to a smoothing of system loads, impacting in turn the variation and volume of support services needed to regulate any uncompensated balance of electricity generation and consumption. An important prerequisite for intelligent network support is the standardisation of suitable technologies for Slovak conditions and the option for interchangeability of its main components to allow the integration of solutions and equipment from different manufacturers. iv. National objectives with regard to ensuring electricity system adequacy, as well as for the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy generation, including a timeframe for when the objectives shall be met The Slovak Republics goals and plans for ensuring the adequacy of the electricity system are defined by the Slovak Energy Policy (see point 1.2 ii.).  To ensure the adequacy of the electricity system or, more exactly, to ensure the safe and reliable operation of each Member State, an appropriate and balanced source mix in terms of both sufficient generation capacity (quantity) and generation technology (quality) is an important prerequisite. It is the intention of the SR to create the necessary conditions to ensure the adequacy of the electricity system in meeting climatic and energy objectives and respecting the conditions of the single European market. By 2030, the SR expects the export balance of the system to be 5% to 10% of projected electricity consumption21 assuming the Mochovce nuclear power plant (Mochovce NPP - EMO 3,4) is commissioned, the - PP) and the possibility of terminating operations at the Nováky thermal power plant (Nováky PP - ENO). In this development scenario, the SR will have no difficulty in covering the assumed load. Based on current knowledge, to ensure the availability of support services there may be - on rare occasions - a power shortfall of 17% to 26% that the TS operator is able to import from abroad if the required power and transmission infrastructure are available at that moment. Measures to increase support service availability carried out by the TS operator over the last few years have been directed towards seeking reserves that can be activated by modifying the rules for providing support services (virtual blocks) and the ability to procure some support service types from abroad (PRVs). The Strategy to Secure a Sufficient Volume of Support Services for the Provision of System Services and the Safe and Reliable Operation of the electricity system of the SR for 2019 to 2021 (the Strategy) was completed in 2018, and was subsequently subject to a public consultation process. Based on the conclusions and recommendations for the Strategy, a multi-annual tender was conducted, in which all types of support service were procured for 2019 to 2021. After an evaluation of the multi-annual tender results, we can say that for 2019 to 2021 the required support service volumes are secured at an average level of over 70%. No support service bids for TRV3MIN- and TRV10MIN- were submitted for 2019 and 2020 during the multi-annual tender, but we expect these to be procured through other tenders (annual, monthly, and daily). The TS operator has identified other options to ensure the availability of regulatory reserves through the creation of space for the emergence of virtual blocks consisting of multiple small sources and consumption points that behave as a single source vis-à-vis the transmission system operators control management system, thereby expanding the supply of regulatory reserves. The TS operator is also seeking technical and commercial solutions for the provision of support service abroad through international cooperation. International cooperation as regards support services is the subject of a number of international projects, but it is important to note that there are a significant number of issues to be resolved (cross-border capacities, joint platforms), while finding solutions to them is time-consuming. At the same time, it should be understood that while it is possible to procure support services abroad based on international cooperation, this also means that support service providers in the Slovak Republic will also be able to supply their regulatory reserves abroad. The evaluation of the anticipated support service availability in the cross-sectional year 2023 broken down by support services valid for 2018 is based on an analysis of the results of the optimisation of the likely deployment of available production units based on technical-economic assumptions and limitations for covering the anticipated load in an hourly resolution  a market simulation. Figure 8 Estimated support service availability in the cross-sectional year 2023                                                  21 https://www.mhsr.sk/uploads/files/TZINde4d.pdf    Based on the indicated analysis of individual support service availability, it is clear that the required volume of support services to cover all anticipated requirements over 53 weeks will not be 100% available. In real operation, it would probably be possible to compensate for the lack of support service availability by activating them at another certified facility operating on the electricity market, as well as by using foreign assistance, either by importing the support service in question or by purchasing NREs. All these options could help reduce the support service shortfall. Within the meaning of the Parliament and Council Regulation on the internal electricity market22 each Member State must have in place a reliability standard for the application of a capacity mechanism, which transparently states the required level of security of the electricity supply. To establish such a reliability standard, national regulatory authorities should, based on the ACER-approved ENTSO-E methodology, set an estimate of the Value of Lost Load (VoLL) in EUR/MWh. The reliability standard is to be expressed as the estimated Energy Not Served (ENS) in MWh/year, which should, inter alia, be taken into account when assessing the adequacy of sources. According to the currently valid European legislation (Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity), the preparation of a ten-year European Network Development Plan (TYNDP ENTSO-E) includes an assessment of adequacy based on probable access. The assessment of adequacy on a medium-term basis (Mid-Term Adequacy Forecast (MAF)) is carried out in an annual cycle based on ENTSO-E transmission system operators data, focusing on sensitivity analyses of the impacts of sudden changes in fluctuating RES production, climate conditions, market conditions (commodity and emissions pricing) and so on.                                                  22 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:d7108c4c-b7b8-11e6-9e3c-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_1&format=PDF   The probability processing of the pan-European adequacy outlook23 also includes the already-mentioned indicatively calculated reliability standard, the Energy Not Served (ENS) in MWh/year, and Loss of Load Expectation (LLE) in h/year. Non-zero values in the results indicate a problem with the adequacy of the Member States system. The SR does not yet have a defined reliability standard (VoLL, ENS, LLE) and does not apply a capacity mechanism to ensure source adequacy. To determine these parameters, account must be taken of the socio-economic and national economic interest in energy self-sufficiency, i.e. the cost of non-supply of energy based on a presumed source mix in accordance with climate and energy objectives, and also based on the technical limits on interconnection of national and pan-European systems. In the event of the establishment of a national supply reliability standard (following the application of a capacity mechanism) in accordance with European legislation under preparation, the Slovak Republic may, in the future, set or update its strategic objectives for ensuring electricity system adequacy and energy system flexibility in relation to generation from RES in accordance with climate and energy targets, respectively may ensure that the system has sufficient import capacity (in which case it is necessary to take into account the risk of generation shortfalls in the neighbouring systems and also an interest in ensuring an adequate level of security of supply on its own territory). v. Where applicable, national objectives to protect energy consumers and improve the competitiveness of the retail energy sector Pursuant to Section 19(1)(2)(e) of Act No 250/2007 on consumer protection and on amendments to Act of the Slovak National Council No 372/1990 on offenses, as amended, the Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic informs consumers about their rights and obligations within the scope of its competence in the area of consumer protection. For this purpose, the Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic publishes on its website a current list of Advisory Centres focused on consumer rights protection and an informative list of legal persons engaged in consumer protection. The Network Regulatory Office, as the State authority for the regulation of network industries with nationwide competence, handles comments from electricity, gas, heat and water consumers, mainly concerning compliance with the rights and obligations of suppliers and operators of distribution networks and systems. A proposal for alternative dispute resolution may also submitted to the Office in an effort to arrange an agreement between customer and supplier acceptable to both parties to the dispute. The Slovak Trade Inspectorate (STI) is the State authority for control of the internal market in consumer protection matters with a nationwide competence. In fulfilling this role, the STI supervises the sale of products and services to consumers, provides State supervision and control of the energy sector pursuant to special regulations, and market surveillance pursuant to a special regulation. The legal regulation defining STI competencies is Act No 128/2002, on state inspection of the internal market in consumer protection matters and on amendments and supplements to certain laws, as amended. This Act defines the rights and obligations of the STI on a general level, but also in relation to specific rules governing consumer protection in specific areas.                                                  23 https://docstore.entsoe.eu/Documents/SDC%20documents/MAF/2018/MAF%202018%20Executive%20Report.pdf   In 2018 the European Commission presented a comprehensive package of measures for the benefit of European consumers, enabling Europeans to better cope with modern-day challenges and be better protected from widespread fraud or unfair commercial practices. 2.4.4. Energy Poverty Measures of the Government of the Slovak Republic in the social area, primarily aimed at addressing social poverty, also contribute towards addressing energy poverty. The foundations for addressing the issue of energy poverty from the perspective of the energy sector are set out in legal acts relating to the internal market in electricity and gas, through which the European Union obligates Member States to take measures to protect end customers and, in particular, to ensure there are sufficient guarantees to protect vulnerable customers. According to an opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on Energy Poverty in the context of liberalization and the economic crisis (2011/C 44/09), the European Union must take action to establish common rules so that all Member States act in a united way to tackle energy poverty. In this context, each Member State  including the Slovak Republic  is to develop a vulnerable customer protection concept covering energy poverty. Energy poverty is often a consequence of poverty itself and must therefore be treated as a social policy issue. It is necessary to identify the difference between social poverty and energy poverty and to specify how energy poverty differs from the definition of a vulnerable customer. It is very important to look for solutions to eliminate poverty at government, ministry, self-government and private sector levels. Eliminating unemployment is key to tackling a range of related problems, in particular poverty and social exclusion. The Slovak Republic has exceeded its plan to eliminate the risk of poverty or social exclusion. The EU SILC 2017 survey showed that it has rescued 255 000 people from the risk of poverty or social exclusion. The measures adopted have had a major impact on the achievement of this objective, in particular in the employment policy, social policy and economic policy measures of the State. In any case, these must be comprehensive approaches, because energy poverty is not only a financial problem, but also has its human dimension, which affects with all areas of society and significantly influences the whole social atmosphere. Therefore, any solutions must be preceded by a debate across the whole of society and a quantification of impacts, since proposed solutions should not unduly burden other energy market participants. Subsequently, an appropriate combination of proposed measures and a regular evaluation of their effectiveness can be adopted in order to optimise them so as to reduce the energy poverty limit while minimising the number of people affected by this phenomenon. Measures taken by all interested parties must be directed towards meeting the goals of combating energy poverty, but they must in any way discriminate against other parts of the population or cause distortion of the liberalised energy market. The principle of solidarity must be applied, as in other cases, but must be acceptable not only for the beneficiaries but also for providers. The Slovak Republic has adopted national programmes and strategies that are secondarily aimed at addressing the problems of energy poverty:  - The National Reform Programme (NRP)  a document based on the Europe 2020 strategy, presenting national policies and measures to sustain growth and employment; - The National Employment Strategy of the Slovak Republic to 2020  an interdepartmental document that, with contributions from social partners, local governments and the civil society, identified mechanisms promoting increased employment; - The National Framework Strategy for Promoting Social Inclusion and Combating Poverty; - Networking and the Development of Public Employment Services. At its meeting on 8 March 2016, the Regulatory Council adopted a regulatory policy for the 2017-2021 regulatory period. A major difference from the previous regulatory policy is the emphasis on vulnerable customers in the electricity, gas and heating sectors, and also on the energy poverty issue. The Regulatory Office for Network Industries (RONI) will actively cooperate with the relevant authorities in areas relating to network industries when transposing European laws into Slovak legislation, and will also ensure active cooperation with European Commission bodies in drafting European energy legislation.  In this respect, the RONI has set objectives and priorities in the legislative area as follows:  - Create conditions, in cooperation with other European Union Member States, to improve electricity and gas supply security; - Ensure appropriate pricing for all customers through appropriate regulatory methods, with an emphasis on protecting vulnerable customers and ensuring the competitiveness of industrial customers; - Optimize support for electricity generation from renewable energy sources and high-efficiency cogeneration, taking into account new criteria to reduce the financial burden and to ensure the adequacy of the impact on final energy prices; - Achieve a proper perception of regulation, emphasizing that regulation is done in accordance with European Union rules and always ensures all costs are covered with a reasonable profit; - Promote the introduction of smart metering systems to ensure energy consumption until a financial limit is reached; - Develop mutual cooperation among the V4 countries to achieve a leading position and encourage other EU Member States to address common interests in the area; - Help address energy poverty through appropriate regulatory methods. Based on complete analyses and long-term preparation, the RONI submitted a proposal for a new concept for the protection of customers meeting the conditions of energy poverty for an interdepartmental comments procedure on 26 April 2019. This material is supplemented and updated in cooperation with the Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic, the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic and the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic. After the evaluation of the comments, the material will be discussed by the Government of the Slovak Republic and all ministries concerned will participate in the implementation of the approved concept. However, the competences of the RONI do not cover the whole scope (e.g. social policies or improving energy efficiency in the housing sector) of the energy poverty issue. The concept therefore strictly distinguishes between possible tools for a solution at governmental level and those at the level of the national energy regulator, as the creator of possible energy sector price measures  intended for socially vulnerable groups in the population. It explicitly states the impossibility of addressing energy poverty solely from the position of the national energy regulator as an isolated state administration body and emphasises the necessity of addressing this social issue by an integrated approach from all the public authorities concerned, which could be coordinated at government level. The concept has the ambition to translate the proposed measures into the programme of the Government of the Slovak Republic through the partial policies and programmes of the relevant ministries
