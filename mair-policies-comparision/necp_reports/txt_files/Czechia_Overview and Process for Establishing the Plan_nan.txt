 -3-  1 Overview and process for establishing the plan 1.1 Executive summary i. Political, economic, environmental and social context of the plan 1.1.1.1 Political context The Czech Republic is a stable democratic State, a member of the UN, OECD, EU and NATO and other international organisations. The Czech Republic has a directly elected President and a bicameral Parliament, which consists of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. As part of self-government, the Czech Republic is divided into 14 self-governing regions, 76 districts and more than 6 200 self-governing municipalities4. Municipalities and regions are managed by elected assemblies. Regions are headed by governors, statutory cities by statutory mayors and cities and municipalities by mayors (starosta). Prague has a special status, being simultaneously a region, statutory city and the capital. 1.1.1.2 Economic context5 Currently, the Czech Republic is undergoing a phase of economic growth, particularly due to the growth of domestic demand, but also due to net exports and increased private investment. Household consumption has been boosted by labour market developments, rising disposable income and a high level of consumer confidence. From a sectoral point of view, industry contributed most to the growth of real gross value added, which corresponds to its higher volatility during the economic cycle and the structure of the Czech economy. However, other economic sectors also saw an increase in gross value added. In the next few years, real GDP is expected to grow at just under 2.5 %. Economic growth should be driven almost exclusively by domestic demand, including both consumption (particularly private) and investment by companies and the government. This growth structure can be considered healthy. Shortage of labour is becoming a constraint to faster economic growth due to the tense situation on the labour market. Economic growth in the Czech Republic should be faster than in the euro area, which should lead to a continued increase in the relative economic level of the Czech Republic. The expected medium-term trend towards increased wage dynamics and exchange rate appreciation after the Czech National Bank (CNB) abandoned the exchange rate floor should be reflected in an increase in the comparative GDP price level. In terms of the price competitiveness of the Czech economy, however, the anticipated increase should not be problematic. Inflation is estimated to remain within the tolerance band of around 2 for the period 20182021. An increase in unit labour costs and growth in domestic demand in the context of a positive output gap should have inflationary pressure, while exchange rate appreciation will have the opposite effect on consumer prices. Higher inflation will result in slower growth of real wages and                                                            4  In the case of districts, the division is territorial, not self-governing. 5  This information is based on documents from the Ministry of Finance prepared in May 2018. The figures below are then based on documents from the Ministry of Finance prepared in July 2018, which leads to partial inconsistency. The text and numeric values in this chapter will be aligned to match the July economic forecast.   -4-  thus household consumption. In the labour market, the economic boom is reflected in the dynamic development of all important indicators, which confirms that the economy is at full employment.  In some professions and regions, the gap between job demand and supply is already significant. Shortage of labour may hinder production growth, forcing some businesses to reject new orders. On the other hand, it contributes to better use of labour, higher wages and hence household consumption. It can also motivate businesses to invest in machines and equipment that increase labour productivity. foreigners from non-EU countries. In the medium and long term, it will be important for economic growth to ensure that the education system better prepares graduates, allowing them to acquire the competencies and skills required to perform certain professions in the context of the digitisation and automation of the economy, including those that are yet to be created. On the demand side of the labour market, it will be necessary to modernise production and other procedures, thus reducing the labour intensity. In terms of the external macroeconomic balance, the current account balance has been positive since 2014. Surplus balance of goods and services exceeds the deficit of primary income, which is most affected by the outflow of foreign direct investment in the form of dividends and reinvested profits. The current account balance should continue to show a slight surplus in the following years. Although the expected economic developments are associated with positive expectations, they also involve risks. The economic pros-year highs. Economic developments in the euro area could be even more favourable than expected, which could considerably benefit the highly export-oriented economy of the Czech Republic. In this respect, the risks involve the tendency to increase protectionism  although the Czech Republic trades mostly with other EU states, although indirect exposure to some non-EU countries may be significant. Another risk is the form of the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU in relation to the free movement of goods and services.  In the longer term, significant risks include the loss of the EU budget revenues from the United Kingdom, as well as the new allocation linked to the higher relative economic development of the Czech regions and the possible redirection of funds in the EU budget to other priorities.  -5-  Table 1: Economic context  Source: Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic Chart 1: Comparison of the developments in GDP per capita (2010 prices, in USD thousand, PPP)  Source: OECD Economic Survey of the Czech Republic (July 2018) 1.1.1.3 Environmental context Over the past 20 years, the environment has significantly improved in terms of emissions of airborne dust and sulphur and nitrogen oxides in large and medium-sized combustion sources. However, it is still not satisfactory, particularly in terms of air pollution by substances posing health risks, and in affected areas it poses serious risks to human health and ecosystems and causes premature deaths and other  -6-  economic damage. The situation is unsatisfactory in almost every municipality of the Czech Republic due to emissions from domestic coal burners and in all cities due to emissions from diesel and petrol engines. As a result, a significant majority of the population of the Czech Republic is affected. The main risks to maintaining or further improving the environment are changes in the landscape related to the development of settlements (expansion of developed area, changes in the functional use of the area) and the developing road infrastructure, increased traffic intensity, intensive farming practices and finally consumption behaviour of households and individuals (heating, consumption of natural resources, etc.). The developments in environmental pressures will depend heavily on the performance of the economy in the next 10 years, with the specific load per unit of economic output to continue to gradually decline. An important aspect for improving the consumption behaviour of households is to promote increased consumer awareness of sustainable consumption and production and the impact of high consumption of people regardless of the limited supply of resources. The development of anthropogenic loads and the state of the environmental elements can be influenced by the changing climate and the associated change in temperature and rainfall regime. It can be assumed that this mechanism will affect the total emissions from electricity and heat generation, distribution pattern of pollutants and air quality, the quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater, biodiversity and state of forest land, soil quality, the spread of harmful organisms in agriculture and the related consumption of agrochemicals. Overall, we are likely to see an increase in extreme nature of climate, consisting of more frequent occurrences of hazardous hydrological and weather phenomena such as floods, droughts, strong winds, temperature fluctuations, etc.  Model simulations expect a continuing gradual increase in average annual temperature by 0.3Â°C per decade. The total annual precipitation will not change significantly, but we will see increased fluctuations in total precipitation both on year-on-year basis and during the year, as well as the rainfall distribution in our territory to become more uneven. Changes in landscape use may lead to higher risk of water and wind erosion and reduced retention of the landscape, making it more vulnerable to floods due to the expected more frequent torrential rainfall. Similarly, more frequent droughts are expected,  GHG emissions declined by 34.7 % between 1990 and 2016. However, in comparison with the EU, the Czech Republic has higher specific GHG emissions per capita (12.4 tonnes of CO2 eq. per capita compared to 8.7 tonnes of CO2 eq. per capita in the EU). On the other hand, the Czech Republic has a below-average share of transport in total European GHG emissions, currently at around 14 %, although it can be expected to increase. The emission intensity of GDP is higher in the Czech Republic compared to the EU average, due to the higher share of industry in the GDP and the higher emission intensity of transport. The above-the-threshold concentrations of PM10, which affect a large share of the population, continue to be a significant problem (the emission limit for the 24-hour average concentration of PM10 was exceeded on 8.3 % of the territory in 2017, with the above-the-threshold concentrations affecting 23.1 % of the Czech population). As a result of PM10 air pollution, there may be an increase in the incidence of allergic diseases in children, as well as in an increase in respiratory and cardiovascular diseases or even premature deaths, especially in elderly and chronically ill people. Non-compliance with the target emission limits for benzo(a)pyrene and ground-level ozone also continues to be a problem. An important role in air quality is also played by poor dispersion conditions.  -7-  By 2020, particulate matter emissions of PM2.5, SO2, NOx, volatile organic compounds (VOC) and NH3 will decrease. The obligation of the Czech Republic to reduce the emissions of these pollutants is laid down in Directive (EU) 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants. It lays down the national commitments for 2020 and for 2030. In accordance with Annex 2 to the Directive, the Czech Republic is obliged to reduce emissions of selected pollutants compared to the reference year 2005 as follows: for PM 2.5 by 17 % for 2020 and by 60 % for 2030; for SO2 by 45 % for 2020 and 66 % for 2030; for NOx by 35 % for 2020 and 64 % for 2030; for VOCs by 18 % for 2020 and 50 % for 2030; for NH3 by 7 % for 2020 and 22 % for 2030. Water quality in watercourses is gradually improving, mainly due to a decrease in the amount of discharged pollution from point sources. An important factor affecting water quality is the share of the population connected to water supply and sewerage systems which lead to a waste water treatment plant; their number has increased almost twice since 1990, with a particular increase in waste water treatment plants with tertiary treatment (removal of P and N). The requirements of Council Directive 91/271/EEC concerning urban waste-water treatment, which lays down an obligation to ensure that municipalities with more than 2 000 inhabitants are connected to waste water treatment plants, are not met only for a minor share of these municipalities. In 2018, 85.5 % of the Czech population was connected to the public sewer system. By contrast, the Czech Republic is unsuccessful in limiting the extent of surface pollution, which mainly results from agricultural activity (the use of mineral fertilisers), which subsequently leads to the eutrophication of watercourses and reservoirs. An equally important aspect in assessing the state of water is its environmental value. In this respect, it is necessary to increase migration permeability and improve morphological conditions in watercourses, where appropriate and effective. Water quality problems do not only concern municipal water or pollution from agricultural sources, but also, for example, medicines that get through the sewerage into watercourses, where they negatively affect aquatic organisms and enter the food chains. Due to changes in landscape use and climate change, the resilience of ecosystems is diminishing, which results in the unfavourable state of a number of wild species of plants and wild animals (including the species of plants and animals of Community importance) and the reduced ability to eliminate or absorb external influences, including the spread of non-native species and harmful organisms. The decline in ecosystem resilience is mainly due to the persisting consequences of intensified agriculture in the second half of the 20th century, accompanied by the unification of land affected by such agriculture, the persisting significant share of forests which are unbalanced in terms of species, age and spatial structure, persisting degradation of forest soils polluted by emissions, regulation and fragmentation of watercourses and the increasing fragmentation of the landscape (due to transport and construction). These reasons result in the decline of rare species and the reduction of the abundance and vitality of populations of common species, migration routes are disrupted and plants and animals are exposed to increased stress, while undesirable (non-native and invasive) species spread. 1.1.1.4 Social context Inequality and poverty have been low in the last decade compared to other OECD countries. There are large regional disparities in poverty; there is a high level of poverty in the Northwest and the Moravian-Silesian regions, while at the same time the level of poverty is generally relatively low, reflecting the high wage margins due to differences in qualifications and productivity across sectors. The largest economic inequality is in Prague, while low-low wage/income of most workers. ii. Overarching strategy covering all five dimensions of the Energy Union  -8-  The Strategic Framework Czech Republic 2030 can be considered as the overarching strategy covering all five dimensions of the Energy Union. This document defines the top-level targets for the development of the Czech Republic. The strategic framework links two fundamental concepts: sustainable development and quality of life. The Czech Republic 2030 constitutes a long-term framework for strategic planning in the State administration and allows the long-term objectives of the State administration to be communicated transparently to professionals and the general public. The Strategic Framework Czech Republic 2030 builds on the Strategic Framework for Sustainable Development of 2010. The Report on Quality of Life and its Sustainability is prepared every three years. Specific measures are then further elaborated in the implementation plan.6 In this respect, it is necessary to point out that the Strategic Framework Czech Republic 2030 is the top-level strategic document, which can be described as an overarching document covering all five dimensions of the Energy Union. At the same time, however, it should be noted that the document has a significantly wider scope and deals in general with sustainable development and quality of life, where the definition of an energy union can only be seen as one of the parts of this overall definition. Table 2 then shows other significant top-level strategic documents, both overarching and sectoral (including the aforementioned Strategic Framework Czech Republic 2030). However, the list is not exhaustive, it only shows the most important documents. The key strategies in energy and climate protection are further outlined in subchapters 1.2.1.1 and 1.2.1.2. Table 2: Top-level strategic documents Strategic document Brief description Strategic Framework Czech Republic 2030 Top-level document, which defines top-level targets for the development of the Czech Republic. The document supersedes the Strategic Framework for Sustainable Development of 2010. Regional Development Strategy of the Czech Republic 20142020 (RDS) The basic strategic document in regional development. The RDS is a tool for implementing regional policy and coordinating the impact of other public policies on regional development. The RDS interconnects sectoral aspects (themes and priorities) with territorial aspects. It is a medium-term document, which contains a long-term view of the Czech -term vision) as well as short-term implementation steps. Transport Policy of the Czech Republic for 20142020 with the Prospect of 2050 Transport is one of the very important sectors of the national economy, which affects virtually all areas of public and private life and the business environment. This sector is necessary for increasing the competitiveness of the Czech Republic. The document identifies the key issues of the sector and proposes measures to address them.                                                            6  For more information and relevant materials, see www.cr2030.cz.  -9-  International Competitiveness Strategy of the Czech Republic 20122020 The strategy defines measures that should put the Czech Republic among the 20 most competitive economies in the world. The tools to achieve this include maintaining a long-term balanced public budget, improve and improved quality and better efficiency of public administration, modernised transport, energy and ICT infrastructure, creating a financially sustainable public healthcare model, optimised education system and the entire national innovation system as the main pillars of the development of knowledge society and economy, increased flexibility of the labour market and creating favourable conditions for the development of business and commercial activities. The National Research, Development and Innovation Policy of the Czech Republic 20162020 and its update for 20192020 The National Research, Development and Innovation Policy of the Czech Republic 20162020 is the key strategic document at national level, which sets out guidelines for research, development and innovation and forms the basis for other related strategic documents of the Czech Republic. The document puts more emphasis on supporting applied research for the needs of the economy and the State administration, and identifies the key areas and research topics on which applied research should focus. The National Policy also proposes changes in the management and funding of science to produce more top-level scientific results and to engage companies more in R&D. The document has superseded the National Research, Development and Innovation Policy of the Czech Republic 20092015. In 2018, the Report on the Evaluation of Fulfilment of Measures of the National Research, Development and Innovation Policy of the Czech Republic 20162020 was prepared and it was approved by the Czech Government in February 2019. This report includes an update of the National Research, Development and Innovation Policy of the Czech Republic 20162020 for the period 20192020, prepared in the context of the proposed modifications to the measures described in that report. National priorities for research, experimental development and innovation By its Resolution No 552 of 19 July 2012, the Government approved the National Priorities of Oriented Research, Experimental Development and Innovation. National priorities for oriented research, experimental development and innovation are valid for the period up to 2030 with gradual fulfilment. Within the defined 6  -10-  priority areas, there are 24 sub-areas with a total of 170 specific targets. The document contains a description of each of the priority areas and sub-areas, indicating links between the areas and defining several system measures. The document also contains a statement on the expected allocation of research, development and innovation expenditures from the State budget to individual areas and defines the period during which the progress towards and the update of the priorities will be evaluated. National Research and Innovation Strategy for Smart Specialisation of the Czech Republic (RIS3 Strategy) The purpose of the National RIS3 Strategy is to effectively focus European, national, regional and private funding on priority innovation specialisations in order to fully exploit the  National Initiative Industry 4.0 The document aims to mobilise key sectors and industry representatives to develop detailed action plans in areas of political, economic and social life. Reducing energy and raw material intensity of production, increasing productivity in production, optimising logistics routes, technology solutions for decentralised energy production and distribution systems and smart city infrastructure are the major benefits of Industry 4.0.  Raw material policy in the field of minerals and their sources Raw material policy was updated in 2017. The document responds to the transformation of the raw material industry, especially as regards the range of raw materials required by modern industry. There has been a major shift towards modern high-tech raw materials which are used in electronics and other modern industries. The document reflects the principles of the EU Raw Materials Initiative, which was created in relation to the increase in the importance of raw materials security of EU Member States.  State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic (SEP) Top-level strategic document for the energy sector. It was approved in May 2015. The current SEP has an outlook until 2040. State Environmental Policy of the Czech Republic 20122020 The State Environmental Policy of the Czech Republic 20122020 is an overarching strategic document, which defines the implementation of effective environmental protection in the Czech Republic. The main objective is to ensure a healthy and quality environment for people living in the Czech Republic, to contribute to the efficient use of all resources and to minimise the negative impacts of human activity on the environment, including cross-border impacts,  -11-  thus contributing to better quality of life in Europe and in the world. Innovation Strategy of the Czech Republic 20192030 Innovation Strategy of the Czech Republic 20192030 was approved by Government Resolution No 104 of 4 February 2019. It is a strategic framework plan that predetermines government policy in the area of research, development and innovation and it is intended to help the Czech Republic become one of twelve years. The innovation strategy consists of nine interconnected pillars, which contain the starting points, the basic strategic objectives and the instruments leading to their fulfilment. These pillars represent the following areas: Research and development funding and evaluation, Innovation and research centres, National start-up and spin-off environment, Polytechnic education, Digitisation, Mobility and construction environment, Intellectual property protection, Smart investment and Smart marketing. Territorial Development Policy of the Czech Republic During the preparation of the National Plan of the Czech Republic, the Territorial Development Policy of the Czech Republic is effective as amended by Updates Nos 1, 2 and 3. (Update No 3 was approved by Government Resolution No 630 of 2 September 2019) Strategic document with nationwide scope and a spatial planning tool binding for making and issuing spatial planning documentation of regions and municipalities and for decision-making in the territory. Its main purpose is to coordinate regional spatial planning activities of regions (or municipalities) and departmental policies, strategies and documents with territorial projection. This document sets out, among other things, the national priorities of spatial planning and defines in particular the development plans (areas and corridors) of transport and technical infrastructure of international and national importance, or of those exceeding the territory of one region.

Current energy and climate policies and measures relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union 1.2.1.1 State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic and other strategic documents in the field of energy The key strategic document, which contains policies and measures in the field of energy and, therefore, across all five dimensions of the Energy Union, is the State Energy Policy (SEP). Furthermore, territorial energy policies, which must be in line with the State Energy Policy, are also being prepared. These strategic documents are laid down in Act No 406/2000, on energy management, as amended (hereinafter performance of State administration in the field of energy management. It is prepared by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, which evaluates it at least once every 5 years and informs the Government of the evaluation. In addition, it submits to the Government, by 31 December of each year, an evaluation of the progress towards the targets and measures laid down in the SEP. The current State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic was approved by the Government on 16 May 2015 and has an outlook until 2040. The long-a reliable, affordable and sustainable energy supplies for households and the economy. This vision is summarised into three top-level  competitiveness  sustainability. The SEP contains the following strategic energy priorities: (i) a balanced energy mix / transformation of the energy industry; (ii) energy savings and energy efficiency improvements; (iii) infrastructure development; (iv) research in the field of energy and industry, human resources; (v) energy security. Furthermore, it contains the strategy for the development of major energy sectors and related areas, namely: electricity sector; gas sector; oil processing; heating sector; transport; energy efficiency; research, development, innovation and education; power engineering; external energy policy.

It focuses mainly on the strategy of network infrastructure development to ensure reliable and safe operation with the required development of distributed production. The Update of the NAP SG for 20192030 was approved by the Government of the Czech Republic on 16 September 2019. National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP CM) It is based on Directive 2014/94/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure. The document is aimed at creating a strategic framework for developing clean mobility and providing for the necessary infrastructure. The document was approved by the Government of the Czech Republic on 20 November 2015. This document was being updated in 2019. National Action Plan for the Development of Nuclear Energy in the Czech Republic (NAP NE) Approved by the Czech government in June 2015. The document is aimed at meeting the objectives of the SEP in the area of further development of nuclear energy. National Renewable Energy Action Plan of the Czech Republic (NAP RES) The last NAP RES was approved by the government on 25 January 2016. This document specifies measures and tools concerning RES. For the period after 2021, the NAP RES will be superseded by the National Plan. National Energy Efficiency Action Plan of the Czech Republic (NAP EE) The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan describes the planned energy efficiency improvement measures and expected or achieved energy savings, including those in the supply, transmission and distribution of energy as well as energy end-use. For the period after 2021, the NAP EE will be superseded by the National Plan.                                                            8  In addition to strategic document, it is also worth mentioning the voluntary commitments of cities and regions (e.g. under the Covenant of Mayors) in achieving energy and climate goals. It can be expected that local authorities will take greater responsibility for achieving climate targets also by implementing smart strategies and smart projects at the level of municipalities and cities.  -16-  National Emission Reduction Programme of the Czech Republic It is the basic strategic document on the air quality improvement and reduction of emissions from air pollution sources. The document was approved on 2 December 2015 by a resolution of the Government of the Czech Republic. This document is currently being updated. Action Plan for Biomass in the Czech Republic 20122020 The aim of this document is primarily to define the measures and principles which will lead to the effective and efficient utilisation of the biomass energy potential and thus help to fulfil the obligations of the Czech Republic for the generation of energy from renewable sources by 2020. The document was approved by the government on 12 September 2012. Raw material policy in the field of minerals and their sources On 14 June 2017, by Resolution No 441 of 14 June 2017, the Government of the Czech Republic discussed and approved the document Republic in the Field of Minerals and their  has completed the process of updating the Czech State raw materials policy, which has been running continuously since 2012, with the actual approval process lasting almost a year and a half. Source: Prepared by MIT using publicly available information  1.2.1.2 Climate Policy and other strategic documents in the field of climate protection The Climate Policy in the Czech Republic represents a strategy until 2030 as well as a low-emission economy development plan until 2050. It focuses on measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and is thus complementary to the approved Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change in the Czech Republic, which focuses on the issue of adaptation to climate change. The Climate Policy follows on from the State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic and takes up and develops a number of its measures in the field of energy. In doing so, it is based on the so-called optimised SEP scenario. However, it also contains a whole range of new policies and measures focused on sectors outside EU ETS.  The Climate Policy in the Czech Republic sets the main targets in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and sets long-term indicative targets (see Table 10). Table 10: Summary of targets of the Climate Policy in Czech Republic Target horizon Target description Main target by 2020 By 2020, reduce emissions of the Czech Republic by at least 32 Mt CO2 eq. compared to 2005 (corresponding to a reduction of 20 % compared to 2005).  -17-  Main target by 2030 By 2030, reduce emissions of the Czech Republic by at least 44 Mt CO2 eq. compared to 2005 (corresponding to a reduction of 30 % compared to 2005).

State Environmental Policy of the Czech Republic 20122020 It defines a plan to implement effective environmental protection in the Czech Republic by 2020. Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change in the Czech Republic Approved in October 2015; it builds on the National Action Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change. National Action Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change It builds on the 2015 strategy; it contains specific implementation measures, including the responsibilities of individual ministries and the deadlines for the proposed tasks. National Emission Reduction Programme of the Czech Republic It is the basic strategic document on the air quality improvement and reduction of emissions from air pollution sources. The document was approved on 2 December 2015 by a resolution of the Government of the Czech Republic. An update of this document was prepared in 2019. The update passed the interdepartmental comment procedure in the first half of 2019 and the material will be submitted to the Czech  -18-  Government for approval after the eventual completion of the SEA process. Source: Prepared by MIT using publicly available information  iii. Key issues of cross-border relevance Among the key issues of cross-border relevance are, in general, (i) major strategic documents that are subject to international strategic impact assessment (SEA); (ii) major infrastructure projects, in particular cross-border interconnection in the field of electricity transmission, transmission of gas and oil and petroleum products, as well as the construction of major production sources or sources located close to the border with the neighbouring state (these projects are predominantly subject to the international EIA); (iii) transnational cooperation in the field of science and research; (iv) other activities that may have an impact on another Member State. iv. Administrative structure of implementing national energy and climate policies As regards the administrative structure of implementing national energy and climate policies, an important role is played by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, which is the central State administration body in the field of energy, and the Ministry of the Environment, which is the central State administration body in the field of climate policy. These ministries are responsible for the preparation of legislation in the above areas as well as of non-legislative strategic materials. Legislative and non--Government. Measures and policies pass through a standard legislative process, with gradual involvement of the Government of the Czech Republic, the Chamber of Deputies, the Senate and the President of the Czech Republic. Non-legislative documents are approved by the Government of the Czech Republic, which adopts the relevant resolutions, specifying concrete tasks following from that resolution. The preparation of top-level strategic documents, their content and their binding nature are in most cases laid down in legislation. The obligation to prepare, the mandatory elements and the binding nature of the State Energy Policy is, for example, laid down in Act No 406/2000, on energy management. 1.3 Consultations and involvement of national and Union entities and their outcome i. Involvement of national parliament During the preparation or finalisation of the Draft National Plan, a number of seminars were held in the Chamber of Deputies and the Parliament of the Czech Republic, which were specifically or partially focused on the process of preparing the National Plan (for example on 13 December 2018, a seminar was held with an emphasis on the issue of financing objectives; on 4 April 2018, there was a seminar focused on RES, etc.). The issue of preparing the National Plan was also repeatedly discussed at the level of relevant committees (in particular the Committee on Power Engineering and the Committee on Environment of the Chamber of Deputies). The Senate of the Czech Republic also requested the elaboration of a framework position on the recommendations of the European Commission of 18 June 2019 regarding the Draft National Energy and Climate Plan of the Czech Republic. This framework position was discussed by the Committee on European Affairs of the Senate of the Czech Republic on 24 October 2019 and it was approved at the plenary session of the Senate of the Czech Republic on 30 October 2019. In its adopted resolution (Resolution 124 of the 15th meeting held on 24 October 2019), the Senate appreciates the systematic and comprehensive approach of the European Commission to  -19-  achieving the goals of the Energy Union and laying the foundations for a successful transition to clean e 22 % share of renewable energy in the final version of the Czech National Plan, but recommends that the Czech Government continuously negotiate with stakeholders and look for ways to more significantly increase the share of renewable energy sources (RES) within the energy mix of the Czech Republic in the 20232024 Plan Update and to reduce primary energy consumption, taking into account geographical and climatic conditions, economic possibilities of the Czech Republic and expected future development of individual technologies (this is not an exhaustive list of information from the resolution). recommendations regarding the Draft National Plan were discussed by the Committee on Environment of the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic and a resolution was adopted regarding the Draft Integrated National Plan of the Czech Republic were discussed within the Committee on European Affairs of the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic. Representatives of the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic also participated in the meetings of the working group for the preparation of the National Plan. At the same time, the National Plan was being discussed throughout the preparation process, in particular with relevant Members of Parliament and Senators, for whom the energy and climate sectors are a key area of responsibility. ii. Involvement of local and regional authorities Local and regional authorities (self-governing units/regions, cities and municipalities, etc.) had the opportunity to comment on the draft and final versions of the National Plan of the Czech Republic within the standard comment procedures through the respective groups and associations. At the same time, the relevant authorities were invited to relevant working groups and had the opportunity to participate directly in the preparation of the document.  regions to elaborate them is laid down by law), which must be in accordance with the state energy concept and at the same time serve as a basis for its updating. This process should ensure coherence of objectives and priorities at the state and regional level. However, the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 to a large extent do not correspond to the time course of elaboration of strategic documents in the Czech Republic, so the National Plan could not fully reflect the energy planning on the regional level due to incomplete cycle of preparation of territorial energy concepts. iii. Consultations of stakeholders, including the social partners, and engagement of civil society and the general public The National Energy and Climate Plan was prepared with the participation of a wide range of relevant professional bodies. From the departments, the following entities were directly involved in the preparations beyond the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of the Environment: Ministry for Regional Development; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Transport; Energy Regulatory Office; Czech Hydrometeorological Office; the electricity and gas market operator, Confederation of Industry and Transport; Czech Chamber of Commerce; Chamber of Renewable Energy Sources, Czech Gas Association; Union of Towns and Municipalities; Czech Association of Petroleum Industry and Trade; representatives of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Czech Republic9.                                                            9  This is not an exhaustive list, but a list of the main entities involved in the preparation.  -20-  An external (interdepartmental) comment procedure and public consultation took place as part of the preparation of the Draft National Energy and Climate Plan of the Czech Republic. During December 2018, specifically on Friday 21 December 2018, a formal external consultation process regarding the Draft National Plan of the Czech Republic was launched with ministries and other bodies with the status of a commenting body. Also, on Friday 21 December 2018, the Draft National Plan of the Czech Republic was published on the website of the Ministry of Industry and Trade10 for public consultation. The most important comments include (without limitation): the ambition level, especially in the area of RES and the electricity sector; a comment on determining the contribution to the European RES target; a suggestion to implement a wider portfolio of policy measures regarding the compliance with Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive  the requirement for detailed discussion; the requirement to process additional analyses; the requirement to fill in some missing parts such as impact analyses; impacts on final customers and minimisation of State aid; insufficient public/private resources to meet the contributions in the plan; insufficient time to discuss and revise the document; inadequacy of measures and policies to achieve targets and their lack of specificity in some cases; statistical irregularities and inconsistencies; excessive scope of some parts and also the excessive briefness of some other areas; contradicting the development of some underlying trends and quantities; a requirement to emphasise the role of nuclear power to meet decarbonisation targets.  On 11 November 2019, external (interdepartmental) comment procedure and public consultation11 were launched with a deadline for comments set to 22 November 2019 and 25 November 2019 respectively. Hundreds of comments were received during the comment procedure and public consultation. All comments received, both in the external comment procedure and in the public consultation, including their settlement, are available on request12. iv. Consultations of other Member States In accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the National Plan of the Czech Republic was regionally consulted as follows. On 20 November 2018, a regional consultation of the Visegrad Group countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland) and Austria took place under the Slovak Presidency of the Visegrad Group. This meeting was attended by representatives of the public administration, namely those responsible for the energy sector and climate protection. Practical aspects regarding the preparation of the National Plan and its draft were discussed, as well as individual issues corresponding to the individual dimensions of the Energy Union, namely: (i) renewable energy sources; (ii) climate protection; (iii) energy efficiency; (iv) the internal energy market; and (v) energy security. The main aspects of the preparation, the positions on the main targets and the most important policies to meet these targets were discussed. The experts also discussed further steps and specific elements of the National Plan where there is space for further regional cooperation. On 8 and 9 April, a regional consultation of the Draft German National Plan took place in Berlin with the participation of a number of Member States, including the Czech Republic. Germany provided form also provided                                                            10 The reference to the Draft National Plan of the Czech Republic for the purposes of public consultation: https://www.mpo.cz/cz/energetika/strategicke-a-koncepcni-dokumenty/navrh-vnitrostatniho-planu-v-oblasti-energetiky-a-klimatu-ceske-republiky--242761/ 11 The reference to the National Plan of the Czech Republic for the purposes of public consultation: https://www.mpo.cz/cz/energetika/strategicke-a-koncepcni-dokumenty/verejna-konzultace-k-vnitrostatnimu-planu-ceske-republiky-v-oblasti-energetiky-a-klimatu--250509/ 12  Comments and their settlements are available only in Czech.  -21-  information on the planned end of coal use in Germany. Member States, including the Czech Republic, had the opportunity to discuss specific parts introduced by Germany. On 28 June 2019, a regional consultation was held in Vienna at the invitation of Austria, attended by representatives of Austria, Slovakia, Germany and the Czech Republic. The meeting had a form of an information exchange and subsequent discussion on all five dimensions of the Energy Union. Relative consensus has been reached on the fact that the common challenges for the participating countries are, in particular, decarbonisation of transport and energy security. Furthermore, areas of possible future cooperation, or a deepening of existing regional cooperation, were identified. The Czech Republic also discussed parts of the National Plan of the Czech Republic or its draft on relevant bilateral and multilateral platforms, such as bilateral negotiations with representatives of France on 18 July 2019 in Prague and meeting of the Polish and Czech governments on 28 August 2019 in Warsaw or during the V4 high-level panel discussion on energy efficiency on 28 November in Prague. We can also mention the V4 joint meeting on production adequacy, which took place on 4 July 2019 with the participation of representatives of the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA). On 23 August 2019, the Czech Republic published the Draft National Plan for regional consultation13. All neighbouring countries (Slovakia, Germany, Poland) as well as Hungary (due to the Visegrad Group cooperation) were informed about the launch of the consultation via a letter. The other Member States were notified about the regional consultation electronically via national contacts. By 15 October 2019, the Czech Republic received no comments from any of the Member States; several Member States sent statements on the non-application of comments as well as some clarifying questions. Under the V4 Presidency, the Czech Republic plans to organise a follow-up regional consultation in the first half of 2020, focusing on the implementation of the National Plans (by this time, the plans must already be submitted as required by Regulation (EU) 2018/1999) and on the consultation of the subsequent actions, mainly the elaboration of annual and biannual progress reports as required by Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. Consultations with other Member States were also carried out within the frameworks initiated by the European Commission or at the level of the European Council. This includes, among other things, the meetings of the Technical Working Group (meetings took place in 2019 on the following dates: 29 January, 15 May, 2 and 3 July, 17 September). Within this working group, the Czech Republic presented, among other things, an approach to the construction of RES trajectories and national objectives and policies in the area of research, innovation and competitiveness. Negotiations regarding the National Energy and Climate Plan also took place at the level of the Energy Working Groups and the Telecommunications and Energy Council, which took place on 25 June 2019 and 24 September 2019. Last but not least, there were discussions initiated by the European Commission focusing on specific topics, such as the Technical Workshop on RES and Energy Efficiency, which took place on 11 September 2019 and the joint meeting of representatives of the Technical Working Group and representatives of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan, which took place on 16 September 2019. Last but not least, it is necessary to mention that the policies and measures listed in the National Plan are based on the vast majority of the approved strategic documents, especially the State Energy Policy and the Climate Protection Policy. These documents are subject to strategic environmental assessment (SEA). Interstate consultations were also held as part of this process, in which other Member States had                                                            13 The public consultation information was published at the following link.  -22-  the opportunity to comment. Therefore, the regional consultation was also carried out in the form of interstate consultations on key strategic documents. v. Iterative process with the Commission In accordance with Article 9(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the Commission will examine the draft integrated national energy and climate plans and may issue recommendations to each Member State no later than six months before the deadline for submitting the integrated national energy and climate plans. On 18 June 2019, the European Commission published a Communication (COM (2019)285) assessing the joint achievement of the Energy Union objectives and of the climate action measures; recommendations for all Member States, including the Czech Republic, were published at the same time. The Czech Republic appreciates the efforts of the European Commission to clarify the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 and the recommendations made through presentations and discussions in the framework of TWG, EWP and TTE meetings. The Czech Republic also utilised the bilateral consultations with Commission representatives. In accordance to Article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, a Member State is required to take due account of relevant recommendations in a spirit of solidarity between the Member States and the Union and among the Member States themselves. The Czech Republic received a total of ten specific recommendations. Below is how the Czech Republic took these recommendations into account when finalising the National Plan. Recommendations of the European Commission on the Draft National Plan of the Czech Republic and their considerations by the Czech Republic: 1) Increase the 2030 ambition level for the share of renewable energy to at least 23 % as the Czech Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. Indicate in the final plan an indicative trajectory which, in accordance with that share, will reach all the reference points referred to in Article 4(a)(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, taking into account the need to step up efforts to achieve this goal together. Present detailed and quantified policies and measures in line with the obligations set out in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council in order to achieve this contribution in a timely and cost-effective manner. Increase the ambition level in the heating and cooling sector to achieve the indicative target referred to in Article 23 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and present measures to achieve the transport sector target set out in the Czech Republic plan in accordance with Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Introduce measures to reduce administrative burdens related to the framework for the self-consumption of electricity from renewable sources and the renewable community in accordance with Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Taking account of the recommendationsrenewable energy target for 2030 (as a share of gross final energy consumption) was increased to 22 %. For detailed information on the contribution of each renewable source and individual sectors, see 2.1.2. The indicative trajectory which, in accordance with the stated share, reaches all reference points referred to in Article 4(a)(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, is provided in 2.1.2. For detailed information on policies and measures, see 3.1.2 and 3.1.2.2. The ambition level in the heating and cooling sector was increased from an average annual growth rate of 0.8 % to 1.0 % (excluding waste heat). Achieving the indicative target referred to in Article 23 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 is not possible for objective reasons, more detailed justification is given in 2.1.2. Detailed  -23-  information regarding measures to achieve the transport sector goal can be found in Chapter3.1.3.6. Information regarding the introduction of measures to reduce administrative burdens related to the framework for the self-consumption of electricity from renewable sources and the renewable community in accordance with Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 is provided in Chapter 3.1.2, specifically in point (v). For the area of self-consumption of electricity from renewable sources and the community for renewable energy sources, the Czech Republic will transpose Directive (EU) 2018/2001 into national legislation on 30 June 2021 and it is not possible to anticipate future legislation at this point. The Czech Republic will provide detailed information in the framework of the biannual integrated reports on energy from renewable sources. 2) Increase the ambition level to reduce primary energy consumption, taking into account the need to y target for 2030 and support it with policies and measures to achieve further energy savings by 2030. Better identify the policies and measures envisaged to be adopted during the 20212030 period, for example on the basis of an assessment of their expected impacts. Taking account of the recommendations: As regards the indicative contribution to the EU 2030 energy efficiency target, the Czech Republic did not increase its ambitions in the area of primary energy sources and final consumption compared to the Draft National Plan. The Czech Republic set its targets on the basis of realistic possibilities, taking into account national circumstances affecting primary and final energy consumption in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. Any increase in ambition would imply an increase in overall investment in this area, beyond the already relatively large-scale investment in meeting the target set out by Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, as amended, which would need to be offset by national and Union resources in order to maintain competitiveness. The determination of the Czech Furthermore, the target value of primary energy sources has also been partially increased compared to the Draft National Plan of the Czech Republic, due to an increase in the share of renewable energy sources. Detailed information on energy efficiency policies and measures has been added to Chapter 3.2. Furthermore, Annex 4 has been added, which contains detailed cards of policy measures focused on complying with Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, as amended. 3) Provide forecasts on the future mix of energy sources, including renewable gas, and planned measures concerning the energy system resilience, demand side measures and measures concerning cyber security and critical infrastructure. Provide more detailed policies and measures aimed at greater diversification of gas supplies from third countries. Further specify measures to support energy security objectives for diversification and reduction of energy dependency, including measures to ensure flexibility and long-term supply of nuclear materials and fuel, in particular with a view to developing nuclear power generation capacity. Taking account of the recommendations: The expected future composition of energy sources and their consumption is clearly presented in Annex 1, which provides a simplified energy balance in 2016, 2020, 2025 and 2030. More information on the future energy mix has been added to 4.4.1.1. Detail information on estimating the development of gas from renewable sources is provided in 4.2.2. Information regarding existing or planned cyber security measures has been added to 3.3.1.6. Critical infrastructure measures are listed in 3.3.1.1. Detailed information on diversifying gas supplies from third countries is provided in 4.4.1.3. Measures to support energy security objectives for diversification and reduction of energy dependency, including flexibility measures, are  -24-  described in Chapter 3.3. Measures to ensure the security of long-term supplies of nuclear materials and fuel have been added to 3.3.1.5, detailed information regarding the current situation and expected developments with regard to long-term supplies of nuclear materials and fuels were also added to 4.4.1.6. 4) Define perspective objectives and tasks for market integration, in particular well-defined new and planned measures. Outline the potential of renewable gas. Provide in the final plan an overall assessment of existing and future measures related to the development of competition. Taking account of the recommendations: Objectives regarding for market integration are listed in 2.4.3. Detail information on estimating the development of gas from renewable sources is provided in 4.2.2. The impact assessment of individual existing and future measures with regard to the development of competition is administratively demanding also in view of the above policies and measures. Regulatory impact assessment is carried out for legislative measures on a compulsory basis, which also assesses the impact on competition. These assessments may be shared by the Czech Republic for selected policies, but they cannot be included in gross in this document, given, for example, its scope. State aid is also subject to an assessment directly by the European Commission according to the applicable state aid rules, so the Czech Republic assumes that the key schemes have been or will be assessed directly by the European Commission (this concerns for example the proposed scheme for support of renewable energy sources for 20212030 under the amendment to Act No 165/2012, on supported energy sources, see in detail the section 3.1.2.2). 5) Further clarify the national and funding objectives for research, innovation and competitiveness, which are specifically relating to the Energy Union and are to be achieved from now on by 2030, so that they are immediately measurable and appropriate to support the achievement of objectives in other dimensions of an integrated national energy and climate plan. Support these objectives with specific and adequate policies and measures, including those to be developed in cooperation with other Member States, such as the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan. Taking account of the recommendations: Objectives are described in Chapter 2.5. As stated in this section, the Czech Republic does not have an aggregate goal that would be easily quantifiable, specifically for the energy and climate sectors. In the time horizon since the draft submission, it was not possible to design and approve such an objective at national level. Policies and measures are described in Chapter 3.5, no additional policies in this area have been approved since the submission of the draft. The Czech Republic will report on further developments in the relevant progress report prepared in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1999.  6) Continue the already excellent regional cooperation within the Visegrad Group consisting of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, as well as the bilateral dialogues with other Member States. Such cooperation could include topics such as further integration of the internal energy market, measures related to assessing the adequacy of the system in view of the planned continuation of the capacity market, fair transformation, reducing carbon emissions and further introduction of renewable energy, including the resulting impacts on the energy system and cross-border trade in electricity. Taking account of the recommendations: The Czech Republic plans to continue the regional cooperation at the Visegrad Group level as well as at bilateral level with other (relevant) Member States. For more information on the regional consultation of the National Plan, see Chapter 1.3, in particular part (iv).  -25-  7) Extend the analysis of investment needs and resources, including relevant funding at national, regional and Union level, currently available for specific policies, to a general overview of investment needs to achieve the energy and climate objectives. Also consider cost-effective transfers to other Member States under Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council as a source of funding. Taking account of the recommendations: Information regarding investment needs to achieve the objectives and sources of funding has been added to Chapters 5 and 5.3.4. For information regarding the possible use of static transfers / transfers in RES, please see Chapter 3.1.2, specifically point (ii). 8) Indicate all subsidies in the energy sector, including in particular fossil fuel subsidies, and the measures or plans taken to phase them out. Taking account of the recommendations: The list of energy subsidies with emphasis on fossil fuel subsidies, including measures and plans for their phasing out, were added to chapters 3.1.3 part (iv) and 4.6 part (iv) 9) Add to the analysis the information regarding interactions with air quality and air emissions policy, report and quantify the impacts of air pollution in different scenarios, provide background information and consider synergies and compensatory effects. Taking account of the recommendations: Interactions with air quality and air emissions policy, including quantification of the effects of air pollution, have been added to Chapter 4.2.1, specifically to section (iii). 10) Better integrate aspects of fair transformation, in particular by providing more details on the skills, social and employment impacts of the planned objectives, policies and measures. The final integrated national energy and climate plan should in particular analyse the impact of the energy transformation on the population affected by the phasing out of coal use or adaptations in other energy-intensive sectors and it should be linked to the Czech strategic ReStart framework to support the fair transformation of Czech coal regions. Further develop methods to address energy poverty issues, among other things by specifying the assessment required by Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. Taking account of the recommendations: Information on energy sector transformation has been added to Chapter 5.2, with particular emphasis on the population affected by the gradual phasing out of coal use. The impacts of the energy sector transformation on the population affected by the phasing out of coal use, or the overall impacts of the phaseout, should be analysed in more detail by Commission must be prepared by 30 September 2020 at the latest according to the approved statute. Hence, it is not possible to provide all the recommended information, which will however be supplemented through the relevant progress reports in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. On 5 June 2019, the European Commission published a new proposal for country-specific recommendations including a justification in the context of the European Semester for coordination of economic policies. Regarding the energy recommendations, the Czech Republic was recommended to take the following steps for 20192020: In the context of the investment economic policy, focus on transport and in particular its sustainability, digital infrastructure and the transition to a low-carbon economy and energy sector transformation, including increasing energy efficiency, taking into account regional disparities. Reduce the administrative burden for investments and promote more competition based on quality  -26-  criteria in public procurement. Remove obstacles to the development of a fully functioning innovative ecosystem. Taking account of the recommendations: The Czech Republic is reducing the energy intensity of the economy in the long-term. It was decreased by almost 18 % in the period 20102018. Significant public funds from subsidy programmes are invested each year to improve energy efficiency across sectors of the economy. In the framework of 9 programmes to support energy savings, approximately CZK 81 billion is allocated in 20142020. In the next programming period 20212027 it is planned to maintain approximately the same allocation rate in subsidy programmes. The availability of public funds under national investment policy does not appear to be a barrier to energy efficiency. The barrier to increasing the intensity of increasing the energy efficiency of the economy is the low motivation to implement energy-saving measures, which stems from a low awareness of the wider benefits of energy-saving measures. In order to remove this barrier, the MIT commissioned a communication strategy design to raise awareness of energy savings across sectors. The strategy aims to design the most appropriate tools and communication channels to raise awareness of the potential for reducing final energy consumption in households, business and public sectors, as well as in transport. Awareness-raising should contribute to unlocking the potential for energy savings and, consequently, to increasing the drawdown of funding from subsidy programmes, thus improving the effectiveness of the state investment policy. 1.4 Regional cooperation in preparing the plan i. Elements subject to joint or coordinated planning with other Member States The National Plan does not contain any parts prepared at regional level. Unfortunately, joint planning was not possible, not even in partial sections or topics, due to the time horizon of the preparation and the fact that this was the first time a National Plan has been prepared. Nevertheless, it is obvious that coordinated planning already takes place in a number of aspects, for example in the area of infrastructure, transmission system operation, etc. However, the Czech Republic would like to initiate a joint preparation of selected sections or topics with neighbouring or other Member States when preparing this document for the next period or for its update. In this respect, there is a possibility of joint preparation in the field of energy security or the internal energy market, but also in other sections or topics. ii. Explanation of how regional cooperation is considered in the plan -regional cooperation. The Czech Republic actively works with other Member States within different multilateral or bilateral platforms on the relevant issues  electricity, gas, research, development and innovation, etc. The Czech Republic does not consider it effective to initiate a specific regional cooperation platform aimed at discussing the National Plan as a whole, also in view of the fact that the regional dimension is different for different issues. For example, in the electricity sector, a different cooperation platform is important for the Czech Republic than, for example, in the gas sector. However, this year, the Czech Republic contacted selected Member States with which it has already set up bilateral or multilateral cooperation and discussed the National Plan with them. For more information, see1.3, specifically iv.
