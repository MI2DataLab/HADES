  213   4.5 Internal energy market dimension 4.5.1 Electricity interconnectivity i. Current interconnection level and main interconnectors The Bulgarian electricity system (EES) operates in parallel with the electricity systems of the countries in continental Europe. Our EES is interconnected with the united European EES through the following interconnectors:  400 kV interconnecting power line from the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant (BG) to Cancarene substation (RO);  400 kV interconnector from Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant (BG) to Cancarene substation (RO);  400 kV interconnecting power line from Varna substation (BG) to Stupina substation (RO);  400 kV interconnecting power line from Dobrudzha substation (BG) to Rahman substation (RO);  400 kV interconnecting power line from Sofia zapad substation (BG) to Nish substation (RS);  400 kV interconnecting power line from Chervena Mogila substation (BG) to   400 kV interconnector from Blagoevgrad substation (BG) to Thessaloniki substation (GR);  400 kV interconnector from TPP Maritsa Iztok 3 (BG) to Hamitabat substation (TR);  400 kV interconnector from TPP Maritsa Iztok 3 (BG) to Hamitabat substation (TR). The current level of electricity interconnection is: - 21.7 % of transmission capacity in imports, taking into account the security criteria; - 22.6 % of transmission capacity in exports, taking into account the security criteria;  - 144 % of rated heat transmission capacity against peak load; - 265 % of total rated heat transmission capacity against the installed renewable generation capacity.   214  ii. Projections of interconnector expansion requirements (including for the year 2030) Interconnectivity development prospects until 2030: Construction of the following new electricity interconnectors is envisaged:  400 kV interconnector from Maritsa Iztok substation (BG) to Nea Santa substation (GR); The new electricity interconnector between Maritsa Iztok and Nea Santa is a project of common interest (PCI). The development of transmission networks and interconnectors of the countries in the South-Eastern part of continental Europe is planned in the regional investment plan and is approved every two years in the ten-year network development plan drawn up by ENTSO--term horizon until 2040.  Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey are implementing a trilateral project to assess the possibilities for construction of a third interconnector between Bulgaria and Turkey. The work has not been completed yet.  4.5.2 Electricity and gas transmission infrastructure i. Key characteristics of the existing transmission infrastructure for electricity and gas transmission operator, which has been certified by the European Commission. The Bulgarian electricity system (ES) operates in parallel with the electricity systems of the European EES via four interconnectors with Romania, two interconnectors with Turkey and one each with Serbia, Macedonia and Greece.  Figure 60: High-voltage (HV) grid map  Source: ESO EAD   215  The existing electricity transmission infrastructure covers: 2 571 km of 400 kV power lines, 400 km of 220 kV power lines, 9 960 km of 110 kV power lines, 34 system substations and 263 reduction substations. Overhead power lines of the national electricity grid  400 kV PLs with a total length of 2 519 km;  220 kV PLs with a total length of 2 812 km;  110 kV PLs with a total length of 9 990 km; Transformer substations  32 system substations with a total transformer capacity of 15 888 MVA;  259 reducing substations with a total transformer capacity of 15 383 MVA; Distribution stations:  one 400 kV distribution station;  one 110 kV distribution station; Optical network:  with a total length of 3 118 km. In accordance with Article 16(8) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of 5 June 2019 on the interconnection capacity to be made available to market participants as a means of solving congestion inside their own bidding zone or as a means of managing flows has been ensured by reaching the minimum threshold of at least 70 % of transmission capacity between gas trading zones thereby guaranteeing compliance with the safety standards for network operation, including the safety standard in emergency situations (N-1). ESO EAD has submitted to the KEVR a reasoned application for a derogation from the requirements laid down in Article 16(8) for a period of one year, with a possibility for extension for another year up to the maximum period of two years, in accordance with Article 16(9) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943. Structure of the gas transmission network:   EAD, which is an independent transmission operator certified by the European Commission. The national gas transmission network has a length of 2 788 km, including an underground storage facility in Chiren, gas mains and high pressure transmission branches, nine compressor stations, gas pressure regulation stations, gas metering stations, an electrochemical protection system, gas purifiers, a communication and information system and other ancillary facilities. The network is used for the transmission of gas for consumption by households Bulgaria and transmission to the neighbouring countries ission capacity is   216  7.4 b;n.m3 per year and the overall natural gas transmission capacity of the three neighbouring countries is 17.8 billion m3 per year. The maximum operating pressure of the network is 54 bar. The national gas transmission network (NGTN) comprises 9 compressor stations (CS)  Kardam 1, CS Valchi Dol, CS Polski Senovets, CS Kardam 2, CS Provadia, CS Lozenets, CS Strandzha, CS Ihtiman and CS Petrich, with total installed capacity of 319 MW. The main entry and exit points of the gas transmission network of the operator are:  Entry/exit interconnection points (IP) Negru Voda 1 / Kardam and Negru Voda 2. 3 / Kardam between the national gas transmission network operated by Bulgartransgas EAD and the gas transmission system operated by Transgaz S.A. (Romania) on the Bulgaria-Romanian border in the Negru Voda/Kardam area;  Entry/exit interconnection point (IP) Kulata / Sidirokastro between the national gas transmission network operated by Bulgartransgas EAD and the gas transmission system operated by DESFA S.A. (Greece) on the Bulgaria-Greek border in the Kulata/Promahonas area;  Entry/exit interconnection point (IP) Strandzha / Malkoclar between the national gas transmission network operated by Bulgartransgas EAD and the gas transmission system operated by Botas (Turkey) on the Bulgarian-Turkish border in the area of Strandzha Village, Bolyarovo Municipality.  Entry/exit interconnection point (IP) Kyustendil / Zidilovo between the national gas transmission network operated by Bulgartransgas EAD and the gas transmission system operated by GA-MA (North Macedonia) on the border between Bulgaria and North Macedonia in the area of Gyueshevo Village, Kyustendil Municipality.  Entry/exit interconnection point (IP) Ruse / Giurgiu between the national gas transmission network operated by Bulgartransgas EAD and the gas transmission system operated by Transgaz S.A. (Romania) on the Bulgaria-Romanian border in the Ruse/Giurgiu area;  GMS Ihtiman and GMS Lozenets  reverse-flow stations measuring natural gas flows, which enable the operator to transfer natural gas to users via different routes;  GMS Galata  entry point for locally produced natural gas into the national gas transmission network;  GMS Dolni Dabnik  entry point for locally produced natural gas into the national gas transmission network;  Entry/exit point Chiren GMS  connection between the national transmission network and Chiren UGS;   217  The Chiren Underground Gas Storage is built in the land of the village of Chiren and is based on the already exhausted gas condensing storage with the same name. It is equipped with the required specialised underground and ground devices to ensure compression, extraction and quality of gas storage. Chiren UGS has 24 drilling wells and a compressor station with a total installed capacity of 10 facility can ensure storage of 550 million m3 of natural gas. The withdrawal and injection capacity is directly dependent on the formation pressure and on the degree to which the storage facility is filled. The minimum extraction capacity is 0.5 million m3/day and the maximum extraction capacity is 3.4 million m3/day. Where necessary, the so-called forced (emergency) extraction can be carried out and the extraction capacity may reach up to 4.2 million m3/day. However, the emergency mode of operation can be implemented provided the gas storage is full and for a period of maximum 30 days. Chiren UGS is used to cover the seasonal fluctuations in consumption in the Republic of Bulgaria. ii. Projections of network expansion requirements at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) Electricity transmission infrastructure: The following new 400 kV internal power lines (PLs) are envisaged to be constructed:  400 kV PL from Plovdiv substation to Maritsa Iztok substation;  400 kV PL from Maritsa Iztok substation to Maritsa Iztok 3 Thermal Power Plant;  400 kV PL from Maritsa Iztok substation to Burgas substation;  400 kV PL from Burgas substation to Varna substation. The new internal power lines mentioned above are projects of common interest (PCI).  Next in order of importance are the new 400 kV power lines in the NorthSouth direction (VetrenBlagoevgrad and TsarevetsPlovdiv). A renovation of a substantial part of the 110 kV network has been planned. Modernisation and expansion of many substations will take place through replacement of equipment and protection relays, telecommunication devices and method of management. Stationary compensating devices will be provided to offset high pressure in minimum modes in the area of Maritsa River basin and Dobrudzha substation. New communication routes will be built.  If a positive decision for the construction of a new nuclear facility is granted, the electricity transmission network in the NorthSouth direction will be developed further and the northern part of the 400 kV ring will be reinforced. Gas transmission infrastructure: The planned activities of the gas transmission operator will ensure the infrastructure required to enable acceptance of gas flows for transfer to and from different regions. The operator will provide the required cross-border capacity that would allow transmission   218  diversity in gas flow directions. The actual use of this capacity and the specific flow directions will depend directly on the outlook for gas market development in Europe and in the country. iii. Indicative projections of development with existing policies for the year 2030 (with an outlook to the year 2040) In accordance with European law, after 2020 transmission capacity must be at least 10 % of the installed generation starting from and at least 15 % of the installed generation after 2030, taking into account the security, the (N-1) criterion and the reliability margin.  In order to achieve this target and diversify the sources and routes for natural gas supply, Bulgaria has launched the implementation of the projects described in section 2.4.4.  4.5.3 Electricity and gas markets, energy prices i. Current situation of electricity and gas markets, including energy prices Electricity With regard to restructuring the activities relating to production, transmission and energy system management, in accordance with Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 2003/54/EC (Directive 2009/72/EC) the the transmission operator and grid assets are allocated to a separate legal entity within a vertically integrated undertaking that performs the functions of production and supply. In line with the requirements of Directive 2009/72/EC, after the procedure for separation of ESO EAD from NEK EAD was completed in 2014, ESO EAD is the owner and operator of the entire electricity transmission network in the Republic of Bulgaria. ESO EAD was certified as an independent transmission operator by a decision of the KEVR adopted in 2015. Thus, compliance was ensured with the requirements laid down in Articles 10 and 11 of Directive 2009/72/EC and Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009.  Electricity distribution is carried out by operators of electricity distribution networks for designated territories: CEZ Razpredelenie Bulgaria AD (CEZ Distribution Bulgaria AD), Elektrorazpredelenie Sever AD (Electricity distribution North AD), Elektrorazpredelenie Yug EAD (Electricity distribution South AED) and Elektrorazpredelenie Zlatni Piasatsi AD (Electricity distribution Zlatni Piasatsi AD).  In accordance with Directive 2009/72/EC and the ZE, the electricity market in Bulgaria was liberalised from 1 July 2007. The liberalisation process is staged and electricity in Bulgaria is traded on two market segments: at freely negotiated prices and at regulated prices.   219  The electricity market in Bulgaria is identified as national. Its structure and organisation are laid down in Rules for Electricity Trading. The electricity market includes an electricity market based on bilateral contracts entered into on the exchange platform, a balancing energy market, a market for reserve and ancillary services and a market for interconnection capacity. Commercial players are electricity producers, traders in electricity, coordinators of balancing groups, final customers, the public electricity provider, end suppliers of electricity, the independent transmission operator, the exchange market operator, the operators of electricity distribution networks, the suppliers of last resort and the traction electric power distribution company.  The electricity exchange is organised by BNEB EAD which holds the licence for that activity. BNEB administers all transactions in the Day Ahead and Intraday segments and in the centralised market for electricity purchases and sales based on bilateral contracts.  Following amendments to the ZE, which entered into force in 2018, the transactions in electricity concluded at freely negotiated prices include the transactions to compensate technological transfer costs, respectively the distribution costs of the electricity grid and electricity distribution network operations. Article 100(4) of the ZE stipulates that the transactions are concluded on an organised electricity exchange. Furthermore, following the legislative amendments adopted in 2018 transactions in electricity between electricity producers with a total installed capacity of 4 MW and above 4 MW are concluded at freely negotiated prices on the organised electricity exchange. This is a step towards increased market liquidity. In 2019, the scope of this obligation was expanded and it now also applies to the electricity plants with total installed capacity of 1 MW and more than 1 MW. Table 53: Wholesale trade in electricity Source: EWRC Report to the European Commission, 2019 According to BNEB data the total physical quantity of electricity imported and traded on the electricity exchange in Bulgaria in 2018 was 2.2 million MWh of which 94 % originated from Romania. Total physical export for the same period stood at 10 million MWh and was distributed as follows: Serbia (23 %), North Macedonia (23 %), Greece (21 %), Turkey (21 %) and Romania (12 %). Most transactions are concluded in the Centralised Bilateral Contracts Market (CBCM) segment. In 2018, the volumes of electricity traded in this segment expanded significantly. The volumes of electricity traded in the Day-ahead segment also increased, Exchange segment Electricity traded in 2017 (MWh) Electricity traded in 2018 (MWh)  Change (%) CBAM 22 711 566 10 788 404 210 % Day-ahead 4 232 922 6 058 743 43 % Intraday  170 773    220  registering an annual increase by 43 %. Trading in the Day-ahead segment was launched in April 2018. In 2018, there were approximately 612 000 non-household clients in the regulated price segment of the electricity market, which represents a small increase from 606 000 in 2017). Their total electricity consumption stood at 13 TWh. Household consumers in the regulated price segment are approximately 4.5 million and their total consumption is approximately 11.1 TWh. Observations in 2017 showed that the balancing energy market was operating soundly and ensured a predictable environment for the commercial players covered.  In 2017, the following were registered with the balancing energy market:  57 coordinators of standard balancing groups, which is double the number in the previous year;   15 coordinators of special balancing groups;  14 coordinators of combined balancing groups. Pursuant to the ZE, every year the KEVR sets a maximum price for execution of transactions on the balancing energy market. For each settlement period, two prices of balancing energy are determined. As from 1 January 2019 the following price caps apply to transactions concluded on the balancing energy market:     1. The price at which transactions can be concluded on the balancing power market in respect of energy shortages balancing services is capped at 2.5 time of the CBCM price, where the CBCM price is equal to the baseload price on the Da-ahead market segment of the Bulgarian Independent Electricity Exchange EAD.    2. The price at which transactions on the balancing power market may be concluded in respect of energy surplus balancing services is BGN 0.00 per MWh;   3. The price caps apply to balancing power transactions, when the energy is purchased/sold from/to neighbouring energy systems under bilateral agreements or from the regional balancing market.  Four operators of electricity distribution networks operate on the retail market. They are licensed to distribute electricity to customers connected to the low- and medium-voltage network in the respective designated territories.  In terms of supply, the retail market comprises three groups of suppliers:  The supplier of last resort (SLR) is a provider that guarantees the provision of a universal service as a last resort, in line with a licence granted by the KEVR, and is obliged to deliver electricity to customers which are connected to the distribution network and have not selected a trader of commercial energy or to deliver electricity to customers where the trader they have selected does not   221  prices of the SLR are determined on the basis of the KEVR Methodology for setting electricity prices of supplier of last resort.  The End Supplier of electricity supplies electricity at regulated prices set by the KEVR to sites of household and non-household final customers connected to the low-voltage electricity distribution network.  Free market supplier is a trader providing electricity to household and non-household customers at prices based on demand and supply. Household and non-household final customers connected to the electricity distribution network at low-voltage level purchase electricity from end suppliers at prices subject to regulation by the KEVR. In 2018, there were approximately 612 000 non-household clients in the regulated price segment of the market, which represents a small increase from 606 000 in 2017). Their total electricity consumption stood at 13 TWh. Household consumers in the regulated price segment are approximately 4.5 million and their total consumption is approximately 11.1 TWh.  Natural gas Bulgartransgas EAD is certified as the independent transmission operator (ITO) of the Bulgarian transmission system. Natural gas is supplied to consumers in Bulgaria mainly via the national gas transmission network, which operates at a maximum pressure of 54 bars. According to the national energy balance data published by the NSI in 2018 natural gas had a share in final energy consumption of 14.7 %, which represents a decrease by approximately 1.5 % as compared to 2017. The Bulgarian market is highly dependent in terms of natural gas supplies, with a share of imports of approximately 99.9 %. In 2018, the operator transported 31.9 TWh of imported and local natural gas and local natural gas, including for final customers in Bulgaria and export to other countries. Out of the total, approximately 31.7 TWh were imported for domestic consumption. In 2018, the quantities of natural gas sold on the domestic market at regulated prices reached 32.1 TWh distributed as follows: Chemical industry (33 %), Energy sector (31 %), Distribution companies (17 %) and Others (19 %).  In order to ensure the security of natural gas supply at prices that are affordable to consumers, Bulgaria established a natural gas exchange, which will create a competitive environment for both traders and consumers of natural gas. The exchange has been fully operational since 9 December 2019. On 2 January 2020, multilateral trade was launched via the trading platform of BALKAN GAS HUB EAD, including the so-called short-term (spot) and long-term segments and trade via gas brokers. This has largely eliminated State monopoly in the sector. The main gas market participants are as follows:   222   Bulgartransgas EAD  combined system operator licensed, operating under a licence for the transmission and storage of natural gas;  Balkan Gas Hub EAD  natural gas exchange operator;  Gas distribution companies  retails of natural gas that distribute and supply natural gas to the clients connected to their networks. By law they have an obligation to build and develop gas distribution networks in accordance with the long-term business plans and other conditions stipulated by the KEVR.  Bulgartransgas EAD  the public supplier of natural gas in Bulgaria responsible for the supplies of natural gas at prices and upon conditions approved by the KEVR;  Traders in natural gas  companies that trade in natural gas, supplying quantities to the public supplier, retailers, customers and other traders in natural gas, manufacturing companies, natural gas storage companies and the combined operator;  Natural gas clients other than households that are not connected to the gas transmission networks;  Non-household and household clients of natural gas, connected to the gas distribution networks. The necessary infrastructure for natural gas distribution is still under construction and the number of household consumers connected to the distribution network is very small. According to the data published by distribution companies, in 2018 the total number of natural gas clients in Bulgaria was 107 669 (93 % household customers and 7 % non-household customers). In 2018, the number of household clients increased by 10 000 compared to 2017 as a result of the implementation of the Demand Side Residential Energy Efficiency Through Gas Distribution Companies in Bulgaria project (DESIREE GAS). The share of domestic supply of natural gas within Bulgaria is still very small compared to other EU Member States, despite the positive trend of increase in recent years. This is due to the fact that the enabling infrastructure for natural gas distribution is currently under construction. The total length of distribution networks at present is 4 916 km, a major part of which has been built in the last twenty years. Taking into account that gas distribution networks are still under construction, they currently operate with load is below their rated capacity. There is one underground gas storage facility (UGS) in Chiren, Bulgaria which is owned and operated by Bulgartransgas EAD. In 2018, a total of 319 million m3 of natural gas were pumped and 324 million m3 of natural gas were extracted from the storage facility.   223  Prices of electricity and natural gas Figure 61: Retail price of electricity per type of consumer  Households Consumption range between 2 500 kW and 5 000 kW (DC) Non-household consumers Consumption range between 500 MW and 2 000 MW (IC) Source: Eurostat, electricity prices (excl. taxes and charges) The final prices16 paid by household consumers have continually followed an upward trend. The latest available data shows that during the first half of 2019 prices stood at EUR 0.083 kWh. The price of electricity for household consumers has increased by 5 % as compared to 2015. From 2015 until the first half of 2019 the price for non-household clients (S1) was in the range between EUR 0.073 and EUR 0.089 kWh. Figure 62: Retail price of natural by type of consumer, GJ  Households Consumption range between 20 MW and 200 GJ (D2) Non-household consumers Prices, excl. taxes and charges  Consumption range between 10 000 MWh and 100 000 MWh (I3)  Prices, excl. taxes and charges Source: Eurostat, prices of natural gas (excl. taxes and charges)                                             16According to the ZE the final price includes the price of electricity, the prices for access to and transmission via the electricity grid and distribution networks and the public service obligation costs.   224  Following a drop in 2016, the prices of natural gas for household and non-household consumers in the period between 2017 and the first half of 2019 decreased to nearly 2015 levels.  ii. Projections of development with existing policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) In accordance with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 two scenarios  WAM (with additional policy measures) and WEM (with existing policy measures)  have been developed. The projections set out in this section are solely based on existing national and EU policy measures. Under the WEM scenario the targets set in this Plan will not be achieved. The scenario has been developed as a basis for comparison to the WAM scenario (in which the national targets will be achieved). The WA< scenario is described in detail in points 2 and 3 and in Annex I to this Plan.  Figure 63: Net installed capacity, WEM scenario  Wind (on-shore) Hydro Solar plants Combustion plants Nuclear energy Total Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling  According to WEM scenario projections the net installed capacity of power plants generating electricity from renewable sources (mostly wind and solar power) will increase by 12 % up to 59 %, reaching 13.9 GW (2030 as compared to 2020) and compensating the decrease in installed capacity of conventional combustion plants by 16 %.  The net installed capacity will increase by 26 % [to] 15.6 GW by 2040 (as compared to 2020). In order to overcome the drop in solid fuel production, the share of nuclear and wind power after 2030 will increase significantly.   225   Figure 64: Net electricity generation by plant type, WEM  Wind (on-shore) Hydro Solar plants Combustion plants Nuclear energy Total Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling  Under the WEM scenario total electricity production is projected to reach 47.7 TWh in 2030 as compared to 43.9 TWh in 2020. Most of the increase attributable to electricity generation from renewable sources (52 % in 2030 as compared to 2020) will offset the downward trend in electricity generation from solid fuels, which becomes particularly prominent after 2025. The share of nuclear power is projected to remain stable over the period under consideration. The new nuclear power and wind farm capacity will have a higher contribution to net electricity generation. The most prominent trend during the period 2030-2040 is the increase in the share of nuclear power, which is projected to reach 45 % and 60 % in 2035 and 2040, respectively, in total net electricity generation. In contrast to this trend, in 2020 the share of electricity generated by combustion plants will decrease by 50 % in 2020, reaching 15 % [of total net electricity generation] in 2040.    226  Figure 65: Domestic consumption of electricity by sector, WEM scenario  Transport Industry Energy sector and other applications Households Sectoral services Total Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling During the period 2020-2030 domestic consumption of electricity will increase by 12 %, reaching 35.6 TWh. Consumption in the residential and industrial sectors will see similar increases and the two sectors will continue to have a share of two-thirds of total consumption. By 2030, electricity consumption will double to approximately 955 GWh. In 2040, electricity consumption is projected to reach 38.5 TWh, which represents an increase by 8 % as compared to 2030. Consumption in the household sector is expected to register the highest increase to approximately 1.4 TWh while electricity consumption in transport will double to approximately 1.81.9 TWh.  Figure 66 Projected average prices of electricity before tax, WEM scenario  Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling   227  During the period 2020-2030 the average price of electricity before tax is expected to vary within the range from EUR 81 MWh to EUR 95 MWh, reaching EUR 106 MWh in 2040. Figure 67: Projected prices of natural gas, WEM scenario  Energy production Industry Other Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling  A gradual increase of natural gas prices until 2040 has been projected
