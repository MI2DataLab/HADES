2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 25    2.1 Dimension Decarbonisation   GHG emissions and removals Lithuania is implementing GHG emission reductions on the basis of the National Strategy for the Climate Change Management Policy (he-term (until 2030), indicative medium-term (until 2040) and long-term (until 2050) targets and objectives for climate change mitigation.  Lithuania signed and ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016. Under the Agreement, Lithuania, together with the EU and its Member States, has made a binding commitment to reduce GHG emissions from all sectors of economy by at least 40% by 2030,   In sectors covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), in which Lithuanian operators participate together with operators from other EU Member States participating in the EU ETS, emissions must be reduced by 43% compared to the 2005 levels.  Non-ETS sectors (transport, agriculture, waste management, industrial enterprises engaged in other activities or fuel burning installations with boilers with installed capacity below 20 MW (small district heating enterprises), public sector buildings, households, fisheries, construction, services and other sectors) will have to comply with Lithuania's annual emission reduction limits (t CO2 eq.) and achieve at least a 9% reduction in 2030 compared to 2005.  is to ensure sustainable development and to make sure that the national economy grows fast and GHG emissions decrease; and, together with the EU and its Member States, to pursue the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement on temperature stabilisation through socially equitable, competitive, innovative technology-based and cost-effective restructuring of all sectors of the economy, with a view to neutralising the impact of GHG by 2050. The assessment criterion to be applied in the monitoring of this strategic target is the quantity of GHG emissions per GDP unit (t CO2 eq/EUR 1 million GDP).  Implementation of the strategic objective of climate change mitigation will aim:   To contribute to the EU's short-term climate change mitigation targets by 2030: to reduce GHG emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 through an internal EU effort.; to reduce GHG emissions in sectors covered by the EU ETS by 43% and in sectors not covered by the EU ETS by at least by 30% compared to 2005;   To ensure implementation of Lithuania's short-term climate change mitigation targets by 2030: together with operators from other EU Member States, to reduce GHG emissions in sectors covered by the EU ETS by 43% compared to 2005 and to reduce GHG emissions in sectors outside the EU ETS by 9% compared to 2005; to ensure that at least 0.9% of the country's GDP is allocated to the implementation of short-term climate change mitigation targets in 2030 and that the share of the population contributing to environmental protection is at least 50% in 2030;   To ensure the implementation of Lithuania's main indicative medium-term and long-term climate change mitigation targets: in the medium term, to reduce GHG emissions by 70 per cent compared 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 26   to 1990, and in the long term, to reduce GHG emissions by 80 per cent compared to 1990 and to cover 20 per cent with sinks from LULUCF.  GHG emissions in sectors outside the EU ETS are to be reduced by 9%. In the waste sector, at least a 40% GHG emission reduction compared to 2005 is to be achieved through reduction and efficient waste management. In the sector of non-centralised energy production (small combustion plants) and use (households, services, etc.), a reduction of at least 15% in GHG emissions compared to 2005 is expected. For other sectors, a uniform GHG reduction target of 9% has been set. Transport and industry will be the most challenging sectors, as they need to cut their GHG emissions by more than a third (see Table 2.1.1.1).   Table 2.1.1.1. Relative GHG emission reduction targets for individual non-ETS sectors in 20212030, %   Non-ETS sector Average annual change (from the 2016-2018 average until 2030), % Target compared to 2005, % Transport -3.6 -9.0 Agriculture -1.3 -9.0 Industry (including industrial combustion) -3.9 -9.0 Waste management -0.9 -40.0 Sectors of non-centralised energy production (small combustion plants) and use (households, services, etc.)  -0.9  -15.0 Total non-ETS sectors -2.3 -9.0  Meanwhile, the land use, land use change and forestry sectors (LULUCF) have been included in the EU's reduction targets for the period 20212030 as a flexibility instrument. Lithuania will be able to offset 6.5 million tonnes of CO2 eq to meet the GHG emission reduction target for sectors not participating in the EU ETS through the LULUCF Flexibility Instrument for the period 20212030 if GHG removals in the LULUCF sector is higher than the emissions from the said sector. In the case of GHG emissions from the LULUCF sector, they will have to be covered by annual GHG allowances of non-ETS sectors.  Given the importance of climate change management and in order to maintain a leading position at international level in the fight against climate change, the EU aims to neutralise the effects of GHG emissions by 2050.  The policy vision for climate change management foresees that by 2050 Lithuania will have achieved climate neutrality of its national economy, ensured the resilience of the sectors and ecosystems of the national economy to the environmental changes brought about by climate change and developed a competitive, socially just low-carbon economy through sustainable financing and investment, created new green jobs, introduced eco-innovation technologies, achieved an increase in the efficiency of energy generation and consumption as well as the use of renewable energy sources in all sectors of the national economy (energy, industry, transport, agriculture etc.).   Short-term (until 2030), indicative medium-term (until 2040) and long-term (until 2050) targets and objectives for climate change adaptation are set out in the NCCPs. The strategic objective of the Lithuanian policy for the adaptation to environmental changes caused by climate change is to reduce the existing and 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 27   adapt through the introduction of measures, cost-effective reduction of risks and damage, the preservation and improvement of resilience to climate change, in order to ensure the creation of favourable conditions for the sustainable development of public life and economic activities.  Implementation of the strategic objective of climate change will aim to:   provide all residents living in flood risk areas with flood protection equipment in 2030;   to keep the share of climate-related economic losses per year within 0.08% of the national GDP;   to make sure that by 2030 the share of foreseen dangerous, natural and catastrophic meteorological phenomena in the total number of actual phenomena would be at least 89%.  The strategic objective of climate change adaptation will be implemented through measures in climate sensitive sectors (agriculture, energy, transport, industry, forestry, ecosystems and biodiversity, landscape, public health, water resources and coastal area, urbanised areas, etc.). These measures are described in more detail in Section 3.1.1. .  Renewable energy  Lithuania's commitment to achieve 23% of RES in final energy consumption in the EU by 2020 was met as early as 2014. Lithuania is implementing the development of RES on the basis of the NEIS, which sets long-term energy targets. The strategy sets targets for the share of RES in gross final consumption of energy and in the heat, transport and electricity sectors by 2050 (Table 2.1.2.1). It should be noted that achieving the 2030 targets requires full implementation of the planned policy measures as described in Sections 3.1.2. and 5.1. 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 28    Table 2.1.2.1: RES share in gross final consumption of energy and in relevant sectors  2017 2018 202022 202023 2022 2025 2027 2030 2050 RES share in gross final energy consumption,%  26.04  24.2124    30  32.70  36.45  39.75  45  80 RES-E share in final energy consumption in electricity sector, %  18.25  18.41  21.29  30  25.55  31.48  36.70  45  100 RES-T share in final energy consumption in transport sector25  4.29  4.33  4.33  10  6.69  9.23  11.46  15  50 RES share in heat and cooling sectors26 46.50 47.30 50.9  53.9 63.1 66.9 67.2  Of which RES share in DH 68.7 67.5 71.7 70 78.8 89.3 91.3 90 100 A reference point  of the total increase in the share of energy from renewable sources between the respective Member State's binding 2020 national target,  and its contribution to the 2030 target, %                    18    43    65          Given that from 2015 there was no RES-E development due to the achievement of the targets set by Lithuania in 2020 and it was only renewed in 2019 by holding the first technologically neutral auction, the 30% target set by the NEIS will not be achieved in 2020; therefore, in setting Lithuania's obligations, the RES-E is specified taking into account the electricity generation volume for 2020, forecast in the light of the current situation. The integration of renewable energy sources into the transport sector is inefficient and too slow, and a Law on Alternative Fuels currently being drafted and the transposition of Directive 2018/2001 are expected to speed up the process. From a historical perspective, the increase in the share of RES in gross final consumption of energy will be mainly influenced by the growth of RES in the heating and cooling sector, which makes the largest contribution to gross energy consumption (Table 2.1.2.2).                                                            22 Expected achievement. 23 NEIS target 24 Taking into account statistical transfer to Luxembourg 25The RES-T objectives are pursued by reference to the energy content of transport fuels, without applying the multipliers laid down in Directive 2018/2001. 26 As the NEIS does not establish an overall objective for RES in the heating and cooling sectors, a projected value following the implementation of all planned policy measures is specified here. 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 29    Table 2.1.2.2. RES contribution of each sector to final energy consumption, 2018, ktoe and %  ktoe % Gross final RES consumption in the heat and cooling sector  1166.9  80.8 Gross final RES consumption 197.6 13.7 Gross final RES consumption in transport sector  79.8  5.5 Total consumption of RES 1444.4 100  The share of RES in gross final consumption of energy is to be achieved by increasing the share of RES in the electricity, transport and heating/cooling sectors.   Electricity sector As of 2015, following the allocation of the full promotion quota provided for in the Law on Energy from Renewable Sources for the period until 2020, support to RES-E was suspended, resulting in a slight slowdown in the development of RES-E. In 2018, the share of RES-E in final energy consumption was 18.41%, and new promotional auctions to promote the development of RES-E were launched at the end of 2019, and therefore their outcome is likely to be visible only in 2023, when the winners of the auction will build the power plants and start generating electricity. The main measures used in Lithuania to promote the development of RES-E by 2020 are financial incentives for prosumers, which will have a negligible impact on the development of RES-E, and it is therefore likely that the 30 % target set by the NEIS will not be achieved in 2020. The objective set for 2030 is to increase the share of RES-E in gross final electricity consumption to 45%. Wind energy is expected to remain the main resource for electricity generation, accounting for at least 70%, while solar energy will account for 3%, biofuels 9%, hydropower 8% and biogas 2% (Table 2.1.2.3).

The share of RES-E will be pursued by maintaining existing generating capacities, modernising them and installing new ones (Figure 2.1.2.4). Lithuania has been developing RES since the construction of the first hydro and wind power plants in 2002. Given that hydropower plants have a useful life of between 30 and 50 years, it is estimated that they will not require modernisation in the 20202030 period. Also, taking into account the fact that the development of hydroelectric power plants in Lithuania is limited by environmental legislation, it is estimated that the development of these plants will not take place in the period 2020-2030. Wind power plants have a useful life of around 20 years and 40 plants with a total installed capacity of 163.71 MW   should be upgraded in order to maintain the existing capacity until 2020. The increase in wind power plant capacities could start in 2023 if wind power plants win the auction launched in September 2019. The total installed capacity of new wind power plants is estimated to increase to 1,322 MW  between 2020 and 2030. In 2003, the first biogas plants started operating, with a useful life of 15 to 20 years. In this context, 14 biogas plants with a total installed capacity of 14,886 MW   should be modernised in order to maintain their existing capacities. Given that biogas use is expected to be transport-oriented, it is estimated that the development of these power plants in the electricity sector will not be carried out in the 2020-2030 period. In 2007, the construction of the first biomass power plants, having a useful life of around 15 years, began. In this context, 9 biomass plants with a total installed capacity of 73.46 MW   should be modernised in order to maintain their existing capacity. An increase in the capacity of new biomass power plants is expected in 2021 once the biomass power plant currently under construction is launched. The expansion of solar power plants started in 2011 and it is estimated that they will not require modernisation in the 20202030 period given their useful life of around 20 years. Active energy consumers will be the main contributors to the development of new solar power plants. The installed capacity of solar power plants is expected to increase to 117 MW   between 2020 and 2030.  2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 31    Table 2.1.2.4.

The NEIS has ambitious targets for the development of active electricity consumers:  2% compared to the total number of consumers by 2020;  30% compared to the total number of consumers by 2030.  Transport sector The transport sector is aiming at a gradual shift towards cleaner fuels and electricity, and therefore, in line with the EU's commitments, the aim is to achieve a 10 per cent RES share by 2020 and a 15 percent RES share by 2030 (Table 2.1.2.5). However, Lithuania, like other Member States, is struggling to achieve the RES-T target for 2020 due to relatively high investment in the renewal of the vehicle fleet, which consists mainly of almost 1.5 million cars, 69% of which are diesel cars, with an average age of 15 years.29 For this reason, it is likely that the 2020 target will not be achieved by 2020 and the share of RES-T will be around 5 per cent.  More active steps are now being taken to promote the growth of the share of RES-E, with higher mandatory blending rates coming into force on 1 January 2020, and the drafting of the Alternative Fuels Law, which will set out the guiding principles for promoting the use of alternative fuels and less polluting vehicles. The focus will be on the use of advanced liquid and gaseous biofuels of generation II and the electrification of the vehicle fleet and the rail system. The said Law also seeks to establish a clear long-term perspective for market participants in the transport sector and to provide alternatives for the transitional period.                                                              28 The outcomes of the PPM modelling scenario are presented, assuming the implementation of all planned policy measures 29  2.

In line with good practices in EU countries, Lithuania needs to promote transition to the fourth generation (4G) district heating by integrating solar power plants into the district heating networks and promoting the use of surplus and waste heat for heating buildings.  In Lithuania, the district heating system is an integral part of the overall energy sector, closely linked to the electricity system, fuel supply and other systems in terms of technological and energy flows. All Lithuanian cities have well-developed district heating systems, which supply heat to about 53% of all buildings in the country and 76% in the cities.31 The main consumers of district heating services are residents living in multi-apartment buildings.  The total installed capacity of heat generating installations in the district heating systems is 9,582 MW. Lithuania will aim at a 90% share of district heating from renewable and local energy sources in total district heating by 2030. Private households are projected to consume 647 ktoe of fuel in 2020 and 643 ktoe in 2030 for heating purposes.  The efficiency of heat and hot water production technologies in the decentralised sector is relatively low and there is considerable potential for energy savings. Conversion of primary energy sources is also possible in this sector, which can significantly improve access to heating for residents and encourage more efficient use of renewable energy sources, some of which could be used in other sectors.  The combined share of RES in the heating and cooling sector will reach around 50% by 2020, with heat produced from local biofuels accounting for the largest share. Additional policy measures (such as the deployment of solar and heat pumps, low temperature heating, use of waste heat) are expected to reduce the demand for all fuels as energy efficiency increases and centralisation of decentralised heat generation continues. Due to the specificity of the building stockpile, the energy demand of the cooling sector in Lithuania is negligible. As the share of new buildings with cooling systems in the national building stockpile                                                            30 Outcomes of the PPM modelling scenario under the assumption that all planned policy measures will be implemented 31 https://lsta.lt/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LSTA_apzvalga_2018.pdf 2.

New technologies (heat pumps, modern biofuel boilers, etc.) and renovation of multi-apartment buildings will have a major impact. If the planned additional measures are implemented, a higher share of RES in heating and cooling than currently foreseen may also be achieved. It should be noted that the achievement of the 2030 targets requires full implementation of the planned policy measure, as described in sections  3.1.2. and 5.1.   According to Directive 2018/2001/EU33 of 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (RED II), Lithuania has assessed the necessity to build new infrastructure for district heating and cooling produced from renewable energy sources in order to achieve the national target. In accordance with the above Directive, in order to promote the use of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector, each Member State should endeavour to increase the share of renewable energy in that sector by an indicative 1.3 percentage points as an annual average calculated for the periods 2021 to 2025 and 2026 to 2030, starting from the share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector in 2020, expressed in terms of national share of final energy consumption and calculated in accordance with the methodology set                                                            32 Outcomes of the PPM modelling scenario under the assumption that all planned policy measures will be implemented 33 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/LT/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32018L2001&from=EN#d1e2914-82-1 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 34   out in Article 7, without prejudice to Article 23(2) of the Directive. That increase should be limited to an indicative 1.1 percentage points for Member States where waste heat and cooling are not used. Member States should, where appropriate, give priority to the best available techniques. When calculating its share of energy from renewable sources in the heating and cooling sector and its annual average increase in accordance with that share, each Member State:  may include waste heat and cooling up to a maximum of 40% of the average annual increase;  where its share of energy from renewable sources in heating and cooling is higher than 60%, may count any such share as fulfilling the average annual increase;  here its share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector is above 50% and up to 60%, may count any such share as fulfilling half of the average annual increase. The centralised cooling energy supply network is not developed in Lithuania. Residential and commercial premises are cooled on an individual basis for the production of cooling energy using electricity. The preliminary annual cooling energy demand in Lithuania is estimated at 5 to 6 TWh. The demand was established on the assumption that the cooling demand in Lithuania is ~60 kWh/m3 per year, taking climatic conditions into account, but in order to develop this sector it is necessary to consider that this would only be useful if only buildings already equipped with a centralised (common mechanical) ventilation system, i.e. offices, shopping centres and new high-energy multi-apartment buildings, were connected to the network, as investments in old multi-apartment buildings would be unreasonably high in order to benefit from centralised cooling energy supply. In that case, the annual cooling energy demand would be reduced to 2-3 TWh.  Priority axes for improving regulatory market conditions in the heating sector for the period 20212030:   The establishment of a regulatory environment conducive to attracting investment and providing a non-discriminatory environment for all actors in the district heating market;   Increasing transparency in the biofuels market;   Promoting the supply of heat produced by district heating, in buildings and giving priority to urbanised areas in order to reduce air pollution;   Assessment of the current situation and the prospective evolution of heat supply in the decentralised sector, with rational development trends, taking into account changes in heat production technologies that increase the efficiency of heat production and consumption;   Assessment of the current situation in the cooling energy sector, performance of a prospective analysis and setting guidelines for the most rational solutions for cooling energy provision.  Technical tasks for solution implementation:   Feasibility assessment and, where economically justified, introduction of waste heat collection and use technologies, technologies using solar and heat energy, heat pumps, low-temperature heating and heat storage facilities for district heating;   Introduction of a remote metering system for district heating;  2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 35    Rational development of high-efficiency cogeneration plants to increase the availability of local electricity generation;   Timely upgrading (when replacement or building of new ones is no longer justified economically and/or due to environmental aspects) of: a. existing biofuel combustion plants or, where economically justified, cogeneration installations, with a view to maintaining the balance of renewable energy sources; b. existing heat transmission installations and their systems in order to reduce heat losses and to allow optimal development of the heat transmission network; c. heating facilities in buildings and/or heating and hot water systems, providing technical conditions, where economically justified, for individual regulation of heat consumption by each consumer.  The market for biofuels The Lithuanian heat sector is becoming increasingly dependent on factors forming the Lithuanian biofuel market as it moves towards renewable energy. The Lithuanian Law on the Energy Resources Market stipulates that heat suppliers, participants in the heat auction and joint heat and power producers using biofuels to produce electricity and/or heat must give preference to the energy resources exchange by purchasing all the quantities of biofuels needed to produce electricity and/or heat.  In the second quarter of 2019, the Lithuanian biofuel market had 46 DH enterprises, 18 independent heat producers (IHP) and 98 biofuel suppliers. The biofuel exchange Baltpool had 420 participants, including 41 DH companies and 34 IHPs. Concentration of the Lithuanian biofuel market, according to the Herfindal-Hirschman Index (HHI) in terms of the volume of biofuel sold by biofuel suppliers, is low. The concentration level in the biofuel market since 2015 Q2 did not exceed 1,000 under the HHI (the market is considered to be competitive with an HHI below 1,500).  The State authorities supervising competition and formulating competition policy in the energy sector must strive to keep the level of concentration in the Lithuanian biofuel market to a minimum, which means that it is important for the State that, in the national biofuels market:   the concentration level under the HHI remains below 1,000;   the biofuel supplier with the largest market share and its affiliated undertakings do not hold more than 20% of the total biofuel market share and three-fourths of the biofuel market consist of products of at least 15 unrelated suppliers;   the balance between domestic production of biofuels and imports of biofuels from third countries is sustainable and optimal, allowing a high level of competition and low market concentration to be maintained in the long term;   promote the use of biofuels produced and supplied in an ecological and sustainable manner (certificates confirming best forest management practices to ensure product quality and sustainability throughout the biofuel production and supply chain).  Currently, indigenous biofuels are used, which are purchased by DH companies via the biofuel exchange 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 36   Baltpool.34 Depending on the price situation in the market, price increases create an incentive to import biofuels from third countries where they are cheaper, such as Belarus.

The Ministry of the Environment also noted that imports of biofuel products (granules, chips, sawdust) increased by an average of 50 tonnes each year (mainly from Belarus), but that these products were not used exclusively for energy purposes (production of panels, etc.). If imports of wood fuel fall drastically and all quantities have to come from local sources, there may be a need to increase the volumes of felling, but the principle that the amount of timber harvested must not exceed the annual increment and must be in line with the principles of sustainable forest management will in any case be observed. It was also noted that an increase in the demand for wood for energy purposes would not change the ratio of wood used in industry to energy. As regards the impact of the use of biomass from forests on the GHG absorption of LULUCF, it should be noted that the LULUCF Regulation (EU) 2018/841 does not restrict a country's need and potential for using wood for the production of biofuels. The ratio between wood used for the production of products and wood used for energy purposes is fixed only for the purpose of calculating the reference level (forecasting future production of harvested wood products). If, in the future, due to the demand for biofuels, greater volumes of domestic wood harvests are used for energy production in one way or another and less wood is used for the production of products, this will have an impact on the reduction in GHG removals in the category of wood harvested. It is noted that the supply of biomass from logging waste for energy purposes will have no impact on GHG absorption in the LULUCF sector since felling residues are not accounted for separately again; the total volume felled is included in the calculation of the volume change and the calculation GHG absorption/emissions due to respective volume change. In the light of the above, it can be concluded that no significant impact on the LULUCF sector is foreseen.
