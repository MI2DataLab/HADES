4.4. Energy supply security  Supply security therefore has a geopolitical dimension in terms of continuity of supply from exporter countries: we depend on the countries that have resources, and if a political crisis leads a country to supply in jeopardy.   235       En %  In %  Électricité  Electricity  Gaz  Gas  Toutes énergies confondues  All energies combined  Énergies renouvelables  Renewable energy  Charbon  Coal  Produits pétroliers  Oil products  requirements: procurement from abroad can be secure, if it uses reliable, diversified suppliers, i.e. originating in more than one country. Exclusively domestic supply can also present vulnerabilities if technical or industrial problems arise. The fall in consumption and the increase in the generation of renewable energies contribute to reducing dependence on other countries.  The changes in the stock of production installations will have impacts on supply security that must be anticipated.    4.4.1. Oil  4.4.1.1. Crude oil production in France  National production of hydrocarbons amounted to 0.8 Mt in 2018 and only represents about 1% of national consumption. The law putting an end to the exploration and exploitation of conventional and non-conventional hydrocarbons65 will lead to a gradual halt in domestic production by 2040. In 2023 and 2028, production is estimated to be 0.7 Mt and 0.6 Mt, respectively.  In a context where domestic hydrocarbon extraction covers only a very small portion of national requirements, France is almost totally dependent on oil imports for domestic consumption. To improve  65 . Law No 2017-1839 of 30 December 2017 putting an end to the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons and enacting several provisions relating to energy and the environment, available at https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.docidTexte=JORFTEXT000036339396&dateTexte=&categorieLien =id                              236    the security of its oil supply lines, France is diversifying the regions from which it imports crude oil. In 2018, these imports came from the Middle East (25%), Russia (14%) and Kazakhstan (15.5%), Africa (33.1%) and Norway (5.6%).    4.4.1.2. Refining  In France, the refining sector was marked by the closure of several facilities in the early 2010s. France now has only seven oil refineries on its mainland. They have an annual refining capacity of about 62 Mt of crude oil per year. They are supplied mainly by shipping or by pipelines. Apart from the production of fuels, refining enables the production of non-energy products such as lubricants and bitumen. Refining is also of particular importance for supplying the petrochemical industry.  French refineries mainly produce diesel (35% of total production in 2018), super-fuels (20%), heavy fuel oil (10%) and non-energy products (15%). Domestic fuel and kerosene each represent 8% of the total domestic production of refined products, LPG 3% and all other products 2%. This distribution has been stable in recent years.  Refineries must continually adapt to meet demand while improving environmental performance and energy efficiency in their industry.  Refining contributes to employment in France in the energy sector: its activities represent more than 7,000 direct jobs, plus about 30,000 indirect jobs.  In addition, the French Government is mindful not only about limiting the consumption of fossil energy but also in terms of importing fossil fuels with the least environmental impact.    Article 8 of the Hydrocarbons Law provides that the Government must provide Parliament with a report on the origin of imported hydrocarbons consumed in France. This report must study the environmental impact of extracting and refining conventional and non-conventional hydrocarbons, and in particular it must:   classify the environmental footprints arising from the extraction and refining of oil;   identify the variability criteria of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the extraction and refining of oil;   assess the feasibility of differentiating oil products according to the origin of the crude oil from which they were made;   propose areas of progress for the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions arising from oil extraction, and for the traceability of physical flows of hydrocarbons.  4.4.1.3. Local issues: intermediate stocks and service stations  Today, hydrocarbons account for nearly 90% of energy consumption in the transport sector. Consumption projections for petroleum products foresee a decrease of almost 25% in 2028 compared to current consumption levels. Ongoing vigilance is needed to enable the adaptation of petroleum logistics in order to guarantee supply security: lower consumption will make it difficult to maintain the entire network of secondary depots necessary for quality supply.   Only the most profitable depots will be able to remain active, thus leading to a concentration of activity in these depots. There are 200 main depots today, and there is a risk of a sharp decrease if there is a fall  237    in consumption. The launch of studies to obtain a future vision of the necessary network for oil storage and the minimum number required forms part of supply security activities.   It is necessary to maintain a sufficient geographical network for the following reasons.   To guarantee the availability of supplies. The excessive concentration of storage premises entails risks of shortages for consumers if one of these sites is inaccessible and the others cannot support the activity of the missing site, or if extended travel time no longer makes it possible to guarantee an adequate supply.   To ensure proximity between storage and consumption sites in order to avoid an increase in the number of tankers on the roads for the distribution of fuels.  In addition, the rules on risk prevention make it difficult to create new storage capacity in the most competitive depots. Storage capacity lost in closed depots cannot easily be redeployed elsewhere.  This subject therefore requires special attention.  The number of French petrol stations fell by nearly 75% between 1980 and 2017. Nevertheless, France still has a number of petrol stations providing an efficient service within its territory. Fuel sales are increasingly concentrated in high-throughput stations, in particular those owned by large and mediumsized supermarkets. The geographical distribution of the stations in the country is satisfactory for most citizens:   90% of households can get to a petrol station within 20 minutes and 16 km;   50% within 6 minutes and 3 km;   on average, a household takes 9 minutes and 20 seconds to access a station;   fewer than 2.5% of households are more than 30 km away from a petrol station.  The average time to get to a petrol station by department is used as an indicator to monitor changes in the network, and 90% of individuals can get to a petrol station in under 25 minutes. In 2018, fewer than 4.3% of households had a journey of more than 25 minutes.       Figure 67: Home-petrol station journey time (IRS network),     source: DGEC   238       Minutes  Minutes    4.4.2. Gas  4.4.2.1. State of play and outlook for national natural gas  France has few conventional natural gas resources across its territory. The commercial operation of the Lacq field  the main French natural gas field  is currently limited, and since 2013, its output is no longer injected into the grid but is instead directly consumed on site. Law No 2017-1839 of 30 December 2017 also provides for the gradual cessation of exploration and exploitation of new resources.  4.4.2.2. Natural gas supply  In the absence of significant domestic production, the supply of natural gas is based on imports. Two types of natural gas are distributed in France through separate networks, namely gas with a high calorific value or H gas, for 90% of consumption, and gas with a low calorific value or L gas. To ensure a high level of supply security for H gas, France is equipped with an infrastructure consisting of five interconnectors for imports and four LNG terminals. This infrastructure provides access to diversified sources of natural gas.  in 2018). The remaining imports are broadly diversified among various suppliers: Russia (22% of H gas imports in 2018), Algeria (8%), Nigeria (7%) and Qatar (3%). Interconnectors and LNG terminals also provide access to other smaller suppliers, as well as to gas that is more difficult to trace, from international gas markets, in gaseous or liquefied form.    Figure 68: Origin of French natural gas imports of high calorific value since 1990 (Source: SOeS and GRTgaz)   239       Importations de gaz H (TWh)  H Gas imports (TWh)  Norvège  Norway  Russie  Russia  Algérie  Algeria  Nigéria (y compris swaps)  Nigeria (including swaps)  Qatar  Qatar  Pays-Bas  Netherlands  Autres pays ou origine indéterminée  Other countries or unknown origin    concentrated between Norway and Russia, with these two countries now accounting for nearly 70% of imports, compared to around 50% at the start of the decade. This trend is also noticeable in terms of infrastructure: more than 80% of natural gas imports currently pass through three interconnectors located in the north-east of France.  French natural gas imports in the future will be marked by the decline of European gas production, which will be offset by an increase in gas pipeline imports from non-European countries, and in liquefied form (LNG). Indeed, Norway is expected to reach a production plateau between 2020 and 2030. The decline in European production, particularly in the Netherlands, is expected to accelerate. This fall in the share of European producers could be offset by an increase in imports of Russian gas or LNG, depending in particular on the relative competitiveness of these two types of supply. The French gas infrastructure seems able to cope with either of these two prospective scenarios.  Gas operators obtain natural gas over-the-counter from a producer through medium- and long-term contracts, or through purchases on marketplaces. Long-term contracts  generally 15 to 25 years  mean that buyers can secure their supplies and producers can secure outlets, through take or pay clauses, over a period defined so as to amortise investments in exploration, development of gas fields, production and transportation.  -term contracts for delivery on the national grid. A significant proportion of these contracts will expire over the period of in the French market are able and wish to renew their existing long-term contracts and to enter into new ones. The increasing interest of suppliers in flexible purchases on the marketplaces and their preference for gas deliveries to the borders of the European Union, so that they can more easily take advantage of  240    price opportunities within the European internal market, could lead to a fall in the proportion of supplies covered by long-term contracts providing for delivery to the French grid.  Box 6: Environmental impact of imported natural gas  To be eligible for injection into the French grid, natural gas must meet certain standards, particularly in terms of composition. These are applicable to all gas sources. The natural gas consumed in France therefore emits a similar amount of greenhouse gases during combustion, regardless of its origin and extraction method.  However, the environmental impact associated with natural gas consumption is not limited to its combustion. Production and transport to France must also be considered.  Natural gas production has environmental impacts in terms of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions that vary depending on the fields. These variations depend in particular on the production methods used, the quality of the gas extracted and the climatic conditions. This issue of environmental impacts associated with natural gas production is a particular focus of discussion for non-conventional production in the United States, where strong growth is creating opportunities for exports to Europe in the form of LNG.  The transport of natural gas must also be taken into account. For LNG transport, liquefaction and regasification operations use energy and therefore have a significant impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. Natural gas transportation by pipeline also requires energy to operate the compressors that mobilise the gas. Methane can also leak during transportation  a particular problem for the transport of natural gas in the Russian transmission system.  In accordance with the provisions of the article of Law No 2017-1839 putting an end to the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons, a report will be produced to evaluate the environmental impact of natural gas supplied for consumption in France, based in particular on its origin, the type of resource, and its extraction and transportation conditions.    Tools for ensuring the security of natural gas supply can be classified into three broad categories:   obligations for gas operators, especially suppliers;   tools for sizing the gas system, from a forward-looking perspective;   safeguarding measures for gas crises.    4.4.2.3. Obligations on gas operators  Continuity of supply obligations  Natural gas suppliers are required to provide continuity of supply for all their customers, with the exception of customers with an interruptible contract, at the level corresponding to the supply security target.  In addition, natural gas suppliers are under an obligation to ensure continuity of supply to these same consumers, including in the event of disappearance of the main source of supply for a maximum of six months under average weather conditions. The supply of gas on the French market is subject to ministerial authorisation. Proof enabling confirmation of compliance with the continuity of supply obligations may be requested when the supply authorisation is updated each year.    Diversification obligations   241    Beyond a certain market share, a natural gas supplier is required to diversify the entry points of its supply into national territory. The terms of this obligation are laid down in Article R. 121-1 of the Energy Code. So as not to penalise new entrants, this measure does not apply below a 5% market share.    Obligations for the continuity of delivery  Operators of natural gas transmission and distribution systems must size their infrastructures so that natural gas can be delivered at the level corresponding to the supply security target.  Infrastructure operators are also required, with regard to their public service obligations, to give advance notice of the dates when their infrastructure will be unavailable to enable suppliers to ensure continuity of supply.    4.4.2.4. The special case of low calorific natural gas  Natural gas consumers from a large area of the Hauts-de-France region are supplied, through a separate grid, with low calorific natural gas, known as L gas. All L gas is imported from the Netherlands, the vast majority of it from the Groningen gas field.  After operating for more than 50 years, this major gas field has now entered a phase of decline. Moreover, following the finding of an increase in the frequency and intensity of seismic activity around the Groningen field, in an area hitherto classified as seismic, the Dutch Government has announced a reduction in the production ceiling of the field and a cessation of L gas exports from 2029.  To ensure continuity of supply to the 1.3 million L gas consumers, a gradual conversion of the H gas grid is being launched. This is a large-scale operation requiring improvements to natural gas transmission and distribution systems, and work at each consumption site to address the possibility of different gas appliances (boilers, water heaters, furnaces, ovens and industrial equipment, etc.) to be supplied with H gas. Some equipment will need adjustment, adaptation and, in some cases, replacement, to guarantee the safety of people and property.  The conversion of the low-calorific gas grid began in 2018 and will be completed by 2029 at the latest. It will be implemented on successive sections of the L gas grid. In view of the risk of faster-thanexpected declines in deliveries of L gas to France, an acceleration of the conversion operation will be sought.  4.4.2.5. Gas system sizing, storage  The current sizing of the gas system ensures that French consumers are supplied. Given the prospects for a decline in natural gas consumption, optimisation of the use of existing infrastructures or even their reduction will be pursued. This optimisation of the use of existing infrastructures relates particularly to underground natural gas storage infrastructures. Article L. 421-3-1 of the Energy Code therefore requires that a definition be provided, in the MEP, of the storage facilities that guarantee medium- and long-term supply security.  Over the period covered by this MEP, no disruptions are expected to natural gas import infrastructures. Uncertainty about the future use of the Fos-Tonkin terminal, in the event that natural gas suppliers do not sign up for any new capacity, does not change the liquefied natural gas import capacity on the Mediterranean coast, which can be fully covered by the single Fos-Cavaou terminal.   The main expected change in the gas system relates to the gradual conversion from the low calorific gas (L gas) network to the high calorific gas (H gas) network. The roll-out of this conversion requires that or the storage of L gas until 2025, despite the gradual decline in numbers of consumers supplied with this grade of gas. The future of the two pipes that make up the Taisnières B interconnection point is uncertain at this time, the options being conversion to H gas transmission and abandonment.   242    Over the period covered by the MEP, natural gas underground storage infrastructures will continue to play a key role in ensuring the continuity of delivery over the grids, especially in the event of a continued concentration of supplies from north-eastern France, by building up natural gas stocks downstream of potential congestion fronts. They will also continue to be necessary to ensure that the gas system is able to meet demand in line with the objective of supply security, without jeopardising the transmission of natural gas to other EU Member States or to Switzerland.  The MEP confirms the outlook for a fall in natural gas consumption, but there is uncertainty about the pace of this decline. Furthermore, the contribution of LNG terminals during a cold snap depends not only on emission capacities, but also on the level of tank filling, which has varied considerably in recent years, and for which the fluctuation outlook must be taken into account. While Articles L. 431-6-2 and L. 431-6-3 of the Energy Code set the objective of developing the interruptibility of natural gas consumption, the potential for this development is difficult to estimate at present.  The underground natural gas storage infrastructures necessary for medium- and long-term supply security have been identified by incorporating these uncertainties into analyses of potential needs, to ensure transmission on the natural gas transmission system and the ability of the network to meet demand.  Figure 69: demand, including L gas and back-up stocks       Débit de soutirage pour un remplissage correspondant à 45% du volume utile (GWh/j)  Take-off flow for filling corresponding to 45% of useful volume (GWh/day)  Estimations des infrastructures de stockage nécessaires  Estimates of necessary storage infrastructures  Capacités des infrastructures de stockage en exploitation en 2018  Storage infrastructure capacities in operation in 2018    Over the next 10 years, there is no need for new underground natural gas storage infrastructures or for the reactivation of any of the three currently mothballed underground storage facilities. The uncertainty up to 2023 means that the underground storage infrastructures currently being used must be kept in operation for this time frame.   243    Between 2019 and 2023, the underground natural gas storage facilities that must remain in operation to ensure medium- and long-term supply security are those listed below, representing a usable volume of 138.5 TWh and an extraction capacity of 2,376 GWh/day, which meets 45% of usable volume needs:   Infrastructure  Operator  Year of commissioning  Storage type  Beynes  Storengy  1956  Aquifer  Céré-la-Ronde  Storengy  1993  Aquifer  Cerville-Velaine  Storengy  1970  Aquifer  Chemery  Storengy  1968  Aquifer  Etrez  Storengy  1980  Salin  Germigny-sous-Coulomb  Storengy  1982  Aquifer  Gournay  Storengy  1976  Aquifer  Lussagnet/Izaute  Teréga  1957  Aquifer  Manosque  Géométhane  1993  Salin  Saint-Illiers-la-Ville  Storengy  1965  Aquifer  Tersanne/Hauterives  Storengy  1970  Salin  Gas storage facilities to remain in operation until 2023  Between 2024 and 2028, storage needs will decrease following the end of the mobilisation of the Gournay infrastructure for the storage of L gas, scheduled for the end of winter 20252026. Based on current assumptions, by that time, the list of storage facilities could be reduced by an extraction capacity of at least 140 GWh/day at 45% of usable volume. Given the above-mentioned uncertainties, the assessment of the necessary volumes will have to be confirmed in 2023 and the next MEP will identify the storage infrastructures that would no longer be needed to ensure the security of natural gas supply in the medium and long term.   4.4.2.6. Safeguarding measures for gas crises  In the event of a crisis, and when preventive measures are insufficient to guarantee the supply of natural gas to French consumers, specific mechanisms may be activated:   recommendation by the public authorities for moderation of energy demand;   activation of interruptibility contracts for natural gas consumption;   as a last resort, reduction of supply to certain consumers by the network operator to which they are connected;   a call for European solidarity if these measures are not sufficient to maintain supply to domestic consumers and essential social services.    Interruptibility contracts for natural gas consumption   244    The Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth provides for the possibility of putting interruptibility schemes in place so that certain consumers can sign up with system operators to reduce their consumption if necessary. To achieve flexibility of approximately 5% of consumption in a cold snap, development of interruptibility of natural gas consumption of at least 200 GWh/day is expected by 2023.  Load shedding and natural gas consumption  Insufficient gas at a point in the network could lead the manager of that network to reduce supply to certain consumers (load shedding). These measures, which may be local or national, aim to compel a consumer to reduce or suspend their consumption. It is not possible to perform automatic supply shutdown remotely, so the network operator must contact the natural gas consumer directly to ask that individual to reduce or suspend their natural gas consumption. The effectiveness of the load-shedding mechanism therefore depends on whether the consumer in question complies with the load-shedding order. To reinforce the effectiveness of the load-shedding procedure, clarification of the legislative and regulatory framework will be undertaken by 2023.  Calls for European solidarity  Regulation (EU) No 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council provides for the establishment of a Union solidarity mechanism in the event of a gas crisis. In extreme situations, if demand from domestic customers and essential social services cannot be satisfied, even after loads are curtailed to all other consumers, France could use the mechanism to obtain the natural gas needed from neighbouring Member States. Conversely, Germany, Belgium, Spain or Italy could use this mechanism, which would lead to loads being curtailed for industrial consumers, with the payment of compensation. The procedures for this European solidarity mechanism will be specified by 2023.    4.4.3. Electricity  The purpose of ensuring security of the electricity system is to avoid localised power cuts or blackouts on a larger geographical scale. The security of the electrical system is based on two separate pillars:   Electricity system reliability, which refers to the capacity of the electricity system to convey electricity from producers to consumers. This is achieved in particular by keeping infrastructures in good working order and by carrying out short-term balancing. Operating reliability also covers events such as major storms or system imbalances owing to an incident abroad that may cause large-scale power cuts. The associated issues will not be addressed in this section.   Security of the electricity supply, which refers to the balance between supply and demand; at any given time, the quantity of electricity consumed must be equal to the quantity of electricity generated and injected into the system, making allowances for the uncertainties associated with both generation and consumption. A balance must be achieved both at an operational management level and in the long term. This involves managing two different kinds of phenomena:  ctricity consumption in France, requires sufficient capacity to be available during the relevant periods (either production or load shedding);  requires an adequate number of flexibility tools to be available within the electricity system. These tools include demand management, storage, interconnections and controllable production units.  This section examines the various determinants of electricity supply security and how it can be provided satisfactorily.   245    4.4.3.1. Controlling and handling consumption peaks  In Metropolitan France, the main risk to the security of electricity supply is peak winter consumption. Demand peaks occur during cold snaps that far exceed average power consumption: power demand then increases by about 2.4 GW for every 1 °C drop in temperature. To date, the maximum power demand nationally was approximately 102.1 GW, reached on 8 February 2012, during an exceptional cold snap.  The national power generation infrastructure and all flexibility tools must therefore be designed to be able to meet peak consumption and not average annual demand.  During the 2000s, power demand at peak consumption increased twice as fast as annual consumption. Since then, peak consumption has tended to stagnate overall, but with significant changes from one year to the next, depending on the severity of the climate, as shown in the following figure.    Figure 70: Change in annual electricity consumption and peak demand      Source: RTE 2018       base 100 en 1990  baseline 100 in 1990  consommation en énergie réalisée  energy consumption achieved  Pointe annuelle réalisée  Annual peak achieved    The long-term trend in peak electricity demand depends essentially on the trend in temperature-sensitive uses of electricity, and primarily electric heating. The implementation of the 2012 heating regulation (RT2012) has led to a decrease in the market share of electric heating in new collective housing and a reduction in heating needs in these dwellings. In electric heating systems, the strong growth of electric heat pumps, with lower, more regular power demand and high thermal inertia, also helps to reduce the demand for electricity at consumption peaks.  Considering the entire stock of residential and tertiary buildings, the trend in peak electrical consumption will largely depend on the pace of energy retrofits of buildings, but also on the trend in consumption: new comfort and leisure habits, new equipment and transfers of use (such as electric cooking). The development of individual electric mobility could also have a significant impact, which will be discussed later in this document.  Given these developments, the trend in peak consumption should become aligned with the trend in total electricity consumption in the coming years, while remaining extremely sensitive to temperature.   246    envisages changes in peak consumption similar to the trend in consumption by 2035, which would therefore reflect a stagnation or indeed a fall in peak power demand in France66.    The capacity mechanism  To ensure compliance with the disruption criterion and ensure that demand peaks can be managed, the NOME law74 introduced a capacity obligation mechanism in France, which effectively applies as of 1 January 2017. The principle behind this capacity mechanism is an obligation for each electricity supplier to provide evidence that the consumption of its customers can be covered in all situations intended to be covered by the system, even during cold snaps, with sufficient capacity guarantees.  The number of capacity guarantees that each supplier must have is determined in such a way as to meet the disruption criterion. It is based on calculations made by RTE, using a methodology consistent with the work carried out as part of the forecasting process. Capacity guarantees are released by RTE for generation and curtailment capacities, during a certification process, with suppliers committing to ensuring that these capacities will be available in the future during peak periods of the year in question. In order to meet their obligations, suppliers can therefore:   use the guarantees they hold based on their own means of generation or curtailment; or,    obtain generation or curtailment capacity guarantees from other operators.   best cost, by selecting the most competitive capacities, and this system provides transparent information about capacity prices.  The energy market ensures that the use of the generation and curtailment capacities of the various players is optimised, but the unrestricted operation of this market would not guarantee compliance with the supply security criterion. The addition of the capacity market to the energy market ensures that this criterion is met.  The introduction of the capacity mechanism on 1 January 2017 required approval by the European Commission, which determined that the capacity mechanism, like all capacity mechanisms implemented within the EU, was covered by European legislation on State aid. The approval of the scheme by the European Commiss  Introducing an annual call for tenders, to guarantee a fixed capacity price over seven years for new capacities, in order to promote  when economically advantageous  the market entry of new generation or curtailment capacity. The calls for tenders are therefore conducted so as to ensure an economic benefit for the community and to minimise the impact of these long-term contracts on the operation of the current system. They include stringent environmental conditions (winners must be able to emit less than 200 gCO2/MWh).   Allowing foreign contributions from bordering Member States to participate directly in the capacity mechanism and obtain the corresponding capacity certificates starting in 2019. Previously, these contributions were only taken into account implicitly.   66 Forecast report on the balancing of electricity supply and demand in France, 2017 Edition, RTE, 2017 available at https://www.rte-france.com/sites/default/files/bp2017_complet_vf.pdf. 74 Law on new structure of the electricity market.   247      The Decree of 15 November 2018 and the subsequent revisions to the rules governing the capacity mechanism have helped to delineate these commitments and move the system in France in this direction.   The coming months should focus on:   Continued integration of the mechanism at European level, with the conclusion of agreements between the French electricity transmission system manager (RTE) and its European counterparts, to further the opening of the European market begun in 2019.   Requests for feedback on the early phases of the mechanism, three years after its initiation in 2017, with the aim of assessing whether any reforms to its operation are appropriate.   Adaptation of the mechanism to new requirements resulting from the Clean Energy for All Europeans package adopted last summer, which includes several provisions on capacity mechanisms operating in the European Union.     4.4.3.2. The rise of renewable electricity  The French electricity system is sufficiently flexible in its current operation to be able to respond to short-term fluctuations in supply and demand, over hourly, daily or weekly periods. But in the long term and beyond the time frame of the MEP, the incorporation of a large proportion of non-controllable renewable energies will require adaptations in order to continue to ensure the supply-demand balance, both in terms of supply security and for balancing services. The simulations performed by RTE in its 2015 forecast report on the balancing of electricity supply and demand have been used to assess the need for flexibility generated by the development of photovoltaic and wind power: wind power primarily creates a need for weekly flexibility, while photovoltaic systems create a need for hourly and daily flexibility.    Figure 71: Illustration of electricity demand and residual demand variability today and in a scenario involving the significant development of renewable energy in 2030  Source: RTE, 2015   248     actuellement  One week of summer currently  Semaine du lundi au dimanche  Week from Monday to Sunday  Solaire  Solar  Éolien  Wind  Consommation  Consumption  Consommation résiduelle  Residual consumption  développement ambitieux des EnR  One week in summer in 2030 in an ambitious RE development scenario  Diminution de la consommation « apparente »   Modification de la forme de la demande résiduelle hebdomadaire  Modification in the form of weekly residual demand  Inversion de la pointe journalière + apparition de creux mi-journée  Reversal of the daily peak + appearance of midday dip   Accentuation of daily range  Semaine du lundi au dimanche  Week from Monday to Sunday  Solaire  Solar  Éolien  Wind  Consommation  Consumption  Consommation résiduelle  Residual consumption       249    In its forecast of the balance of electricity supply and demand for 2017, RTE devised several scenarios (see below). The Ampere and Volt scenarios are based on major development of photovoltaic and wind power, leading by 2035 to installed capacity levels, respectively, of 67 GW of wind power (including 15 GW of offshore wind) and 48 GW of photovoltaics for the Ampere scenario; and 50 GW (including 10 GW of offshore wind) and 36 GW respectively for the Volt scenario. These installed capacity levels for wind and photovoltaic power are of the same order of magnitude as the entire French electricity infrastructure in 2018, for all sources combined, which is 101 GW.  These massive developments of non-controllable capacities should change the pace of residual consumption, i.e. the net electricity consumption of waste (residual) renewable energy generation. Forecasts anticipate a reversal of the daily peak and the appearance of a trough in residual demand at midday, reflecting peak photovoltaic production. The daily amplitude of residual consumption is increasing, while the form of weekly residual demand has changed.  In the two Ampere and Volt scenarios, the high levels of solar and wind power generation in summer feed exports, which reduces the need for the development of flexibility at national level. Occasional dumping appears by 2035. This refers to situations when generation fails to find outlets in France or for export.

In addition to hydroelectricity plants with pumped-energy transfer stations (STEPs) and hydroelectricity plants on lakes, which are already essential sources of flexibility for the electrical system, pondage electricity generation has a regular generation profile with room for manoeuvre to vary generation over the course of the day. ROR power generation provides no flexibility, but does offer a regular generation profile.  The production of electricity by cogeneration from solid biomass or biogas has a basic generation profile (generation that is substantially constant throughout the year) or a semi-basic profile. Like pondage hydropower, these systems even offer a certain intraday flexibility to help them achieve the supplydemand balance.  The analyses carried out by RTE in preparing its forecast report conclude that the integration of significant renewable energy capacities (more than 100 GW installed by 2035 in the Ampere scenario) will not require the development of new flexibilities to ensure a balance between supply and demand. This development of non-controllable renewable electricity nonetheless creates new challenges that can be addressed using all existing flexibility levers, including flexibility of demand, storage and interconnections.  The scenario selected by the Government in the context of the MEP results in wind energy levels of 33.2 to 34.3 GW and photovoltaic levels of 35.6 to 44.5 GW in 2028. According to RTE studies, these levels do not require additional flexibility over the MEP time frame.   Other countries, including European countries, have much higher variable renewable energy penetration rates than France, without suffering disruptions due to supply-demand imbalances (see the example of Ireland below).  4.4.3.3. The closure of fossil thermal generation plants67  In 2016, French electricity generation facilities still included 6.67 GW of oil-fired electricity generation capacity and 2.93 GW of coal-fired generation capacity. On 31 March 2018, EDF closed its last large oil-fired power plant in Cordemais for economic reasons. The Government has announced its intention to close coal plants by 2022 or to support their conversion towards less carbon-intensive solutions, as  67 See also Chapter 3.4.9. Fossil fuel infrastructures   251    part of the Climate Plan. This target was confirmed in the Law on Energy and Climate promulgated in November 2019. The Government has also announced that there will be no new gas plant projects.  The cumulative disappearance of these capacities between 2016 and 2022 will result in a decrease in flexibility of electricity supply and a greater need to mobilise other means of flexibility.   Studies carried out in late 2017 by RTE and updated in 2018 and 2019 confirmed the possibility of closing the last coal-fired power plants by 2022, while meeting supply security criteria both nationally and locally in the reference scenario used in the MEP. This would mean bringing the Flamanville EPR on line by 2022 at the latest.  The delays to the EPR in Flamanville announced in summer 2019 prompted RTE to adjust these analyses in its 2019 forecast report, which concludes that the first coal-fired plants can be closed in 2020, but that the shut-down of all plants by 2022 would entail additional measures, particularly in terms of controlling peak consumption. The Government committed to implementing these measures to secure the shutdown of coal-based power generation by 2022.  RTE also highlighted specific security of supply difficulties for the west of France in the absence of the maintaining the current level of security (in the west in general and Brittany in particular) until the  2019 Forecast Report). Among the levers identified by RTE to maintain a satisfactory level of security of supply in the most degraded configurations, the Ecocombust project to convert to biomass from B wood, driven by EDF, makes it possible to address these difficulties.  demonstrated that the framework laid down by the law on energy and climate, with the aim of encouraging the operators of the last French coal-fired power plants to halt their operations by 2022, and the Decree of 26 December 2019 setting the emission ceiling for electricity generation installations, are compatible with the security of supply objectives.    4.4.3.4. Supply security challenges until 2028  RTE forecasts on the supply-demand balance  In its 2017 forecast report, RTE undertook a major forecasting exercise, presenting five electricity system scenarios with assumptions relating to generation, consumption, flexibility and interconnection, up to 2035, with milestones at 2025 and 2030.   All scenarios show stagnation or a slight decline in annual electricity consumption, even in the case of a significant development of electric mobility. In all scenarios, the downward effects produced by energy efficiency equal or exceed the upward effects associated with transfers of use. This decrease makes it possible to utilise long-term margins for manoeuvre in terms of supply security. The scenarios also show that it is possible to achieve renewable electricity generation in excess of 40% in 2035 without jeopardising the electrical system.  The recent closure of oil-fired power plants, the delay in commissioning the Flamanville EPR, and the prospect of the closure of coal-fired power plants by 2022 with a gradual increase in renewable energies make the 20222023 period the most difficult in terms of supply security. This issue is covered more extensively in the previous section on the closure of fossil fuel plants.   RTE showed that the simultaneous closure of coal-fired power plants and nuclear plants within 40 years would lead to a failure to meet the criterion, unless there is massive development of new means of generation within a very short period. The development of thermal plants would have generated an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the long-term profitability of these facilities would not have  252    been guaranteed due to the development of renewable energies in France and in Europe, which will continue beyond 2025.  In terms of extending the lifespan of the nuclear reactors beyond 40 years, this would need to meet two types of requirements: regulatory requirements (compliance with the cap on nuclear capacity installed in France and with the threshold of 50% generation of nuclear origin in the electricity mix) and security requirements. With regard to the security issues, EDF is beginning a regular review of its 900 MW reactors. To do this, EDF has chosen to apply a general policy of tending towards the nuclear security targets set for third-generation reactors, for which its reference facility is the EPR. Meeting this target will mean that the installations will first need to meet the applicable rules, based on the introduction of targeted checks, in particular on cooling and core rescue systems, investigations to identify and remedy potential weaknesses in the maintenance programmes, and an exhaustive analysis of the handling of compliance deviations.  More long term, the nature of the risks to supply security changes with the development of renewable energies: episodes of tension may last for shorter periods and may involve smaller volumes of energy, but could happen more often and especially in non-winter periods. These forecasts confirm the need for the development of flexibilities and interconnections to ensure long-term supply security, utilising the proliferation of renewable energies at European level.  The scenario chosen by the Government considers all of these constraints and proposes a calendar for the closure of coal-fired power plants and nuclear reactors in order to guarantee the security of supply. The law on energy and climate therefore pushed back the reduction in the share of nuclear to 50% to 2035.  The participation of nuclear in supply security  Around the world, nuclear reactors most often operate at a constant power level for economic reasons: it is more profitable to operate reactors at full power than not to use them because there is no economic gain in terms of fuel when a reactor is shut down, unlike fossil fuels.  Conversely, in France, nuclear plants were designed to operate in load monitoring mode and thus to continuously adjust electricity generation for consumption. Today, the average load factor in the French system is therefore relatively low when compared to other international figures: this is around 72% in France while the facilities operated by Exelon in the United States have a load factor of 90%. In addition to the technological and operational challenges that this load monitoring operation involves, the French system has adjusted economically.  With the increasing integration of renewable energies, nuclear installations in the future will have to adapt to new factors of variability, in a context in which the concomitant growth of interconnections will make it possible to derive greater benefit from the flexible capacities of our European neighbours for our own supply security.  With regard to the participation of nuclear in supply security in the medium and long term, based on the technologies currently available, it is not possible to determine with certainty which technologies will be the most competitive in guaranteeing our electricity mix over that time frame, whether nuclear or renewable energies associated with storage and other flexibility solutions.  The ability of the electricity grids to integrate intermittent energy sources, the maturity of electricity storage technologies (including between seasons) and the economic performance of the different pathways on a full-cost basis will be decision-making factors. Between 2030 and 2050, these parameters will need to be combined to develop the new energy landscape in France and the respective shares of nuclear and renewable energies: a range of scenarios will be explored, from 100% renewable to a scenario where nuclear remains an electricity generation source sustainably integrated into the electricity mix for reasons of competitiveness and the need to control power generation. Because of this uncertainty,  253    there is a need to preserve a capacity to construct new nuclear reactors supported by national industrial capacity and technology.  Interactions between the supply security of electricity and gas  The electricity and gas systems are interdependent:   During cold snaps, gas and electric heating are both subject to high demand. It must not be possible to interrupt the supply of gas plants that are in high demand.   An electrical crisis can lead to gas delivery difficulties, as the gas network, from the transmission system to end-customer installations, cannot function properly without electricity.  This interdependence is expected to increase with the commissioning of a new gas plant at Landivisiau and the shut-down of oil and coal power plants. However, with peaks in electricity consumption on very cold winter days, which coincide with peaks in gas consumption, a lack of gas supply combined with a cold snap may have an impact on electricity supply.  The dependencies between the two systems may also be local, as in Brittany or Provence-Alpes-Côte Azur where the electricity grid is limited, making the operation of some gas plants necessary. Gas supply to power plants can currently be interrupted under the interruptibility clauses of their supply contracts.  The existing coordination between GRTgaz/Téréga (formerly TIGF) and RTE needs to be increased to enable a more detailed examination of the dependency links between electricity and gas crises, and in particular the consequences of a gas crisis on the electricity system, due to its effect on gas-fired plants, given that electricity demand is much more variable over the day than gas demand, and that load shedding can be more easily implemented, locally and on a rotating basis, for electricity.    4.4.3.5. Developing the electrical system to integrate a growing share of renewable energies  Changes being implemented at European level  The Third Energy Package for the internal market, adopted by the EU Member States in 2009, introduced a number of tools to facilitate the construction of European electricity. In particular, it lays out the order to improve electrical safety in a context of rapid development of renewable energies. These codes were all approved in late 2016, and are being integrated into the French regulatory framework. Three of these grid codes are designed to harmonise the technical requirements for the connection, respectively, of generation and consumption facilities and very-high-voltage direct current lines. These elements also aim to improve integration of renewable energies into the operation of the electricity system through appropriate connection to electricity grids.  Construction of the electrical system of tomorrow  In national terms, the changes in generation methods in the electrical system will not result in new technical constraints over the time frame of the MEP. In the longer-term, many questions will need to be answered about the potential of renewable energies to ensure the stability of the electricity system. Regardless of the scenario adopted beyond this programme, changes in the electricity mix will be based on a reduction in controllable thermal systems within France and Europe and replacement by renewable energies, and especially wind and photovoltaic systems. In the long term, these renewable energies will make up a significant part of the electricity mix, supplemented by hydroelectricity and possibly by nuclear generation. The challenges posed by the penetration of renewable energies essentially relate to:   254     the decentralisation of the electrical system, in particular with more and more installations connected at HVA or LV, which will change flow management practices and will raise important planning issues for the accommodation of new generation capacity;   the management of variability and maintenance of supply quality;   interfacing of these generation activities, particularly through power electronics, to ensure the security of the electrical system.   Providing system services with renewable energy  System services, in terms of voltage and frequency (adjustment, balancing, etc.) are currently provided mainly through traditional generation resources. Renewable energies can already provide some of these services today. New generation facilities will also be required to have the capacity to perform these services, under the grid codes that will soon be applicable throughout the European Union. On the other hand, the issue is still open for other services provided to the grid, as it does not currently seem possible to provide these services due to power electronics interfacing.   Work will be undertaken with the grid operators and the IEA to study in detail the services that can be provided by renewable energies interfaced by power electronics. It will also assess possible changes in the management of the electrical system that might be required to guarantee the same level of security and quality of supply in a system with a significant share of renewables.  Several examples from around the world show that it is possible to ensure the stability of the electrical system at high rates of variable renewable energy penetration through the adaptation of existing balancing services and the introduction of new services, as the example of the Irish case shows.    255    Box 14: Integration of renewable energies into the Irish electricity mix  In 2016, Ireland produced 30 TWh of electricity, of which 26% came from renewable energies. Its installed facilities represent just over 7 GW.   With variable wind power generation accounting for  Mix électrique irlandais 2016 : 30 TWh 22% of national generation and with a target of 42.5% renewable energy by 2020, Ireland must continually  Eolien adapt the operation of its grid to integrate a growing 22% Hydro share of intermittent renewable energies.

The first problems that a grid operator has to address result from the high rate of frequency change due to low synchronous inertia and a lack of production stability.  In order to gradually increase this 50% limit, Eirgrid and SONI have implementeservices that address potential problems in the system (e.g. variability of generation, lower inertia, difficulty in maintaining frequency), identified through technical analysis. These services include the following:   the establishment of technical requirements for the facilities, for example a requirement for ided by rotating machinery, thanks to the wind turbine blades);   the development of new balancing products, such as the supply of dynamic reactive power or a ramping margin, which  for a given generation unit  involves defining a margin of generation that can be guaranteed for a certain period of time and that evolves over time depending on the degree of certainty of generation.  These different mechanisms have made it possible to limit the loss of wind generation (by capping or due to congestion) to around 4% of annual wind production, without resorting to significant storage volumes.  Since May 2018, Eirgrid has thus pushed its renewable energy penetration limit to 65%. Eirgrid aims to reach 70% in 2019 and 75% in 2020.       256    4.4.3.6. Security of uranium supply  For the purposes of nuclear-based power generation, the French nuclear system uses various types of uranium-based nuclear fuels (UOx, MOx or ERU). France has therefore adopted a policy of reprocessing of its spent fuel, a strategy that presents a major challenge in terms of reducing the volumes of radioactive wastes produced. This strategy will be continued until the 2040s, when the bulk of the installations and workshops required for reprocessing will reach the end of their life cycles.   EDF, which operates the entire stock of French nuclear reactors, is responsible for uranium security of supply.  Uranium needs mainly depend on:   changes to nuclear installations and their operating methods;   the spent fuel recycling strategy, particularly with the use of MOX fuel, which means that the procurement of natural uranium can be reduced.  per year, i.e. 13% of the global consumption of 59,000 tonnes (2017 data).   Accessible global reserves are estimated at 4.6 Mt, which corresponds to nearly 80 years of global consumption. These reserves are generally well distributed throughout the world, notably in Australia (1.7 MtU), Africa (0.9 MtU), Central Asia (0.8 MtU) and North America (0.5 MtU). There is, therefore, a relatively low risk of shortage, while the uranium market has remained depressed since the FukushimaDaiichi disaster, with a very low average price of about USD 25 per pound in 2019.  To bolster its supply security, EDF uses several levers:   Geographical and commercial diversification of sources of supply for each stage of the fuel cycle (mining, conversion, enrichment and assembly manufacturing). This diversification is particularly important in mining, as EDF is mainly supplied by five countries (Niger, Kazakhstan, Canada, Australia and Russia).   Long-covered for about 10 years by its main suppliers.   Stock management. EDF retains significant stocks of uranium over the entire nuclear fuel cycle (mining, conversion, enrichment, new fuel, reactor fuel, reserve fuel). These stocks make it possible to operate the French nuclear reactors over several years, thus addressing the risk of supply disruption.  However, the supply of uranium is not the only issue for supply security: the robustness of industrial processes used for fuel fabrication and the storage capacities associated with these activities can also be critical. Indeed, a long interruption to certain plants in the cycle or the saturation of spent fuel storage capacities could lead to a forced temporary shut-down of some nuclear reactors in the whole country.  A reduction in nuclear capacities has consequences for the fuel cycle. In particular, the strategy to reprocess/recycle nuclear fuel is a major challenge in terms of reducing the volumes of radioactive wastes produced. This strategy will therefore be continued throughout the time frame of the MEP and beyond, until the 2040s, when the bulk of the installations and workshops of the Hague plant will reach reactors over the longterm viability of the French cycle.  4.4.3.7. Security of biomass supply   257    Energy transition and the green economy require control of the use of fossil resources in all areas and better use of nationally available renewable resources, especially biomass, given the assets available to France in this sphere. The SNBC envisages a five-fold increase in non-food uses of biomass in the long term (wood-construction, green chemistry, biomaterials, bioenergies, etc.). In this context, the implementation of strategies (nationally and regionally) for biomass mobilisation is sensible.  Energy recovery from biomass has its place within other uses. The diagram below illustrates the fact that energy recovery is part of a hierarchy of biomass resources that prioritises food uses, then biofertilisers, then materials, then molecules, then liquid fuels, then gas, then heat, then electricity. This hierarchy is based on the principle of the cascading use of biomass: products used in materials can be used in energy at the end of their service lives.

Non-methanised biomass is in primary energy.   The total supply of solid biomass not usable for methanation up to 2028 is estimated as 251 TWh, of which 120 TWh is forest biomass.   259     These figures, particularly those related to forest biomass, are taken from the SNMB (approved in 2018), which itself is based on the latest studies and available data, including a 2015 IGN-FCBA78 study on forest availability for energy and materials until 2035. The SNMB to 2023 describes the usable volumes for various products associated with forest biomass (softwood lumber, industry/energy lumber, wood scraps, sawmill products). These data should be revisited in the light of the latest available studies, particularly those done as part of regional programmes for forestry and lumber management79. To that end, a consolidation study was launched in mid-2019.  Regarding methanisable biomass, the SNMB evaluates the additional supply of methanisable biomass without destabilisation of other existing sectors as 30 TWh, and thus total resources of 40 TWh.        2023  2028  Methanised biomass  Agricultural biomass  Crops  (perennial  and  Intermediate  Crops for Energy Purposes)  2.3  2.4  Crop residues  6.7  11.3  Waste and other by- products  Green wastes  1.2  1.9  STEP slurry  0.2  0.4  Waste and agri-food by-products  0.2  0.5  Effluents  7.8  13.3                                                          76.

Additional biomass supply as final energy (TWh)  Recoverable wood resources that can be recovered as energy are estimated to be 2 Mt, of which 1.1 Mt are already recovered. This means an additional energy resource of about 2 TWh. Measures to increase the mobilisation of biomass resources in accordance with sustainable management practices, in order to coordinate the uses of biomass and linked with the national forest-wood programme, will help support the development of wood for energy purposes. Finally, a wood waste recovery initiative is currently under way within the framework of the Strategic Committee for the Timber Industry.  The aim of the waste recovery policy is to reuse wood waste in material form, instead of incinerating it. The circular economy action plan above all encourages cascading wood use, with several reuse and recycling cycles.  Support systems for energy recovery should not thus provide for the eligibility of wood waste when it is demonstrated that the waste could not be reused or recycled (e.g. diseased wood, creosote waste, etc.).  Non-recyclable wood waste should be eligible for support schemes as a matter of priority, without prejudice to the application of the regulations on classified installations for the protection of the environment. However, the cost impact of the upstream processing of this waste or processing via energy recovery on the level of support necessary must be studied.  If the potential resource is very abundant, mobilising it under satisfactory economic and environmental conditions will require a progressive approach (see the box below). The evaluation of additional biomass supply available shows that by 2023, just over half of the additional needs should be met from agricultural biomass, mainly through the use of crop residues and intermediate crops for energy purposes, but also through agroforestry and, to a lesser extent, by perennial crops. Achieving these SNMB objectives therefore requires the development of suitable instruments to enable the mobilisation of this agricultural biomass. Forestry should contribute less than half of the resources.  A comparison of this supply with the additional demand identified at this stage shows that biogas needs can be covered by domestic resources, but that energy needs overall (biofuels including air, heat and cogeneration) could not be covered without some transitional use of biomass imports. If the figures are on the higher side, the need for non-methanised solid biomass could even be only half met by domestic biomass, thus necessitating major transitional use of imports.  However, it is important to remember that the SNMB specifically seeks to avoid structural recourse to imports, establishing mobilisation conditions for domestic resources that meet the sustainability criteria laid down in the 2018 RED II Directive. Operationally speaking, it should be noted that the Heat Fund specifications require that imported wood come from certified sustainably managed forests. It is also important to note that products made from palm oil are not considered biofuel, and their use is therefore not subject to tax incentives (exclusion provided under Article 266-quindecies of the Customs Code).  Box 13a: National Biomass Mobilisation Strategy  The National Biomass Mobilisation Strategy (SNMB) aims to develop positive externalities related to the mobilisation and de facto use of biomass, especially for the purposes of mitigating climate change. One of its objectives is to enable the supply of energy production facilities: domestic wood-burning appliances, industrial and tertiary collective boilers, and cogeneration units.  To be effective, the SNMB must overcome difficulties in the development of biomass supply, providing acceptable synergies with other existing policies. It has been designed alongside the National Low-Carbon Strategy and the MEP, from which it takes the demand targets for biomass for energy purposes. The SNMB is also supported by the National Forestry and Timber Plan. In geographical terms, it covers 18 regions (Metropolitan France, plus Guadeloupe, Guyana, Martinique, Reunion and  261    Mayotte). It will be coordinated with the regional biomass schemes (SRB) being developed in the regions. It will be revised in the year following the adoption of the new MEP and then every five years.  The SNMB identifies different categories of biomass that could be subject to increased use and sets targets for resource development and mobilisation. It makes 72 recommendations for improving and increasing the mobilisation of domestic biomass, to cover as many identified biomass needs as possible, for energy purposes and for construction or biomaterials and green chemistry. These recommendations also ensure that this mobilisation is sustainable, through initiatives such as promoting material uses and those with high added value (progressive concentration of biomass energy use on end-of-life bio-based products that are not recyclable), restoring sustainable forest management (in close partnership with bio-economics, adaptation to climate change and increased preservation of biodiversity), focusing on strengthening the quality of soils, especially agricultural soils, etc.  The SNMB is based on several national studies intended to quantify resources and estimate additional potential. In particular, it uses the 2015 IGN and FCBA study, the 2013 ADEME study on biomass resources for methanation, and data collected by the National Observatory of Biomass Resources under the leadership of FranceAgriMer. On that basis, the SNMB has established targets up to 2023 for mobilisation of additional forest, agricultural and biowaste resources:   additional non-methanised biomass (possible use in bio-based materials, green chemistry, biofuels or heat-cogeneration) is estimated as 52 TWh of primary energy equivalent;  additional biogas production is estimated as 18 TWh.  In the medium term, agricultural biomass would contribute close to 80% of available biomass.  The SNMB is subject to annual monitoring. It is presented to the Information and Orientation Committee (the indicative composition of which is attached to the strategy document) and then made public. This monitoring is undertaken in tandem with the monitoring of the sector-based plans with which the SNMB is coordinated (National Forestry and Wood Plan, agroforestry plan, MEP, waste prevention and management plan, low-carbon strategy, etc.).  Another development factor to be considered for this strategy is the forthcoming completion of regional biomass schemes (SRB) being devised in the regions. The first review of the strategy will be an opportunity to ensure consistency with the SRBs.          Box 13b: National Biomass Mobilisation Strategy  Environmental challenges faced by the SNMB  As regards soil and biodiversity, more frequent use and increased, sustained exporting of wood, scraps and crop residues could result in a loss in chemical (fewer nutrient-rich resources), physical (settling) and biological fertility in the soil, decreased availability of biodiversity habitats, and reduced connectivity (green pathways) in the landscape. These effects should be limited through reasonable use of materials, maintenance of old trees, increased awareness of the issue of soil compacting and the return of nutrient-rich elements (digestates, composts, ash, etc.).  Overall, increased use of nitrogen fertilisers and crop protection products, particularly in agriculture, could impact biodiversity and soil, air and water quality.   The environmental impacts observed will depend to a considerable degree on the implementation of the awareness building, training and reporting measures laid out in the SNMB and the relevant sectorbased regulations.  The impact is considered to be neutral in terms of use of natural spaces and landscapes, considering the lack of clear causal links on these issues.   262    It should be noted that more dynamic management of certain resources (forests, hedges, etc.) can, conversely, have positive effects on the diversity of these environments and their resilience to climate change.  All of these issues, and the measures proposed as a result, are developed in the SNMB environmental assessment report.        Strategic orientation of these resources  Biomass is a scarce resource and will remain so between now and 2050. For this reason, the MEP gives clear guidelines on prioritising it for uses where it is most effective:   For wood, its use as heat in district heating systems or for the production of industrial heat must be prioritised. Cogeneration should only take place in specific cases and high efficiency cogeneration should be preferred in this case.   For biogas, biomethane injection must be prioritised. Cogeneration must only take place in specific cases, in particular for generation facilities far away from gas networks.   For biofuels, the goal is not to increase first-generation fuels but, rather, second-generation (advanced) biofuels
