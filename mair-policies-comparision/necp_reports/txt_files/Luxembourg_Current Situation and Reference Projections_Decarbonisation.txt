The values and the definition of the sectors have been taken from the GHG inventory of 2019.16 In accordance with international conventions, the total sum of the LULUCF emissions is not included. In 2017, a total of 10.2 million t CO2eq was emitted. This is a 21.4 per cent reduction when compared with 2005.

Due to the change to the scope of the ETS from 2013 onwards, additional activities and installations have been included in the ETS. The corresponding GHG emissions are therefore no longer accounted for in the non-ETS sector (non-ETS emissions for industry in 2012: 563 kt CO2eq and non-ETS emissions for industry in 2013: 274 kt CO2eq). The GHG emissions from the non-ETS sectors amounted to 8.7 million t CO2eq in 2017, of which only about 10% were non-energy-related GHG emissions.                                                              16 https://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/lu/eu/mmr/art07_inventory/ghg_inventory/envxitkwg/  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 136   Table 8: Greenhouse gas emissions by ETS and non-ETS for 2005 to 2017, in kt CO2eq  2005 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 ETS emissions excl. internat. air transport 2,603 2,253 2,052 1,990 1,847 1,931 1,661 1,503 1,492 Total non-ETS emissions 10,421 9,926 9,998 9,798 9,391 8,855 8,634 8,549 8,744 Energy-related non-ETS emissions 9,608 9,070 9,144 8,960 8,536 7,982 7,753 7,653 7,832 Energy sector 232 201 208 215 221 174 175 184 184 Industry 474 605 570 563 274 236 245 249 255 Transport 7,188 6,517 6,893 6,585 6,439 6,139 5,706 5,533 5,639 Private households 1,216 1,161 1,064 1,083 1,075 973 1,086 1,119 1,116 Trade, commerce and services 419 502 336 439 463 398 483 512 583 Others* 27 29 28 28 24 24 24 24 24 Diffuse emissions 53 54 47 48 41 38 35 32 31 Non-energy-related non-ETS emissions 814 856 854 838 855 873 882 896 912 Industrial processes 68 89 97 100 106 108 108 109 116 Agriculture 641 672 666 649 660 675 688 704 712 Waste 105 95 91 89 90 91 85 83 84 LULUCF -601 -88 -220 -313 -500 -416 -362 -452 -344 * Other emissions relate to combustion in construction and agriculture Source: GHG Inventory 2019v1 (March 2019) and EUA EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) data viewer.17  The projections for the sector-specific developments by ETS and non-ETS for the reference scenario based on current policies and measures are shown in Table 9 .

Renewable energy The contribution made by renewable energy to energy production in Luxembourg is steadily increasing. As can be seen from the target scenario in Section 2 of this report, a consistent continuation of the trend established in the recent past is being sought. The following section explains the starting position in respect of the use of renewable energy, followed by a consideration of the future development  in this case purely in the event of a continuation of existing measures, both in terms of production and demand.  Status quo of renewable energy use in Luxembourg In recent years, considerable growth has been achieved in renewable energies such as wind energy, photovoltaics and biomass, i.e. the core technologies in the field of electricity production for Luxembourg. Over the course of a decade, their contribution has increased significantly  both in the electricity sector (from 3.3% in 2007 to 8.1% in 2017), but also in connection with heat generation (from 4.4% in 2007 to 8.1% in 2017). In the transport sector, which is dominated by the use of biofuels and the transition to electrically operated drive systems, this change was even more dramatic: In 2007, the renewable energy share was around 2.2%; in 2017, Luxembourg achieved a renewable energy share of 6.4%.  Reference development in the event of a continuation of existing measures In the following, a reference development or the expected development with continuation of existing measures, both on the supply and the demand side, is presented for the period up to 2040.  The renewable energy share in the gross final energy demand, in other words the total of the sectoral energy demands for electricity, heat and fuels in the transport sector would increase accordingly from 6.4% in 2017 to 12.9% by 2030, and finally to 13.5% in 2040.  Table 10 provides information on the sectoral decomposition of the overall balance and Table 11 provides supplementary details on the potential underlying technology split. Compared to the target scenario of 25%, as depicted in Section 2 of this report, the underlying volumes only show comparatively minor differences in terms of the energy-related contribution of specific renewable energy technologies. Accordingly, a significant increase in renewable energy in the electricity sector is also expected in the reference scenario. This results in a share of approximately 26.5% for 2030 and around 34.7% for 2040. Substantial contributions in terms of volume are expected here from wind energy and photovoltaics  the latter, however, being considerably slower than in the case of the development compatible with the target  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 138   scenario (according to Section 2). Projects that are already in the implementation stage, for instance in the field of biomass cogeneration, will also make substantial contributions.  Similarly to electricity, a significant expansion of renewable energy is also expected in the heat sector in the event of a continuation of existing measures. In this case, the renewable energy share in the reference scenario will increase from 8.1% in 2017 to 18.6% by 2030 and finally 21.9% in 2040.   In unison with electricity and heat, a huge increase in the use of renewable energy is also expected in the transport sector in the reference case. In this specific case, it is assumed that there will be an increase in the admixture of biofuels (with an admixture rate of around 8% in 2030). In addition, an expansion of e-mobility is expected, and it is also assumed that by the end of 2030 the biofuel mix will consist of no more than 5% first-generation fuels. In total, an increase of the renewable energy share in the transport sector to 15.1% will therefore be achieved by 2030 in the reference case.

These are  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 139   used in the reference scenario to achieve an overall renewable energy target of 23% in 2030 and amount to (already contractually agreed) 1 TWh in 2020 and 4.83 TWh in 2030 (and thereafter).
