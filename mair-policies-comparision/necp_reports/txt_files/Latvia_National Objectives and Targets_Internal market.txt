Electricity interconnectivity  EDG2020 lay down the target for infrastructure connectivity in the electricity market (the ratio of interconnection capacity to total generation capacity expressed in percentage terms  for 2020 at 10 %. CEPF2030, for its turn, lays down the target for 2030 at 15 %.  In accordance with the current situation, the Latvian interconnection level in 2017, which has been calculated using at least eight formulae, reaches at least 50 % (as much as 80 % depending on the formulae used in the calculation), it is therefore believed that Latvia has already reached the set interconnection target. Latvia sets the target for 2030 to increase at least 60 %. 3.4.2. Energy transmission infrastructure  Interconnections between Member States in the Baltic Sea Region and reinforcing internal grid infrastructures accordingly is intended to prevent isolation of the Baltic States and to foster market integration inter alia by working towards the integration of renewable energy in the region. In the period until 2025, the implementation of the following projects has been set as the goal for improvement of electricity transmission infrastructure:  Integration of the electricity networks of the Baltic States and their synchronisation with European networks;  Estonia  Latvia third interconnection  Kilingi-NÃµmme (Estonia)  Riga CHPP-2 (LV) interconnection to increase the transfer capability by 500/600 MW between Estonia and Latvia in a normal operation mode and by up to 300/500 MW in an isolated operation mode;  Interconnection Tartu (Estonia) - Valmiera (LV) and interconnection Tsirgulina (Estonia) - Valmiera (LV) in order to completely remove transfer capability limits between Estonia and Latvia also after 2020, as well as to increase the total transfer capability via the Baltic States by 600 MW.   88  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 Figure 40. The existing high voltage infrastructure network and planned projects152 In addition to the listed energy transmission interconnection projects, thought is being given to the idea of building an interconnection between Latvia and Sweden, taking into account that Latvia is the only country among the Baltic States that does not have interconnections with Nordic countries or other EU countries outside the Baltic States region. The planned interconnection capacity is 700 MW. Presently, the Latvian transmission system operator has evaluated several versions of routes and approximate costs. capacity of the HPP spillway in order to address the calculated possible negative consequences and danger of maximum potential flooding for the security of reservoir dams. The natural gas sector has a number of infrastructure projects to promote market liquidity and ensure security and stability of gas supply in the region. In the period from 2020 to 2029 the following significant projects for the development of the Latvian and Baltic natural gas market:  The Estonia  Finland interconnection (Balticconector) is considered to be one of the most significant projects in the gas supply sector in the Baltic Sea region, and this is a precondition for creating the joint regional gas market of the Baltic States and Finland;  Improvement of the Latvia  Estonia interconnection (Karksi) to ensure gas flows in the single Baltic gas market after the implementation of the Balticconnector project enabling   facility to make it retain its functionality after pressure in the Baltic transmission system increases.  The Poland  Lithuania interconnection (GIPL), which will ensure diversification of natural gas supply routes and sources.  Increasing the capacity of the Latvia  Lithuania interconnection, which would allow management of higher volumes of gas between Latvia and Lithuania, including after the implementation of the GIPL project; Latvia aims to continue to realise investments in natural gas infrastructure development also when the current infrastructure projects are completed. 3.4.3. Market integration  Since Latvia has an open electricity and natural gas market, although undertakings and households may freely choose the most suitable electricity and gas traders, there are no plans to set other goals for integration of the internal electricity and gas market. Nor are specific goals being set for the integration of the internal fuel market (transport energy), because this market has not been and is not integrated. As for the internal thermal energy market, Latvia possibilities of opening this up, although even under the current setup several thermal energy producers may operate in the single thermal energy supply system operator licence operation zone, and these manufacturers may propose that the system operator buy the heat they produce for the agreed price.                                                       152 http://www.ast.lv/sites/default/files/editor/Gada_parsk_2017_parakstits_Final_print_arvaku_.pdf  89  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 3.4.3.1. Other aspects of the internal energy market Until 2018, electricity users continued to optimise the connection capacity  the efficiency of using the connection capacity has increased by an average of 7.5 %. Since May 2016, applications for changing the connection capacity have been received and over 14,000 users with a consumption of 0 to 120 kWh/year have terminated their contracts. 1,473 users have used the opportunities of the transition period to introduce tariff changes and have completely or partially restored the capacity for a total of 123,398 kW. The service of reducing the connection capacity is free of charge. 3.4.3.2. Non-discrimination of RES members There are no specific prohibitions for any specific technology or type of RE in Latvia, but there are restrictions regarding the location of the technologies and their compliance with environmental, biodiversity, societal, or territorial conditions.  3.4.3.3. Consumer's participation as part of the development of a smart grid based on digital technologies. A gradual expansion of the smart grid will reduce the costs of servicing and maintenance of electricity meters and ensure that the information on consumption, load, and interruptions in the electricity grid is available quickly, at any time, and from any location.  For the benefit of consumers, in 2016 Section 301 of the Electricity Market Law introduced an electricity net payment system153 for micro generators, and it has been in force since 1 January 2014 for all households that produce electricity for own consumption using RES. RES consumers use micro generators to produce electricity. A micro generator is an electricity generator and related protection and conversion devices (inverter) for producing alternating current with the electric current of up to 16 amperes intended to be installed in the electrical installation of the customer for parallel work with a low-voltage distribution network. It corresponds to the power of 3.7 kW in a single-phase network and 11.1 kW in a three-phase network. Since 2012, the Ministry of Economics has issued about 600 permits for introducing new electricity generators, mostly micro generators with a power from 0.0035 MW to 0.01 MW. 3.4.3.4. Adequacy of the electricity system There are no plans to bring into operation any new base power plants by 2028 and no decisions about implementing any major power plant projects (including with regard to the increase of the base electric power) in the Baltic States by 2028 were taken by the end of 2018. However, it is possible that high capacity wind park projects with the installed capacity over 200 MW or more might be implemented in Latvia in the coming years. 3.4.3.5. Protection of energy consumers Since electricity is no longer subsidised for all energy consumers after the liberalisation of the electricity market, the most vulnerable part of the society requires support in order to reduce the possible negative impact of increased prices. In the period until 2030, there are plans to continue the implementation of support for protected users in the previous amount, but also taking into account the measures implemented for reforming the MPC.                                                       153 the net system for electricity is a procedure by which payments are made for electricity consumed and by which the distribution system operator clears accounts for the electricity consumed by the user who produces electricity from RES for own needs, and electricity which has been transferred to the network of the distribution system operator 90  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 According to Section 33.1(1) of the Electricity Market Law, a protected user154 has the right to receive the electricity trade service of a protected user, and vulnerable population groups are offered a certain amount of electricity at a reduced rate:  poor or low-income families (persons), as well as families taking care of a child with disability, and persons with group I disability  100 kW for a subsidised price of EUR 0.03758 per kilowatt hour each accounting period (calendar month);  large families  300 kWh for a price of EUR 0.03758 per kWh each accounting period (calendar month). The fixed MPC and the distribution system service fee are also offset depending on the connection capacity.  3.4.4. Energy poverty  Latvia has pledged  to reduce share of households that could not afford  by 2030, ensuring that this share is lower than the EU average indicator. Therefore, the target for 2030 for the indicshare of households that could to ensure that this indicator in Latvia is less than 7.5 %. At the same time, energy poverty conditions and targets should be set and reviewed in line with the conditions and goals of protection of energy consumers.
