74 (199) Framework (see Section 1.2.1).  3.2 Dimension energy efficiency  3.2.1 Planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030 as well as other objectives referred to in point 2.2, including planned measures and instruments (also of a financial nature) to promote the energy performance of buildings, in particular with regard to the following:  3.2.1.1 Energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative policy measures under Articles 7a and 7b and Article 20(6) of Directive 2012/27/EU and to be prepared in accordance with Annex III to this Regulation  Choice of policies to achieve the energy saving obligations Under Article 7(10) of the Energy Efficiency Directive129 Member States must achieve the amount of energy savings required under Article 7.1, paragraph 1, point b, either by establishing an energy efficiency obligation scheme referred to in Article 7a or by adopting alternative policy measures referred to in Article 7b. The Member States may combine an energy efficiency obligation scheme with alternative policy measures.  Swedish energy efficiency policy is based on the principle that:   policies should be general and not linked to specific technologies;  prices must give the right (or required) information;  search costs are reduced because information is produced and distributed; and  barriers can be removed, for example by adjusting existing regulations.  State initiatives to promote energy efficiency are targeted both at energy consumption and supply and aim to support the spontaneous efficiency improvements in society with policies tailored to the mechanisms of the market. The state's role is to identify and remedy market failures  primarily external effects and a lack of information.  The current portfolio of energy efficiency policies is consequently very broad and comprises general economic policies, such as energy and carbon taxes and emissions trading, as well as more targeted administrative policies, such as the requirement for authorisation to carry out activities that are harmful to the environment and the requirement for energy performance                                                       129 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, amending Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC. 75 (199) ratings and energy labelling of energy-related products and buildings. The policies are implemented by means of various complementary initiatives, which deal in different ways with the lack of information on the market and increase awareness and knowledge of different energy-efficiency and energy-saving measures, both technical and behaviour-related, and also their legitimacy. Examples include state support for municipal energy and climate advisory services, state support for energy mapping in small and medium-sized enterprises, state support for local and regional capacity development for the energy and climate transition, including support for regional climate and energy strategies and measures for early introduction to the market. Sweden also provides various support measures for investments to promote energy efficiency. Examples include the Energisteg programme, the Klimakliv and Industrikliv initiatives and state support for renovation and energy efficiency measures in apartment blocks in certain areas.  The combination of economic policies and complementary and targeted information initiatives and investment assistance is considered to provide a sound basis for achieving energy efficiency cost-effectively. Energy and carbon taxes increase the cost of using energy and hence create an incentive for consumers to take energy-saving measures to reduce their energy consumption and/or consume energy more efficiently. Some of the measures are easy to introduce and to take, but there is often a lack of detailed knowledge about the measures that can be taken and are suitable in a particular case. Information about possible and suitable measures is often asymmetric, which means that those selling energy-efficient technologies or other energy-efficiency solutions often have an information advantage over the final consumer, who will be taking the measures and footing the bill. The guidance function of the energy price is often not enough. Energy consumers who respond to price signals are also influenced by other knowledge about where measures should be taken. Impartial advice about suitable measures can be obtained from a municipal energy and climate advisor.  Under Article 7(11) of the Energy Efficiency Directive, when drafting policy measures to meet their energy savings obligations under 7(1) of the Energy Efficiency Directive, Member States must take account of the need to alleviate energy poverty in accordance with criteria established by them and with due regard for their existing practice in the area. The Government makes no distinction between energy poverty and poverty in general. As a result, the term energy poverty is not used, and there are no targeted policies to deal with it.  The Swedish Energy Agency has looked into whether an energy savings obligation scheme (white certificates) is an appropriate policy for Sweden on 76 (199) a number of occasions. It has concluded that this kind of scheme should not be introduced in Sweden in principle, but does not categorically rule it out. It believes that white certificates aim to correct market failures that are already addressed by another policies; the scheme may also affect, and be affected by, the operation of other policies, such as the EU ETS and electricity certificates. It does not rule out the possibility of using white certificates if another objective in addition to energy efficiency is added to the scheme, by does not believe the matter needs to be investigated any further.  In the final report of its study of smaller operators in a changing energy landscape Smaller operators in the energy landscape  effective proposals (SOU 2018:76) it proposed that an obligation scheme should be introduced in Sweden. The proposal deals with energy efficiency and energy consumption up to 2040 and energy efficiency in general. The scheme proposed by the study was not based on the obligation scheme provided for under the Energy Efficiency Directive. The study has been sent out for consultation, and the suggestions made will be dealt with by the Swedish Government Offices.  period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 by means of energy and carbon taxes and complementary policies which focus on managing information-related market failures.  In view of this, Sweden currently intends to achieve the savings obligation with policies other than obligation schemes, as permitted under Article 7(b) of the Energy Efficiency Directive. It will impose special energy and carbon taxes to meet the energy savings obligation. A more detailed description of energy and carbon taxes in Sweden and the EU is given below. Other complementary energy efficiency policies are described in Section 3.2.1.2 and Section 3.2.1.3.  Energy and carbon tax  Energy and carbon taxes in Sweden The energy and carbon taxes charged in Sweden under the Energy Tax Act (1994:1776) fulfil the minimum levels of taxation required by the Energy Tax Directive130  The Swedish agency that administers and monitors taxation (the implementing public authority) is the Swedish Tax Agency.                                                        130 Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity. 77 (199) Electricity generators and network operators are the main groups liable for energy tax131. They incur the tax liability when they transmit electricity to anyone who is not liable for the tax as a generator, network owner or voluntary tax payer or when the electricity is used by a party liable for the tax.  The main categories of taxpayer liable for energy and carbon tax on fuel are warehousekeepers, consignees and traders authorised by the Swedish Tax Agency132. Tax liability for fuel is normally incurred when it is supplied under duty suspension 133 and is therefore released for consumption or, in the case of authorised traders, when it is supplied to a buyer who is not an authorised trader or to its own sales outlet.  The Energy Tax Act gives rates of energy and carbon tax on fuel as an amount per quantity of fuel (krona and öre per litre, cubic metre or kg depending on the type of fuel). With the exception of the energy taxes on electrical energy, the information given below on tax based on energy content describes the typical energy-content equivalent of these levels of taxation or changes in these levels. The energy and carbon taxes on fuels have risen by 1629 öre/kWh between 1995 and 2019, depending on the type of fuel. The taxes vary depending on the type of fuel and the purpose for which it is used. A reduced rate is applied to some uses, including consumption for industrial manufacturing processes. In addition to these reduced taxes, a full exemption from energy and carbon tax on fuel used in some specific industrial process, such as metallurgical processes, can be granted under the Energy Tax Act. However, there is no tax reduction on the fuel consumption of a household that uses oil for heating. Table 9 shows the changes in energy and carbon tax on fossil fuels and electricity between 2012 and 2019. The biggest change is the diesel tax reduction of 13 öre/kWh between 2018 and 2019. This was a result of the removal of the tax exemption for low-level biodiesel blends. When the reduction obligation was introduced, the energy and carbon taxes on petrol and diesel were reduced to reflect the content of fossil carbon in the fuel blend, and to avoid the effects on the petrol and diesel price which had been seen when the tax on their biofuel content was introduced.  Table 9 shows the current rates of energy and carbon tax. The rates given for fuels are a result of changing to a different taxation unit from the one specified in the Energy Tax Act. The tax rates are shown here as an amount per quantity of energy (öre/kWh). The current rates for energy and carbon tax on fuel are laid down in Chapter 2, Sections 1, 1a, 1b, 3 and 4 of the Energy Tax Act. The tax rates are not fixed over time but are reviewed and                                                       131 Chapter 11, Section 5 of the Energy Tax Act (1994:1776). 132 Chapter 4, Sections 1 and 12 of the Energy Tax Act (1994:1776). 133 Duty suspension means the suspensive procedure referred to in Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC. 78 (199) changed annually to take account of changes in the consumer prices index. Since 2017, a flat rate of 2% has been charged in addition to the CPI adjustment to reflect the growth in GDP. This has maintained the guidance function of the taxes over time. Tax rates are also changed actively at other times. Applicable rates for 1 January to 30 June 2019 are given in the Ordinance (2018:1638) Establishing Energy and Carbon Tax Adjustments for 2019. Applicable rates for the second half of 2019 are given in Chapter 2, Section 1 of the Energy Tax Act.  Table 9 shows the current rates of energy tax on electricity. The current rate is given in Chapter 11, Section 3 of the Energy Tax Act. The tax rates are not fixed over time but are changed annually to take account of changes in the consumer prices index. The applicable rate for 2019 is given in the provision referred to above.  Table 9.

Full energy and carbon tax is paid on fuel used to generate heat charged on the energy price including taxes for households. VAT is generally deductible for companies. Electricity and fuel used to generate electricity are exempt from energy and carbon tax. The electricity generated is taxed instead. The amount of energy tax depends on where in the country the energy is consumed and for what purpose135. Other fuels besides petrol and high-tax oils used in industrial manufacturing processes outside the EU ETS are subject to 30% energy tax and 100% carbon tax. The same applies to fuels used for purposes other than operating motor vehicles or ships or boats in commercial agriculture, forestry or aquaculture. Fuels used for                                                       134 The Swedish Energy Agency  Energiindikatorer 2019 (ER 2019:11). 135 Electricity consumption in households and service companies in the following municipalities is subject to lower energy tax on electricity: all municipalities in the counties of Norrbotten, Västerbotten and Jämtland, Torsby in the county of Värmland, Sollefteå, Ånge and Örnsköldsvik in the county of Västernorrland, Ljusdal in the count of Gävleborgs and Malung-Sälen, Mora, Orsa and Älvdalen in the county of Dalarna. Electricity consumption in industrial manufacturing processes is also subject to a lower level of energy tax. 79 (199) industrial manufacturing processes within the EU ETS are subject to 30% energy tax and no carbon tax. Fuels other than crude tall oil and high-tax oil used within the EU ETS to generate heat for purposes other than industrial manufacturing are subject to 100% energy tax and 91% carbon tax. Different levels of taxation are applied to transport depending on the fuel, environmental classification and purpose of the vehicle. Low-tax diesel and fuel oils used in rail transport and in ships used for non-private purposes, and aviation gasoline and kerosene used for non-private purposes are exempt from energy and carbon tax. Aviation and marine fuel used for private purposes is taxed. Natural gas used as a fuel is subject to carbon tax but exempt from energy tax. Electricity used for rail transport is also exempt from tax.  On 1 July 2018, the tax reduction on low-level biofuel blends was removed and replaced with a reduction obligation. The petrol and diesel suppliers liable to pay tax are obliged to gradually increase the amount of biofuel in their fuels, which increases the price at the pump. To compensate for this, the tax on petrol and diesel was reduced. The overall pump price for petrol and diesel may however be higher. Pure biofuels or high-level blended biofuels are still completely exempt from tax.   The EU's minimum levels of taxation applicable to motor fuels are shown in Table A of Annex I to the Energy Tax Directive136. Table B of this annex shows minimum levels of taxation applicable to motor fuels used for the purposes set out in Article 8(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC. Table C of the annex shows minimum levels of taxation applicable to heating fuels and electricity. Article 15(3) of the Directive states that Member States may apply a level of taxation down to zero to fuels and electricity used for agricultural, horticultural or piscicultural works, levels or taxation are shown in Table 10 and Table 11.

Under Article 7(12) of the same Directive Member States must demonstrate that where there is an overlap in the impact of policy measures or individual actions, there is no double counting of energy savings.  Overview of the calculation of energy savings As described, Sweden intends to apply a wide range of complementary policies. Specific energy efficiency measures will be taken on the basis of the synergies between these policies.  To avoid the risk of double counting energy savings from different complementary policies, Sweden proposes to consider the effects of the different policies as a whole for calculation purposes. The fundamental principle of Swedish energy efficiency policy is that general energy and carbon taxes should be imposed to influence price signals. The cumulative specified in the Directive for calculating the effects of energy and carbon taxes. The calculations currently do not take account of reduction obligations. As they increase the fuel price at the pump, the effects of the                                                       137 The levels have been converted on the basis of the calorific value in the report Energiläget i siffror 20122013: SEK/EUR 8.6329. 81 (199) policy should perhaps be treated in the same way as a tax in future. The effects of the other, complementary policies described in Section 3 will therefore not be monitored and calculated as specified in Article 7a and 7b of the Energy Efficiency Directive. Sweden implements the obligation under the Directive to achieve national energy savings in the period 20142020 in a similar way. This approach to calculating and monitoring energy savings is applied only to the implementation of the provisions of Article 7, 7a and 7b of the Directive.  Method for calculating energy savings from taxes The Directive does not provide a detailed calculation method, but the provisions state that credit should be given only for energy savings from taxation measures exceeding the minimum levels of taxation applicable to fuels as required in the Energy Tax Directive or the VAT Directive138. Furthermore, price elasticities for the calculation of the impact of the taxation measures must be estimated on the basis of recent and representative official data.  Credit can therefore be given for the energy savings obtained from the price s minimum taxation levels. A simple way of calculating the energy saving is to multiply the price difference by the price elasticity and energy consumption.  Articles 7, 7a and 7b of the Energy Efficiency Directive do not require the cumulative energy saving to be achieved by new policies; however it must be achieved by new measures. These can be measures under new and/or existing policies. The levels of energy and carbon tax and VAT in Sweden long time. They contribute to energy savings by encouraging both changes in behaviour (for example driving less) and investments in energy efficient technologies (such as buying a more energy-efficient car). The start date used is a key factor when calculating the effects of policies. The energy efficiency measures taken in 2021 are an effect of the levels of taxation (and other policies) in 2021, but also those in 2020 and before. The taxes introduced in and after 2021 will have an effect beyond 2030.  Since Sweden estimated the effects of the taxes on energy saving in the period 20142020, 2014 should also be the start year for calculations for 20212030. To calculate the effect of taxes, energy savings in the period 20142030 should be evaluated counterfactually, in other words compared on the basis of an alternative scenario to reduce the levels of taxation to the                                                       138 Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax. 82 (199) Directive was originally introduced, for example to introduce an alternative policy in the form of white certificates. The guiding effect of the higher levels of taxation keeps energy consumption lower than the alternative scenario in which taxes are reduced. The cumulative energy savings are therefore the difference between the scenarios, which is the increased energy consumption resulting from educed taxes (see Figure 7). If we included effects in the period 20142030 of taxes introduced before 2014, the energy savings would be far higher, because the full effect of price differences would already have been achieved in 2014 and would have continued to be felt since that date. The levels of energy and carbon tax in Sweden are also regularly adjusted in line with the Consumer Prices Index (and in some cases also with increases in real earnings (GDP)), which maintains  and sometimes increases their guidance function even if prices in general rise. The guidance function of the taxes is therefore not eroded in real terms. They have been adjusted regularly to ensure this. As an example, energy taxes on electricity were increased on 1 July 2017 and 1 January 2019 as a result of the Energy Agreement.    83 (199) Figure 7. Energy saving as a result of differences between the level of taxation in Sweden and the minimum level of taxation.    Source Target Euse Twh Euse Twh EU EU SE SE  As stated above, the taxes increase prices both in the short- and the long-term. To capture this effect, the energy savings should be calculated dynamically and cumulatively as far as possible, taking account of both short- and long-term price elasticity.  As regards the use of long-term price elasticity, the calculation method does not assume that the full effect is achieved in the first year after the introduction of a tax increase. This is not a risk in a dynamic model, but if a dynamic model is not available, an assumption must be made about how long it will take to achieve the full effect and how the effect will develop over time. There are various ways of doing this. More detailed information about the calculation models, price elasticity etc. used to calculate energy savings achieved by Swedish policies in different sectors is given in the next section. The calculations are made for different fuels/energy sources in the housing and services (excluding agriscience businesses) and transport sectors.  In 2013, Runar Brännlund produced economic estimates of short- and long-term price elasticities for electricity consumption in the housing and services sector139 and petrol and diesel consumption in the transport sector140. The elasticities in these estimates are lower than those in previous estimates made in 2008141. The Swedish Energy Agency produced new estimates of short- and long-term price elasticities in 2019; these covered the period 19752017 for electricity consumption in housing and services and 19762017 for the                                                       139 Brännlund (2013) Bostadssektorns elefterfrågan i Sverige, Rapport till Finansdepartementet. 140 Brännlund (2013) The effects on energy saving from taxes on motor fuels: The Swedish case, CERE Working Paper 2013:6. 141 See Ett energieffektivare Sverige, SOU 2008:25, Annex 5. 84 (199) transport sector142. It based its estimates on the models used in 2013 for energy demand. The resulting price elasticities have been used for these effect calculations, as set out in the Swedish Energy Agency's memorandum143.  The actual final energy consumption data are used for calculation and future monitoring for 20142017. The final energy consumption for 2017 is then used for 20182030. The actual energy prices, taxes and VAT are used for 20142018144. The values for 2018 are then used for 20192030. All of these prices are expressed as fixed prices as at 2015. Actual conversion factors are used to convert petrol and diesel prices from SEK/litre to SEK/kWh and vice versa.  The minimum EU tax and VAT levels set out in the respective directives are used for the contrafactual reference scenario145taxation for each fuel has been converted to SEK/kWh at the current official exchange rate (see Table 10). This level is used for the whole of the period 2014normal taxation is 15%, as compared with the Swedish level of 25%. VAT at 146 and the lowest permitted level of normal taxation. The total minimum price has then been compared with the Swedish energy price including excise duty and VAT.  The effect of the price differences between excise duties and VAT in Sweden and the EU is calculated for each year. The price differences resulting from the above assumptions are the same as those for the years up to 2019, which produces the same annual, but preliminary, effect from that year onward.  Annex 2 contains descriptions and results of energy savings calculations in the housing and service and transport sectors. Full sources and data can be obtained from the Swedish Government Offices. The Swedish Energy Agency updates all of the data every year when new official statistics are published. It will also refine the calculation methods, as they currently underestimate the effects of the taxes. The calculations can be updated when Regulation147 is submitted.                                                       142 The Swedish Energy Authority's Memorandum, 2019: Beräkningsmetod för energi- och CO2-skatternas effekter på energianvändningen.

This exceeds the cumulative energy saving to be achieved by Sweden for those periods148. The Swedish Energy Agency updates all of the data every year when new official statistics are published.

Sweden will report its long-term renovation strategy under Article 2a of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive150 by 10 March 2020.  National Board of Housing, Building and Planning Building Regulations (BBR) The Planning and Building Act (2010:900) establishes requirements for buildings. The regulations apply both to new buildings and to alterations to buildings. The National Board of Housing, Building and Planning Building Regulations (BBR)151 contain detailed regulations under the Planning and Building Act for the design, accessibility and usability of housing, fire protection, hygiene, health, environment, water and waste management, noise protection, safe use and energy management.  The building regulations contain energy management requirements which specify the limits for energy consumption in buildings. One requirement sets limits for energy consumption in buildings (primary energy) expressed as kWh per square metre per year. This requirement covers energy for heating, comfort cooling, domestic hot water and domestic energy and is given for normal use of the building. The primary energy requirement is currently 90 kWh/m2 for small buildings, in other words one- and two-dwelling buildings, 85 kWh/m2 for multi-dwelling buildings and 80 kWh/m2 for non-residential buildings.  Support for renovation and energy efficiency measures in rented properties On 1 October 2016, support was introduced to encourage renovation and energy efficiency measures in rented properties in areas facing socio-economic challenges152.  The support is divided into two parts  one for renovation and one for energy efficiency. The renovation support, which is 20% of the costs, is given directly to the tenants as a rent rebate over seven years. The energy efficiency support is calculated on the basis of the energy saving achieved after the renovation. This part of the support is given to the property owner. To be eligible for this part of the support, the renovations must improve energy performance by at least 20%. Support cannot be sought for renovation or energy efficiency alone, as that does not fulfil the purpose of the measure153.                                                        150 Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings. 151 The National Board of Housing, Building and Planning regulations (BFS 2011:6, incl. amendments up to BFS 2018:15). 152 The Ordinance (2016:837) on Support for Renovation and Energy Efficiency Measures in Some Residential Areas. 153 The National Board of Housing, Building and Planning  Information om stöd till renovering och energieffektivisering i vissa bostadsområden (November 2016). 87 (199) budget for 2019154. SEK 165 million has been allocated to fund existing measures in 2020155.  The renovation, conversion and extension deduction The tax deduction for renovation, conversion and extension applies to the labour costs for house repairs, maintenance, conversions and extensions. It was introduced in 2008 to increase the supply of labour and reduce undeclared work156. Some of the measures covered also help to increase energy efficiency157. An obvious effect of the deduction is that it gives property owners an incentive to carry out more renovations. On 1 July 2016 the tax reduction was cut from 50% to 30% of the labour costs. The maximum support will now be SEK 50 000 per person per year. The facility is offered to owners of small buildings, owner-occupied apartments and holiday homes and to tenants.  The National Renovation Centre (NRC) The NRC works with businesses and academic institutions to improve knowledge and distribute information to operators in the building industry, to enable them to carry out renovations efficiently. The aim is to make existing buildings more environmentally, economically and socially sustainable from a life-cycle point of view, while improving or retaining their function so that they meet the requirements of users and the authorities158.  Renoveringsinfo.se information website The website renoveringsinfo.se is an initiative of the NRC and Svensk Byggtjänst AB. It aims to improve knowledge and distribute information to help operators in the industry to carry out renovations efficiently. The website collects opinion pieces, news, examples of renovation projects, research and comprehensive information on specific renovation measures. The news section is a subscriber service, but the other parts of the website are free.  The Sustainable Building Information Centre The Sustainable Building Information Centre was set up on 1 January 2018 and is run by Svensk Byggtjänst AB on behalf of the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning159. The Government has commissioned the operations and results on a regular basis. The contract expires in 2021 and                                                       154 Report 2018/19:CU1, Riksdag communication 2018/19:83. 155 Government bill 2019/20:1, Report 2019/20:CU1, Riksdag communication 2019/20:96. 156 Government bill 2006/07:94, Report 2006/07:Sk U15, Riksdag communication 2006/07:181 and Government bill 2008/09:97, Report 2008/09:FiU18, Riksdag communication 2008/09:183. 157 Owners of small buildings are entitled to a tax reduction for drilling and installation of geo-thermal heating systems, changing windows, doors and taps, installing additional insulation and installing and changing ventilation systems.

The first is to carry out initiatives in 20182020 to promote strategic work for the energy transition and reduced climate impact at local and regional work in dialogue with the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, the Swedish Transport Administration, the county councils and operators responsible for regional development on planning and implementing initiatives in the form of support to increase digital ways of working, cooperation on coordinated distribution of goods, town and country planning measures to improve transport efficiency, advice and education initiatives and financial support for measures or demonstrations programme for these two tasks, which distributes funds by means of public calls. The support programme aims to help local and regional public operators to contribute to the energy transition and reduced climate impact. strategically on integrating energy and climate matters into various areas of public-sector responsibility, including public procurement, town and country planning and improving transport efficiency. The 75 or so projects which have been given support must end by 2020. In 2019 and 2020 the Swedish Energy Agency will also arrange for the projects to exchange experience and share knowledge and produce guidelines and other knowledge aids for operators wishing to carry out similar work.                                                        160 https://ichb.se/. 89 (199) Since 2018, the county councils have been tasked by the Government with promoting, coordinating and leading the regional implementation of the Government's policies for the energy transition and reduced climate impact in the long-term. This involves:   leading and coordinating the development of new long-term regional energy and climate strategies based on the -term energy and climate policy in dialogue with operators in other county councils; and  coordinating measures to promote fossil-free transport and developing regional plans for infrastructure for electric vehicles and renewable fuels as part of its work on regional energy and climate strategies, in dialogue with the Swedish Energy Agency and the Swedish Transport Administration.  The regional strategies and plans were adopted in autumn 2019 and are now being implemented.  Dissemination of information To promote energy services, the Swedish Energy Agency is currently working as a contact point, providing relevant information to customers and suppliers on the internet. In its Performance-Based Energy Management project161, the Residenmodel contract for housing associations. The report Nulägesanalys av energitjänster med garanterad energibesparing i Sverige162 was produced in 2017.  The Energy Efficiency Council The Energy Efficiency Council is responsible for improving state cooperation and implementing and monitoring measures and instruments to part in implementing the Energy Efficiency Directive. The Council is an arena for addressing strategically important issues to improve cooperation within the Government and increase the transparency of energy efficiency, including public procurement and energy efficiency measures. It is an advisory body and meets four times a year.  3.2.1.4 Other planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030 as well as other objectives referred to in point 2.2 (for example measures to promote the exemplary role of public buildings and energy-efficient public procurement, measures to promote energy audits and energy management systems (2), consumer information and training measures (3), and other measures to promote energy efficiency (4)).                                                       161 https://energiradgivningen.se/lagenhet/malstyrd-energiforvaltning. 162 http://www.enveco.se/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Anthesis-Enveco-rapport-2017-13.- Nul%C3%A4gesanalys-av-energitj%C3%A4nster-med-garanterad-energibesparing-i-Sverige.pdf. 90 (199) Besides the energy efficiency provisions adopted at European level and implemented in Sweden, such as the Ecodesign Directive163, the Energy Labelling Regulation164, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive165 and the Energy Efficiency Directive166 the following policies and measures apply.  Sectoral energy efficiency strategies In 2017 the Government commissioned the Swedish Energy Agency to formulate sectoral energy efficiency strategies with various industries, in consultation with the relevant agencies. The sectoral strategies are designed to help Sweden to achieve the target of a 50% improvement in energy efficiency by 2030.  The aim of sectoral strategies is to set up a dialogue between the Swedish Energy Agency, various industries and relevant agencies at an early stage, to discuss indicative targets and measures in each sector and thus make a cost-effective contribution to achieving the national energy and climate objectives. This task was assigned to it under the Energy Agreement (see Section 1.2) and will continue until 2030. The sectoral strategies are described in Section 2.2.  Municipal energy and climate advisory services167 Energy and climate advisory services have existed in various forms for nearly 40 years. They were reviewed in 2015, and the Government decided to introduce new guidelines in the Ordinance (2016:385) on Contributions to Communal Energy and Climate Advisory Services. Advisory services provide impartial, free, technologically neutral and commercially independent advice to households, companies, housing associations and organisations. This can be done by telephone or email or face-to-face.  All municipalities can provide basic local energy and climate advice. Municipalities in remote areas can obtain additional coordination and travel support to allow them to provide these services. In addition to a basic advisory service, municipalities can run a more comprehensive energy and climate advisory service with additional financial support from the Swedish Energy Agency. The additional support can allow them to provide more advice and cooperate with other municipalities or work together on projects which focus on a local priority target group.                                                        163 Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-related products. 164 Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2017 setting a framework for energy labelling and repealing Directive 2010/30/EU. 165 Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings. 166 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, amending Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC. 167 http://www.energimyndigheten.se/energieffektivisering/program -och-uppdrag/kommunal-energi-och-klimatradgivning/. 91 (199) Environmental supervision and guidance for supervision The Environmental Code came into force in 1998. The Code increased the importance of energy management and the use of renewable energy sources by highlighting them in one of the rules for consideration which are its fundamental pillars. The Environmental Code specifies that all operators must manage energy and use primarily renewable energy sources. Operators must therefore:   find out how much energy they are using;  identify possible measures; and  take reasonable measures at all times.  The supervisory authorities must check that the management principles are being followed. They are also responsible for giving advice. The authorities have the right to request the information required for supervision, for example maps, analyses and measures. It is therefore particularly important to document energy management work. Under the Environmental Supervision Ordinance (2011:13), the Swedish Energy Agency has been of energy management and the use of renewable energy sources since 2011. The work involves supporting and advising operational supervisory authorities, municipalities and county councils and coordinating, monitoring and evaluating operational supervision.  Energy mapping in large companies The Energy Mapping (Large Companies) Act (2014:266) aims to promote energy efficiency. The Act is one of the ways in which Sweden meets the Directive168. The Act requires large companies to produce energy maps, which must contain information about their total energy consumption and suggestions for cost-effective ways of improving energy efficiency. Energy mapping must be carried out at least every four years.  The Energisteg programme Energisteg is a programme to support energy efficiency in industry and thus help to achieve the Energy Agreement target of a 50% improvement in energy efficiency by 2030. The programme has a total funding allocation of SEK 125 million and runs from 20182020. Industry accounts for a large proportion of Sweden's total energy consumption and the programme is targeted particularly at the mining and manufacturing industries.  Industrial companies that have produced an energy map under the Energy                                                       168 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, amending Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC. 92 (199) Mapping (Large Companies) Act, can seek two types of financial support: design support or investment support. Design support is a contribution to an in-depth design or study of energy efficiency measures. Investment support covers the additional cost of investing in energy efficiency measures identified by statutory energy mapping.  The European Regional Development Fund During the 20142020 programming period, the Commission allocated around SEK 2.8 billion (including national co-finance) to Sweden to shift towards a low-carbon ecdivided between eight regional and one national Regional Fund programme to encourage businesses, specifically small and medium-sized enterprises, to improve the energy efficiency of their operations and to contribute to innovative solutions in this area. More than 12 000 companies are expected to have received support through the projects funded up to now.  Energy efficiency support for small and medium-sized enterprises169 Since 2015, the Swedish Energy Agency has run initiatives to promote energy efficiency in small and medium-sized enterprises. The support is co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund via the National Regional Fund Programme. The Programme includes support to companies for energy mapping. Companies that have already mapped their energy use, but need to carry out in-depth analyses before making investment decisions, can apply for support for environmental studies. Companies can also apply for investment support for energy efficiency measures. Besides this financial support. small companies are also offered coaching and the opportunity to take part in regional business networks.  the shift towards a low-carbon economy in all sectors, aims to promote energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy in companies, along with research and innovation. The Priority Axis also aims to support the capital requirements of companies whose operations assist with the transition to a low-carbon economy.  The eight Swedish Regional Fund Programmes grant funding to projects specifically aimed at energy efficiency in small and medium-sized enterprises. The projects include cooperation between universities, companies and the public sector to improve the energy efficiency of small and medium-sized enterprises in the region.  Support for introduction to market, technology development and innovation clusters                                                       169 http://www.energimyndigheten.se/nrp/. 93 (199) Technology procurement is an instrument designed to initiate a transition in the market and to disseminate new, more efficient technologies and methods and new products, systems and processes. Network-based procurement for the development of technology is a method which covers the whole decision-making process, from the preliminary study and purchasing groups, to requirements specifications and the dissemination and further development of more energy-efficient technologies. It is used in areas such as heating and control, ventilation and lighting. The Swedish Energy Agency coordinates innovation clusters for cities (BeBo), commercial and public premises (BeLok), small house builders (BeSmå), public sector bodies renting premises (HyLok) and food distribution (BeLivs).  The aim of these purchaser groups and networks is to create a forum and a platform where the state, businesses and academic institutions can develop energy-efficient methods, produce good examples and give demonstrations etc. The networks test, introduce and evaluate new technologies, new models and new products and overcome knowledge barriers on the market. The networks also act as a platform for cooperation and engagement for various sector operators, agencies and academic institutions.  Energy declarations The Energy Declarations for Buildings Act (2006:985) came into force in 2006 and governs the use of energy declarations in Sweden. The National Board of Housing, Building and Planning has produced rules for implementing the Act and supervises the declarations and the independence of energy experts. An Energy Declaration must be prepared for buildings when they are built, sold or rented out and for large buildings often visited by the public. It is drawn up by an independent expert commissioned by the owners and is valid for 10 years.  An Energy Declaration contains informatioconsumption and is intended for future house buyers or tenants. Energy Declarations must provide buyers with information about energy consumption which they can take into account when buying a property. They must also contain any energy-saving measures suggested by the energy expert.  Energy Declarations were introduced 13 years ago and many early declarations have now expired as they are only valid for 10 years. New declarations have therefore been issued for many buildings in the past few years. In June 2019, 689 000 buildings with an Energy Declaration were database170.                                                       170 The National Board of Housing, Building and Planning. Trend  Energideklarationer 2009-07-01  2019-06-30. 94 (199)  Training programmes for low-energy buildings Since 2016, the Swedish Energy Agency, together with other operators, has been responsible for a range of capacity-building programmes for low energy consumption in buildings. The programmes are aimed at various operators in the building industry, such as architects, engineers, customers, technicians, installers, site managers and teachers of secondary school building courses.  Information initiatives The Swedish authorities, particularly the Swedish Energy Agency171, have developed web-based tools to disseminate information about energy consumption and energy efficiency to specific target groups. The information initiatives are targeted at households, companies and authorities.   Energikalkylen172 is a web-based calculation programme which provides households with information about energy efficiency.  Energilyftet173 is a free web-based training course on low-energy building aimed at customers, architects, engineers, building project managers, administrators and control technicians.  The Sustainable Building Information Centre174 was set up in December 2017 at the request of the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning and on the Government's initiative. The Centre is run by Svensk Byggtjänst AB in conjunction with IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute, Rise Research Institutes of Sweden AB, Energy Agencies of Sweden, The National Renovation Centre at the Lund University Faculty of Engineering (NRC) and Sustainable Innovation (SUST) and promotes energy-efficient renovation and building using sustainable materials which have a low climate impact from a life-cycle point of view. It is tasked with collecting information about sustainable building, adapting it to specific target groups and disseminating it and has published scientific reports and articles, produced guides to sustainable building and taken part in conferences.  3.2.1.5 Where applicable, a description of policies and measures to promote the role of local renewable energy communities in contributing to the implementation of policies and measures in points i, ii, iii and iv. The Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate is currently tasked with examining how the Internal Market for Electricity Directive should be                                                       171 https://www.energimyndigheten.se/energieffektivisering/. 172 http://energikalkylen.energimyndigheten.se/. 173 http://www.energimyndigheten.se/energieffektivisering/jag-arbetar-med-energieffektivisering/byggbranschen/energilyftet/. 174 https://www.ichb.se/, https://www.boverket.se/sv/byggande/uppdrag/informationscentrum-for-hallbart-byggande/. 95 (199) incorporated into Swedish legislation. At present there are no measures or policies for this.  3.2.1.6 Description of measures to develop measures to utilise energy efficiency potentials of gas and electricity infrastructure  Amendments to the Electricity Act The Electricity Act (1997:857) was amended in 2014 to comply with the requirements of the Internal Market for Electricity Directive. A provision was inserted into Chapter 3, Section 16a of the Act, which states that grid operators may not establish technical requirements or other conditions which hamper the provision of services in the form of altered electricity consumption, unless the conditions are justified in the interests of a secure, reliable and efficient network. This avoids the possibility of network tariffs preventing load levelling by balancing services, for example, and the purchase of additional services.  Provisions were also inserted into Chapter 4, Section 1 of the Electricity Act, stating that network tariffs must be compatible with efficient use of the grid and efficient generation and consumption of electricity. The Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate may issue regulations for network tariffs to promote effective use of the grid.  Regulatory model for network operators In 2014, an incentive to encourage energy efficiency was introduced into the economic regulation of grid operators175. The incentive gives a bonus to network operators that help to increase energy efficiency by reducing network losses and improving the utilisation of capacity a bonus.  3.2.1.7 Regional cooperation in this area, where applicable. Since 2018, the county councils have been tasked by the Government with promoting, coordinating and leading the regional implementation of the Government's policies for the energy transition and reduced climate impact in the long-term. This involves:   leading and coordinating the development of new long-term regional energy and climate strategies based on the -term energy and climate policy in dialogue with operators in other county councils; and  coordinating measures to promote fossil-free transport and developing regional plans for infrastructure for electric vehicles and renewable fuels as part of its work on regional energy and climate strategies, in dialogue with the Swedish                                                       175 Energimarknadsinspektionens föreskrifter (EIFS 2019:4) om vad som avses med kvaliteten i nätverksamheten och vad som avser med ett effektivt utnyttjande av elnätet vid fastställande av intäktsram. 96 (199) Energy Agency and the Swedish Transport Administration.  The regional strategies and plans were adopted in autumn 2019 and are now being implemented.  3.2.1.8 Financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds, in the area at national level. Besides the national financing measures described above, the following EU finance is relevant:  EU financial support for energy efficiency in buildings The EU promotes improvements in the energy performance of buildings with a range of financial support programmes. The Energy Efficiency Finance Facility (EEFF) was established in 2011 and offers facilities for loans, equity and guarantees and support for technical assistance for project development support.  The European Regional Development Fund The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) aims to improve economic and social cohesion within the EU by reducing regional differences. In 20142020, the ERDF rules require Member States to -carbon -2027, have not yet been established, but are likely to include comprehensive initiatives   During the 20142020 programming period, the Commission allocated around SEK 7.5 billion (including national co-finance) to Sweden for the Regional Funds; SEK 1.4 billion of this was intended for thematic objective -  EU funds for Thematic Objective 4 in 20142020 have been divided between eight regional programmes (SEK 8 million excluding co-finance) and one national Regional Fund programme (SEK 700 million excluding co-finance) to encourage businesses, specifically small and medium-sized enterprises, to improve the energy efficiency of their operations and to contribute to innovative solutions in this area.  The National Regional Fund Programme shift towards a low-efficiency and the use of renewable energy in companies, as well as research and innovation, and the application of low-carbon technologies. This 97 (199) priority axis is implemented as a national initiative to encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to improve their energy efficiency, which will make them more competitive on the market. The Priority Axis also aims to support the capital requirements of companies whose operations assist with the transition to a low-carbon economy.  The initiatives described below are run by the Swedish Energy Agency to enable companies throughout the country to improve their energy efficiency.  Energy mapping support Small and medium-sized enterprises have been entitled to apply for financial support for energy mapping since 2010 to improve their energy efficiency176. Energy mapping should include energy maps, suggestions for measures and an energy plan. Each company can apply for 50% of the cost of energy mapping, up to a maximum of SEK 50 000.  Energy efficiency networks The Swedish Energy Agency launched a network project for small and medium-sized enterprises in 2015. The project aims to operate 40 networks comprising 400 companies in all, and to help them to introduce energy management principles with the assistance of regional coordinators and energy experts. Sharing experience and learning from each other through the networks are also important factors for success. The network activities aim to reduce the energy consumption of participating companies by 15%. This new opportunities for growth.  Development of technologies and innovation Investment support for energy-efficiency measures. Some measures identified by energy mapping may be expensive but necessary for the company to achieve the higher level of energy efficiency. Companies can apply for investment support for up to 50% of the additional cost of these investments.  Energy-efficiency incentives Advice for small and medium-sized companies subject to supervision under the Environmental Code. The supervision officers of the county councils and municipalities give companies advice on supervision to enable them to go beyond the legal requirements.  Dissemination of information about energy services The Swedish Energy Agency has specific initiatives to promote energy                                                       176 The Ordinance (2009:1577) on State Support for the Production of Biogas. 98 (199) services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It carries out these initiatives in conjunction with industry organisations, energy management agencies and county councils all around the country to reach both customers and suppliers of energy services. Activities include a variety of seminars, workshops and network meetings.  Energy and climate coaches The Energy and Climate Coaches project is a national initiative aimed particularly at small and medium-sized enterprises with an annual energy consumption of less than 300 megawatt hours (MWh).  The programme, which is free to participants, combines individual coaching with group lectures and exchanges of information between companies. The coaching activities aim to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The benefits to the companies are lower costs and improved competitiveness.  The municipalities are entitled to apply for funding for a part-time energy and climate coach.177 Around 130 municipalities currently have coaches, which means that coaching can be provided locally. The programme started in January 2017 and continued until 2019.  Other activities under the National Regional Fund Programme. ClimateSync knowledge support is run jointly by the Swedish Energy Agency and the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth to support all of the initiatives in Thematic Objective 4; it includes mapping, project manager meetings, results work, learning processes and dissemination activities.  Green Funds are equity funds for investment in start-ups providing products and services to reduce climate impact. Green Funds are managed by ALMI Invest AB.  Regional Structural Funds Programme Within the eight Swedish regional ERDF programmes, more than 20 projects aimed specifically at energy efficiency in small and medium-sized enterprises have been granted finance in 2014-2020. The projects include cooperation between universities, companies and the public sector (regions, municipalities etc.) aimed at improving the energy efficiency of small and medium-sized companies in the region.                                                        177 The Ordinance (2016:385) on Contributions to Municipal Energy and Climate Advisory Services. 99 (199) Besides these energy efficiency projects for small and medium-sized enterprises, finance has so far been granted to around 150 projects for:   research and innovation: low-carbon technology;  sustainable building;  sustainable transport;  renewable energy in small and medium-sized enterprises; and  business support
