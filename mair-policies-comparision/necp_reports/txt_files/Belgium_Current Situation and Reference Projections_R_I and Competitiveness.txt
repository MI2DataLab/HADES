Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness i. Current situation of the low-carbon-technologies sector and, to the extent possible, its position on the global market  Wallonia has not yet adopted any legislation specifying research objectives in the energy sector. The available budgets and calls for projects are updated on a regular basis in order to guarantee free competition between the different research goals. However, the following calls for projects form an exception to this rule: - ERABLE (2011), which related to energy generation methods and energy efficiency; - RELIABLE (2012), which related to smart grids; - ENERGINSERE (2013), which related to energy storage; - calls for projects in 2015 and 2016 aimed at funding research projects in connection with the International Energy Agency (IEA) and supporting regional energy projects. 101 These calls for projects had a total budget of EUR 26.5 million and were mainly prompted by European initiatives to boost research activity in the field of technology. More specifically, research in Wallonia is supported through the Decree of 3 July 2008 on support for research, development and innovation in Wallonia and its implementing decrees. This legislation serves as a general framework for supporting research and outlines the arrangements for valuing research projects at regional level, which is vital for obtaining research grants). All support is researched through the mechanisms identified in the decree. A total annual budget of around EUR 340 million (2016) is earmarked within budget for the various types of support (subsidy, co-financing or repayable advances). Coordination with European research programmes is firstly ensured by the Department for Research Programmes within the Walloon Public Service for Research, whose Directorate for Federal and International Programmes manages the programmes that are co-financed by the EU (ERA-NET, ERA-NET+, etc.). Secondly, projects are promoted by the National Contact Point (NCP) for Wallonia, whose tasks are carried out under contract by the Union wallonne des Entreprises (Walloon Union of Companies). The annual budget earmarked for European co-financing programmes is around EUR 7 million for all research areas combined. In terms of energy, the ERA-NET programmes and the -ERA.NET Cofund EGSysRegion. Technology Initiative. Likewise, MecaTech (2006) and GreenWin (2010) Clusters have been established under the Marshall Plan with the aim of assisting technological development stakeholders and supporting research and innovation projects in the fields of mechanical engineering and green chemistry. TWEED (Technology of Wallonia for Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development), Cap Construction and Eco-Construction clusters promote innovation and economic development among the relevant stakeholders.  ii. Current level of public and private research and innovation spending on low-carbon-technologies, current number of patents, and current number of researchers (48) Figure 20 - d of energy by type (1999-2017)   Public spending, which was less than EUR 10 million between 1999 and 2006, rose to almost EUR 60 million in 2012 and has now stabilised at between EUR 35 million and EUR 40 million.                                                            48 Budget/Expenditure Statistics). 102 The majority is aimed at energy efficiency, which has accounted for around two thirds of the total since 2012. This involves the energy efficiency of all sectors (industry, residential, transport, other). Around 250 FTE researchers are working in universities, colleges and research institutions. The research budget of private operators is difficult to assess, but could be around EUR 200 million per year. Existing policies and measures are based on the Decree of 3 July 2008 on support for research, development and innovation in Wallonia, under which themed calls for projects, aid information pointsand bottom-up funding of research presented by businesses are organised. This allows the Walloon research, innovation and competitiveness budget to be maintained at around EUR 43 million per year (2012-2017 average).  iii. Description of energy subsidies, including for fossil fuels Calculating subsidies for fossil fuels is the subject of much debate and many different methods. There are two types of subsidy in Belgium: - direct funding of fossil fuels; - tax rebates. Fossil fuel subsidies are relatively limited at regional level. Aid for residential gas condensing boilers has recently been abolished. An exhaustive survey has also been carried out as part of the reporting under the relevant directives (RES, EE and grid).
