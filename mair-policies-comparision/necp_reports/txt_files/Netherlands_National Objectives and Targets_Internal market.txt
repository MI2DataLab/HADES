Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030     2.4 Internal energy market dimension 2.4.1 Electricity interconnection: the level of electricity interconnection the Member State wishes to achieve by 2030, related to the interconnection target for electricity of at least 15% by 2030 An indicative interconnection target of 15% was agreed in the European Council for 2030. The Netherlands has already had an interconnection percentage in excess of 15 % for some time. In the next ten years, interconnection capacity is expected to double from a nominal 5.9 GW in 2017 to 9.8 GW in 2025. The Netherlands does not have a specific quantitative target for interconnection. In the event of any plans for new interconnectors, the welfare effects (including effects on the supply security of electricity) will be examined for each interconnector, as will the projected costs. 2.4.2 Infrastructure for energy transmission: most important projects for electricity and gas transmission infrastructure and projects for its modernisation In order to accommodate the growth in the number of renewable energy generating plants (both on land and offshore), sufficient capacity must be created on the electricity network of regional and national grid operators in a timely manner. Timely and integral spatial planning, in which energy infrastructure is taken into consideration from the start, is more important than ever. Infrastructure for transporting, converting and storing electricity, natural gas, biogas, hydrogen, CO2 and heat will also have to be coordinated so that the spatial impact and the total investment required are kept to a minimum. To this end, regional and national grid operators will work on an integrated Energy Infrastructure Outlook 2030-2050 and Investment Plans will be drawn up detailing the investments needed to achieve the objectives and to continue to guarantee affordability, security of supply and reliability. In parallel, it will be explored whether, and if so how, scope and incentives should be created for grid operators regarding anticipatory investments in network infrastructure that support the energy transition and the timely achievement of the targets. We will also look at how new possibilities such as the use of flexibility, energy storage, supply and demand coordination and congestion management can make the best possible use of the available space on the network at the lowest social costs. In addition, consideration will be given to the way in which the costs of the energy infrastructure are charged and, where necessary, proposals for adjustments will be made. In the field of electricity, investments are being made to increase the domestic capacity of the national grid. The Randstad 380 kV Noordring grid project will be completed in 2019. Various related sub-projects have already been completed. Furthermore, expansion of the grid capacity in the north-west of the Netherlands is being prepared (the Noord-West 380 kV project), because the Eemshaven region is an important production location and has also become a major switch point in the international electricity network. In addition, the Zuid-West 380 kV grid project aims to resolve existing bottlenecks in this part of the country. The Dutch electricity market is linked to four (five as from 2019) neighbouring countries. In the next ten years, interconnection capacity is expected to double from 5.55 GW in 2016 to 10.8 GW in 2025. With regard to the connection of the offshore wind farms, TenneT's approach includes standard platforms whereby 700 MW of wind energy capacity can be connected per platform. The five projects of Borssele Alpha, Borssele Beta, Hollandse Kust (zuid) Alpha, Hollandse Kust (zuid) Beta and Hollandse Kust (noord) will be connected between 2019 and 2023. The Netherlands' gas transmission and distribution infrastructure is mature and robust and therefore no major projects are planned. The only exception is the construction of a new, large-scale nitrogen plant that will allow 5 to 7 billion mÂ³ of high-calorific gas to be converted into low-calorific gas every year. Furthermore, a survey is being conducted into the extent to which industry that still currently uses low-calorific gas can switch to another, wherever possible sustainable, form of energy. If this leads to a transition to the use of high-calorific gas, then investments in the high-calorific gas Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    transport network will be required. The size of these investments can only be estimated once it is clear which companies are to make this transition and how they are situated in relation to the existing high-calorific transport network.65 The government has also announced its work on the National Agenda for Charging Infrastructure (Nationale Agenda Laadinfrastructuur).66 The agenda provides an overview of the required charging infrastructure and outlines the frameworks within which this infrastructure is to be rolled out. This also applies to other fuel types, such as LNG, hydrogen and biofuels, within the context of the recalibration of the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive (AFID). 2.4.3 Market integration i. Increasing the system's flexibility The Netherlands considers additional flexibility to be necessary in the system as a result of the continued increase of intermittent sources in the electricity system. The Netherlands will organise market regulation in the coming years via the legislative agenda, so that flexibility (also for small consumers) can be increased even further and small consumers get better access to the market and are rewarded in accordance with the market. To this end small consumers could be supplied with an aggregator. The Netherlands is focusing on rolling out smart meters, to allow consumers to respond more effectively to real-time prices.67 Further flexibility will be created by the introduction of dynamic tariffs on the retail market. There is already a high degree of flexibility in the system, thanks, for example, to large-scale consumers, which are flexible and can respond to real-time prices by connecting, calibrating or disconnecting, and parties with storage assets that offer them on the different markets. Where necessary, any obstacles to storage will be eradicated.68 The Independent Grid Management Act (Wet Onafhankelijk Netbeheer) guarantees the independence of grid management, to facilitate fair competition on supply and wholesale markets, and to increase the systems' reliability. Competition between various providers on the energy market benefits the degree of affordability. In addition, the system of "programme responsibility" or balance responsibility ensures that suppliers and consumers themselves maintain the balance of supply and demand on the energy market. They receive an economic incentive to implement the deliveries and purchases agreed.69 ii. Non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage in all energy markets In general, the Dutch government strives for frameworks for the electricity market that encourage fair competition between market parties and do not discriminate against any one party. This includes parties that provide renewable energy, demand response and storage, including through aggregation. No separate, national objectives have been formulated for this purpose. iii. Consumer participation in the energy system, self-generation and new technologies, including smart meters No specific targets apply in this regard, except the target for 80% of Dutch small consumers of electricity and gas to be supplied with a smart meter by 2020. Overall the Netherlands' aim is to ensure that consumers are able to optimally benefit from competition on the energy market, to make conscious choices and receive fair remuneration for investments in self-                                                 65 Letter to Parliament on Gas Extraction in Groningen, Parliamentary document 33 529, no. 457. 66 Government assessment of the Climate Agreement Mobility sectoral platform, 5 October 2018, Appendix to Parliamentary document 32 813, no. 220. 67 Stimulating Renewable Energy Production - Parliamentary document 31 239, no. 263. 68 Legislative agenda, Parliamentary document II, 2017-2018, 30 196, no. 566. 69 Memorandum following the report  Amendment to the Gas Act (Gaswet) and the Electricity Act 1998 (Elektriciteitswet 1998) concerning strengthening the operation of the gas market, improving the security of supply and establishing rules on the priority of sustainable electricity, as well as a number of other amendments to these Acts  Parliamentary document 31 904, no. 7. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    generation. No separate, national objectives have been formulated for this purpose. Furthermore, consumers in a competitive Dutch market are able to choose from an abundance of diverse types of providers. Suppliers offer different types of contracts, such as contracts for the supply of 100% renewable energy, the supply of 100% renewable electricity of Dutch origin, etc. There are currently 58 different licensed providers who often offer multiple options operating on the Dutch retail market. The Netherlands also has a relatively high percentage of annual switchers (16% in 2017), with half of all consumers having switched supplier at least once in the last three years. In addition, a growing number of consumers have begun feeding in electricity to the grid, for which they are remunerated through the net-metering scheme. This scheme will eventually be replaced by a feed-in grant (after 2020).70 iv. Safeguarding the adequacy of the electricity system and the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy generation The Netherlands expects an efficient and effective electricity market to provide the market parties with the right incentives to invest in production capacity where and when needed - in other words, an energy-only market. In addition, the Netherlands has a large number of interconnectors with neighbouring countries, which also allow Dutch electricity demand to be satisfied. In addition to affordability and sustainability, reliability is also an important objective of Dutch policy. The competitive electricity market contributes to this, including through the system of programme responsibility and the imbalance market. Stimulating renewable electricity could have an effect on the level of security of supply. The energy supply is becoming increasingly dependent on weather conditions. The growth in the share of intermittent sources will result in an increase in the demand for flexibility on the market. The Netherlands already has a high degree of flexibility, which allows it to respond to the elimination of supply and demand in a way that is in line with market conditions. The Netherlands does not have separate targets related to increasing flexibility in the system. The required flexibility could take the form of interconnection, demand side response (including hybridisation), storage and adjustable generation. The analysis and inventory of options demonstrates that developments in the energy system potentially offer enough options in the short term to cope with the demand for flexibility. A mix of different sources of flexibility is needed to cope with long-term flexibility, including adjustable capacity. The adjustable capacity will increasingly have to be CO2-free as of 2030. There are several potential options available in this regard: CO2-free hydrogen, renewable sources such as biomass and green gas, nuclear power and the use of fossil sources in which the CO2 is captured. As the government indicated in its letter dated 6 November 201871, nuclear power is one of the options for the future energy mix. A number of studies reveal that for 2050, nuclear power could be a cost-effective option and that a positive business case could be one of the long-term options. Given the lead times, additional nuclear power for 2030 does not seem likely in the Netherlands. Specifically with regard to thorium, research in this area is still at a fundamental phase and introduction to the market is not yet expected over the next few decades. The use of biomass is viewed within a broader sustainability framework, which is discussed in more detail in section 2.3.3. Although the electricity market is adequately equipped to achieve the required flexibility, it is important to continue to properly monitor the development of flexibility, including adjustable power. The annual monitoring of supply security is being fine-tuned by TenneT for this purpose72.                                                 70 Further elaboration of phasing out the net-metering scheme - Letter to Parliamentary document 31 239, no. 305. 71 Parliamentary document 32 645, no. 89. 72 Monitoring Leveringszekerheid (Monitoring Security of Supply), 2017, TenneT, https://www.tennet.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/Company/Publications/Technical_Publications/Dutch/Rapport_Monitoring_Leveringszekerheid_2017_web.pdf Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    v. Consumer protection and the competitiveness of the retail energy sector No specific objectives have been formulated in this regard. The Dutch government strives to establish frameworks for the electricity market that encourage fair competition between market parties and do not discriminate against any one party, including parties that offer renewable energy, demand response and storage, including through aggregation. The regulatory authority monitors developments on the small consumer market on an annual basis. The Dutch retail market is highly competitive with relatively high switch percentages (16%). Last year, some 1.3 million households switched to a new supplier. A supply licence must be requested to supply small consumers. The NRA monitors these licences. The licence obligations are regulated, for example, by Chapter 8 of the Electricity Act 1998 and include an assessment of how reasonable the tariffs are. Since mid-2018, 59 providers operate on the Dutch retail market with a licence to supply electricity and/or gas to small consumers. Dutch consumers are also protected against disconnection in the winter months and in the event a supplier goes bankrupt. As described above, the Netherlands has a licence system for supplying energy to small consumers. If a supply licence is revoked, for example, due to bankruptcy, the customers of the supplier concerned would theoretically have to be disconnected immediately if they had not taken any action themselves. After all, these customers would no longer have a valid supply contract because they may only be supplied by a licence holder. In practice, these types of quick disconnections are socially undesirable. Therefore, first and foremost, rules and regulations on this matter include the possibility for the licence holder to sell part or the entire customer base to one or more other licence holders prior to the actual withdrawal of the supply licence. If the licence holder is unsuccessful, in part or otherwise, the remaining small consumers who stand to lose their provider upon the withdrawal of the supply licence will be divided between the other licensed providers. As such, all providers who supply small consumers on the market collectively function as an emergency supplier. This scheme applies both to electricity73 and to gas74. The national grid operators for electricity (TenneT) and gas (GTS) respectively play a major and coordinating role in this regard. 2.4.4 Energy poverty i. Policy objectives in the field of general energy poverty The Netherlands has no specific objectives related to energy poverty. Support for households with a lower income forms part of policy to combat poverty, which is ultimately part of general social policy. Central government as well as municipalities take measures to prevent poverty as much as possible. This is achieved by central government through, for example, compensating healthcare costs for people with a low income. And through measures to maintain the purchasing power of people with a low income. Efforts made by municipalities focus on preventing or eradicating problems related to poverty and debt among people as much as possible. The municipality can help people on a low income in different ways. For example, via:  General benefits and special benefits (welfare);  Discounts for people on the minimum wage, such as city passes that entitle the holder to discounts for sport and culture-related activities;  Exemption from municipal taxes;  Minimum collective healthcare insurance (CZM);  The individual study allowance;  The individual income allowance;  Schemes for children, such as the child package and facilities for sport or culture, so that all children can participate regardless of their family circumstances;  The prevention of debt and debt assistance. Together with the VNG, the government has formulated four ambitions related to child poverty. For example, the aim of all parties is to reach virtually every child in poverty by 2021, so that every child growing up in a low-income family can participate. Extra attention is devoted to employed people with children, living in poverty. This represents a large group                                                  73 Security of Supply for Electricity Decree, Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 2006, 104. 74 Security of Supply for Gas Act Decree, Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 2004, 170. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    that has not been adequately reached. Moreover, in the next few years the government is focusing on reducing the number of households with children having to cope with a low income. To achieve this we are increasing the disposable income of parents on a low wage. Working, and working more hours, will also be more rewarding. This will be achieved by increasing the general tax exemption, the employed person's tax credit and child allowance. Growing up with prospects involves more than income alone, and this is why we want to regularly gather information about children living in poverty. What is it like for a child living in poverty? And how can we better support these children? We see many initiatives throughout the country. We are going to bundle good examples so we can learn from each other. Based on the above ambitions, the government aims to obtain an insight into child poverty every two years. The government will discuss the outcomes with the ministers involved, with children, the VNG and other relevant parties. Although there is no specific policy in the field of energy poverty, there is a scheme that prevents people who cannot pay their energy bill (or pay it on time) from being disconnected (Rules Governing the Disconnection Policy for Small Consumers of Electricity and Gas).75 To prevent payment arrears accruing without finding a solution, the regulation stipulates that energy companies must actively point out the possibility of debt assistance. Payment arrears related to the energy bill can be an early sign of (possibly imminent) problematic debts. This is in line with the intended amendment of the Municipal Debt Assistance Act, which aims, among other things, to make the exchange of personal data easier so that timely detection is possible. Payment arrears on fixed costs in particular, including energy, are examined, because practical experience shows that these are effective predictors for the early identification of debts
