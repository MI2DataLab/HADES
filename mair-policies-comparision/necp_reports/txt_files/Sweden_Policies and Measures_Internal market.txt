The level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030 in consideration of the electricity interconnection target for 2030 of at least 15%, with a strategy with the level from 2021 onwards defined in close cooperation with the Member States affected, taking into account the 2020 interconnection target of 10% and the indicators of the urgency of action based on price differential in the wholesale market, nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors in relation to peak load and to installed renewable generation capacity as set out in point 2.4.1 of Section A of Part I of Annex I. Each new interconnector shall be subject to a socioeconomic and environmental cost-benefit analysis and implemented only if the potential benefits outweigh the costs.  2. Key electricity and gas transmission infrastructure projects, and, where relevant, modernisation projects, that are necessary for the achievement of objectives and targets under the five dimensions of the Energy Union.  3. National objectives related to other aspects of the internal energy market such as: increasing system flexibility, in particular through policies and measures related to market-based price formation in compliance with applicable law; market integration and coupling, aiming to increase the tradeable capacity of existing interconnectors, smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment and real-time price signals, including a timeframe for when the objectives should be met, and other national objectives related to the internal energy market as set out in point 2.4.3 of Section A of Part 1 of Annex I  As described in Section 2.4, the Swedish interconnectivity level in target of 15% by 2030. Svenska kraftnät is building connections to other countries on the basis of socio-economic cost-benefit assessments.  A third AC connection to Finland is currently in the design phase and the Hansa Powerbridge to Germany is part of the current network development plan. Planned and new connections are analysed every other year, when   3.4.1.2 Regional cooperation in this area Svenska kraftnät cooperates with other European national grid companies through the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E). It contributes to various ENTSO-E products such as the Ten Year Development Plan (TYNDP) and is also a member of various ENTSO-E working groups. 105 (199)  It also produces joint Nordic network development plans with the other Nordic national grid companies every other year. The last plan, which was published in August 2019194194, describes planned and current projects.  3.4.1.3 Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds The planned AC connection195 (400 kV) between Sweden (SE1) and Finland has PCI status196 and is therefore eligible for funding from the EU. This is being handled by Fingrid (the Finnish transmission system operator).  3.4.2 Energy transmission infrastructure  3.4.2.1 Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.2, including, where applicable, specific measures to enable the delivery of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and other key infrastructure projects. Removing regular bottlenecks from the national grid is a continuous process. Regional and local network companies are responsible for their own parts of the grid. Regular bottlenecks are removed if that is worthwhile from a socio-economic point of view. However there is no justification for reinforcing the grid to the point where bottlenecks never occur. Reinforcing the grid to minimise bottlenecks is a long-term measure.  3.4.2.2 Regional cooperation in this area See Section 3.4.1.2.  3.4.2.3 Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds A new scheme197 was introduced on 1 May 2015 which allows regional network companies to apply for grid reinforcement loans. The aim of the new regulation is to enable large renewable generation projects to connect to the grid.  The grid reinforcement loan is a temporary solution to allow regional network companies to obtain a loan from Svenska kraftnät under certain circumstances. The loan covers the grid reinforcement costs that facilitate future connection of electricity generation. This means that an operator connecting to the grid only needs to pay the costs of the capacity required for its own project, which was not the case with previous regulations.                                                        194 Statnett, Fingrid, Energinet, Svenska kraftnät  Nordic Grid Development Plan 2019. 195 https://www.svk.se/natutveckling/stamnatsprojekt/messaure-keminmaa/. 196 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/infrastructure/projects-common-interest. 197 The Ordinance (2015:213) on Loans to Network Companies for the Connection of Renewable Generation. 106 (199) 3.4.3 Market integration  3.4.3.1 Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.3 Sweden does not have any national targets for market integration, as stated in Section 2.4.3. While there are no national targets, the measures for market integration are described in more detail below.  3.4.3.2 Measures to increase the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production such as smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, real-time price signals, including the roll-out of intraday market coupling and cross-border balancing markets. An electricity market with a higher proportion of renewable generation in the form of wind and solar power also presents greater challenges for the electricity system. Domestic customers and industries can help to meet some of the challenges by being flexible in their use of electricity. A flexible electricity system is essential for maintaining the balance between production and consumption. Those responsible for the balance hold the key to this, since they have an incentive to reduce their costs by increasing the flexibility of resources under market conditions. In a future electricity market with a higher share of renewable and variable electricity generation, it will be words flexible production and storage, and demand response.  The SmartGrid Forum has produced a strategy198 to increase flexibility in the electricity system with smart grids. Four areas have been identified which need to be developed to achieve this. These four areas combined are essential for the development of services and products to stimulate flexibility in the electricity system. The Forum has produced 20 recommendations for activities in the following four areas:   establishing the conditions for new business models for flexible services;  developing the markets for system services;  carrying out IT-security and integrity measures; and  carrying out information and awareness-raising measures. Sweden participates in Nordic and international cooperation on demand response. The Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate monitors developments in demand response continuously to ensure there is scope for it in the regulations. It has proposed a range of measures to facilitate and accelerate the development of demand response at the Government's request199. Many of these measures have been implemented. The measures implemented or                                                       198 http://www.swedishsmartgrid.se/globalassets/publikationer/slutrapport_flex_14sept.pdf. 199 The Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate  Åtgärder för ökad efterfrågeflexibilitet i det svenska elsystemet (Ei 2016:15). 107 (199) approved are described below.  Work is being carried out in accordance with the network codes on shorter settlement periods and developed price setting for imbalances. This may give operators more of an incentive to develop business models for explicit demand response. Explicit demand response means that customers are compensated for using more or less electricity during a particular period. The energy released in this way can be offered in different marketplaces (for example intraday or balancing power markets) or used for other purposes (for example for local networks). Flexibility is therefore priced in the electricity system.  To enable customers to adapt their electricity consumption to hourly variations in the electricity price, they must be sent a price signal by means of an hourly price contract, for example; this is known as implicit demand response. An hourly price contract means that customers are charged for their actual hourly consumption rather than at a flat rate for their consumption profile. Hourly price contracts give customers a genuine opportunity and incentive to control their consumption, so that they use more electricity when the price is low and less when the price is high. Two measures have been implemented to promote hourly price contracts.  The Ordinance (1999:716) on the Measurement, Calculation and Reporting of Transmitted Electricity (the Measurement Ordinance) has been amended to remove flat-rate settlement for customers with an hourly price contract from 1 January 2020. In addition to this, hourly rate contracts will be included in Elpriskollen  the Swedish Energy Market Inspectorate's price comparison website. This will be done by including variable hourly rate 200 about electrand conditions applicable to consumers. Showing these contracts on Elpriskollen will create new opportunities for Swedish consumers to choose this type of contract.  3.4.3.3 Where applicable, measures to ensure the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets. There are no specific measures, as discrimination is not permitted in the Nordic electricity system.  3.4.3.4 Policies and measures to protect consumers, especially vulnerable and, where applicable, energy poor consumers, and to improve the competitiveness and contestability of the retail energy                                                       200 Energimarknadsinspektionens föreskrifter och allmänna råd (EIFS 2013:7) om elleverantörers skyldighet att lämna uppgift om priser och leveransvillkor som tillämpas mot elanvändare. 108 (199) market. The Swedish definition of vulnerable customers is set out in the Ordinance (2016:742) containing Instructions for the Swedish Energy Markets permanently lack the means to pay for the electricity or natural gas transmitted or delivered to them for non-of consumer is protected on the Swedish electricity and natural gas markets by a right to receive financial assistance for payment of bills. The Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate has estimated that around 20 000 consumers can be classified as vulnerable customers.  Both the Electricity Act (1997:857) and the Natural Gas Act (2005:403) also contain provisions which protect consumers at risk of being disconnected from the electricity or natural gas network for non-payment or another serious breach of their contract. These provisions require companies to follow a particular statutory procedure before disconnecting them. This includes providing them with accurate information, giving them the opportunity to comply without disconnecting them and notifying social services in the municipality where they live before they are disconnected.  The Energy Markets Inspectorate also runs a price comparison website, www.elpriskollen.se, to immarket and access to objective information. Consumers can use it to compare prices and conditions under the most common contracts offered by all electricity suppliers. The opportunity to compare prices and other factors which may influence the choice of electricity supplier is essential for encouraging active customer engagement and hence demand response.  In a future electricity market with a higher share of variable electricity generation in the form of wind and solar power, it will be important to utilise all of the flexibility resources in the electricity system, in other words flexible production and storage, and demand response.  3.4.3.5 Description of measures to enable and develop demand response, including those addressing tariffs to support dynamic pricing. Since 2018, grid operators have been able to test new tariffs as part of a pilot project under Chapter 4, Section 4a4b of the Electricity Act (1997:857). In its report Åtgärder för ökad efterfrågeflexibilitet i det svenska elsystemet (Ei R 2016:15) the Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate concluded that network tariffs are an effective tool for exploiting the available customer demand response.  Under the new provisions of the Electricity Act, grid operators are able to 109 (199) test tariffs that use demand response to encourage more efficient use of the network on a small number of customers in a customer category. This allows them to test and develop the tariffs to encourage the type of flexibility needed in their own network area.  The provisions are an exception to the requirement for uniform network tariffs. However, the tariffs must still be objective and non-discriminatory and must be compatible with efficient use of the grid and efficient generation and consumption of electricity.  On 2 October 2018, the Government decided to amend the Electricity Ordinance (2013:208). The amendments allow the Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate to issue rules for designing network tariffs to promote efficient use of the grid. It has begun drafting these rules. The work is expected to be completed in Spring 2020. The Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate may also issue rules for the customer information to be provided by grid operators explaining their charges and telling customers how they can influence their costs by changing the conditions or patterns of consumption. It is planning to start work on these rules in 2020.  3.4.4 Energy poverty  3.4.4.1 Where applicable, policies and measures to achieve the objectives set out in point 2.4.4. Not applicable as energy poverty is not an element of social policy.  3.5 Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness  3.5.1 Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.5  Policies for research and innovation Energy research policies are set out in the Government bill on Research and Innovation for Sustainability, Competitiveness and Security of Supply in the Energy Sector (Government bill 2016/17:66) and are implemented by the energy-related activities under the National Energy Research and Innovation Programme. They complement the policies presented in the Government bill A Cooperative Approach to Knowledge  and Enhancing Competitiveness (Government bill 2016/17:50).  These bills set out the policy and the budget for the next four years and similar bills have been presented every four years. The next Government bill on the energy research and innovation policy
