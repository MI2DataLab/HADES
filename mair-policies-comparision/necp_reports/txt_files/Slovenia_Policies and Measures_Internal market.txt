Ensuring conditions for effective market development Economic incentives, elimination of normative barriers MZI, Borzen, distribution companies with operator, Energy Agency, Eco fund, MOP  Developing the Flexibility Market by introducing pilot platforms for Flexibility Trading and producing studies of integrating the new market with existing organised markets [in 2021];  development, testing and deployment of new business models and services in connection with new roles in the 109 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   market (active customer, aggregator), in particular with regard to controlling the operation of the distribution network: development of services for the implementation of non-frequency system services on distribution networks (independent aggregation) [in 2021];  to revise the NMS deployment plan by 2025 by taking into account the requirements of EU legislation and technological development [in 2021] and to implement the NMS on the basis of an updated plan [in 2023];  encourage investment in certain advanced client devices (advanced bottling firms, storage tanks, etc.) [in 2020];  launch campaigns to raise customer awareness of their more active role [2020-2025];  ensure the establishment of centralised, standardised data services based on measurement data from NMS in B2B and B2C domains (national data hub) to promote the competitiveness and participation of active customers in the energy market. Ensuring the conditions for accelerated development of the electricity distribution network economic MZI, Energy Agency, distribution companies with operator, SVRK  Establish targeting of RES investments and electric vehicle charging stations in areas where no major additional investments are needed in the network (mapping of areas with options for generating electricity from RES and for on-site consumption, proximity to TS and DTS, etc.). [in 2020];  promote RES investments in combination with local storage of adequate capacity in PDS areas where RES integration is problematic [in 2020];  upgrade the methodological approach to distribution network planning and carry out a study on a new approach to the construction of medium- and low-voltage networks [in 2021];  determine, where appropriate, financial resources to increase investments in the electricity distribution network, e.g. in the form of a specific contribution to the adaptation of the distribution network for the transition to a climate-neutral society, to integrate more heat pumps, accelerate the deployment of e-mobility and integrate renewable electricity generation facilities;  a renewed regulatory framework for development-oriented networking that will provide sufficient resources to cover all eligible operating and maintenance costs and an adequate 110 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   regulated return on the assets that make up electricity infrastructure [in 2021];  a renewed regulatory framework for network charging that will adequately support the development and achievement of climate targets [in 2021];  to provide the conditions or the enabling environment for the transition from pilot or demonstration projects (or research and innovation) to the phase of investment in new technologies, due to the above activities in connection with the new approach to planning and action plans [in 2022];  encourage the involvement of electricity distribution companies, transmission and distribution operators in order to establish effective coordination mechanisms for efficient market purchasing of flexibility (system services) [in 2022];    111 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA     Name and description of the instrument Type of instrument Responsibility Activities and deadlines     amending the statutory provision to allow the EDP management and control bodies to create more other reserves from profits, which would mean even more of the company's own resources earmarked for additional investments in electricity infrastructure [in 2021];  provide access to green EU funds (under the cohesion policy of the 2021-2027 financial period) to adapt the electricity distribution network to the transition to a climate-neutral society [in 2022]. Development incentives for decarbonisation of gas supply legislative, economic MZI, Borzen, Energy Agency  Encourage early implementation of pilot projects (Power 2 gas, biogas injection, etc.) for the construction of renewable gas production units in the natural gas network [in 2021];  analyse and implement incentive tax and excise policies to promote decarbonisation in gas supply [in 2021];  prepare a regulatory and support environment for renewable gas in the natural gas network [in 2022];  determine the target shares of RES gas in the grid by 2030 in the next NEPN update based on an analysis of the results of pilot projects, market developments and market conditions and the regulatory and supportive environment for the supply of renewable gas to the gas network [in 2024]. A supportive environment for alleviating energy poverty the legislature, action plan MDDSZ, MZI, SVRK, MOP  To define energy poverty and the obligation to periodically measure the energy poverty dimension (estimates of the number of energy-poor households in the country) by 2021 [in 2021];  define clearly how energy poverty is measured based on the definition of energy poverty - define an operational definition to statistically measure the phenomenon that will enable the measurement of energy poverty and set a measurable target in future [in 2021];  based on the measured indicator in the baseline year, to set energy indicators for the future in the area of energy poverty, with the aim of not increasing energy poverty despite the planned measures in the energy and climate field [in 2021]; 112 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA    keep under review whether existing general social and housing policies and targeted energy poverty measures are meeting the target;  Develop an action plan to tackle energy poverty, improve and increase the range of instruments available and, if necessary, identify additional measures [in 2022].
