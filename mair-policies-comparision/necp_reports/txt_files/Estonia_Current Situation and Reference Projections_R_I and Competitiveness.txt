The number of gas purchasers in the retail market was ca 49.3 thousand customers, including 47.2 thousand household consumers. The rate of changing electricity trader by consumers averaged 12%. Five operators had a gas import licence, of which two actually imported gas in 2017. There were a total of 24 distribution system operators (the total length of the network was 2,131 km), and the market share of the biggest system operator was 82% (for 1,483 km of the distribution system). A total of 41 operators acted as gas sellers. The majority sold gas in their own network area. Seven persons operated actively as sellers, and the market share of the largest was 92%. In Estonia, six undertakings acted as balance responsible parties. ii. Projections of development with existing policies and measures until at least 2040 (including for the year 2030). The prices of electricity and gas as electricity carriers are formed on the respective markets (e.g. the Nord Pool power exchange for electricity). Measures applied in Estonia do not impact the prices of electricity and gas as energy carriers.  The research, innovation and competitiveness dimension i. The current situation of the low-carbon-technologies sector and, to the extent possible, its position on the global market (that analysis is to be carried out at Union or global level) Europe has taken a leading role in global climate action to achieve an economy emitting near-zero GHG emissions. This relies on a safe and sustainable energy supply that is supported by a market-based and trans-European approach. The energy system of the future involves electricity, gas, heating/cooling and mobile systems as well as markets. Citizens are at the centre of the system with the support of smart networks. The transition requires the introduction of further technological innovations in the energy, construction, transport, industrial and agricultural sectors. This can be accelerated with revolutionary solutions in digital, information and communication technologies, artificial intelligence and biotechnology. It will also be necessary to expand the systems and processes that cover cross-sectoral cooperation (e.g. circular economy). Technologies in which Europe sees potential include the production of synthetic gases and liquids with the help of renewable electricity, decentralisation of the energy system based on renewable energy sources, digital technology and smart grids, industrial processes, the capture and transformation of carbon into new products when burning fuels, expanding the use of biomass, carbon sequestration from this biomass, and circular bioeconomy201. The coming years will see a breakthrough in the energy and carbon storage sectors. Regarding energy storage, Estonia is already on the global map as the home of 202, with                                                            201  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0773&from=EN  202 Skeleton Technologies https://www.skeletontech.com/ultracapacitor-technology production units in Germany and development in Tallinn. While energy storage in batteries takes place as a chemical reaction, in ultracapacitors it takes place electrostatically. Ultracapacitors have been under development for more than a decade, but a major breakthrough came with the introduction of graphene use. Ultracapacitors as energy storage have a long lifetime (one million charging cycles, where batteries have several thousand charging cycles) and are 30% more energy efficient than batteries. They are used in motor sport (Formula 1 cars), the space industry, shipping, heavy industry, renewable energy, the automotive industry and the transport sector.  While ultracapacitors are mainly used in industry, the energy router and storage device developed as a prototype by the Tallinn University of Technology in 2018 is suitable for managing energy flow in households203. Comparing various electricity storage technologies, today lithium-ion batteries are the best batteries in regard of price, lifetime and technological indicators. The capacity of lithium-ion batteries was 1,629 MW in 2018, with a projected increase of 1,200 GW by 2050. Lithium-ion batteries are used in industry, such as the 100 MW Tesla, but also in electricity networks, e.g. in Australia and Texas. Lead-acid batteries have a short lifetime. Zinc-hybrid cathode technology is under development. The innovation of sodium metal halide and sodium-sulphur batteries is  unclear and they are not expected before 2025. However, Japan has made use of sodium-sulphur batteries to stabilise wind energy. A total of 450 MW of sodium-sulphur batteries have been installed all over the world, mainly produced by the Japanese company NGK Insulators. These batteries have a high operating temperature and hence are suitable only as non-mobile solutions. Pumped-storage plants, compressed-air storage, flywheel energy storage and ultracapacitors are more mature technologies, but a major change in their prices is not predicted for the coming years. Pumped-storage plants have been installed mainly by rivers to store solar and wind electrical energy to balance electricity supply when sunshine or wind is lacking and to cover peak demand. Pumped-storage stations comprise 97%204 of the total installed energy storage capacity worldwide. 270 pumped-storage stations have been installed or are being built around the world. For example, the oldest station in the USA was built in 1929 and the station with the highest capacity is at over 3000 MW205. By 2017, pumped-storage stations had been installed with a total capacity of 153 GW and stationary batteries with a capacity of 5 GW. These stations are mainly located in Europe, China, Japan and the US. A total of 26 GW of pumped-storage stations will be added in the next five years (including 18 GW in China, with the network operators mainly belonging to the state). New stations in Europe will be built in Switzerland, Portugal, Austria, the UK and Germany. A total of 650 MW of                                                            203 TalTech power electronics of the Electrical Power Engineering and Mechatronics Institute have developed innovative solutions for use and storage of renewable energy in households. https://www.ttu.ee/taltechi-energeetikud-naitavad-uudseid-lahendusi-taastuvenergia-kasutamiseks 204 Hydrowires 2019 Energy Storage Technology and Cost Characterization Report https://www.sandia.gov/ess-ssl/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PNNL_mjp_Storage-Cost-and-Performance-Characterization-Report_Final.pdf 205 PSH - The Nation's Largest Energy Storage Resource https://www.hydro.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-NHA-Pumped-Storage-Report.pdf capacity will be added in Morocco and Israel. A total of 146 TWh of electricity will be produced at pumped-storage stations in 2023206. Two pumped-storage plants planned in Estonia will be unlike those elsewhere, which are built mainly on rivers. Another option in energy storage is hydrogen and hydrogen fuels. Today, hydrogen is mainly produced from natural gas and coal and used mainly in petroleum refining and the production of fertilisers. The current use of hydrogen on the basis of fossil fuels contributes to carbon emissions equivalent to the total emissions of Indonesia and the UK. To switch to clean energy, it is necessary to both store the carbon that accompanies hydrogen from fossil fuels and increase the hydrogen stock obtained from renewable electricity. Based on its analysis, the IEA has estimated that by 2030 the cost of producing hydrogen from renewable electricity will be reduced by 30%. Hydrogen could be one of the main options for storing renewable energy and one of the most affordable ways to store energy for days, weeks or even months. Hydrogen and hydrogen fuels can be transported thousands of kilometres from regions with favourable sun and wind conditions to energy-hungry cities. The transition to clean energy also requires the use of hydrogen from renewable energy in transport, buildings and electricity generation, including making hydrogen available also to users. The main obstacle to the development of a clean hydrogen industry is the current lack of regulation. Industrial ports should be the main development centres for clean hydrogen, in order to provide it to ships and other vehicles. The existing gas transmission network is suitable for the delivery of hydrogen207.  Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technology today enables carbon capture in industry and the burning of fuels, its transport by ship or pipeline, its use in products and services and its storage deep underground. Today, 30 million tCO2/year is captured, but according to projections, this volume could be 2.3 billion tCO2 in 2040, representing 7% of the required reduction in cumulative emissions208.  According to current knowledge, Estonia does not have suitable geological conditions for storing CO2209. The country is carrying out a study entitled main objective is to assess the suitability of different carbon capture technologies and develop scenarios for implementing these technologies in the Estonian oil shale industry. It also analyses the environmental impact of the most effective solutions and the technological and economic capacity of the industrial sector to use the captured CO2. The economic analysis focuses on the difference in unit costs of the most appropriate capture technologies, sensitivity to carbon quotas and electricity prices, and the need to subsidise investments, as well as the export potential of the captured CO2.

Current level of public and, where available, private research and innovation spending on low-carbon-technologies, current number of patents, and current number of researchers  strategic research and development support under the RITA programme. TalTech conducted t 950,000. The research was financed by the European Regional Development Fund and the Estonian state. This study looked at what pre-requisites allow the cost-efficient creation and operation of carbon capture technologies and whether and under what conditions it would be possible to use CO2 as an input in Estonian industry or whether it is economically viable to export this secondary raw material for use in the industrial sectors of other countries. The results of the study provide input to companies in the Estonian industrial sector, universities and research institutions for further research work and also to the national authorities and institutions for planning processes. iii. Breakdown of current price elements that make up the main three price components (energy, network, taxes/levies) a) Electrical energy Final electricity prices largely depend on the voltage level of connection points. Network prices depend of the voltage level of the connection point  a higher voltage at the connection point means a lower investment cost for the network operator. Hence the price of a higher voltage level network service is lower than the network price of a lower voltage level. On that basis, Estonian consumers can be divided into three categories in relation to the final electricity price: household consumers (low voltage connection points), industrial consumers (connected at a voltage of 110 kV), and large-scale consumers (connected at 330 kV). The components of the final electricity price in 2018 by the consumer groups indicated above are shown in Figure 44. Figure 44 Price components by consumer group in 2018     Electrical energy  Renewable energy fee  Network service (average)   Electricity excise duty  VAT       Electrical energy  Network service (average)   Electricity excise duty  Renewable energy fee  VAT   Large-  Electrical energy  Network service (average)   Electricity excise duty  Renewable energy fee  VAT Electricity excise duty in Estonia is largely the same for all customers - has established a lower rate of excise duty for electro-intensive consumers, or consumers whose electro-intensity exceeds 20% and whose energy management system complies with ISO 50001. A lower  Another important component of the final electricity price is the renewable energy fee, which is used to finance a national support scheme for electricity generated from renewable energy sources. Considering that the largest producers of electrical energy from renewable energy sources will start to leave the support scheme from 2021, a significant reduction in the renewable energy fee can be expected in the near future. The state has also made the support scheme for electricity from renewable energy sources reverse auction-based, which in turn reduces the pressure on the renewable energy fee. b) Natural gas Gas consumption has halved in Estonia in recent years. The main reason is the reduction of gaseous fuels in the generation of electrical energy and heat due to the relatively high and at times unstable final price of natural gas. The bulk of the final gas price consists of the price of gas as a product, followed by state fees and the network service fee. The components of the final gas price 2018 are shown in Figure 45. ousand m3) of natural gas in 2018   Network service  Gas  Excise duty  VAT The price of natural gas forms the largest component of the final price. VAT is uniform in Estonia, at 20%. Gas excise duty is largely the same for all consumers, but a lower excise duty rate is applied for gas-intensive consumers. The general level of excise duty 33. A lower excise duty rate can be applied for persons whose gas consumption intensity is at least 13% and whose energy management system complies with ISO 50001. In that case, the gas excise duty rate is 11.30 3. iv. Description of energy subsidies, including for fossil fuels None of the measures under this plan (see Annex IV) offer financial support for the deployment of fossil fuels. Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 does not define the concept of energy subsidies, but according to recital 20 of the Regulation, Member States may base themselves on definitions of energy subsidies used by international organisations. According to the OECD, energy subsidies are measures which, because of their existence, result in cheaper or higher energy consumption in a certain market segment compared to an energy market that operates without interventions. On 1 January 2019, the fee rate levels for the right to extract energy from mineral resources and the corresponding heavy fuel oil price levels changed in Estonia. The widening of the price range between the fee rates and heavy fuel oil prices stemmed from the objective of maximising state revenue at very high heavy fuel oil prices. The fees for the right to extract energy from mineral resources were linked to the evolution of oil prices on the world market in order to align the price of competing fossil fuels to ensure the availability of energy supplies to the consumers. The fee rates will increase  361 per tonne. This is due to the fact that if companies recoup variable costs as well as capital costs, then each subsequent euro is essentially net income and it is also possible for the state to collect more state revenue from its assets. Restrictions on the use of peat for energy purposes include requirements on combustion plants. The burning of peat is required in a certain volume, for example in co-combustion with wood, for ensuring the technical condition of the boiler. Energy consumption subsidies for consumers are minimal in Estonia. Energy subsidies are available for natural and legal persons. Energy subsidies for natural persons People with subsistence difficulties have access to subsistence support, which takes into account the household's housing costs, including the cost of heat or fuel consumed for heating purposes. Local authorities lay down the conditions for calculating these housing costs. The authority may establish limits on costs by regulation, such as a maximum amount of energy costs. Issues relating to energy poverty are more thoroughly described in chapters 2.4.4 and 3.3.4.i. Estonia does not impose excise duty on solid fuel (coal, peat briquettes, firewood etc.) used as fuel by households. The main fuel used by households in Estonia is wood and wood-based fuels, the consumption of which accounted for 86% of the fuel used for heating by households in 2017, according to Statistics Estonia. As wood and wood-based fuels are not taxed in any sector in Estonia, the exemption from excise duty of wood and wood-based fuels does not qualify as an energy subsidy. Despite the excise duty exemption on fossil fuels used by households, the quantities of fossil solid fuels used by natural persons are modest. According to Statistics Estonia, fossil fuels accounted for 0.6% of household heating fuels in 2017. Energy subsidies for legal persons Estonia has gradually reduced energy subsidies for legal persons. An overview of energy subsidies for legal persons in 2016 is shown in the following table (see Table 35). Table 35.
