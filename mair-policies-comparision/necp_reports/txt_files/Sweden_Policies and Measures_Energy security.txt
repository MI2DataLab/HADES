3.3 Dimension energy security  3.3.1 Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.3.  Electricity supply  Measures for power cuts preparedness authority for withstand severe stresses. It ensures that measures are taken to improve preparedness, that there are trained personnel and that resources are available to carry out repairs and provide communication equipment. For the funding of preparedness measures, see Section 3.3.3.  Network owners are obliged to ensure that power cuts last for no more than 24 hours (see also Section 2.3) unless they are caused by factors beyond their control178. If a power cut lasts for more than 12 hours, customers are entitled to compensation179.  Measures are also taken to increase public awareness of suitable preparedness measures at home to alleviate the effects of power cuts180.  Measures for electricity shortages Crisis management measures have been prepared both to prevent electricity shortages and to alleviate the effects of any shortages. The measures include a national information campaign to encourage consumers to reduce their consumption voluntarily to avoid shortages. If this is not sufficient, there are plans for a possible rationing system in the future. The Swedish Energy Agency is the agency in charge of measures to deal with electricity shortages.                                                        178 Chapter 3, Section 9a of the Electricity Act (1997:857). 179 Chapter 3, Section 9a of the Electricity Act (1997:857). 180 http://www.energimyndigheten.se/trygg-energiforsorjning/nar-det-blir-el--eller-varmeavbrott-i-ditt-hem/. 100 (199) Measures for capacity shortages Capacity shortages must be avoided because market operators act in balance. The Swedish system operator, Svenska kraftnät, has a number of technical and commercial mechanisms which it can use to maintain the balance in the electricity system if this is not sufficient.  The capacity reserve can be used if the balance cannot be restored by ordinary measures. To create the capacity reserve, Svenska kraftnät sets up agreements with electricity generators and consumers to maintain a specific generation capacity or reduce their consumption.  If these mechanisms are not sufficient to remedy the problem, load shedding (manual disconnection) is the last resort; that means disconnecting some consumers to avoid system collapse. Styrel, a method for planning and prioritising socially important electricity consumers, has been developed to alleviate the consequences for society181.  The Government has commissioned the county councils in Skåne, Stockholm, Västra Götaland and Uppsala to carry out a local and regional analysis of the conditions for a secure electricity supply in their respective regions. The aim is to find ways of improving coordination between the regional and local operators to increase the efficiency of network supply. The county councils must collect information and views from relevant local and regional operators, such as municipalities and grid operators, to obtain a good basis for their analysis of the local and regional capacity requirements. They must also identify, and coordinate with, national initiatives and projects and work which is important for their assessments for the particular area. They must submit a report to the Swedish Government Offices (Infrastructure Department) by 07 August 2020.  Gas supply The Security of Gas Supply Regulation182 contains operational requirements for security of the gas supply. On the basis of the Regulation and the Swedish  legislation183 a risk assessment had been carried out which forms the basis for a national preventive action plan184 and national crisis management plan. In addition to these plans, the Swedish Energy Agency has also produced regulations and general advice185, which contain certain requirements for natural gas companies and major natural gas consumers. The requirements                                                       181 The Ordinance (2011:931) on Planning to Prioritise Socially Important Electricity Consumers. 182 Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2017 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and repealing Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 183 Act (2012: 273) on the Security of the Natural Gas Supply and the Ordinance (2012:275) on the Security of the Natural Gas Supply. 184  185 national gas supply. 101 (199) aim to increase preparedness for any future gas supply crises and thus secure the supply of gas to domestic customers, who have special protection under the Security of Gas Supply Regulation. The Regulation specifies that the competent authorities must oblige natural gas companies to take measures to secure the gas supply to protected customers in the following circumstances:   when temperatures are extreme for seven days which, statistically, happens once every 20 years;  when there is an exceptional demand for gas for a period of 30 days which, statistically, happens once every twenty years; and  when the largest single gas infrastructure is interrupted for 30 days under average winter conditions  Oil supply The IEA Agreement186 and the Oil Stocks Directive187 oblige Sweden to hold Agency determines the size of the oil stocks once a year; it also establishes who is responsible for holding them and how large individual stocks should be. The extent of the storage obligation is based on the sales or consumption of the party obliged to hold them during the previous reference year. A stock year runs from 1 April to 31 March of the following year. From 2020, the stock year will change to 1 July to 30 June of the following year. The emergency stocks include biofuels if they are blended with stored fuel on sale or consumption, or if they are stored in Sweden and the party obliged to store them can demonstrate that they are intended for blending with stored fuel and will be used for transport.  Information security  Implementation of the NIS Directive The NIS Directive188 on information security has been transposed into Swedish legislation by the (2018:1174) Socially Important and Digital Services (Information Security) Act and the accompanying Ordinance and regulations.  The purpose of the Information Security (Socially Important and Digital Services) Act is to achieve a high level of network and information-system security for socially important services in the energy, transport, banking, financial market infrastructure, health, drinking water supply and distribution, digital infrastructure and digital services sectors. The Swedish                                                       186 The International Energy Agencys Agreement on an International Energy Programme. 187 Council Directive 2009/119/EG of 14 September 2009 imposing an obligation on Member States to maintain minimum stocks of crude oil and/or petroleum products. 188 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union. 102 (199) Civil Contingencies Agency coordinates the work under the Act and the individual sectors have dedicated supervisory authorities. In short, the Act obliges suppliers of socially important services to register with the supervisory authorities, to report incidents and to carry out systematic information security work.  The Government has appointed the Swedish Energy Agency as the supervisory authority for the energy sector in Sweden under the Act. The Agency is therefore required to supervise suppliers of socially important services in the energy sector to ensure that they comply with the Act and the associated regulations. It is also responsible for providing information and training about information security and risk and continuity management. It is currently developing regulations for risk analysis and security measures for the energy sector. The Agency provides training on legislation, threats and risk analysis.   The National Digitisation Strategy189 policy. The vision is sustainable digitisation in Sweden. The overall objective is to make Sweden the world leader in exploiting the possibilities of digitisation. Reliable people with good digital skills have the opportunity to drive innovation, which requires strong leadership and good infrastructure. The strategy contains five subsidiary objectives for digital competence, digital security, digital innovation and digital infrastructure to help achieve the overall objective. The subsidiary objectives show how digitisation will benefit social development.  National strategy for information and cybersecurity The Government has also presented a national strategy for developing and improving information and cybersecurity in Sweden190. The strategy sets out objectives in six priority areas to create permanent conditions which will allow social operators to work effectively on information and cybersecurity and raise awareness and improve knowledge throughout society.  3.3.2 Regional cooperation in this area The security supply work and crisis management measures are based on the geographical extent of the market. Since the oil and fuel markets are global, cooperation on crisis management measures is also global, partly within the IEA. The risk of a potential oil or fuel shortage is analysed both in Sweden and in the EU, by the IEA. The IEA assesses the severity of an interruption to the market supply and analyses how much of the emergency stocks should be used to cover it. It can suggest measures, including collective                                                       189 https://www.regeringen.se/49adea/contentassets/5429e024be6847fc907b786ab954228f/digitaliseringsstrategin_slutlig_170518-2.pdf. 190 https://www.regeringen.se/49f639/contentassets/04c9e2929f474f14bb05f182e7054c87/faktablad -en- nationell-strategi-for-samhallets-informations--och-cybersakerhet.pdf. 103 (199) measures, but Sweden is responsible for deciding on the measures to be taken.  Since the Swedish electricity system is linked to the other Nordic countries, the Nordic region works together on crisis management measures. NordBER is a forum for cooperation between the Nordic energy and electricity preparedness authorities and system operators on electricity preparedness. Two Swedish agencies, the Swedish Energy Agency and Svenska kraftnät, are members.  Sweden and Denmark have cooperated on gas supply for many years. The 191 formalises regional cooperation by dividing Member States into different regional risk groups so that they can produce joint regional risk assessments to improve cooperation on disruption which affects the region. Sweden is in three of these groups192. The transmission network operators in Sweden and Denmark have set up a joint balancing zone which will increase regional cooperation.  3.3.3 Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds Svenska kraftnät is given a budget allocation for preparedness measures. Some of this allocation is also used for administrative costs linked to its role as the authority in charge of preparedness, funding for research and information related to its duty to promote the securdefences. The annual allocation is normally equivalent to the electrical preparedness charge paid by the grid operators (SEK 255 million in 2018193).  The crisis management measures aim to prevent, resist and manage disruption of the electricity supply which may place the country under severe strain. Examples include technical reinforcement measures, increased physical protection of vital installations, strong IT-security and the acquisition of resources for repair and training
