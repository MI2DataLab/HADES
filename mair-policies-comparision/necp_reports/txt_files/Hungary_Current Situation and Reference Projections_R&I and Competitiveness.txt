 4.6. Dimension of research, innovation and competitiveness i. Current situation of the low-carbon-technologies sector and, to the extent possible, its position on the global market (that analysis is to be carried out at Union or global level) In 2017, R&D expenditures accounted of an average of 2.06 % of the GDP in EU Member States. This ratio is 1.35 % (1.53 % in 2018) in Hungary  0.71 percentage points less than the EU average  placing Hungary 13th in the Member State ranking. Between 2010 and 2017, Hungary climbed five places in the ranking of GDP-proportionate R&D expenditures.211 Current key priorities of energy R&D in Hungary: energy efficiency, energy production, renewable energy, alternative propulsion in transport; distribution, transmission and storage of energy, nuclear development - consistently with improved energy security and reduced dependence on energy imports. The main directions of RDI were defined on the basis of the distribution of State R&D+D expenditures and the distribution of R&D aids awarded under tendering schemes, taking into account that the Government does not possess accurate information on private investments. The distribution of State R&D+D expenditures was reviewed on the basis of data provided to the IEA.

Efficiency research and development was the key R&D field. In the 20162018 period, development expenditures aimed at improving energy efficiency accounted for one half of total energy research financing. The share of renewable sources of energy within expenditures already reached 19 % (only 5 % in 2010) in the average of the three reviewed years. The category of other cost-cutting technologies also equalled a share of 19 % in the same period. Nuclear energy, fossil fuels, and hydrogen and fuel cells each accounted for 1 % of total R&D expenditures, while the Hungarian State spent around one tenth of funds on developing other electricity generation and storage technologies. In international comparison, the share of Hungarian expenditures spent on renewable energy approximates the average share within the EU (EU average in 2018: 27.4 %, Hungarian value: 26.3 %).

In 2014, the HIPA was involved in 60 awarded investment projects. The total value of the investments equalled 1.662 billion EUR. Based on projects of the year 2014, around one half of investment volume was related to the automotive industry (868.14 m EUR). The second largest volume of investment targeted the renewable energy sector (199 m EUR).221 The HIPA notes that in the field of electromobility  a technology of the near future  Hungary has a special position not only in the region, but in the whole of Europe. Hungary is not only leading in major R&D capacities relating to electric power trains (AVL, Bosch, Thyssenkrupp), but is also top-ranked in battery manufacturing; among the five largest Asian companies manufacturing batteries for electric vehicles, three chose Hungary as the seat of their European manufacturing centres: Samsung SDI, SK Innovation and GS Yuasa. After the above decisions, suppliers of major producers are also targeting Hungary (e.g. Bumchun, Doosan, INZI Controls, Shinheung, Toray).222 ii. Current level of public and, where available, private research and innovation spending on low-carbon-technologies, current number of patents, and current number of researchers R&D financing In 2018 the amount of Hungarian R&D expenditures (public and private) exceeded HUF 654 billion, amounting to 1.53 % of the GDP. In the same year a little over HUF 129 billion was spent on R&D from R&D targeted funds of the State budget.223 In 2018, 4.4 % of public R&D expenditures were directly related to energy; this ratio was 2.1 % for total R&D expenditures (including private expenditures). In the                                                       221 HIPA (2015): Hungarian investment promotion is also successful in a regional comparison. Press release.

The above segment was followed by development investments in efficient systems (28 %). The report estimated the share of renewable energy sources at 17 %. Staff size in R&D A database is not available for the size of R&D staff exclusively focussing on energy development. The Central Statistical Office (CSO) only aggregates the number of researchers at companies classified in the category of electricity, gas and steam supply, air conditioning. In 2018 there were only 62 researchers, developers employed full-time in this field. In Hungary data relating to research staff size are collected mainly in the breakdown of scientific disciplines (and not industrial sectors). The background to RDI in energy is primarily, but not exclusively based on researchers working in the fields of technology and natural sciences. In 2018, 17 902 researchers in technology and 10 870 researchers in natural sciences were registered. Results in a given scientific field can be utilised in several economic sectors.

Breakdown of current price elements that make up the main three price components (energy, network, taxes/levies) Electricity prices Owing to price controls, Hungarian retail electricity prices are among the lowest in the European                                                       228 European Patent Office 229 https://stats.oecd.org  Union. The second lowest retail electricity price  behind Bulgaria  was registered in Hungary in 2018. The energy fee (40.2 %) and network access fee (38.6 %) account for the largest share of retail electricity prices. The tax component in Hungary is very low (21.2 %).  Figure 73  Household electricity prices in 2018 (all consumption bands)  Source: Eurostat HU EN Energia Energy Rendszerhasználati díj Network access fee Adók és egyéb díjak Taxes and other fees  On the retail market, industrial (non-household) electricity prices are significantly lower than household prices. The figures below illustrate differences in price composition among Member States.

The taxes and levies on electricity are low for industrial consumers for competitiveness reasons, and the share of the payable network access fee is also lower compared to retail prices. Price of natural gas While electricity prices are partly determined by fossil fuel prices (together with other, typically national or regional price factors), natural gas prices are based exclusively on global fossil fuel  including oil  prices. Owing to price controls, Hungarian retail natural gas prices are among the lowest in Europe. In 2018 prices were lower only in Romania. Taking into account that most Hungarian households heat with natural gas, a low tax component is essential. Retail prices are therefore determined to a significant degree by wholesale product prices. In Hungary the price of energy makes up one half of the gas price. In 2018 the network access fee and taxes accounted for 26 % and 21 % of the price, respectively. The figure below shows components of the retail natural gas price.

Description of energy subsidies, including for fossil fuels Efficient renewable subsidies also available to alternative technologies The feed-in system (FIS) was introduced to encourage electricity generation from renewable energy sources and waste, where electricity may be sold with a statutory feed-in tariff that is higher than the market price. Due to legislative changes, however, new FIS subsidy eligibility is no longer granted for applications lodged after 31 December 2016. The REAS scheme, serving the subsidisation of electricity generated from renewable energy sources233, entered into effect on 1 January 2017; it was extended and modified as a result of legislative changes in October and November of 2017. Chapter 3.2.1 provides information on the REAS. Financing programmes of the EU relating to renewable energy and the NRDI Fund financed by Hungary indirectly support investments in the sector (for details see point i. of this chapter). The Warm Home                                                       232 consumption category: 100 000 GJ999 999 GJ 233 Decree No 13/2017 of 8 November 2017 of the HEA on operating aid provided for electricity generated from renewable energy sources.  Programme is also worth noting, which has so far supported Hungarian households in upgrading building energy performance in the value of around HUF 26 billion. Fossil fuels do not receive direct subsidies in Hungary. Products and services on the market receive indirect subsidies. Subsidies provided to support specific sectors and social groups are justified in the interests of society as a whole and are compliant with legal requirements in force. The level of indirect fossil fuel subsidies in Hungary (subsidies as a percentage of tax revenues) approximate the OECD average and slightly fall short of the average of European OECD member states.
