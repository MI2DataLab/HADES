4.6.  Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness i. Current situation of the low-carbon-technologies sector and, to the extent possible, its position on the global market (that analysis is to be carried out at Union or global level) Compared to the five strategic action lines proposed by the European Commission, the research-concentration of efforts to harness that potential, such tendency being also reflected at sectoral level. The main challenges are related to the absence of funding predictability, the under-sizing of the critical mass of human resources, the low absorption of European funds and the red tape. At European level, the main instrument for promoting and mobilising funding resources in the field of research, innovation and competitiveness in the energy sector is the Strategic Energy leader in the area of renewabecosystem through smart systems, energy efficiency systems, sustainable transport, carbon capturing, usage and storage, and enhancement of security in the use of nuclear energy.

RENEWS is a research infrastructure that aims at creating and strengthening a national excellence centre in the field of energy, environment and water, also contributing to the ESFRI 1.2 objective regarding the upgrading of the research structure by connecting national and international grids75. Enhancement of nuclear security and reduction of radioactive waste in Generation IV nuclear reactors  ALFRED (Advanced Lead Fast Reactor European Demonstrator) is a research project for a demonstration reactor for the lead cooled fast reactors (LFR, Lead Fast Reactors) technology. The LFR technology is sustained by the European Union through the SNETP initiatives (Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform) and ESNII (European Sustainable Nuclear Industrial Initiative), for the development of Generation IV nuclear systems. They are based on lead cooled fast reactors (LFR), sodium cooled fast reactors and gas cooled fast reactors. The project is in the portfolio of the international consortium FALCON (Fostering ALFRED CONstruction), which was established in 2013 in Bucharest by the Technologies for Czech Republic). FALCON has signed to date ten scientific cooperation agreements with research-development organisations from EU Member States, which contribute to the development of the LFR technology, and a memorandum of collaboration with SN Nuclearelectrica in 2018. The FALCON consortium has estimated the testing period for the technologies and the completion of the design and engineering stages for ALFRED in the forthcoming period in order to complete the construction of the demonstrator from Mioveni Pitesti (Romania) before 2030. ALFRED would thus have a total capacity of 300 MWh and the estimated costs could range between EUR 1 and 1.4 billion76.  The experimental pilot installation for separation of tritium and deuterium (PESTD) - ICSI Nuclear, which is a national interest objective, is purposed to develop the heavy water detritiation technology as a moderator and cooling agent in CANDU nuclear reactors and to check the specific materials and equipment in tritiated environment and at cryogenic temperatures. The experimental pilot installation is included on the list of nuclear installations supervised by the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna.

Description of energy subsidies, including for fossil fuels The subsidy system is configured as follows:  Aids to reduce energy poverty; they consist of social benefits granted from the State budget through the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection and the family maintenance allowance, and aids to secure the minimum income guaranteed for families and single persons under poverty. Aids are also granted for home heating for all the four heating systems: heat, natural gas, electricity and wood, coal and oil fuels, to vulnerable consumers, as defined by Government Emergency Order No 70/2011, other special aids for vulnerable consumers, and social electricity tariffs (until 1 January 2018).  Subsidies for heat without differentiating consumers under vulnerability criteria, which are applied directly to the electricity price. Over 60 % of these subsidies are allocated to the operator responsible for the capital city area. According to independent studies, subsidies totalling RON 1.1 billion were granted in 2015, of which RON 208 million for the first category and the remaining RON 900 million for the heat subsidies (for the second category the study cumulated the values recorded for 15 municipalities). In the period 2015-2018, aids were granted from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection for home heating for all the four heating systems, as follows: The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Table 35 - Number of persons receiving the home heating aid  Cold season period 2015-2016 2016-2017 2017-2018 2018-2019 Total number of beneficiary families: 636 256 536 080 386 966 230 357 Total number of beneficiary persons: 1 523 370 1 251 025 899 402 582 335 Heat 96 467 76 855 56 431 30 238 Natural gas 128 388 94 310 62 594 42 951 Electricity 8 825 8 218 4 615 2 994 Wood 402 576 356 697 263 326 154 174 Source: The Ministry of Labour and Social Protection The only State aid granted for coal is in accordance with Council Decision (EC) No 787/2010 on State aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mines and activities are to be carried out in order to close down mining works and to ensure the greening of the affected mine perimeters. The Romanian State initially notified the closure of three mines in Valea Jiului. The State aid SA 33033 was authorised under Commission Decision C(2012) 1020 final of 22 February 2012. This State aid was subsequently amended by including two more mines from Valea Jiului. The last amendment to the State aid was re-authorised under Commission Decision C(2018) 1001 final of 16 February 2018. The State aid for closure of the Petrila, Paroseni and Uricani coal mines is administered by the National Mine Closure Society in Valea Jiului (de Închideri Mine Valea Jiului SA - SNIMVJ) and the State aid for closure of the Lonea and Lupeni coal mines is administered by Complexul Energetic Hunedoara SA (CEH). The table below lists the value of the State aid authorised for closure of coal mines for the period 2011-2024 in accordance with Commission Decision C(2018) 1001 final.

The order provides for the monthly supplementary income to be granted as a social protection measure, which is received by the persons made redundant from the companies for which the granting of State aid was approved in order to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mines. As the abovementioned companies are located in a mono-industrial region, these measures are required in order to mitigate the social impact of the structural changes entailed by the closure of the uncompetitive coal mines in Valea Jiului and, implicitly, to promote just transition having regard to the legislative policy of the Romanian State and to the requirements for correlation with internal regulations and for harmonisation of the national law.  From the viewpoint of the European competition rules, the proposed measures do not constitute State aid. The below table shows the financial impact on the general consolidated budget on the short term, for the current year, and on the long term (for five years).
