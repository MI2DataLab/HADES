2.4  2.4.1 Electricity interconnectivity (2030 Framework target) i. The level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030 in consideration of the electricity interconnection target for 2030 of at least 15 %, with a strategy with the level from 2021 onwards defined in close cooperation with affected Member States, taking into account the 2020 interconnection target of 10 % and the following indicators of the urgency of action:  (1) Price differential in the wholesale market exceeding an indicative threshold of EUR 2/MWh between Member States, regions or bidding zones;   -60-  (2) Nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30 % of peak load;  (3) Nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30 % of installed renewable generation.  Each new interconnector shall be subject to a socioeconomic and environmental cost-benefit analysis and implemented only if the potential benefits outweigh the costs. 2030 interconnectivity target The 2030 framework transmission system interconnectivity target corresponds to maintaining the transmission system import and export capacity relative to the maximum load at a level of at least 30 % and 35 %, respectively32. However, this target is not directly comparable to the 2030 EU target of 15 %, as this target is expressed in relation to installed capacity. In general, it can be stated that the target under the State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic corresponds to the 15 % target, because the share of the maximum load in relation to the installed capacity corresponds to approximately 50 % (53 % in 2017)33. The Czech Republic therefore commits itself primarily to fulfilling the target under the State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic, which is already achieved and way above the target, but the achievement of this target should correspond to the implementation of the Barcelona Agreement (2030 target of 15 %), even though the developments of the maximum load and the installed capacity may be somewhat different. The level of the Czech transmission system interconnectivity is an area which is monitored and the national level in accordance with the State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic, which directly requires to maintain import and export capacity of the Czech transmission system in relation to the maximum load at least at 30 % and 35 %, respectively, and at European level within the European Ten-Year Network Development Plan, which assesses the progress towards the 2012 Barcelona criterion of 10 % of the transmission systems interconnectivity and the 2030 connectivity target at 15 %. Table 37 specifies the projected 2030 interconnectivity level (both for export and import) relative to the maximum load in two scenarios. In both cases, the 30 % and 35 % targets should be achieved with a relatively significant margin. Table 38 then shows the assumed interconnectivity level relative to the installed capacity. Both Scenario A and Scenario B assume the same installed capacity in this respect, so there are no differences between these scenarios. The current interconnectivity level is described in Chapter 4.5.1. Table 37: Assumed interconnectivity in 2030 (relative to maximum load)  Scenario A Scenario B Interconnectivity (export) 58.0 % 60.2 % Interconnectivity (import) 50.0 % 51.8 %                                                             32  Target state, or PIII.1. strategy under Priority III  Infrastructure and International Cooperation. 33  In 2017, the maximum load (according to the Energy Regulatory Office) was 11 768 MW and the installed  216 MW.  -61-  Table 38: Assumed interconnectivity in 2030 according to the Barcelona Agreement (relative to installed capacity)  Scenario A Scenario B Interconnectivity (export) 44.1 % 44.1 % Interconnectivity (import) 38.0 % 38.0 % Source:  Calculation methodology The current model of international transmission systems is used to calculate the export and import capacity of the Czech transmission system; in the case of the Czech Republic, the model is supplemented to include parts of the transmission system with investment plans to be implemented by the reference year. Cross-border capacities are calculated using the ENTSO-E NTC methodology, modified for the needs of transit systems such as the Czech transmission system (strong link between individual boundaries and their interaction). The procedure for determining cross-border capacities is laid down in capacities for auctions, which is avand import capacity of the Czech transmission system is then given by the share of the determined summary export/import capacity in MW for the year and the net load outlook for the year.34 Formula for calculating interconnectivity (export):  Formula for calculating interconnectivity (import):  2.4.2 Energy transmission infrastructure i.

For more information on the expected developments in the electricity system, see the Chapter 4.5.2.3. Gas sector In accordance with the Energy Act, NET4GAS, a transmission system operator, prepares each year the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of the Transmission System of the Czech Republic, which aims to analyse the development of maximum daily and annual consumption and the adequacy of input and output capacity for the Czech Republic. The plan includes completed and upcoming investment projects which increase the capacity of the transmission system, and also a supply security analysis. The Ten-Year Plan is approved by the ERO following an opinion of the MIT, and is published on the NET4GAS website.36 For more information on the expected developments in the transmission system, see the Chapter 4.5.2.4. ii. Where applicable, main infrastructure projects envisaged other than Projects of Common Interest (PCIs)37 Electricity sector The above Czech Development Plan is also reflected in the content of the regional investment plan of Central and Eastern Europe and the Ten-Year EU Network Transmission Plan, which are adopted by ENTSO-E at a two-year interval. The Czech Development Plan contains not only PCI projects, but also projects that the requirements necessary to ensure electricity supply security. Gas sector The development of the gas infrastructure will be in line with the approved Ten-Year Plan for the Development of the Transport System in the Czech Republic. The projects are aimed both at maintaining the capacity of the transmission system and its modernisation, and at its development. As of 2018, the most important such project is C4G, which is implemented in accordance with the priorities of the State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic, and is based on binding contracts for the transmission of natural gas.

If the SEP targets are to be achieved in a liberalised gas sector, cooperation of all stakeholders is necessary. 2.4.3 Market integration i. National objectives related to other aspects of the internal energy market such as increasing system flexibility, in particular related to the promotion of competitively determined electricity prices in line with relevant sectoral law, market integration and coupling, aimed at increasing the tradeable capacity of existing interconnectors, smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, and real-time price signals, including a timeframe for when the objectives shall be met  2.4.3.1 Electricity sector The integration of day-ahead and intraday markets in Europe, on the basis of the implicit cross-border capacity allocation, has more than a 15-year history when this coupling initially involved only neighbouring States38 on the basis of bilateral or multilateral agreements. Consequently, these already coupled markets were further integrated into larger regions.  The main benefits of market integration include access to a larger  single electricity market. The energy market segmented into individual national markets (although physically coupled) is inefficient and the trading on it is more risky and, therefore, expensive. In coupled markets, participants can better respond to changes in production and consumption. This way, the system opens up space for other players, the market becomes stabilised and more transparent. As a result, competition increases, leading to downward pressure on prices. Savings from coupled markets can then be reflected by traders in their pricing policy.  Other benefits resulting from the integration of short-term electricity markets can be summarised as follows:  optimal use of cross-border transmission capacities;  integration helps to balance the electricity systems of individual countries;  price indices become stabilised and the volatility of the difference in spot electricity prices across EU markets decreases;  purchases of often unused capacities of cross-border profiles in explicit auctions are limited;   there is a decrease in risks associated with the purchase of cross-border capacity without the ownership of electricity in export/import and vice versa. An important step, which was not only to promote the creation of a single EU electricity market but which also showed the attention the European Commission pays to the issue of integration, was the adoption of Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 of 24 July 2015 establishing a guideline on capacity allocation and congestion management (CACM Regulation) based on Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity.                                                            38  For example, 2009 saw the Czech and Slovak day-ahead electricity coupling.  -64-  In accordance with the requirements of the CACM Regulation, on 7 October 2015 OTE, a.s. was appointed by the Energy Regulatory Office as the Nominated Electricity Market Organiser (NEMO)39, which will ensure a single day-ahead or intraday coupling in the Czech Republic40. The appointment of the market operator as the Nominated Electricity Market Organiser is not only a clear confirmation and a positive operator to actively participate in EU integration activities. Together with other European exchanges appointed as NEMO and transmission system operators in Europe, OTE a.s. cooperates towards the obligation to complete and further develop and, finally, operate the single day-ahead and intraday coupling in the EU, as required by the CACM Regulation. In cooperation with all NEMOs in the EU, in June 2017 a plan was created to jointly establish and perform the functions of a market coupling operator  management and cooperation between NEMOs, defines the relationship with third parties, and also describes the transition of existing initiatives of interconnected day-ahead and intraday markets into a single interconnected day-ahead and intraday market. Following the CACM Regulation, for example the following methodologies were further developed and subsequently approved in 2017 and 2018:  the methodology of products that NEMOs can include in a single interconnection of   day-ahead and intraday markets,  methodology of alternative procedures,  methodology of harmonised maximum and minimum clearing prices. In 2018, based on the decision of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators  ACER, the methodology of the algorithm for reconciling interconnected day-ahead markets and the algorithm for continuous trading pairing was adopted. Some of these methodologies will be updated in 2019 to:  include newly prepared intraday auctions, which will be organised on the basis of intraday capacity pricing methodology;  incorporate rules for change in the single day-ahead and intraday electricity markets;  incorporate rules for monitoring the single coupling of day-ahead and intra markets; and   update some articles based on operational experience. Table 39: Main national market integration objectives (electricity) National objectives and targets Description Complete, further develop and last but not least operate the single day-ahead and intraday electricity market in the EU as required by Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 of 24 July 2015 establishing a guideline on capacity The aim is to implement the Single Market Framework as set out in Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 of 24 July 2015 establishing a guideline on capacity allocation and congestion management based on Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the                                                            39  At the time of the finalisation of the National Energy and Climate Plan of the Czech Republic, OTE, a. s. was renominated for the next period by decision from 1 October 2019 for the period from 10 October 2019 to 31 December 2023. 40  For more information see: http://www.ote-cr.cz/kratkodobe-trhy/integrace-trhu/all-nemo-cooperation  -65-  allocation and congestion management (CACM Regulation).

To secure, within the framework of the long-term electricity market, the supply of all the products of long-term capacity rights relevant to the bidding zone border of the Czech Republic through the Central Auction Office. The aim is to offer all the products of long-term transmission rights relevant to the bidding zone border of the Czech Republic through the Single allocation platform already for 2019. To secure, within the framework of the day-ahead electricity market, the interconnection of the Czech electricity market with the remaining markets in Europe by 2021.  The Czech Republic has day-ahead coupling with the Slovak, Hungarian and Romanian markets within the 4M MC41. At the same time, the work is underway to link this market to the Western European Connected Market (MRC) through the Interim Coupling project, which uses cross-border capacities calculated by the NTC method. The target solution is to ensure that all day-ahead electricity markets in the EU are fully integrated into one EU electricity market (coupled), which is also the main objective of the CACM Regulation. The Czech Republic will be involved in the Single Day-ahead Coupling (SDAC) in the EU after the finalisation of the Interim Coupling regional project or the launch of the CORE flow-based market coupling project, whichever is the earlier. Regardless of the project, the Czech day-ahead electricity market will be implicitly linked to the EU market by the end of 2021.42 To implement, within the intra-day electricity market , the LIP 15 project and to continue according to the XBID project schedule to achieve the integration of the Czech Republic within the single intra-day coupling (SIDC) in the EU according to the CACM Regulation. in the Czech Republic and OTE, a.s. as the nominated electricity market operator in the Czech Republic, together with similar entities in Bulgaria, Austria, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Croatia, form the LIP 15 project.

In addition to infrastructure projects that are geared towards facilitating the reservation of capacities for gas traders or making areas that are not directly coupled accessible for trading, no integration projects are currently under discussion with the aim of coupling organised gas markets in our region. The Czech Republic intends to help complete the internal energy market, in particular the internal gas market, by removing infrastructure bottlenecks between the Czech Republic and its neighbours, namely Poland and Austria. This should be facilitated by the fact that the national gas market legislation has been adapted to two regulations designed to ensure uniform principles for the creation of a single internal gas market in the EU  Regulation (EU) No 2017/460 establishing a network code on harmonised transmission tariff structures for gas, Regulation (EU) No 2017/459 establishing a network code on capacity allocation mechanisms in gas transmission systems and repealing Regulation (EU) No 984/2013. This should be further facilitated by the support for the implementation of PCI status projects (projects of common interest), enabling direct interconnection with the gas systems of neighbouring countries. These projects contribute to the integration of national markets in the region and the creation of a Central European gas market. The interconnection with Germany and Slovakia is already sufficiently robust. The Czech Republic is interconnected with Poland by the STORK gas pipeline. There is no physical interconnection between the Czech Republic and Austria. The national gas market in the Czech Republic has been fully liberalised since 2007; the ERO regulates only those prices which, for technical or organisational reasons, cannot be formed by market mechanisms within a competitive environment. There are several dozen gas traders on the Czech gas market, which offer their services to customers. The Czech gas market operates on the principle of non-discrimination, where each trader may reach out to any customer, and any customer may enter into a contract with any trader. Supply prices and other supply terms depend only on a mutual agreement. The developed competitive environment on the gas market has enabled a wide range of trader offers, both in terms of price, and the related business terms. The market dynamics thus depends more on the ability and willingness of customers to change suppliers to get more favourable conditions. The Energy Act and its implementing legislation guarantee all customers the right to change their gas supplier. This change is free. If the customer meets the existing business conditions, he may thus choose his gas supplier. Trading in the internal gas market then takes place either through bilateral trading or an organised short-term market. For more information, see Chapter 4.5.3. ii. Where applicable, national objectives related to the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met Integration of renewable energy sources, demand-side response, energy storage and flexibility aggregation are addressed in the National Action Plan for Smart Grids and its updated version, the  -68-  ets, including the timeframe for achieving them, are set out in this document. Detailed information is provided in part (ii) of Chapter 3.4.3. Directive (EU) 2018/2001, which will be transposed into national legislation by 30 June 2021, is also important in this respect. iii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to ensuring that consumers participate in the energy system and benefit from self-generation and new technologies, including smart meters  The conditions for the implementation of smart metering in the Czech Republic are being prepared within the framework of the National Action Plan for Smart Grids (see information in part (ii) of Chapter 3.4.3). The prepared solution also takes into account legislative measures issued unthe European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for electricity). iv. National objectives with regard to ensuring electricity system adequacy, as well as for the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met The Czech Republic aims to ensure the maximum possible adequacy with an acceptable level of risk. ust be carefully monitored by the State, which creates the conditions for ensuring this adequacy. The safe operation of the electricity system and the required quality of the electricity supply depends, in addition to the reliability parameters of the transmission and distribution system, also on a balanced production mix that cannot be directly influenced by the transmission and distribution system operators. The current State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic anticipates the balance for the Czech Republic to be equal over the medium term and does not expect a significant import dependence. In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003, the transmission system operator carries out an annual outlook for the adequacy of production capacities, including the proposal of measures to address any problems with ensuring the adequacy of production capacities. The document prepared by the transmission system operator is then based on an analysis of systemic risks concerning the ES power balance reliability using probabilistic approach for different periods and consumption scenarios, levels of construction and recovery / lifespan of conventional sources, the throughput of international couplings, and the share of renewable energy sources and decentralised energy sources in different scenarios. The evaluation also includes the preparation of critical scenarios and the evaluation of potential risks requiring measures in production and system adequacy. When preparing the critical scenarios, we draw on the experience of hallows the evaluation of risks even in extreme operational situations. The Czech Republic currently has no established and legislatively or non-legislatively prescribed supply reliability standard, expressed by relevant indicators such as the Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE) or Value of Loss Load (VoLL), which would allow a target to be expressed in terms of production adequacy exactly through these values. Without these parameters, it is not possible to easily justify measures to ensure the necessary reliability and adequacy of production capacities of the Czech electricity system. In accordance with Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electricity, the VoLL value shall be determined by 5  -69-  July 2020. In accordance with Article 22 of the same Regulation, from 5 January 2020, ENTSO should submit to ACER a draft methodology for the calculation of VoLL and the safety standard referred to in Article 2548. The assessment of the adequacy of the Czech electricity system production capacities up to 2030, prepared by the transmission system operator in August 2017, works with an indicative reliability standard at LOLE level of 3 hours for P50 % and 6 hours for P95 %. Higher flexibility of the electricity system can also be facilitated by a higher degree of integration with other sectors such as heating, gas or transport. In the case of heating, it mainly involves the power2heat technology, which has been deployed for a long time in the Czech Republic; however, it is appropriate to consider the support of their development. In the case of the gas sector, it involves the production of hydrogen by electrolysis (Power2Gas technology) and possibly its methanisation into the form of synthetic methane. Specific measures on financial support for energy stored in gaseous form in the gas system may depend on the EU legislative framework, which will be introduced in the European sport, this may involve the use of electricity storage in electric cars and the coordination of their charging in the surplus electricity period. The flexibility of the energy system in terms of renewable energy production is specifically addressed in the National Action Plan for Grids 2019timeframe for achieving them, are set out in this document. Detailed information is provided in part (ii) of Chapter 3.4.3. v. Where applicable, national objectives to protect energy consumers and improve the competitiveness of the retail energy sector For more detailed information, see Chapter 3.4.3, specifically point (iv), which addresses policies and measures to protect consumers, especially vulnerable and, where relevant, energy-poor consumers, and to enhance the competitiveness and competitiveness of the retail energy market. 2.4.4 Energy poverty i. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to energy poverty, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met 2.4.4.1 National energy poverty objectives The definition of energy poverty is yet to be laid down in Czech legislation. In research projects, energy poverty is generally defined as a situation where a household does not have the socially and materially necessary level of energy services. Energy poverty is caused by a combination of three basic factors at household level: energy prices, energy efficiency and household income. In the Czech Republic, a working group was set up in 2015 to deal with energy poverty within the and households affected by energy poverty. In line with the outcomes defined: the quality and energy performance of a building, the price of energy at the given place, the                                                            48  Currently, there is an ongoing research MAF methodology into the national reliability standards, which can be used in the planning of corrective measures in case of indication of resource inadequacy within the Czech elecinter alia, to propose a methodology for setting production adequacy targets.  -70-  income of the household, the conditions and the quality of the indoor environment. The adequacy of living area is an additional indicator.  Because finding the links between these factors and assessing the impacts of their combinations on households is difficult, an energy poverty project was awarded in a public tender. The output of the project is to set up a certified methodology for evaluating energy poverty and vulnerable customer in the Czech Republic and to propose measures to prevent and address these phenomena. Project outputs can be expected by 30 November 2020, but partial outputs will be available throughout the project according to its schedule. At the same time, to meet its obligation under Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU, the Czech Republic will set up the instruments so as to ensure increase in energy efficiency also for low-income groups, see Chapter 3.2. 2.4.4.2 Context information for energy poverty49 The Czech Republic considers the project output deadline to be sufficient given that the Czech Republic achieves better household sector indicators than the EU average. Approximately 4.7 % of households were unable to maintain sufficient heating comfort in 2016 and only 2.4 % had problems paying energy bills. The Czech Republic is slightly better than the EU average in expenditure-based indicators. Approximately 10.7 % of households spend more than double the median on energy and 8.4 % spend so little on energy that they probably live in hidden energy poverty. Chart 9: Comparison of indicators with respect to the EU average  Source: Energy Observatory                                                            49  data (their information value for the Czech Republic) will need to be verified, also on the basis of the established methodology.  -71-  Energy poverty (its indicators or indicators expressing it) in the Czech Republic has been gradually decreasing since 2005. The share of households that could not maintain sufficient thermal comfort decreased from 11 % in 2005 to 5 % in 2016 and the number of households with energy bill arrears fell from 5 % in 2005 to 2 % in 2016. The indicators in the household sector indicate that energy poverty in the Czech Republic mostly affects private tenants. However, there are no clear groups by the type of dwelling or urbanisation density where energy poverty is most significant. There seems to be no clear socio-economic group that is particularly vulnerable to energy poverty in the Czech Republic.
