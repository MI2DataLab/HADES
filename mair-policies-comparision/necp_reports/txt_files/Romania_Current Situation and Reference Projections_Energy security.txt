4.4.  Energy security dimension i. Current energy mix, domestic energy resources, import dependency, including relevant risks The energy source with the highest share in the total production in 2017 is represented by production of natural gas, with over 30 % in the total production, followed by renewable The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         energy (23 %). Moreover, a falling trend is noticeable for solid fuels and crude oil, and petroleum products. A downward trend in primary energy production in Romania has been recorded, total production in 2017 being by 9 % below that recorded in 2005. This reduction is however smaller than the reduction in the quantity of imported energy; in 2017, Romania imported by 19 % less energy compared to 2005.

The reduction in import dependency was achieved on account of the reduction in the imports of natural gas, renewable energy and solid fuels.                                                  63 The definition of the indicator is found by accessing the link: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Primary_production_of_energy The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Chart 35 - Historical trend in energy import in Romania by energy source, 2005-2017  Source: EU Commission, Energy datasheets  EU 28, 8 October 2019 RO EN  Crude oil and petroleum products  Gaz natural  Natural gas   Renewable energy  Electricitate Electricity Combustibili solizi  Solid fuels   As regards net import of energy, Romania was a net exporter of electricity (with only one exception) between 2005 and 2017.

Projections of development with existing policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) in the context of current policies and measures, the projection shows a decrease in energy production mainly on account of a reduction in the production of solid fuels and natural gas. On the other hand, an increase in production of nuclear energy is expected, including after 2030, following the commissioning of Nuclear Power Units 3 and 4 in Cernavoda, as well as an increase in production of renewable energy.  As regards net import, Romania is expected to further remain a net exporter of electricity at a much lower level than before though. Moreover, imports of crude oil and petroleum products are expected to remain high in order to be able to cover the demand. Overall, dependency on imports is expected to increase in the context of a projection of increase in primary consumption and of decrease in production.
