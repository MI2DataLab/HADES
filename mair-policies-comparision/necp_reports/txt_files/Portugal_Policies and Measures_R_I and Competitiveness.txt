PROMOTE R&I&D PROJECTS SUPPORTING THE SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY DESCRIPTION Support the development of low-carbon technologies, processes, practices, products and services that are efficient in terms of using resources in the agroforestry sector and promote the compilation of more and better base information, which will  SECTOR(S) Agriculture; Forestry; Circular Economy ACTION MEASURES To promote R&I&D projects supporting the sustainable management of agriculture and forestry, the following action measures are planned:  6.8.1. Promote liaison with Themed Research and Innovation Agendas by the Science and Technology Foundation (FCT) FCT Agendas seek to mobilise experts from R&D institutions, companies and public entities to identify challenges and opportunities in the national scientific and technological system, from a medium and long-term perspective, contributing to the development of R&I which provides solutions to problems or needs in different sectors of society. The following Agenda is worthy of note in terms of supporting R&I projects that contribute toward decarbonising the agroforestry sector: Agri-food, Forestry and Biodiversity Agenda. This cooperation extends to Collaborative Laboratories, since their objective is to implement research and innovation agendas. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   6.8.2. Systematically compile, process and make available information on the forestry sector  The absence of information on a number of basic aspects of the Portuguese forestry sector is widely acknowledged. This issue raises uncertainties and risks and hinders the drawing up and implementation of policies for the sector and their respective monitoring and assessment. In a globalised world, the quality of information is a vital process for creating value for the development and competitiveness of any sector. Solid investment is needed in the production-provision-use of information. It is thus necessary to invest substantially in the production-availability-use of such information. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   6.8.3. Implement a permanent system for the National Forestry Inventory  The forestry inventory is one of the main sources of information to monitor GHG sequestration and emissions but it also serves as base information for informed forestry policies. It is thus necessary to migrate to a permanent system that allows frequent updates as the current frequency of 10 years does not allow accurate monitoring. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   6.8.4. Implement a system to update land use and monitor changes in land use  A cartographic system that makes it possible to monitor the evolution of land use and identify the main dynamics driving changes in land use is a vital tool for the proper monitoring and calculation of sequestration and emissions. It also provides an information base for informed spatial planning policies and targeted and effective supervision. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   6.8.5. Improve information on the structure and ownership of property  114 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3. Policies and measures planned    The implementation of agricultural and forestry policies, including incentive and penalty systems requires information on owners and the size of land parcels and as such it is vital to create and improve such information, particularly in areas of the country where there is either no information or it is significantly out of date. The simplified cadastral record will be extended to all of national territory and the updating and vectorization of the geometric registration should be promoted. There will also be a rapid updating of the information in the building registration whenever changes in the ownership or size of the building take place. [Expected date: 2020-2030]  6.8.6. Develop agricultural and forestry innovation and research by improving the capacities of Centres for Competences for the main agricultural and forestry chains Reinforce the horizontal and vertical integration of chains and sub-chains, promoting coordination between industries, research and production. The process of producing and funding research, development and trials will increase the capacity of forestry actors to influence the topics being researched and to thus respond more effectively to their needs. It is therefore important to continue to develop lines of R&D&I aimed at improving the management and use of forest populations (namely through genetic improvement, silviculture techniques/models, experimenting with new species, biotic and abiotic agents, invasive species), above all in a context of adapting to climate change, as well as those that could lead to the innovation and diversification of uses of woody and non-woody products, by focusing on advanced technologies, new production technologies for wood products, cork, pulp and paper, and on highly efficient processes. These lines will be supported by research programmes, experimental development, extension and innovation, which use and orient the various instruments available at a national and Community level. Good examples include Operational Groups and Collaborative Laboratories. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   6.8.7. Stimulate research and innovation in the area of energy efficiency in the agricultural and forestry sectors.       Promote R&I projects that make it possible to monitor the effects of agricultural and forestry best practices, using digital technologies (remote sensing, satellites, sensors, models, software).

Cooperation with other Member States in this area, including information on how the SET Plan objectives and policies are being translated to a national context  The European strategy with regard to Research and Development and Innovation for energy, including the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan)27, the Horizon Europe28 (current draft programme which will replace Horizon 2020) and the Investment Plan for Europe: Juncker Plan29, include R&D&I objectives in energy for the 2020-2030 horizon. Participation and cooperation in the SET Plan has proven to be beneficial with respect to joint efforts to achieve common goals to increase the use of new technologies while also creating joint challenges in relation to disruptive actions. Portugal has participated in several implementation groups and activities and considers collaboration in specialist groups for carrying out coordinated action and other forms of collaboration to develop guided projects to be important. The aim is to comply with ambitious targets for the 2030 horizon.   iii.
