Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   4.6 Research, innovation and competitiveness dimension 4.6.1 Trends in the low-carbon technology sector Trends in the low-carbon technology sector in the Netherlands This section provides an overview of the economic significance of the Dutch energy sector in recent years with a focus on the developments in the transition to the development and application of low-carbon technologies for energy savings and renewable energy. In this section a differentiation is made between energy operations and activities related to energy investments.127 Energy operations are usually capital-intensive. In contrast investment-related activities are often labour-intensive and as a result, are important for employment potential in the energy supply. International position At the international level, similar definitions and data of low-carbon technologies and the corresponding "sector" are still being worked on. Many definitions and data are still incomparable and it is therefore difficult to provide official, comparable data related to the overall position of the low-carbon technology sector in different countries. However, an "unofficial" study is published every three years by a commercial consultancy group, the Clean Tech Group, from the USA. This Global Clean Tech Innovation index compares about 40 countries, including the G20, in terms of their clean tech sector developments. In the most recent report (2017), the Netherlands is ranked 15th (see text box below). The Netherlands scores above the global average in both inputs to and outputs of cleantech innovation, achieving 15th position in the overall Index. Scoring 5th in general innovation drivers, the Netherlands succeeds in producing a high-quality innovation ecosystem, and promotes a strong national entrepreneurial culture. Above average access to private finance for start-ups together with a good score for public R&D expenditure in the cleantech sector provides the country with significant cleantech-specific drivers. This manifests in the country's good score for emerging cleantech, scoring 11th place for evidence of early-stage venture capital investment. This culminates in the Netherlands' relative success in commercialised cleantech, particularly in its strength in cleantech trade, scoring 3rd and 6th place in cleantech commodity imports and exports respectively. A weakness, however, is its low renewable energy consumption relative to total primary consumption. See: https://www.cleantech.com/ This report is now several years old (there might be an update in 2020) and since then a number of aspects have experienced considerable development: according to expectations, investments in low-carbon technologies and the generation and consumption of renewable energy are increasing considerably in the Netherlands (see below). Better and internationally comparable data is also being worked on, including by the statistics agencies. Future reports under the Governance Regulation are expected to contribute further to a more uniform and comparable picture of the sector. However, the available data used in this chapter still relate mainly to energy-related activities. They try and provide a picture of the total energy-related sector and to subsequently indicate developments in renewable energy shares or energy-related low carbon technology in that total. Later reports also include other climate-relevant activities that are not energy related, where possible.                                                   127 Energy operations consist of activities related to the extraction, production, conversion, trade, storage, transport and supply of energy (including refineries, oil and gas extraction, fuel stations and renewable energy generation). Investments are made by operational sectors to ensure that these activities are consistent or keep up with the demand from end consumers. End consumers of energy also make investments, for example in new energy-efficient industrial boilers or insulation. In turn, these investments by operational sectors and end consumers lead to economic activities in other sectors, such as for construction and utilities companies, technology manufacturers, R&D, the government, consultancy and other services, and are referred to as "activities from investments". For more information on the demarcation and definitions of  energy-related activities and the distinction between conventional and sustainable, we refer the reader to the background reports (Statistics Netherlands, 2015; Van Dril et al. 2016).

The economic indicators in this chapter are largely derived from the national accounts of Statistics Netherlands. The National accounts provide a coherent and consistent overview of the entire Dutch economy, including energy-related activities128.  Figure 4.32 Share of energy activities in relation to the entire Dutch economy for various economic indicators in 2018. (Source: PBL, 2019a). Renewable energy activities and energy savings Networks Conventional energy activities The total contribution of energy to gross domestic product was 3.7 percent in 2018. The energy domain is capital intensive; the share of investments (8.4 percent) is four times higher than the share of employment (2.0 percent). The figure also shows that the energy import and export value represents a relatively high proportion; this is linked to the direct import and export of fossil energy carriers and to the trade in processed energy products. The Netherlands has extracted a high quantity of natural gas, and exported a portion of it, over a long period. Exports have declined due to the reduction of gas extraction and is now shifting to imports. Furthermore, the Netherlands imports a lot of crude oil that is processed by the refining sector into all kinds of petroleum products, which are then largely exported.                                                  128 In 2018, the national accounts were overhauled, which means that new sources, methods and concepts have been implemented. This has had a particular impact on the figures for investments in renewable energy. The changes are explained in a background report (CBS, 2019f).  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   Figure 4.33 Imports and exports of energy products between 2015 and 2018, at current prices. (Source: PBL, 2019a)  2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 Renewable energy Energy savings Networks Conventional energy Cut-off between situation and estimate Estimate for adopted and proposed policies  Over the past four years, a variation has been observed in the total import value of 45 billion to 66 billion and the export value of 40 billion to 52 billion (see Figure 4.33). This variation is explained by fluctuations both in price and in volume. Especially between 2014 and 2015, the oil price fell sharply, which can be seen in the import and export value of energy products. Since 2016, energy prices have risen once more. The value of natural gas exports peaked in 2013, partly due to the high gas extraction level in Groningen. In the following years, exports of natural gas decreased, partly due to reduced gas extraction level in Groningen and a fall in the price of gas. The following sections describe further turnover, investments and employment in the energy sector, separately addressing the relevant shares of renewable energy and energy-saving technology for the low-carbon position. It addresses both the figures achieved and expected developments. These expectations are based on the KEV, assuming adopted and proposed policies known on 1 May 2019. Some policies announced later under the Climate Agreement have not yet been incorporated. Moreover, expectations are mainly provided as information about trends. Chapter 5 discusses the necessary investments for energy transition activities. Production and added value The contribution of energy-related activities for conventional and renewable energy is outlined in figure 4.34. Figure 4.34 Contribution of energy-related activities to the Dutch economy, expressed as a percentage of total GDP. (Source: PBL, 2019a) % of gross domestic product  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   The peak in 2012 and 2013 was mainly related to a relatively high amount of natural gas extraction, investments in new coal-fired power plants and high energy prices, affording conventional energy sectors a temporary increase in added value. After this peak, there have been no more major investments in conventional power plants and natural gas extraction has declined. This can also be observed in the sharp decrease in the added value of conventional sectors in recent years. In the projections, it is still falling slightly, but stabilises in 2022 (around 1.6 percent). Renewable energy added value demonstrates an upward trend from 2008 onwards, from 0.3 percent in 2010 to 0.8 percent in 2018. This upward trend is also evident in the projections, with renewable energy's contribution to total gross domestic product around 1.8 percent by 2030. The added value of renewable energy activities shows an upward trend over time; it rose to more than 2.3 billion euros in 2018. While most conventional sectors are seeing added value dwindle, the total added value of renewable energy is expected to reach around 10 billion euros by 2030. The added value of renewable energy comprises several components, such as the revenues of electricity generation with installations that generate renewable energy, but also, for example, companies that produce and install wind turbines and solar panels and or their components. In the KEV, the PBL expects more than a quarter of the projected added value of renewable energy to be related to the investment activities of companies benefiting from investments by 2030. One of the sources contributing to this growth in added value of renewable energy activities is energy generated from biomass. The production value of this sector has grown from around 1.9 billion euros in 2016 to almost 2.7 billion euros in 2017, with added value rising from almost 1 billion euros to 1.2 billion euros. An important factor in this increase is the growth in biofuel production for transport. Growth in biofuel demand is expected to increase until 2020 and stabilise thereafter (PBL, 2019a). Solar power generation is expected to increase by 200 percent between 2020 and 2030. The solar panels are installed on the roofs of houses and other buildings or in solar fields, where, depending on the type of connection, another electricity price applies. The growth in the number of solar panels also translates into an increase in the added value of this technology. In addition, other forms of renewable energy, such as the production of heat using geothermal energy, also contribute to the expected increase in added value. The increase in this case, as with solar PV, is mainly in profit income and not in employment income and employment. Investments Total investment in energy gradually increased up to and including 2014, but decreased slightly between 2015 and 2017 (see Figure 4.35). The decrease in this period is the result of opposing trends in the underlying sectors. Investments in conventional sectors have fallen sharply since 2014, while investments in renewable energy and energy savings have increased. Investments in networks also increased slightly during this period. Investments in conventional energy are expected to stabilise after 2017, but investments in renewable energy, energy savings and networks are expected to continue to rise. As a result, total investments will increase to an average of 16 billion euros by 2030.Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   billion euros (current prices) 20  Cut-off between situation and estimate  2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 Estimate for adopted and proposed policies Figure 4.35 Development of investments in energy installations and energy savings, in current prices. The development of inflation within the projections is included in the appendix containing the tables. (Source: PBL, 2019a)  In the conventional sectors, considerable investments were made in three new coal-fired power stations in the electricity sector and additional drilling for oil and gas extraction until 2014. After 2014, investments in these two conventional sectors fell from 4.9 billion in 2014 to 2.1 billion in 2017. On the other hand, investments of oil refineries remained stable during this period (between 600 million and 800 million euros). Investments in the conventional energy supply are expected to remain at about the same level as in 2017. This is related, among other things, to developments in the capacity of gas-fired power plants and cogeneration (CHP) installations. This does not involve investments in new power plants, but maintenance investments in existing power plants. Total investments in renewable energy increased between 2008 and 2016, but fell in 2017, bringing them to circa 2014 levels. The main causes of the increase between 2010 and 2016 are investments in wind energy and solar power. Investments in solar power grew from 500 million euros in 2014 to almost 1 billion in 2017. Investments in wind energy also show very strong growth over a longer period of time, but are volatile year-on-year. This is due to the construction of large offshore wind farms. Offshore wind farms such as Luchterduinen and Gemini resulted in significant investment spikes, but after these farms were commissioned, investments decreased in 2017. After 2017, they increased again due to the construction of new wind farms (RVO.nl, 2019a). Investments in other renewable energy sources, such as geothermal energy, biomass and biofuels have increased since 2014, but are relatively modest compared with investments in wind energy and solar power. In the forecasts the greatest share of investments in renewable energy is determined by investments in solar power and wind energy. The huge increase in the established capacity of solar power and wind energy results in investments that account for approximately 70 to 80% of total investments in renewable energy between 2020 and 2030. Investments in energy savings increased from 2.5 billion euros in 2010 to 4.2 billion euros in 2017. The estimates also include an increase in investments in energy savings, but future growth does slow down in the estimates. PBL expects these investments to be around 5 billion euros by 2030. One of the reasons for the increase in investments is the configuration of the information obligation for companies under the Environmental Management Act. The expectation is that the amendment to the regulation will mean companies are more likely to invest in energy-saving measures. Investments in the necessary infrastructure for transporting and distributing gas and electricity increased from 2.6 billion in 2014 to 3 billion euros in 2017. According to the PBL, these will continue to grow, especially in electricity infrastructure. This may involve connecting wind farms in the North Sea to the coastal electricity grid, as well as strengthening existing grids, for example by constructing a wind farm or a solar field. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   Renewable energy Energy savings Networks Conventional energy Employment Total employment in the energy sector increased to about 154,000 working years in 2014. After this, employment fell to 148,000 working years in 2018. PBL expects the total number of projected working years to vary between 155,000 and 139,000 working years up to 2030 (Figure 4.36). However, this is expected to shift from labour in conventional sectors to renewable energy and energy savings. In 2008, 56% of employment was related to conventional sectors and 29% to renewable energy and energy savings. In 2018, it amounted to 38 percent for conventional energy and 43 percent for renewable energy and energy savings. By 2030, 33% of employment in the energy sector is expected to be related to conventional sectors and 48% to renewable energy and energy savings. The share of employment in networks remains relatively stable. Figure 4.36 Development of energy-related gross employment (2008-2018) and demand for labour. Forecasts for adopted and proposed policies. (Source: PBL, 2019a) in thousands of working years 200 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 Cut-off between situation and estimate Estimate concerns the demand for labour with adopted and proposed policies Employment in the low carbon sector resulting from investments In total about a third of energy-related employment involves energy operations and two thirds are related to investments. Developments in investments can be translated into economic activities resulting from them, i.e. the expected direct demand for labour from investments. Whether this demand for work is also converted into employment depends on labour productivity and whether companies can find suitable workers. The direct demand for labour in the Netherlands differs from one technology to another. A large share of the energy technology used is imported, so this does not result in a demand for labour in the Netherlands to produce this technology. However, Dutch companies do usually install the technology. This is incorporated in the situations and estimates of investment activities (from Dril, 2019) (see Figure 4.37). In particular, the activities related to energy savings and solar power result in a relatively high demand for labour in the Netherlands. These are activities such as insulating homes and installing solar panels. This is labour-intensive work. For solar power, employment increased by almost 60% between 2014 and 2017 and by around 25% for energy savings. Increased investments in other technologies, such as wind energy, also generate additional demand for labour. However, work activities involving these technologies are characterised by a higher import share and, due to the higher costs per working year, result in an equally high investment but in fewer full-time jobs. Therefore, the increase in investments in wind energy in recent years has not translated directly into an increase in employment in the wind energy sector. This has currently returned to the level of 2014.

This involved a variety of activities, such as the installation of charging stations, but also the development and production of batteries, software, propulsion technology and vehicles. Since 2008, Dutch employment in electric transport has experienced continuous growth. In 2017, for example, 800 additional working years were created compared with 2016. Growth in electric transport up to 2020 is expected to be significant, but after 2020 PBL expects it to decline because policy after 2020 is as yet unclear (PBL, 2019a). As of 2025, sales of electric cars are expected to increase once more. As a result, the expected demand for labour will reach a similar level in 2030 as in 2017. The total expected demand for labour in the Netherlands due to investments in conventional sectors, renewable sectors, networks and energy savings shows a decrease until 2030. This brings the total expected demand for labour from investments to about the same level as employment resulting from investments in 2017. It is uncertain whether there will be a sufficient supply of labour and a suitable workforce in the future to meet this demand (PBL, 2019a). 4.6.2 Trends in spending, research and innovation related to low-carbon technologies Every year, the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO) publishes the "Publicly Funded Energy Research" monitor on behalf of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (RVO, 2019b). This report is used for reporting to the IEA. The results are also used in the NEV. It provides an insight into Dutch government expenditure related to energy research conducted by knowledge institutes, universities and businesses, and the underlying energy themes on which it is focused. Public investments in energy research via fiscal instruments (the WBSO), public funds (the Innovation Fund for SMEs+) and direct payments by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science to universities are beyond the scope of this monitor. In 2018, the central government invested 225 million euros of public funds in energy research and development (RVO.nl, 2019c), a sharp increase compared with previous years (see Figure 7). This is the result of additional resources in 2018 for energy innovation and development, made available by the government in the climate envelope, for measures contributing to the ambition to reduce CO2 emissions in the Netherlands by 49% by 2030. The measures financed from the climate envelope crop up in many different sectors. Figure 4.38 also shows the distribution of public investments by category. In 2018, more than 43% (97 million euros) of funds were spent on renewable energy innovation projects and some 66 million euros on research, and the development of Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   Hydrogen and fuel cells 11 mln 5%   2012 2018 Nuclear power 6 mln 3%  2012 2018 Renewable energy sources 97 mln 43%  2012201 Total per year Generation and storage techniques 13 mln 6%   2012 2018 Other Energy research 10 mln 5% Energy savings 66 mln 29% Fossil fuels 21 mln 9%  2012 2018 210mln 185 mln  2012 2013 153 mln  2014 190 mln  2015 2016 150 mln 225 mln 2017 2018 Total investment 2018 225 mln energy-saving measures. These are the two largest categories that also focus on energy technology categories that are subject to a large-scale roll-out. Energy research on hydrogen and fuel cells has been expanding for several years. Investments in fossil fuel research (conventional energy) are limited and focus on carbon capture and storage (CCS). The figure does not show companies' (possibly private) expenditure within energy innovation projects. In the Top Sector Energy approach, the amount has fluctuated around 100-150 million euros per year since the Top Sector Policy was introduced in 2012, around 40% of total investments. Total public and private investments in the Top Sector Energy amount to circa 2 billion euros (RVO.nl, 2019c) from 2012 onwards. This does not include all investments in energy innovation, because companies also invest in energy innovation, but do not always make this information publicly available. Figure 4.38 Public investments in energy research based on a committed subsidy, in current prices. Source: RVO.nl (2019b).  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   Figure 4.39 Number of unique organisations in energy innovation projects related to the Top Sector Energy (Source: RVO, 2019c)  2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018  2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2010 Number of companies One of the objectives of the top sectors policy is to help companies, including SMEs, improve the way they collaborate with knowledge institutions. RVO monitors the number and type of organisations involved in energy innovation projects. Figure 4.39 shows how the energy innovation network of the Top Sector Energy grew between 2012 and 2018. It distinguishes between participation by the different types of organisations.  In total, more than 2,400 individual organisations participate in over 2,600 projects (RVO, 2019c). On average, three participants work together on a project. The number of SMEs participating in the projects has increased considerably since 2012. This applies to both absolute and relative numbers and in relation to other types of organisation. SMEs now account for more than 60% of participants. The number of organisations in the "Other" category is still increasing too. These include public organisations such as water boards. Patent applications for renewable energy Figures related to the number of patent applications provide an indication of the results of efforts in the field of innovation. Figure 4.40 shows the number of international patent applications submitted from the Netherlands and a number of other European countries to the European Patent Office (EPO) or the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). As of 2011, there has been a downward trend in the number of patent applications in the field of renewable energy. This applies to most other countries shown in the figure. This may be a sign that the relevant technologies have matured and are now primarily involved in a scaling up phase.  Figure 4.40 Number of international patent applications related to renewable energy per million inhabitants (Source: PBL, 2019a) Patent applications per million inhabitants  Denmark Germany  The Netherlands  France  Belgium  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   The EU SET programme also examines trends in patents. It does so in a similar way on behalf of the various participating EU countries. Figure 4.41 shows the distribution of patents for the Netherlands per energy theme. This shows that the Netherlands is relatively well represented in patents concerning the themes of smart solutions for consumers, CCUS and energy efficiency in buildings. Figure 4.41 Development of the number of patents in energy technologies from Dutch applicants (Source: Pasimeni et al., 2018)         Number of researchers As previously explained in this section, energy-related employment is increasing as a result of investments in renewable energy. In relation to the NEV 2017, Statistics Netherlands estimated the distribution of employment created by investments in renewable energy and energy savings between 2008 and 2016, both according to product profile (energy technology) and process profile (type of work). According to this study, the number of working years for researchers resulting from investments in renewable energy and energy savings since 2010 amounts to over 3,200 (Statistics Netherlands, 2018)129. No data is available for the total number of energy-related working years of researchers in the Netherlands as a whole. 4.6.3 Structure of current energy prices and subsidies for fossil and other energy This section examines the different elements that currently determine energy prices for Dutch companies. Energy prices comprise three main components:  Energy and energy supply costs. Global market prices are discussed in Section 4.1. Prices for end consumers (consumers and businesses) are discussed in Section 4.5.3;  Grid (operation) and transport costs (detailed below);  Taxes and levies (detailed below). The distribution of these three components partly depends on energy consumption, applicable tariff categories and the type of energy concerned. As a result there are considerable differences in distribution: a rough indication for consumers is 15-24% grid operation, 30-40% taxes/surcharges and 44-51% supply costs.130                                                   129 Source: https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/achtergrond/2018/50/de-impact-van-de-energietransitie-op-de-werkgelegenheid 130Rough estimate based on various sources consulted in September 2018: Netbeheer Nederland, Energiemarktinformatie.nl and Essent. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   Taxes and levies The Netherlands applies a differentiated system of taxes and levies that have an effect on energy consumption. In principle, energy tax must be paid for electricity or gas supplied via the distribution network or a direct line, purchased on the exchange or obtained through other means. Consumers are also required to pay VAT on the applicable amount (currently 21%). The level of the energy tax also depends on the quantities of natural gas and electricity. Tariffs also differ according to the type of tax and per year. The tariffs are available in the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration tables.131 No energy tax needs to be paid for the consumption of:  Electricity, self-generated using renewable energy sources;  Electricity, self-generated using an emergency unit in the event of failure of supply from the distribution network;  Self-extracted landfill gas, sewage treatment gas or biogas;  Electricity, self-generated using a CHP unit. A reduced energy tax rate applies for natural gas used for heating in the horticulture sector. Natural gas used as input for generating electricity is exempt from energy tax under certain conditions, in accordance with the Energy Tax Directive. With regard to non-profit institutions and religious buildings, the energy tax applies a partial refund scheme. Pursuant to the Convention of Mannheim, coastal and inland waterways are exempt from excise duty, while a reduced tariff applies to other applications, such as for machinery in construction and agriculture. Under the Chicago Convention, international aviation is exempt from excise duty with regard to the use of kerosene. There is also a reduced energy tax rate for locally generated renewable electricity. If a cooperative or owners' association generates renewable electricity and supplies it to its members, the members would be entitled to the lower rate under certain conditions. One of the conditions is that the cooperative or owners' association must be recognised by the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration. In some cases, an energy tax refund may be obtained, including for block heating and for participation in a multi-year agreement (under certain conditions, such as sufficient progress). There are no subsidies in the Netherlands aimed exclusively at promoting the consumption of energy from fossil sources. However, these exceptions to the energy tax and lower rates lead to missed tax revenues that are characterised as a subsidy in accordance with the Definition of the WTO. This subsidy may lead more generally to higher consumption of both fossil and renewable energy. A list of related government measures will soon be submitted to the IEA for the in-depth review organised by the latter of energy policy in the Netherlands. Surcharge for Sustainable Energy An additional levy on energy consumption was introduced through the Surcharge for Sustainable Energy Act (ODE) on 1 January 2013. The purpose of the new levy was to cover cash expenditure related to the Sustainable Energy Production Incentive (SDE+) scheme. However, the ODE is not an earmarked levy. Due to the budgetary rules applied in the Netherlands, which prescribe a strict separation between income and expenditure, there is only an ex-ante estimate of the level of ODE income required to cover cash expenditure for the renewable energy incentive estimated in advance. This revenue and expenditure, determined ex-ante, is not corrected during the course of the incumbent government's budget period. The ODE is levied 50% on households and 50% on businesses. The tariffs rise annually in order to cover the estimated increasing SDE+ budgets arising from the target to achieve a 14% share of renewable energy in 2020. The tariffs are included in the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration tables (see link above). As of 1 January 2020, the distribution of the Surcharge for Sustainable Energy (ODE) will be adjusted from 50/50 to one third / two thirds, in favour of households. As a result, companies will contribute more to the subsidies for sustainability than in the past. With the design of the ODE sliding-scale, companies with relatively low consumption are relatively spared. It usually concerns SMEs with an energy                                                  131 See:https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/belastingdienst/zakelijk/overige_belastingen/ belastingen_op_milieugrondslag/tarieven_milieubelastingen/tabellen_tarieven_milieubelastingen?projectid = 6750bae7-383b-4c97-bc7a-802790bd11 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   consumption up to the first and second brackets of the energy tax. Larger businesses will bear a greater share of the burden of energy and climate policy. This adjustment was not included in the KEV 2019.  Grid operation and transport costs These are the fixed costs for connection to the electricity, gas or heat grid. Since 1 January 2009, transport costs for household users depend on the type of connection, also known as the capacity tariff. These tariffs vary per grid operator, per region and per connection.
