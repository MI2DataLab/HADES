INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 259   3.9 Dimension energy security   i. Current energy mix, domestic energy resources, import dependency, including relevant risks  In 2016, national production of energy sources fell by a total of 6.5% compared with 2015, from 36.1 to 33.8 Mtoe (Eurostat data). Separating the production data according to source shows that there has been a zeroing of generation of solids, a reduction of 30% from petroleum sources and a 15% fall in natural gas compared with growth in renewables of 1.2%. A slight increase can be seen in overall net energy imports between 2015 and 2016; in particular, imports of natural gas are increasing (+6.6%), while a reduction can be seen in imports of solid fuels (-13%), electricity (-20%) and petroleum products (-1%).

In recent years, the increasing percentage of RES and the reduction in energy intensity have contributed to a reduction in our country's dependence on foreign supply sources: in 2016, for example, despite still being high, the national energy requirements met by net imports was around 5 percentage points lower than in 2010.                                                                38 It is to be noted that energy dependency is calculated as the ratio between net imports and the sum of gross inland consumption and marine bunkerage.. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 260   ii. Projections for development with current policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)  The tables below show the projections for production of domestic energy resources and dependence on imports in the period 2020-2040 with the current policies. As is evident, energy dependency decreases significantly, from the current 77.7% to 75.4% in 2030 and 74.6% in 2040.
