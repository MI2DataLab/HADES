INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 128   3 POLICIES AND MEASURES   3.1 Dimension decarbonisation   3.1.1 GHG emissions and removals  i. Policies and measures to achieve the target set under Regulation (EU) 2018/842 as referred in point 2.1.1 and policies and measures to comply with Regulation (EU) 2018/841, covering all key emitting sectors and sectors for the enhancement of removals, with an outlook to the long-term vision and goal to become a low emission economy and achieving a balance between emissions and removals in accordance with the Paris Agreement  In order to meet the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the period 2021-2030, equal to -33% in relation to 2005, as provided for by Regulation (EU) 2018/842, Italy will make use of various existing measures as well as new policies which will be introduced. The sectors responsible for greenhouse gas emissions and removals that fall within the scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 are transport, housing, the services sector, industry not falling within the emissions trading system (ETS) sector, waste, agriculture and the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector. As regards the policies and the measures aimed at decarbonisation of transport and energy efficiency in the housing sector, services sector and industry not falling within the ETS sector, please refer to the relevant sections of this plan below. As regards waste, agriculture and the LULUCF sector, the main policies and measures identified for achieving the necessary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 are given below.  Circular economy and waste In general, policies to mitigate climate change have until now been focused on energy efficiency, rather than on the efficiency of materials as a primary driver of improving technical performance. Given the cross-cutting nature of the circular economy, it is necessary to draw up a general strategic plan that identifies specific areas of intervention and the sectors that have the greatest impact. At the same time, the plan must ensure consistency and synergies with other policies planned. Given the specific characteristics of Italy, attention must be paid to the manufacturing, food, textiles, construction and transport sectors. Recent international studies (https://www.resourcepanel.org/) are starting to look more closely at the efficient use of materials and their potential contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Some studies have identified the following strategies to that end: - extending the service life of products - reuse-repair - opting for less carbon-intensive materials at production stage  - reducing materials used and opting for lighter materials - improving the production process - sharing goods  - industrial symbiosis  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 129   - recycling and end-of-waste status By way of example, Ministerial Decree No 62 of 15 May -of-waste -based plastics, super-absorbent polymers and pulp derived from the recovery of absorbent hygiene product waste cease to be classified as waste within the meaning of, and pursuant to, Article 184-ter of Legislative Decree No 152 of 3 April 2006. This is an innovative technological process enabling valuable secondary raw materials to be extracted when recycling used absorbent hygiene products, thus cutting out the emissions that would be caused if the products were dumped in landfill or incinerated. The reduction of emissions in the waste sector is therefore linked primarily to increasing the sorted collection and subsequent recycling of the waste thus collected. In fact, secondary raw materials produced by collecting and transforming waste into new resources allow saving on emissions in a consistent way in relation to the use of raw material. The net gain depends on the kind of material (higher for aluminium and metals) and on the quantities collected. As regards the organic fraction of sorted collection, the subsequent aerobic/anaerobic processing for compost production enables the transformation into fertiliser rich in organic material of waste that would otherwise be disposed of in landfill, with consequent emission of methane into the atmosphere. Quantitatively speaking, the processing of the organic fraction of urban waste originating from sorted collection has increased from 2.4 Mt in 2007 to 5.9 Mt in 2017. Therefore, in the last ten years, 3.5 Mt of organic waste has been intercepted with sorted collection and processed in order to produce compost, preventing it from being transferred to landfill. In the future, sorted collection of organic waste is expected to increase. This is partly a result of the new EU-wide obligation to recover such waste, which can be recycled for use in the production of fertilisers. The development of local systems for processing organic waste will also contribute to reducing emissions, by reducing the need to transport the waste over long distances to centralised plants.  In this context, from a quantitative perspective and with due regard for existing legislation, there has been a progressive increase in the number of organic waste processing plants. Here, organic waste is transformed into fertilisers that enrich the soil with organic substances, replacing mineral fertilisers. The processing of residual fractions of waste that are sent to sorting and stabilisation plants further contributes to reducing emissions into the atmosphere. In relation to 2003 (year of issue of the decree transposing the Landfill Directive), Italy has succeeded in creating capacity for processing of residual fractions, covering almost the total national requirement. In this way, the residual waste is stabilised before being transferred to landfill, reducing the biogas emissions thereof. Improvement of the overall management of waste in relation to the composition (increase in sorting), and to the quantity of waste disposed of in landfill, following the transposal of European Directive 1999/31/EC on landfill, with Italian Legislative Decree No 36 of 13 January 2003, caused a reduced impact linked to the waste sector. This dynamic may be encouraged by new measures to promote the recycling of organic waste (Italian Prime Ministerial Decree of 7 March 2016) and other waste (End of Waste decrees) consistent with the updating of the relevant legislation. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 130   As increase national performance in terms of collecting and recycling waste, concurrently reducing the quantities of waste disposed of in landfill. The new legislation that is being competences, responsibilities and incentives in order to fully implement the new objectives. This has resulted in the approval of Decree-Law No 34 of 30 April 2019 (Growth Decree-Law) and Law No 141 of 12 December 2019 transposing Decree-Law No 111 of 14 October 2019. This represents a first step towards promoting the circular economy. Law No 141 of 12 December 2019 introduced the following measures:  - in order to reduce the production of waste and GHGs, a non-repayable economic  million for 2019-in city shops; here loose or on-draught products are sold, starting with smaller establishments  - mangiaplastica million has been allocated for 2019-2024 to provide municipalities -dispose of their used plastic bottles in exchange for a voucher; - to launch information, training and awareness-raising campaigns in schools, a specific fund  million allocated for 2020-2022. The Legislative Decree on Growth has set out provisions on waste and packaging. A business selling a certain commodity can give the buyer a voucher to redeem against the price of future purchases. The discount is equal to 25% of the price of the packaging containing the goods and is granted on return of the packaging in question. The seller re-using the packaging, or sorting it to be sent for recycling, receives a tax credit equal to double the amount granted  million for 2020. In addition, for 2020 the Growth Decree-Law provides for a contribution equal to 25% of the purchase cost of:  a) semi-finished and finished products which are 75% made up of recycled waste and scrap; b) quality compost derived from the processing of sorted organic waste. If the purchasers are self-employed or businesses and use the commodity for the exercise of their economic and professional activity, the contribution due to them is granted in the form  million for 2020. If the purchasers do not use the goods for their economic and  million for 2020. In this case, the contribution is paid in advance by the vendor in the form of a discount on the sales price, and then reimbursed to that vendor in the form of a tax credit in the same amount.    INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 131    Production of electricity Italy has planned gradual termination of production of electricity with carbon by 2025, with the first significant step by 2023, compensated, in addition to the sharp increase in renewable energy, by a plan for changing infrastructures (to flexible generation, networks and storage systems) to be carried out in the coming years. The implementation of these two processes in parallel is vital to ensure that the result is achieved in safe conditions for the energy system. Despite the limited amount of thermoelectric production from carbon in Italy, in comparison to other European countries (an amount that is however still higher than 30 TWh/year and above the levels of the early 2000s), it is clear that decarbonisation can and must go hand in hand with the safety and cost-effectiveness of supply, exactly in the spirit of this integrated plan. Initial identification of the infrastructural work necessary has been carried out by Terna (Italian transmission system operator) on the basis of consolidated analysis methodologies and is contained in the National Energy Strategy 2017. In fact, without prejudice to the need to accelerate growth of renewable energies, in the context of the overall measures (storage, networks, flexible generation, other network operations) to be implemented by the target year 2030, some infrastructure changes are linked in particular to the phasing out of carbon and, in particular, are to be launched in the period 2020-2025: - new gas capacity for around 3 GW, of which around 50% is substantially linked to the phase-out, in line with regional planning and regulations (on landscape and the environment), and new storage systems for 3 GW in the centre south and south zones, and in Sicily; - the reinforcement of the transmission network in the Brindisi plant to ensure operational safety (already authorised by the Ministry of Economic Development and by the Ministry of the Environment and in the process of implementation); - the new line along the Adriatic coast, with transport capacity of at least 1 GW; - the installation of at least 3000 MVAR of new synchronous condensers, in particular in the south and centre-south zones, to tackle the consequent requirements arising from voltage regulation; - for the phasing-out of coal in Sardinia, a new electricity interconnection between Sardinia, Sicily and the continent is being looked into, along with new capacity for gas generation or storage capacity of 400 MW located on the island and the installation of condensers for at least 250 MVAR.  For the purposes of energy transition, the new capacity for gas-fuelled generation (with a resulting temporary increase in gas consumption, with no associated infrastructural development envisaged for the time being) will help cover the needs and maintain the adequacy of the system in the next few years. More specifically, taking into account the phase-out of coal-fired power stations, in view of their intrinsic characteristics (potential to respond quickly and for prolonged periods to wide ranges of electrical load), gas-fuelled power stations will ensure the flexibility the system needs, compensating for the significant increase in non-plannable renewable production and ensuring that the system maintains its levels of safety, security, adequacy, resilience and quality of service.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 132   Discussions will be held to assess the infrastructural changes that might be needed in order to phase out coal from electricity production in sectoral working groups (by electricity market zone, by site and one for Sardinia specifically). These will involve operators, local authorities, Terna, the social partners and environmental and trade associations. The aim of the discussion groups is to assess the technical and regulatory conditions, the infrastructure needed, and the ways in which employment can be protected (for which adequate resources have been earmarked). The network operations are to a large extent already included in the 2018 Terna Development Plan, currently subject to an SEA assessment by the Italian Ministry of the Environment, and in the Terna defence plans. The new capacity for gas production and the storage systems necessary will instead form part of the new investments in support of transition that will be invited through the capacity market, given that in the current situation, the price signals on the spot markets are not capable of sustaining the creation of new investments in a conventional way.  In 2019 the first two tender procedures were held, for the 2022/2023 delivery period, to allow the process of replacing coal-fired capacity or under-performing capacity with new, more efficient and flexible gas capacity. Considering the average time for authorisation of the Development Plan and the necessary time for planning, authorisation and implementation of the operations, it is necessary to monitor the process, including in terms of the volumes of renewable energy that will be developed in the meantime, and introduce actions for acceleration, so as to have and provide certainty about the time frame of the process. A first verification step may be in place at the end of 2020, the date on which the authorisation proceedings, for the principal works at least, will need to have been concluded. Considering the importance, including from a territorial and social perspective, of this change, the Italian government and the Ministry of Economic Development in particular and representatives of regional and local bodies, also evaluating possible site developments, again for energy purposes and related supporting activities.  Agriculture Agriculture and animal husbandry represent significant sources of greenhouse gas production, consisting primarily of methane, ammonia and nitrous oxide. Ammonia emissions are determined principally by the management of animal waste and by the use of fertilisers. Emissions of nitrous oxides originate from the nitrification and partial denitrification reactions of the ammonia present in the animal waste, from the storage of manure, from the use of fertilisers, from the cultivation of organic soils, from agricultural management residues and from the microaerophile conditions typical of permanent dunging areas. Methane emissions are caused by the management of animal waste, biomass combustion, rice cultivation, enteric (ruminal) fermentation and by fermentation due to organic substances which are not digested and then excreted as waste. At a sector level, in the case of animal husbandry, effluent management (bovine, pig and poultry) is the business phase in which 50% of total agricultural emissions are generated. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 133   More specifically, in the field of animal husbandry, ammonia emissions are generated by the microbial fermentation undergone by the nitrogen present in the animal waste (faeces and urine) and which happens in all stages of management, from the moment of excretion in the barn up until the distribution in the field. In the agricultural sector, however, ammonia emissions are generated by the use of organic and synthetic fertilisers. Regarding the agricultural and animal husbandry sectors, the following actions have been identified:   Programme Agreement for coordinated and joint adoption of measures to improve air quality in the Po basin The Po Basin Agreement 2017 identifies joint measures and actions to combat emissions, including greenhouse emissions and fine particles. Regarding measures in the agricultural and animal husbandry sectors, the Italian Regions must, as part of the air quality plans, apply practices aimed at the reduction of emissions produced by agricultural activity, including coverage of structures for storing sewage, using the correct methods for spreading of manure and the burial of soil surfaces used to apply fertilisers, where these practices are technically feasible and economically sustainable. For biogas of agricultural origin, consideration must be given to the system for managing animal-husbandry waste liquids, and the end-use of digestate. This is especially important in areas which are vulnerable to nitrates and are affected by air-quality problems caused by the build-up of secondary pollutants deriving from the recombination of ammonia released mainly into the atmosphere by agriculture.    National code indicative of good agricultural practices for controlling ammonia emissions The code, which will become part of the national programme for controlling atmospheric pollution, takes account of the following factors for reducing ammonia emissions:  nitrogen management, taking into account the whole nitrogen cycle;  livestock feeding strategies;  low-emission manure storage and spreading techniques;  low-emission animal housing systems;  possibilities for limiting ammonia emissions from the use of mineral fertilisers.  The code provides mandatory measures for mitigating and reducing ammonia by means of: different use of fertilisers; techniques for spreading manure and storage. The optional mitigation measures are to be financed using European funding attributable to rural development policies.   Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 2021 - 2027 The measures indicated in the aforementioned national code are reflected in terms of both budget and application in the instruments of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which, in comparison to the 2014-2020 CAP, places greater focus on improving the environment. These measures will be viable in the period 2021-2027 and provide for: - reinforcement of the cross-compliance that will involve direct payments subject to more rigorous environmental requirements; - the obligation of Member States to introduce ecological regimes that have a positive impact on climate and the environment, but the use of which is optional for individual INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 134   agricultural companies, in the first pillar (direct income support for farmers and market measures); - payments for environmental and climate-related undertakings, and other undertakings relating to management, in the second pillar (rural development).   Promotion of CO2 sequestration measures in agricultural soils and forest systems  With due consideration for the outcome of the public consultation, an assessment will be made of potential measures to promote initiatives aimed at CO2 sequestration in agricultural soils and forest systems (soils, subterranean and above-ground biomass, wood, etc.). This will also take into account potential payment measures for ecosystem services for forestry and those linked to agricultural soils and to herbaceous (arable, etc.) and arboreal farming systems.  LULUCF As regards the forestry sector, the following actions have been identified:   Preparation of the Annual Report on Italian Forests The report foresees consolidation of up-to-date understanding of Italian forests in every aspect: natural, productive, economic, etc. Collection of information from all of the stakeholders involved is also envisaged, including the Regions, regional bodies, ISTAT, and the economic and scientific sector.   Consolidated Law on Forests and Forest Supply Chains On 3 April 2018, the new Italian Consolidated Law in relation to forests and forest supply chains (TUFF) was enacted, with Legislative Decree 34/2018, which repeals Legislative Decree advice and guidelines to support regional administrations in relation to forestry management. The TUFF updates the coordination arrangements and the national guidelines in relation to Sustainable Forestry Management and development of forestry supply chains. In order to create a concrete and uniform national forestry policy, nine implementing decrees are envisaged to identify minimum criteria and guidelines for the sector, including, for example, training of workers, entering competent companies onto a register, recognising the status of the forests as abandoned cultivated land, guidelines for management and forestry planning. With this measure, the goal is to recognise Sustainable Forestry Management as a tool aimed at ensuring an increase in carbon absorption, including in the production of quality timber products. In this context, over a period of ten years, a progressive change of the utilisation rates recorded thus far is envisaged, increasing from the current 30-33% to a possible 40-45%.   White paper on the forests of Italy In order to support the process of drafting a new national forestry strategy, the white paper on the forests of Italy has been published and is open for consultation, with the aim of providing support to the establishment of the new National Forestry Strategy (NFS). The white paper collects and summarises the views, requirements and needs of civil and business society and the scientific and institutional world on the role of the forestry sector. The goal is to contribute to making the new NFS consistent and effective in fulfilling the needs of the INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 135   forestry sector, consistent with European recommendations and international commitments in relation to mitigation of and adapting to climate change, in order to guarantee stability and well-being for present and future generations.  Cross-cutting instruments and other measures Other than those established on a sectoral level, further policies and measures that contribute to ESR objectives are listed below:   Transposition of Regulation (EU) No 2016/2284 Italian Legislative Decree No 81/2018, transposing Directive (EU) No 2016/2284, provides for the reduction of certain atmospheric pollutants (sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds, ammonia and fine particulate matter) by means of:  the drawing up, adopting and implementing of national air pollution control programmes in conjunction with policies adopted in relation to climate change;  the creation of a national emissions inventory and national emission projections;  monitoring of emissions not subject to a requirement for reduction;  monitoring of the impacts on ecosystems.   Italian Ministerial Decree No 186 of 7 November requirements, procedures and responsibilities for issuing a certificate for heat generators  The Decree establishes the requirements, procedures and responsibilities for issuing an environmental certificate for heat generators powered by firewood, charcoal and combustible biomass. The Decree identifies, additionally, the emission performance standards for different quality classes, the related test methods and checks to be carried out for the purposes of issuing the environmental certification, and specific obligations relating to guidance to be provided about the correct methods of installation and management of heat generators which have obtained the environmental certificate.  Implementation of Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 In order to reduce emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases that occur during operations for the installation, maintenance, repair and dismantling of equipment that contain these gases, the new Italian Presidential Decree adopted in November 2018 provides for the adaptation of the certification system for natural persons and for companies that carry out information relating to sales of fluorinated greenhouse gases and of equipment containing these gases, as well as all of the registrations relating to operations for the installation, maintenance, repair and dismantling of such equipment.   Environmental Code The Environmental Code represents a tool, already active today on a national level, which contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by means of: a) implementation of procedures for Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and for Integrated Environmental Authorisation (IPPC); b) providing of soil conservation measures and combating desertification, protecting INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 136   water from pollutants and digestion of water resources; c) management of waste and remediation of contaminated sites; d) air pollution prevention and reduction of emissions into the atmosphere; e) compensation for environmental damage.   Fund for energy transition in the industrial sector  Decree-Law No 101 of 3 September ort energy transition in sectors or sub-sectors that are considered to be at a high risk of re-localisation of carbon emissions owing to costs linked to greenhouse gas emissions being transferred onto the price of electricity. The fund is constituted by that part of the annual revenue deriving from EU ETS auctions that exceeds 1,000 million. This excess amount million per year  million as of 2021, will be used to fund decarbonisation and energy efficiency measures in the industrial sector.  Possible effects of the plan on air quality  The need to link decarbonisation and air quality improvement objectives and measures is explicitly provided for in the Governance Regulation. In this context, at national level Legislative Decree No 81 of 30 May 2018, transposing Directive 2016/2284, provides for the implementation of the National Plan for Air Pollution Control (NPAPC). The Plan must be drawn up by the Ministry of the Environment, with the support of ISPRA and ENEA, to produce scenarios for the expected situation in 2020 and 2030 in terms of emissions and air quality.  The NPAPC was drawn up in line with the instructions contained in Directive 2016/2284 (Annex III, Part 1) and sent, in draft version, to the European Commission within the deadline indicated. In accordance with the laws in force, in drafting the INECP and the NPAPC the competent Ministries aimed to ensure consistency in terms of the analytical basis and the packages of measures, in line with the various timelines envisaged for the two plans. In concrete terms, the NPAPC adopts hypotheses on consumption and levels of production that are in line with the energy and the environment scenarios envisaged in the INECP. Consequently, in addition their impact on climate-changing emissions, the measures considered in the NPAPC guarantee significant reductions in the pollutants targeted by the Plan, namely nitric oxide, sulphur dioxide, particulate air pollution and non-methane volatile organic compounds. As regards ammonia, further measures have been drawn from the code of good agricultural practice drawn up by the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policy (for more details see Tables 11, 12, 13 and 14 of Chapter 8 of the NPAPC). -and 2030, shown below in table form, have been produced for all of the pollutants mentioned (Chapter 6 of the NPAPC). As can be seen, the implementation of the measures in the plan will result in compliance with all the reduction targets set out in the National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive.    INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 137      Table 26: Reduction in emissions by 2030  The integrated policies for decarbonisation and air-quality improvement were recently supplemented by two other provisions. In June Prime , six Ministries, and the Regions and Autonomous Provinces, the plan contains measures on transport, agriculture and biomass-fuelled domestic heating, the sectors most responsible for the current high levels of pollution. The plan covers two years and contains measures targeting both air quality and decarbonisation. These measures are broken down into five areas, four thematic and one cross-cutting:  Agriculture, with measures for reducing ammonia emissions and limiting the burning of plant residues. Specifically:  in the framework of future rural development programmes, forms of funding will be linked to ammonia emissions reduction, in order to guarantee, for the 2021-2027 programming period, an increased use of such measures among farmers, with a concurrent reduction in polluting emissions;  amendment of Legislative Decree No 152/2006, which is intended to limit the practice of burning plant residues, also with a view to recovering and utilising those residues.  Mobility, with the introduction of environmental criteria for non-urban traffic, limited to sections of motorway adjacent to urban centres and within the scope of limited traffic Table 25: Reduction in emissions by 2020  NEC Directive  target by 2020 2020 scenario no measures  2020 scenario with NPAPC measures  SO2 -35% -61% -70% NOx -40% -43% -47% PM2.5 -10% -17% -23% NMVOC -35% -35% -41% NH3 -5% -7% -8%   NEC Directive target by 2030 2030 scenario no  measures 2030  scenario with NPAPC measures  SO2 -71% -73% -80% NOx -65% -63% -70% PM2.5 -40% -33% -42% NMVOC -46% -43% -50% NH3 -16% -11% -17%  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 138   zones, with disincentives for the use of highly polluting vehicles. Specifically:  proposed amendment of Legislative Decree No 285 of 30 April 1992, designed to introduce environmental criteria for the adoption of traffic reduction provisions, limited to sections of motorway adjacent to urban centres and with particular reference to speed limits;    proposed amendment of the existing legislation in order to explicitly provide for the possibility of using devices to monitor limited traffic zones, including within those areas and not only at gateway points;  adoption of guidelines for classifying hybrid electric vehicles in order to allow national and regional authorities, as part of incentives programmes, to channel those incentives towards hybrid electrical technology with a lower environmental impact;   adoption of a decree authorising the experimental circulation of largely electric-powered personal mobility vehicles, such as Segways, hoverboards and scooters, in cities.  introduction of bonus/malus criteria to disincentivise the use of highly polluting vehicles;  publication on the institutional website of guidelines and good practices to promote active mobility, especially for home-to-school or home-to-work routes, including by the Regions.  Domestic heating, with measures to reduce polluting emissions from biomass-fuelled stoves and heaters and to limit the use of gasoil-fired heaters, and to promote the training of installers of renewable energy-fuelled heaters. Regarding the measures designed to reduce pollution from biomass fuel, the following specific measures are envisaged.  Updates to the sectoral legislation to makes incentives to replace heaters fuelled by firewood, briquettes and wood chips conditional upon the certification of such solid biofuels, by the relevant bodies, as complying with the relevant technical standards (ISO UNI EN 17225 parts 3, 4 and 5). Also, compliance with appropriate forms of traceability and environmental sustainability criteria to ensure, energy production being equal, a reduction in the emission of pollutants and carbon dioxide;  Analysis of potential limits to the use of biomass for district heating plants in areas particularly affected by air pollution.  Phase-out of coal, envisaged by 2025 in Italy, with an acceleration for thermoelectric power plants in areas subject to infringement proceedings, by closing or transforming them.  Cross-cutting measures such as the reduction of environmentally damaging subsidies. In this context, and with reference to the planned phase-out of coal, the Budget Law for 2020 revises and increases the levies on energy products used to produce electricity. The sole aim of this measure is to introduce specific rates of excise duties determined on the basis of levels of emissions of greenhouse gases and fine particles. The increase, which applies to all fossil fuels, is particularly high for coal, coke and lignite. The exemption envisaged for non-chemically modified vegetable oils remains in place.  The second provision for the implementation of the national strategic plan for combatting climate change and improving air quality is Law No 141 of 12 December 2019, converting Decree-Law No 111 of 14 October  The Decree provides for the creation of a national strategic plan identifying urgent measures to combat climate change and correctly and fully implement Directive 2008/50/EC. In line INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 139   New planning approach targets both climate change and air pollution in parallel, with the aim of fostering maximum synergy between the two sectors. In addition, to monitor the steps taken as part of the national strategic plan and adjust them according to the results, the Decree establishes a permanent interministerial working group on the climate crisis at the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Natural Resources and the Sea. The group is made up of one representative from the Ministry itself and one each from the Ministry of Agricultural and Forestry Policy, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport.  The Decree identifies actions in the sustainable mobility and reforestation sectors, setting up special funds to provide the resources necessary to implement them. The measures identified include the following.  Incentives for sustainable mobility in metropolitan areas, setting up a special fund  million for  million  million  million  million for 2023  million for 2024.  EU infringement proceedings No 2147/2014 of 10 July 2014 and No 2043/2015 of 28 May 2015 for non-compliance of Italy with the obligations set out in Directive 2008/50/EC, who take for scrapping, by 31 December 2021, type-approved passenger vehicles up to Euro Class 3, or type-approved motorcycles up to Euro Class 2 and Euro Class 3 two-stroke motorcycles;   establishing, within the above-mentioned spending limits and until resources have scrapped. The voucher is to be used, within the following three years, to buy season tickets for local and regional public transport or bicycles, including e-bikes;  funding for projects creating, extending, modernising or bringing up to standard preferential lanes for local public transport 9LPT) million to be authorised for each of the years 2020 and 2021;   million earmarked for each of the years 2020 and 2021 to fund experimental programmes to set up and run a school transport service for children attending state and municipal infant schools and for pupils in their first cycle of state school, using hybrid or electric means of transport, selected by the Ministry of the Environment on the basis of the number of students involved and the estimated reduction in air pollution;   million for each of the years 2020 and 2021 for an experimental programme for tree planting, replanting and forestry and the creation of urban and suburban forests in metropolitan cities;  establishing Economic Environmental Zones (ZEAs) in areas within national parks. In such areas forms of support can be set up, in compliance with EU rules on State aid, for new and existing businesses that launch a programme of economic or investment activity aimed in particular at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency. The Budget Law for 2020 (Law No 160 of 27 December 2019) includes in the statement of estimates of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance a fund with an allocation of: INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 140   -  million for 2020;  -  million for 2021;  -  million for each of the years 2022 and 2023   million for each of the years 2020, 2021 and 2022 is intended for initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, develop renewable energy and energy efficiency, combat deforestation, and promote the geological capture of CO2 and sustainable  million for 2020, 2021 and 2022 is destined for initiatives in the ZEAs. The fund includes revenues from the auctioning of CO2 emissions allowances.   management of Italian cities and the spreading of good practices. To this end, each provincial capital can submit to the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Natural Resources and the Sea an application detailing projects to increase urban sustainability, improve air quality and public health, and promote sustainable mobility and the circular economy, on which work could be started at once. The projects included in the bid dossier of the city awarded the title Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Natural Resources and the Sea in the year in which the award us made, with a  million in the award year is a condition for all notices and tenders for environmental sustainability funding launched by the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Natural Resources and the Sea.   Planned transformation of the current Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning (CIPE) into the Interministerial Committee for Sustainable Development (CIPESS), within a year and a half. One aim is to carry out, in line with the Green New Deal, an extensive revision of the structure of State economic planning. Another is to redefine upstream the sustainability criteria on which economic choices and the selection of public works and infrastructure are based.   ii. Where relevant, regional cooperation in this area  With the regions with which Italy has embarked on a process of regional cooperation, the discussion will be based primarily on the exchange of best practices for adopted or planned policies.  iii. Without prejudice to the applicability of State aid rules, financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds, in this area at national level, where applicable  3.1.2 Renewables  i. Policies and measures for making the national contribution to achieving the binding targets on an EU level for 2030 in relation to renewable energy and trajectories, pursuant to Article 4(a)(2), where applicable or available, the elements given under point 2.1.2 of this annex, including specific measures by sector and by technology11                                                             11 When planning those measures, Member States must take into account the end of life of existing plants and the potential for repowering INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 141   The list of principal measures aimed at realising objectives relating to renewable energy, divided into the electricity, heating and transport sectors, is set out below.  Electricity sector The measures for the electricity sector will be focused on supporting the construction of new plants and safeguarding and improving the sites of existing plants. The measures are of an economic, regulatory, planning, IT and administrative nature, and are calibrated on the basis of the type of intervention (new construction or reconstruction), the size of the plants and the state of technological development. At the moment, offshore wind farming, thermodynamic solar power, geothermal energy with reduced environmental impact and marine energy are considered innovative; onshore wind farming, solar photovoltaics, hydroelectricity and sewage treatment plant gas are considered to be older technologies Among the older technologies are biomass and biogas, which nevertheless still involve high production costs, primarily due to the costs of raw materials. In addition, for biomass, the considerations discussed in chapter 2 concerning targets must also be taken into account.  Energy plants for individual and collective self-consumption: regulatory and economic measures The rules governing the collection of general system charges and electricity tariffs, introduced in 2018 as part of the plan for adaptation to EU guidelines on State aid for energy and the environment, provide, in themselves, a regulatory framework that favours instantaneous self-consumption. The collection tariff structure provides for the application of variable proportions of the tariff collective self-consumption, especially in cases where the use of existing public networks is preferred, the possibility of introducing direct forms of support is currently being examined. In this, due regard is being given to the benefits linked to distributed generation in terms, for instance, of decreased use of the network. In any case, the direct and indirect costs of promoting new systems of self-consumption, including collective consumption and renewable energy communities, will be monitored, keeping the equilibrium of the system under control. The aim is to strike a balance between the promotion of self-consumption and equal participation of electricity customers in covering these charges, which should show a tendency to decrease, particularly from the middle of the next decade. Work will also be carried out on development of the net metering mechanism (which enables the use of the network as a storage system), to promote rewards for plants on the basis of their quota of self-consumed energy, which can also be increased by installing accumulation systems, and for plants which go on to provide services to ensure the safety of the electricity system on medium- and low-voltage networks. In all cases, promotion of individual self-consumption will be aimed primarily at distribution plants for which, moreover, the simplicity and automated nature of the support mechanisms make them preferable to other tools which are more complex and expensive to manage. Further instruments to support self-consumption, both individual and collective, will be:  reinforcing minimum quota obligations for renewable energy sources in new buildings or buildings subject to major renovation, in line with the targets for near-zero emissions buildings; INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 142    progressive and gradual extension of the minimum quota obligation for renewable energy sources (which, as mentioned, is currently envisaged only for new buildings or buildings subject to major renovation) to existing buildings, starting with several categories such as warehouses used for manufacturing activities and service sector buildings. As an alternative to construction of plants, methods will be assessed for transferring rights to roof surfaces to third parties, with a renewable installation preferably for the service of the building. These last two points are also linked to similar measures relating to thermal renewables, detailed in the relevant section. On a preliminary basis, it is expected that the promotion of self-consumption by way of the above measures could lead to an increase in the consumption of renewable energy equal to at least 1 TWh each year.   Other measures for small-scale energy plants Other than the promotion of self-consumption in the terms outlined above, which in itself constitutes an important incentive for the construction of small-scale energy plants, further measures will be introduced both to facilitate self-consumption where possible, and to promote construction of small-scale energy plants, which enable production in the electricity network where self-consumption is not technically and economically viable, and, lastly, to facilitate achieving the other targets considered relevant at the same time. The intended measures are as follows.  To introduce simplified and homogeneous procedures for the construction, commissioning and management of plants, including expanding the scope of the uniform model, currently operative for certain photovoltaic installations with power up to 20 kW: it involves a mechanism which allows, with a single procedure, management of features relating to authorisation, network connection and accessing support mechanisms. These procedures, aimed both at new RES plants and at the reconstruction of existing ones, can also be extended to small-scale storage systems, as well as plants connected to existing points of delivery (PODs) whose contracted demand is greater than the power of the plant.   In line with the outcome of the public consultation, there are plans to extend the use of the Simplified Authorisation Procedure (SAP), which today can be used for individual plants with power between a few dozen and several hundreds of kW;  To promote the installation of photovoltaic plants in existing agricultural structures that do not fall within the definition of a building, including by introducing the concept of .  to permit the aggregation of small-scale energy plants to enable participation in procedures for accessing incentives for energy delivered to the grid (see the section on contracts for difference);  establish specific incentivising tariffs, for cases in which self-consumption is not viable, and provided that there is significant accessible potential and prospects for containing costs and the incentives themselves; combined heat and power generation from waste and residues from the Agri-industrial sector is of interest, in particular by means of plants forming part of the production cycle of companies. These allow, in line with the principles of the circular economy, the waste itself to be utilised and production cycles to be optimised, with smaller shares of raw materials in the secondary collection (in the case of biogas plants, advantages may be additionally gained in terms of use of digestate, found in areas vulnerable INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 143   to nitrates);  introduce rewards for construction of photovoltaic plants where the modules are installed as replacements for roofing containing asbestos. The first operational tool for incentivising small-scale (and other) plants was established by the Decree of 4 July 2019, the effects of which will be seen in the first part of the 2012-30 ten-year period, in particular with respect to meeting the first interim target of the series of objectives on renewables. A summary of the Decree is included in the section on large-scale plants.   Renewable energy communities To avoid inefficiencies in the development of the network, renewable energy communities will be promoted primarily by utilising the existing electricity network. They will help support the economies of the smaller regions, often rich in renewable resources, and will also make it possible to produce and consume renewable energy locally, including in situations where self-consumption is technically difficult. Renewable energy communities will be able to play an important role in terms of reaching local consensus on the authorisation and building of energy plants and infrastructure.  In addition, given their aims as set out in the Renewable Energy Directive, ways in which those communities can also provide support to families in conditions of energy poverty, especially where direct interventions (for example, self-consumption plants) are not technically feasible, will be explored. Renewable energy communities will be promoted in economic terms by means of direct support mechanisms for production, including by more than one plant (similarly to the general production support mechanisms) and for locally consumed energy. The benefits to be reaped in terms of network use in this last case will be taken into account, with due regard to the rights and obligations of the members of the community as customers. These set-ups will have privileged access to support mechanisms. Renewable energy communities will also be promoted through information on locally available resources (also making use of the procedure for identifying suitable local areas, as mentioned below) and on the opportunities offered by support mechanisms. The development of standard tools for setting up and managing the communities and for exploiting energy production will be assessed. Given that in Italy the first local trials have already been launched on the initiative of certain Regions and municipalities, these experiences will be reviewed and monitored within the framework of the INECP Observatory to assess the possibility of developing facilitation and support measures. In those local areas where it is possible and appropriate, the use by those communities of thermal energy from renewables will be promoted.  In the context of the transposition of the Renewable Energy Directive and in line with the transposition of the Electricity Market Directive, special attention will be paid to the relationships between renewable energy communities and citizen energy communities. These groups appear to have the possibility, in addition to producing, storing and consuming energy from renewable sources, of providing other services such as energy-efficiency services and electric vehicle recharging services. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 144   This last aspect will be examined to assess the potential of promoting forms of aggregation and cooperation in the production and consumption of renewable energy, as well as in the provision of energy-related services, including in the context of production clusters.  Large-scale energy plants (typically with power above 1MW): regulatory and economic measures   Contracts for difference to be established following competitive tenders We will continue to employ the mechanisms of competitive tender, which have already been trialled, adopting a neutral approach among groups of technologies with similar structure and levels of cost, possibly with safeguarding mechanisms where technologies deemed necessary to reach targets in any event are repeatedly unsuccessful, it being understood that one of the aims of this mechanism is to support market parity. The tenders will be for the purpose of entering into contracts for difference based on the overall value of the recognised tariff once of the difference between the tariff and the market price of electricity where the difference is positive; repayment on the part of the producer if the different is negative). This mechanism seems to be suited to pursuing the targets set, in that it enables pre-defined power levels to be programmed, providing certainty to operators and, at the same time, potential advantages also for consumers, where the market price of electricity goes above the recognised tariffs, a not unlikely circumstance if you consider that the 2016 tender procedures carried out for wind power were awarded at 66/MWh and lower values have been recorded in other European countries. This mechanism will be the principle tool for promoting the construction of new plants but could also be considered for supporting full renovations and improvements to existing plants, in cases where long-term contracts and administrative simplifications prove to be insufficient. In line with those intentions, in 2019 Ministerial Decree 4/7/2019 (RES1) was published, providing an incentive for almost 8GW (of which 7.4GW new) for renewable energy plants with a high level of technological maturity. The quotas are allocated by means of competitive procedures (tenders and registers, depending on the size) in six rounds up until 2021. The plants built are expected to contribute substantially to meeting the first of the renewable energy objectives. Competition between groups of technologies with similar cost structures is envisaged. The new wind and photovoltaic plants (to which the biggest quotas will be allocated) thus constitute a single group, in which the two types of plant compete on the basis of economic criteria only (for power equal to or greater than 1 MW) or environmental and economic criteria (for power of less than 1 MW). The same applies to the other group, in which hydroelectric plants and sewage gas plants compete in the same way, albeit with technological safeguards. For registered plants (lower than 1 MW) solutions with high environmental value are given precedence, such as one specific quota for photovoltaic rooftops replacing roofs containing asbestos, or installation in areas of low environmental value, such as closed and restored landfill sites. Installations coupled with charging points are also favoured, thus giving an extra push to electric mobility and smart and vehicle-to-grid charging systems. Where self-consumed energy exceeds 40% of production, a specific bonus is provided for, which also encourages the proliferation of energy storage systems. The aggregation of plants via specific priority criteria will also be favoured. Users can opt for all-inclusive tariffs, up to 250 kW.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 145   For plants with power equal to or greater than 1 MW, only the economic criterion applies, as mentioned above: the tariff recognised once the tender procedure has been completed will therefore represents the first concrete application of the criteria described above. The sufficiently high level of participation in the first tender and register procedure suggests that the tool could be a fundamental means of ensuring that electricity renewables play a part in meeting the objectives. This is of course subject to it being properly monitored and, if necessary  on the basis of experience gained  improved and simplified, along with any necessary simplification of the authorisation procedures (which also ensure the right level of liquidity and competition in the procedures).  Long-term contracts (PPAs) Italy intends to widely promote use of this tool, alongside contracts for difference, with regulations that encourage investors to enter into Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with parties interested in purchasing the energy that the plant will produce over a period of time long enough to guarantee the return on the investment necessary to construct a production plant, or to renovate or improve an existing plant. The Ministerial Decree of 4 July 2019 provides that a regulatory framework for the creation of a market platform for long-term trading be set up within 180 days of its entry into force. For this purpose, a study has already been launched with the aim of investigating the legal, regulatory and technical framework surrounding widespread use of PPAs. The need for the study comes from the fact that renewable sources with better residual potential (solar and wind power) are now able to be used at sufficiently low cost.  In any case, for these sources the energy production cost is ascribable to a large extent to the initial investment and not to the costs of the operation, as with traditional plants, where it is still based on the current structure of the electricity market. On the basis of the study, a reference nomenclature is to be developed, defining the possible kinds of PPA and the relative minimum requirements for entering into the contracts, with examination of the requirements of the different parties involved (large-scale consumers, traders, aggregators, producers, funders), and identifying possible barriers to be removed, of a legislative or regulatory nature. The ultimate aim is to promote the use of these contractual schemes without them resulting in charges for the State or for consumers.  In the first phase, the possibility will be considered that Procurement and procurement procedures for energy supply through tenders run by Consip, a state-owned company whose mission is to make the use of public resources more efficient and transparent, providing tools and skills to public administration to allow them to perform their own purchases and to stimulate a competitive participation of enterprises in public tenders. At the same time, the aim is to promote dialogue between the parties. First, by recognising production plant projects promoting the aggregation of potential demand, in particular from small and medium-sized companies. And second, by promoting the participation of potential power demand aggregators, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises and purchaser groups/consortiums representing end-customers, in line with the outcome of the INECP public consultation. The aggregation of supply from energy producers, including those using different technologies, will also be promoted.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 146   As mentioned above, the Ministerial Decree of 4 July 2019 will contribute to the development of PPAs. The Decree stipulates, in fact, that GME (the Italian energy market operator) must regulatory framework for the creation of a market platform for long-term trading. The aim is to promote the trading of production by newly-constructed renewable energy plants, either entirely reconstructed or reactivated, upgraded or refurbished, which started operating after 1 January 2017 and have not benefitted from energy production incentives. Non-economic forms of support are provided for, such as the classification of the plants (by GSE), the removal (by the ARERA) of any regulatory barriers, as well as an update of the guarantee of origin regulations, to enable its direct cancellation by end-users. The Ministerial Decree of 4 July 2019 provides that a regulatory framework for the creation of a market platform for long-term trading be set up within 180 days of its entry into force. For this purpose, a study has already been launched with the aim of investigating the legal, regulatory and technical framework surrounding widespread use of PPAs. The need for the study comes from the fact that renewable sources with better residual potential (solar and wind power) are now able to be used at sufficiently low cost.  On a preliminary basis, PPAs are expected to contribute at least an additional 0.5 TWh each year of renewable energy.  Common measures for large- and small-scale energy plants The scope of the renewables targets, along with the fact that increases in electricity production are expected predominantly from wind and photovoltaic sources, means that significant surface area on which to install such plants is needed. This consequently requires that the Regions be closely involved through, for example, the public debate mechanism, as is already the case for large-scale investments, including in the energy field. This, along with renewable energy communities, will raise awareness in the local communities involved, by informing and involving citizens and local authorities sufficiently ahead of final decisions affecting local areas. In addition to this awareness raising, crowdfunding measures and environmental compensation measures could contribute to acceptance. In any case, support mechanisms must help guide location choices, by prioritising installations with reduced environmental impact, such as in buildings and areas not suitable for other uses.  As the results of the INECP public consultation also showed, stakeholders feel it is necessary to ensure the uniformity and certainty of the time frame of the authorisation process, which also needs simplifying. Closer collaboration between the State and the Regions should also be promoted, including by adopting a standardised format for issuing authorisations at national level, making the time frames, methods and procedures the same. For large wind plants in particular, operators will be encouraged to carry out careful preliminary assessments involving local communities and economies, with adequate priority given to upgrading and renewing obsolete plants.  To meet these needs, the following measures will also be taken.    Sharing objectives with the Regions and Identifying areas suitable for plant construction The renewables targets, especially in the electricity sector, will be met chiefly through wind and photovoltaic energy. Adequate land surface will therefore be needed. While in the photovoltaic sector existing buildings and compromised areas not suitable for other uses will INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 147   be exploited, national objectives will be shared and agreed with the Regions under a national regulatory framework. This, in line with the need to protect agricultural and forested areas, cultural and landscape assets, and the quality of air and bodies of water, will set out criteria (again agreed with the Regions) on the basis of which the Regions themselves will be able to identify the areas that are suitable for installing renewable energy plants and those which are not. In this context, proper consideration will be given to relocating existing plants, the availability of renewable primary resources, shifts in demand, and the constraints and potential development of the network. The potential availability of renewable primary resources, shifts in demand, constraints on and development potential of the network and potential back-up sources will need to be taken into account. To achieve these aims, a computerised and interactive survey will be  and other areas suitable for energy production and not suitable for other uses (without prejudice to the criteria referred to above). This will make it possible to assess their energy capability. The identification of these areas will also feed into the coordinated development of plants, electricity networks and storage systems, with authorisation procedures made simpler and quicker (and coordinated with support mechanisms), given that information on the suitability of surfaces and areas will already have been shared and agreed on.     Ad hoc instruments for new plants based on innovative technologies For technologies which are still far from being economically competitive in Italy, or which have significant potential for innovation, procedures based on their specific characteristics will be implemented. The use of tariff instruments will be assessed by taking into account the state of development, the capacity for cost reduction, the exploitable potential, the possible contribution to reaching the target, compatibility with limiting the amounts due in bills, improvement of environmental performance and concurrence with other targets. Alternatively, and provided that the exploitable potential is considerable, instruments will be assessed such as contribution to investment, including from specific European funds, including those for research and innovation.  In this context a provision to support these technologies (RES2) is being drafted. This will complete the work of the support measures already activated before the new Renewable Energy Directive was implemented, and will incentivise, by means of the usual auction (plants with power above 1 MW) and register mechanisms (plants with power below 1 MW), sources and technologies not covered by Ministerial Decree RES1. These include conventional geothermal energy with notably reduced emissions limits and zero-emissions using total reinjection pilot plants, biomass and biogas. The possibility of incentivising other sources and technologies is being considered. In addition, in the context of the decommissioning of platforms and connected infrastructures already used for production from hydrocarbon reserves that are depleted, almost depleted or in any case unusable, innovative energy reconversion projects will be promoted. These include energy production plants fuelled by available marine resources (Ministerial Decree of 15 February 2019  national guidelines on the decommissioning of platforms for producing hydrocarbons at sea and connected infrastructure). Marine energy resources also appear to be of potential interest for a number of companies, on account of INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 148   their potential synergies with core activities. They can therefore contribute to a gradual move by those companies towards activities that are compatible with energy transition targets.    Smaller islands as test projects for higher levels of penetration of renewables and for electrification of consumption Italy has already started a process for the gradual coverage of the requirements of smaller islands not interlinked with energy from renewable sources. In this context, the Ministerial Decree of 14 July 2017 sets out specific targets for covering consumption with renewable energy sources, available locally for each island. It establishes specific incentives, the scope of which is defined by ARERA Decision No 558 of 6 November 2018 and is proportionate to the avoided fuel cost. The aim is to promote, for each island:  modernisation of electricity networks to allow in more renewables;  implementation of pilot projects designed to increase the use of renewables by using storage systems, developing electric transport, integrating the electricity system with the island water systems and with the scalable demand on the island. The public call for projects is being finalised and will allow experimentation with innovative technological solutions that could potentially be used in the national energy system.   Strengthening Guarantee of Origin framework The aim is to strengthen the Guarantee of Origin framework by promoting its use for PPAs and evaluating the recognition of such guarantees for all energy produced.   Specific measures for safeguarding and improving existing plants Achieving targets for renewables implies the construction of new plants but also the maintenance and, if possible, the increase of renewable production by existing plants. In this, the approach is to provide support primarily through measures to simplify and clarify the legislative framework, using support instruments only where such measures are not sufficient. In parallel, measures to safeguard the production of plants subject to bankruptcy or seizure by the judicial authorities will be introduced. The following actions are planned.    Revamping, repowering and reconverting Notwithstanding the contents of the previous section in relation to hydroelectric concessions, the specific measures of a non-economic nature for revamping and repowering existing installations include the following.  SAPs, setting criteria that enable actions to be taken to extend them and exclude or simplify EIA/environmental screening. In particular, for assessments of an environmental nature, an approach will be favoured which essentially evaluates the variations of the impact in relation to the situation prior to the revamping or repowering;  The setting of basic limits and conditions, compliance with which will result in simpler interventions (for example, replacing plant components, which do not alter the layout or the land involved), subject merely to communication of same. Also, clearer definitions of substantial and non-substantial variations in projects for new plants or interventions on existing plants.  More and better information on plant performance circulated by GSE, based on the INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 149   data acquired through the management of incentivisation mechanisms. This will help work towards:  o Promoting the dissemination of innovative technologies for smart performance monitoring;  o identifying, within similar categories of plants, potential measures to improve performance and to extend the useful life of the plants; o promoting the development of an operational cycle associated with the recovery of production performance and the special maintenance of plants in demise; o raising awareness among plant operators about how plant performance can be optimised.  Promoting the reconversion of some types of plant which, at the end of the incentives period, should in theory no longer be competitive on the market, into plants that better meet the needs of the system in its energy transition journey. This includes, for example, the reconversion of biogas plants to biomethane, already provided for in the existing legal framework. In this respect, diversification of the use of agri-industrial by-products with respect to the current regulatory framework, in line with the provisions of RED II, will be assessed.  This option, feasible for large plants, appears to be more complex for smaller plants. For these, especially those in the agricultural sector, forms of support will be promoted that are efficient and compatible with EU rules on State aid, with a view to safeguarding production. The biogas plants in question must also be able to make efficient use of livestock manure, for the purposes of a well-functioning circular economy To that end, the Budget Law for 2020 envisages the right to use an incentive on electricity produced. This applies to existing biogas-powered plants that started operating before 31 December 2017 and were built by agricultural entrepreneurs acting singly or in groups who do not benefit from other public incentives on electricity production. The incentive must comply with the sustainability criteria set out in Directive (EU) 2018/2001. To benefit from the incentive, the plants must use at least 40% in weight of manure and reconvert daily production in accordance with a programmable system in line with the conditions established each year by Terna SpA from 30 June 2020 onwards. The incentive will be established through the issuance of a decree by the Ministry of Economic Development in accordance with the rules on State aid.   Hydroelectric concessions Law No 12 of 11 February 2019 converting Decree-Law No 135 of 14 December 2018 gives the Regions authority in the area of existing large concessions. The Law provides, among other things, that where there is no overriding public interest in another use of the waters that is incompatible with their use for hydroelectric purposes, the Regions can grant concessions for large-scale diversions of water for such purposes to qualified operators on the basis of certain criteria. These include a) minimum improvements in terms of energy, production power and production potential to be achieved from the diversion, conveyance, regulation and supply of water and from the installations for generating, transforming and connecting electricity, with reference to the national strategic objectives on energy security and renewable energy sources. This includes the possibility of equipping the infrastructure with water storage facilities to promote the integration of renewables in the energy market. Also included are b) minimum thresholds in terms of environmental improvement and rehabilitation of catchment areas, in line with the catchment area planning instruments provided for in Directive 2000/60/EC on water policy. These determine a compulsory minimum share of any revenues deriving from the allocation to be channelled into financing INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 150   the measures contained in district management plans or plans for the environmental protection and rehabilitation of the bodies of water affected by the diversion. Within the framework of agreeing on and sharing national objectives with the Regions, referred to above, an ongoing dialogue with the Regions will continue in order to promote an efficient and adequate application of these rules, to ensure that hydroelectric power can help meet the objectives.  At national level, support tools will be made available where necessary. This will also help promote the building of new plants on smaller water networks, for example harnessing the geodetic drop from aqueducts. In addition, as regards the objective of simplifying authorisation procedures, the classification -legislation (Article 5 of Legislative Decree 28/2011). With reference to substantial modifications to hydroelectric plants, plant modifications that necessitate a revision of concessions will be clearly identified. In that context, Law No 12 of 11 February 2019 provides for the regionalisation of the ownership of hydroelectric works, at the date on which the concession expires or in cases of revocation or relinquishment of the concession, with the subsequent concessions for large-scale diversions of water being allocated competitive tenders. Italy continues, of course, to support the further harmonisation of the rules on hydropower concessions at European level.  Expected evolution of electricity generation The expected evolution of electricity generation from renewable sources is shown below, highlighting different contributions: in the first place, non-incentivised production, which will increase in the coming years and which is to be maintained and optimised by some of the measures previously described, especially revamping/repowering; then production incentivised on the basis of mechanisms currently in force and production related to the measure most recently put in place; finally, the remaining share which will have to be implemented using the measures intended for new installations.  Figure 24 - Expected evolution of electricity from renewable sources and main contributions (TWh) [Source: GSE]  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 151     Transport sector For the purposes of reaching the targets in relation to penetration of renewables in the transport sector, the following measures have been identified.   Mandatory biofuel mixing rate, up to 2022 Mandatory release of biofuels for consumption, based on a share system in which, inter alia, a bonus is recognised for advanced biofuels and biofuels from waste oils and animal fats. In this respect, it is important to adopt measures that are consistent Europe-wide, promoting the supply chain of energy based on biomethane, biofuels from waste oils and category 1 and 2 animal fats, safeguarding investments by biodiesel industries and further stimulating research and creation of innovative solutions. Lastly, support for the use of advanced biofuels is planned, by simplifying administrative procedures, transposing the end-of-waste provisions and promoting the advanced bioethanol segment.   Reduction of GHG emissions from fuels by 6% by 2020 In 2020, fuel suppliers will have to meet a savings target, in terms of GHG emissions in the total fuels released for consumption in that year, in relation to a reference value.   Incentives to meet the biofuel emissions quota using biomethane and other advanced biofuels: 2018-2022 Incentives to use biomethane and advanced biofuels for the purposes of meeting the existing obligation to mix fossil fuels with biofuels, through a system of collecting the biomethane produced, with issuing of certificates of release for consumption for a duration of ten years. The cost of the incentive is borne by the obligated parties (oil companies that release fossil fuels for consumption) and does not impact electricity and gas bills. It is envisaged that this incentivisation system will cover the predicted demand for methane in road transport with biomethane, corresponding to around 1.1 billion cubic metres a year. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 152     Obligation to use biofuels and other renewables in transposing RED II: 2022-2030 The drafting and issuing of an Italian Legislative Decree transposing RED II and subsequent interministerial decrees updating the decrees currently in force in the sector are planned. The main objectives are: updating the mandatory quotas for release for consumption of normal and advanced biofuels up to 2030; introducing differentiated targets for petrol, diesel and possibly methane; adding hydrogen from renewable sources and possibly fuels from recycled carbon to the list of biofuels and fuels that can be used for the purpose of meeting the quotas; establishing a link with the European database for monitoring sustainability; updating the multipliers to be used for the purposes of calculating the target; identifying the maximum percentages of use of first-generation biofuels; facilitating the use of pure advanced biofuels. The targets for different areas are as follows.  First-generation biofuel: the contribution of this category of fuels is expected to decrease, ultimately to around 3%. The possibility of introducing lower limits for certain kinds of biofuels will be assessed, with particular reference to those which could generate an indirect land use change (ILUC). From 2023, this sub-target will have to be split between petrol and diesel or fuel oil, including with different contributions, and possibly methane.  Advanced biofuels: the specific target provided for by the Directive, equivalent to 3.5% in 2030, is expected to be exceeded, so as to reach a sub-target of around 8%. These biofuels are produced from lignocellulosic materials, from non-food crops, residues and waste from agriculture and forestry, as well as industrial residues and waste. They represent a significant GHG saving of up to 100% and have almost zero ILUC impact. From 2023 this sub-target will have to be split between petrol and gasoline, including with different contributions, and possibly methane. To this end, the advanced biofuel sector will be promoted.  As a preliminary estimate, 75% of the advanced biofuels target will be achieved by means of advanced biomethane (0.8 Mtoe) and 25% by means of other advanced biofuels (0.26 Mtoe). However, that breakdown could change owing to the actual availability and cost-effectiveness of different types of advanced biofuel. For advanced biomethane the target of at least 1.1 billion cubic metres by 2030 remains. According to various sources (IEA, IRENA, DENA, etc.), within the EU the availability of biofuels will rise from around 3 Mton at present to over 20 Mton in 2030. This will be made possible above all by the greater availability of raw materials, such as industrial and agricultural residues and waste, algae and other non-food crops. In particular, agricultural production efficiency will be improved, reducing costs along the whole chain and recovering and fertilising currently unfarmed areas: the reduction in costs in the sector is fundamental for making advanced biofuels more competitive. In addition, research and development in the algae sector and for all technologies for converting biomass into advanced biofuels will be stepped up. Lastly, the building and operation of biomethane production plants will be promoted, encouraging investment in this area.  Annex IX part B fuels (used cooking oil and animal fats): the Directive imposes a ceiling of 1.7% (understood as a physical limit), giving Member States the possibility of increasing this value if amply justified. An increase up to 2.5% is proposed, with a final contribution equivalent to 5% at most (with double counting). This goal must be achieved solely with used cooking oil (UCO) and must give priority to UCO collected on national territory, respecting the principle of circular economy and in line with the new targets for the s have great potential for the production of biodiesel and hydrotreated INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 153   vegetable oil (HVO) for mixing with fossil diesel. On the other hand, the incorrect disposal of UCOs generates high risks of groundwater contamination and additional CO2 emissions released as it breaks down. It is estimated that only 40% of used oils are properly recovered, that is, a total of approximately 2.5 Mton in Europe; the other 60% could potentially be a cause of pollution. Measures will therefore be adopted to facilitate the recovery of UCOs and their transformation into biofuels, employing the flexibility provided for in the RED II Directive. The possibility of increasing the maximum ceiling introduced by RED II of 1.7% for Annex IX part B biofuels will be considered, also potentially for animal fats classified as category 1 and 2 by Regulation (EC) 1069/2009 if the chain of production, collection and processing is entirely Italian;  Electricity from RES in the road transport sector: a gradual increase is expected, from year to year, in new registrations of electric cars as well, in order to reach the cumulative target of around 4 million electric cars or electric vehicles by 2030, which, if added to plug-in hybrid cars, would reach a total of approximately 6 million electric cars 2030. Projections for the development of electric transport are linked to the expected technological improvements in batteries and will therefore be constantly monitored as part of periodic updates.   Non-organic renewable fuels: the contribution of hydrogen in 2030 is realistically expected to be around 1% of the RES transport target, through direct use in hydrogen cars and buses as well as trains (for some non-electrified lines) or through the introduction of methane into the network, in that, within certain mixing thresholds (some studies indicate 5-15%) it is possible to exploit existing infrastructures without taking any special measures. An indication of differentiated use could be 0.8% of gas introduced into the network in its unaltered state or reprocessed into methane and 0.2% for direct use in cars, buses and trains. Through research, development and demonstration, the production and use of hydrogen produced from renewable electricity will be promoted, as it offers the dual advantage of reducing fuel emissions and emissions from other refining products. At the same time, it enables the storage of excess renewable electricity generated when supply exceeds demand. as leader with future low-carbon solutions such as power-to-liquid, power-to-gas and H2 for transport. In power-to-liquid, green hydrogen reacts with CO2 (captured from the air or derived from waste) to produce a mix of hydrocarbon chains similar to those found in crude oil (and fuels).  Recycled fossil fuels (for example: plastics collected separately or fuel obtained from recovery of CO2 from steelworks): the contribution to the RES transport target will be (expected by 2021, according to the Directive), following the determining of minimum sustainability requirements for these fuels. The management and treatment of waste is a big issue for developed countries and, increasingly, in developing ones. The refining industry is developing alternative solutions to dumping and incinerating waste and plastic residues. One of the technologies being developed is anaerobic thermal pyrolysis to produce oil from thermal cracking, which can be used in refineries in partial place of crude oil. Legislative instruments to promote synergies between the refinery industry and waste treatment will be explored from a circular economy perspective.  advanced biomethane from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste and agricultural waste: the target of 1.1 billion cubic metres by 2030 for the road transport sector is confirmed. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 154   There are also plans to introduce measures to promote the use of biofuels in the railway, aviation and maritime sectors. These include use of renewable gases (mainly hydrogen). expected to be realised through the use of low-carbon renewable liquid fuel, which can be blended with traditional aviation fuel (under the ASTM D 7566 standard). The IEA predicts that by 2050 around 60% of aviation fuel consumed globally will be biokerosene. This new type of fuel, which meets the sustainability criteria set out in EU directives, enables CO2 emissions to be reduced, depending on the raw material used, by as much as 80% over the entire life cycle compared with traditional aviation fuel.  The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has involved operators in the sector (aircraft producers, airports and fuel users) in the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which aims to pursue emission reduction in the sector from 2020 onwards. Joining CORSIA is voluntary, but membership will become mandatory in 2027. RED II, published in December 2018, also incentivises the supply of non-food and feedstock biofuels to the aviation sector. The contribution of such fuels can be counted as 1-2 times with respect to the energy content of a conventional biofuel; they are thus recognised as one way of meeting the obligation to produce renewable energy. taxing flights and aviation fuel within the EU, in order to ensure a level playing field for all types of transport. In fact, fossil fuels for aviation are not currently subject to taxation either for domestic flights or international flights, even though some Member States apply passenger taxes.  already being used to produce renewable transport fuels (HVO), and when properly integrated can produce biomass-derived  Production development means bearing extra costs that are holding back investment decisions, given the uncertainty of the end market. At the same time, the lack of product availability has not helped demand to grow. To stop this vicious circle, it will probably be necessary to create incentives for use that take the global nature of this market into account.  The measures listed above will naturally go hand in hand with measures to promote electric mobility, described below, in terms of creating energy efficiency by using hydrogen as an energy carrier.  Heating sector In order to meet the mandatory national target in relation to renewable energy, the contribution of the heating sector is fundamental. The final gross consumption on a national level intended for heating and cooling is in fact around 56 Mtoe, equivalent to slightly less than 50% of final overall energy consumption. The principal instruments that are expected to be used to promote the use of thermal renewable energy sources are often integrated with those for energy efficiency and are already operational. These are:  tax deductions for energy efficiency measures and restoration of existing buildings, both also intended for thermal renewables;   INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 155    White Certificates system, including promotion of high efficiency cogeneration;  mandatory integration of energy from renewable sources in buildings;  contributions to municipalities towards investment in the field of energy efficiency and sustainable local development. All of the above measures, already operational at a national level, are better described in section 3.2.1.2. They are briefly detailed below, with reference to the parts relevant to thermal renewables, including the corresponding areas of development planned in pursuit of the 2030 targets for these thermal renewables.   Tax deductions for energy-efficient retrofitting and restoration of existing buildings Tax deductions for energy-efficient retrofitting of buildings are currently in place and have played a vital role in the development of energy efficiency and of thermal renewable energy sources in the housing sector. For thermal renewables, the fitting of solar thermal installations, heat pumps, geothermal installations in buildings, replacing existing winter heating systems, and biomass installations is made easier. As regards the fitting of installations using thermal renewable energy sources, the period 2014-2017 saw around 980 million of investments stimulated by this measure.  Figure 25 - Average annual investment in installations using thermal renewable energy sources in tax deductions for energy-efficient retrofitting of buildings (million  133.0 Solar thermal energy      Heat pumps Geothermal installations  Biomass installations  Tax deduction for restoration of buildings, introduced in 1997 and still in place, facilitates installation of solar thermal installations, heat pumps, geothermal installations and biomass installations in buildings.   'Conto Termico' (Thermal energy account) With Italian Ministerial Decree of 28 December 2012, the Conto Termico was introduced, an incentive for promoting the production of renewable thermal energy and, at the same time, to permit access by public sector bodies to energy-efficient building works and installations. The Thermal Account became operational in July 2013. In relation to production of heat from renewable sources, one or more interventions, listed below, carried out by public authorities and by private individuals, are incentivised:  replacement of existing winter heating systems with winter heating systems, including combined systems for producing domestic hot water, equipped with electric or gas 68.3 40.4 3.5 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 156   heat pumps, using aerothermal, geothermal or hydrothermal energy, along with the installation of heat metering systems in the case of installations with useful thermal output greater than 200kW; the maximum limit for applying for the incentive is nominal total power (post operam) of 2,000 kW;  replacement of existing winter heating systems or existing systems for heating greenhouses and rural buildings with winter heating systems equipped with a biomass-powered heat generator, along with the installation of heat metering systems in the case of installations with useful thermal output greater than 200kW; the maximum limit for applying for the incentive is nominal total power (post operam) of 2,000 kW;  fitting of solar thermal installations for production of domestic hot water and/or for the integration of the winter heating system, including linked to solar cooling systems, for production of thermal energy for production processes or for networking of district heating and district cooling systems. In the case of solar field areas greater than 100 m2, the installation of a heat metering system is required; the maximum limit for applying for the incentive is a total installed floor area of 2,500 m2;  replacement of electric water heaters with water heaters with a heat pump;   replacement of existing winter heating systems with hybrid heat pump systems. In 2017, requests were present for around 40 000 fittings of installations using renewable energy sources, equal to around 250 million invested. Figure 26 - Estimate of average annual investment in installations using thermal renewable energy sources in the Conto Termico (million  144.7 Solar thermal energy Heat pumps Biomass installations   White certificates White certificates are tradeable assets which certify that a reduction of end -use energy consumption has been attained as a result of interventions and projects to increase energy efficiency. As part of this scheme, the development of projects that provide for use of renewable sources for non-electric uses is also encouraged, in relation to their capacity to increase energy efficiency and to permit savings of non-renewable energy. White certificates are issued for energy savings as a result of high-efficiency cogeneration installations, including installations using renewable energy sources and installations linked to district heating networks. As regards high-efficiency cogeneration installations, they record on average a volume of useful recovered heat that varies between 31 and 38 TWh annually, of which around 1.2 TWh 70.8 37.3 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 157   annually are on average an increase on the previous year. Of this annual increase, renewable energy constitutes a proportion varying from 40 to 140 GWh.  Figure 27 - Useful recovered heat from high-efficiency cogeneration installations (MWh)  3,750,999 2013 2014 2015 2016  Annual additional useful cogenerated heat [MWh] Annual additional useful heat from RES [MWh]   Mandatory integration of energy from renewable sources in buildings Annex 3 of Legislative Decree No 28 of 2011, transposing the RED Directive, identifies obligations to integrate energy from renewable sources in new buildings or in buildings subject to major renovation, in force from 31 May 2012. The requirements are currently fixed in terms of percentages (increasing per year) of heating, cooling and domestic hot water services. In particular, it is envisaged that in the case of new buildings or buildings subject to major renovation, installations for the production of thermal energy have to be designed and created so as to guarantee compliance with coverage, with energy produced from installations powered by renewable sources, of 50% of expected consumers of domestic hot water and of the following percentages of expected consumers of domestic hot water, heating and cooling:  20% when the application for the relevant building licence was submitted between 31 May 2012 and 31 December 2013;  35% when the application for the relevant building licence was submitted between 1°January 2014 and 31 December 2016;  50% when the application for the relevant building licence was submitted from 1°January 2017 (then extended to 2018). Where it is technically impossible to meet the obligation to cover the energy requirements of buildings undergoing first-level restructuring, the possibility for the owner to install the mandatory percentage in another building, including a building owned by others, or transfer it to the local authority will be assessed. In such cases, the local authority could then build up sufficient quotas suitable for interventions on public buildings will be assessed, as long as this 1,124,023 1,314,769 1,203,781 97,425 3,169 134,043 38,952 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 158   is compatible with the obligations deriving from the Directive on the energy efficiency of buildings.  Development trends for mechanisms to promote thermal renewable energy sources In order to track the development trends for measures to promote installations for the production of renewable thermal energy, it is necessary to consider emissions from solid biomass installations. Therefore, promotion measures will favour installations with high quality environmental standards that are highly efficient. In order to encourage revamp of old installations with efficient technologies and reduced emissions, the measures described will be updated, introducing more stringent performance and environmental requirements for biomass heat generators. The introduction of requirements regarding the substitution of obsolete heating equipment and periodic monitoring and maintenance obligations for biomass plants (telematic real estate register) will be assessed, as also emerged from the public consultation. For electric and gas heat pumps, a technologically neutral approach will be maintained, leaving the selection of the most efficient option for each application to the market, and also valuing their contribution in cooling mode, taking into account that in some regions of Mediterranean countries, cooling requirements predominate. As emerged from the public consultation, promotion mechanisms will be geared towards encouraging the widespread use of geothermal heat pumps. To promote the widespread use of solar thermal energy, the technology for which has not to date seen any significant growth, regulations will be updated regarding mandatory integration of a minimum renewable energy quota in new buildings or buildings subject to major renovation. In addition, in order to promote fitting of solar thermal installations that can handle the heat demand in a more flexible and effective way (for example by covering of hybrid systems as a part of the incentives. The obligation to integrate energy from renewable sources in buildings, which has had many advantages in terms of improvement of energy performance in buildings and increasing use of thermal renewable energy sources, as the results of the public consultation also showed, must now be made more effective in order to widen its scope and ensure its application in all of the cases provided for. In particular, there are plans to update the obligations system, making it simpler and immediately applicable, introducing for example a list of renewable technologies from among which the designer can choose, on a case-by-case basis and based on the characteristics of the building, promoting, as stated above, the integration of traditional technologies with renewable ones, including through the use of hybrid installations. When extending the scope of the obligation, links can be made with the existing promotion instruments, for the purposes of optimising the ratio between costs and benefits of the investments for fitting installations for the production of renewable thermal energy. On the basis of the results of the measures described above, and consistent with the measures for electric renewables, the step will be considered of introducing a mandatory minimum quota also for several categories of existing buildings, including tertiary buildings. Contributions to the municipalities for investment in the field of energy efficiency and sustainable local development INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 159   Decree-Law No 34 of 30 April 2019 (the Growth Decree-Law) established a contribution for  million for 2019, drawn from the Development and Cohesion Fund (FSC), to be channelled into investment in energy efficiency and sustainable local development. The contribution is allocated to each municipality on the basis of the resident population as at 1 January 2018, as follows:       to municipalities with a population of between 20,001 and 50,000;      es with a population of over 250,000.  The contributions are to be used for public works in the areas of:  a) increasing energy efficiency, including public lighting, energy saving in publicly owned buildings and public housing, and the installation of energy production plants fuelled by renewable sources; b) sustainable local development, including measures for sustainable mobility, upgrading and safety assurance in schools, public buildings and municipal property, and removing architectural barriers;  From 2020, for the above-mentioned projects, the Growth Decree-Law has authorised the implementation of a multi-year funding programme, with resources to be shared equally among municipalities with populations of below 1,000. In the Directo Decrees of 14 May and 10 July 2019, the Ministry of Economic Development set out the size of contribution for each Italian municipality and the methods for implementing the measure (eligible interventions, the contribution that can be granted and the methods of delivery, monitoring of the measure). The Budget Law for  million per year in total to the municipalities for investment in public works for increasing energy efficiency. Areas for investment include public lighting, energy saving in publicly owned buildings and public housing, and the installation of energy production plants using renewables. The subsidies can also be used by the municipalities for projects in the areas of sustainable local development, sustainable mobility, upgrading and safety assurance in schools, public buildings and municipal property, and removing architectural barriers.  In order to exploit the potential of district heating described in chapter 2, the instruments currently available will be upgraded to promote new construction and expansion of infrastructure for distribution of heat in urban areas, in particular in such a way that the heat generation hubs are close to the consumption sites. In this regard, priority will be given to developing efficient district heating, namely that based on distribution of heat generated largely from renewable sources, from waste heat or cogenerated heat (prospectively also biomethane-generated heat). To this end, there will be confirmation of the economic reserve to provide guarantees in favour of measures to create district heating and district cooling networks, included in the National Fund for Energy Efficiency, and the implementing decree, INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 160   already approved by Law No 172/2017, will be issued. This provides measures to facilitate work on installations which brings about an increase in the thermal production capacity for the purpose of maintaining or achieving the set-up of an efficient district heating system, and which is accompanied by an extension of the network in terms of an increase in transport capacity.  ii. Where relevant, specific measures for regional cooperation, as well as, as an option, the estimated excess production of energy from renewable sources which could be transferred to other Member States in order to achieve the national contribution and trajectories referred to in point 2.1.2  Regional cooperation on RES between neighbouring countries (Malta, Croatia, Austria, Greece and France) could be based on sharing projects for the development of plants at sea (off-shore wind, marine and wave energy plants) and on the broadening of support mechanisms. Regarding the statistical transfer that has been the subject of discussions, all the countries are open to this where feasible, in that it is a need that can only be assessed along the way. Some experiments to that end are undergoing preliminary analysis, in the framework of reaching the 2020 objectives. In this context, some countries have sounded out probably have with respect to reaching its own target for the share of energy met from renewable sources in 2020.   iii. Specific measures on financial support, where applicable, including Union support and the use of Union funds, for the promotion of the production and use of energy from renewable sources in electricity, heating and cooling, and transport  See point i.  iv. Where applicable, the assessment of the support for electricity from renewable sources that Member States are to carry out pursuant to Article 6(4) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001  Evaluation of the effectiveness of support for electricity from renewable sources and its principal distributive effects on the different categories of consumers and on investments will be carried out during the monitoring of the Plan.  v. Specific measures to introduce one or more contact points, streamline administrative procedures, provide information and training, and facilitate the uptake of long-term power purchase agreements. Summary of the policies and measures under the enabling framework Member States have to put in place pursuant to Article 21(6) and Article 22(5) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 to promote and facilitate the development of self-consumption and renewable energy communities Several elements are provided in section 3.1.2, point i. In terms of administrative procedures and points of contact, the following is specified. In Italy, from the early 2000s to the present day, there has been a progressive simplification and streamlining of the authorisation procedures aimed at permitting the fitting of installations for producing energy from renewable sources. In this time period, there has also been a significant change in the division of responsibilities between the bodies involved, with a greater decision-making role for the Regions, including in relation to principles established INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 161   by the State, in energy-related matters and, as regards renewables, in environmental assessments. The principal procedural paths provided in the existing legislation for construction of installations, differentiated according to their size and characteristics, are the Single Authorisation, the Simplified Authorisation Procedure and Communication to the Municipality. For some electrical production installations, a harmonised model is also envisaged, which allows a uniform and simple procedure to be used for everything required to create and operate the installation. These measures allow the interested party to always have a single point of contact in order to obtain the licence. In relation to training, Italy has already adopted a training standard for extraordinary installation and maintenance operations for electric installations powered by renewable energy sources, to give effect to Directive 2009/28/EC, and in cooperation with the Regions. Equally, as regards information, an information portal has already been introduced with information about national renewable energy incentives, about the costs and benefits of the system. As indicated in section 3.1.2, these activities will be reinforced by exploiting the wealth of data and knowledge available from GSE, which is responsible for management of the support measures, and from the ENEA, which fulfils the role of national agency for energy efficiency in Italy, starting dialogue with local bodies, consumer associations and SMEs, to make these groups more aware of opportunities and conditions for evaluating the convenience and the conditions for taking steps to improve energy efficiency and for self-consumption. Italy has also established a monitoring body with the Regions which has, inter alia, the objective of spreading good practice in terms of authorisations. In that respect, it is important to step up the involvement of the Regions and local bodies in the production and sharing of statistics, which also help interventions to be planned more efficiently. This requires the resources of the participants in the statistical system, including Terna, GSE and ENEA, to be strengthened. At the same time, this increased synergy must be reflected in the work of the Regions and local bodies, both in terms of statistics and of the exchange of administrative data (authorisations, proceedings under way, measures with an impact in terms of energy efficiency, etc.) for which data provision obligations already exist.  In addition, a preliminary exchange of information on regional policies on environmental and energy-related planning would be desirable, as happens with measures taken at national level, subject to the opinion or agreement of the Conference of the Regions and Autonomous Provinces. In essence, it is necessary, under a framework of national rules and regulations which are clear and as stable as possible over time, to establish more systematic and coordinated regulation, with harmonisation of the regional legal framework. This would reduce the risk of guidelines being adopted which depart from the national framework and differ fundamentally from one another. A useful tool to this end would be the adoption of a standardised format for issuing authorisations at national level which would harmonise time frames, methods and procedures. A process for benchmarking national authorisation procedures against European ones could also be useful in order to assess process performance, including by means of specific performance indicators. The public consultation also showed that the associations recognise the important role the Regions play in sharing the complete and updated mapping of constraints and requirements.  vi. Assessment of the necessity to build new infrastructure for district heating and cooling produced from renewable sources  As came out of the assessment report on the national potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating, in accordance with Article 14 of the EED INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 162   and drawn up by GSE, the economic potential for expanding district heating and cooling networks on a national level is currently estimated at around 900 km, in addition to the existing around 4 100 km. The economic potential relating to DH powered by biomass is equal to an increase of 0.7 TWh of thermal energy per year supplied to users, for an expansion of the networks by 253 km and 14 million m2 of heated space.  Table 27 - Economic potential for expanding efficient biomass district heating networks (based on 2013 consumption) [Source: GSE - Assessment report on the national potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating]  Climate condition area D Climate condition area E Climate condition area F Overall Total Incremental economic potential [GWh] 78 307 310 696 Incremental length of networks [km] 29 101 123 253 Incremental heated space [million m3] 2 6 6 14 Incremental thermal capacity CHP [MWt] 20 62 48 131 Incremental supplemental thermal capacity [MWt] 59 181 138 378 Incremental heat output CHP supplied [GWh] 35 136 137 308 Incremental supplemental heat output [MWt] 44 171 173 388 Incremental electricity capacity CHP [MWel] 4 13 10 28 Incremental electricity produced CHP produced [GWh] 9 35 35 78 Incremental non-HE CHP electricity produced [GWh] - - - -  120 102 103 108 Saved emissions [ton CO2eq] 4,481 17,577 17,741 39,799 Primary energy savings [toe] 8,970 35,182 35,511 79,663  For other considerations and further developments, see under point 2.1.2.ii   vii. Where applicable, specific measures on the promotion of the use of energy from biomass, especially for new biomass mobilisation taking into account:  - the availability of biomass, including sustainable biomass: national potential and imports from third countries  - other uses of biomass in other sectors (agriculture and forestry sectors); and measures for sustainability of biomass production and use 3.1.3 Other elements of the dimension  i. National policies and measures affecting the ETS sector and assessment of the complementarity and impacts on the EU ETS, if applicable  As detailed in section 2.1.1, by 2030, the production sectors that are part of the ETS scheme should record, in the scenario with targets, a reduction of emissions of around 56 % in relation to 2005, a level clearly higher than the aggregated European target (-43 %). INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 163   This differential is partly explained by the economic and energy trends, partly by the measures to be implemented. should in any event record a drop of emissions of around 45 %, as a result of, besides the quantitative constraints and increasing prices of CO2, the long recovery time after the economic crisis (in some sectors, the level of industrial production is still below that of 2005) and of the concurrent increasing production capacity of renewables (production between 2016 and 2030 should in any case increase by around 20%). The effect of the measures to be implemented will add to this trend. The emission differential between individual decarbonisation measures, is around 27 MtCO2eq. In particular, the process for the phase-out of carbon by 2025 is combined with the further significant acceleration of renewables, led by photovoltaics and wind power (by 2030 the increase in electricity production in relation to 2016 will have risen to 75%) and an increase in efficiency with limitation of industrial energy consumption.  ii. Policies and measures to achieve other national targets, where applicable  iii. Policies and measures to achieve low emission mobility (including electrification of transport)  For an extensive description of measures to achieve low emission mobility please refer to sections: 3.1.1. for measures relating to reducing emissions, 3.1.2 as regards the promotion of renewable energy in transport, and section 3.2 for measures for reduction of sectoral energy consumption. Below is a list of the principal measures which contribute to the promotion of low-emission mobility.  Measures referred to in section 3.1.1.   Progressive ban on use of cars that produce most pollution Italian Law 190/2014 progressive ban on use of category M2 and M3 motor vehicles powered by petrol and diesel (EURO 0) from 1 January 2019, and planned ban of use of category M2 and M3 motor vehicles powered by petrol and diesel (EURO 0 e EURO 1) in services contracts from 1 January 2018.  Measures referred to in section 3.1.  Incentives to meet the biofuel emissions quota using biomethane and other advanced biofuels: 2018-2022 Incentives to use biomethane and advanced biofuels for the purposes of meeting the existing obligation to mix fossil fuels with biofuels, through a system of collecting the biomethane produced, with issuing of certificates of release for consumption for a duration of ten years. The cost of the incentive is borne by the obligated parties (oil companies that release fossil fuels for consumption) and does not impact electricity and gas bills. It is envisaged that this incentivisation system will cover the predicted demand for methane in road transport with biomethane, corresponding to around 1.1 billion m3 a year.   Obligation to use biofuels in transposition of RED II: 2022-2030 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 164   The drafting and issuing of an Italian Legislative Decree transposing RED II and subsequent interministerial decrees updating the decrees currently in force in the sector are planned. The  main objectives are: updating the mandatory quotas for release for consumption of normal and advanced biofuels up to 2030; introducing differentiated targets for petrol, diesel and possibly methane; adding hydrogen from renewable sources and possibly fuels from recycled carbon to the list of biofuels and fuels that can be used for the purpose of meeting the quotas; establishing a link with the European database for monitoring sustainability; updating the multipliers to be used for the purposes of calculating the target; identifying the maximum percentages of use of first-generation biofuels, in accordance with Article 27 of Directive 2018/2001/EC and with the related Delegated Regulation on Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action (Regulation (EU) 2018/1999). In particular, paragraph 1(b) of Article 27 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 imposes a maximum ceiling of 1.7% for the raw materials referred to in Annex IX, part B, that is, UCOs and animal fats, leaving to Member States the possibility to increase that value where properly justified. The ceiling is expected to be increased (from 1.7% to a maximum of 2.5%) for waste vegetable oils, with priority given to UCOs collected in Italy, in line with the principle of the circular economy and the new targets set by the waste package. The contribution is expected to be 0.6 Mtoe in 2030. The real 2%, in terms of the contribution to the RES-Transport target, will be equal to 4%, owing to double counting. This expectation is justified by the large-scale production and use of vegetable oil in Italy (mostly olive oil but also oil from oil seeds) compared with the other EU countries, which means there is a wide availability and potential for collection and use of those oils for producing advanced and sustainable biofuels. When they are not properly collected and reused, these oils cause serious damage to the environment. Special measures will be taken to increase the quota of UCOs collected and used to produce biofuels. Italy uses over a third of all olive oil consumed in the EU and around a sixth of olive oil consumed worldwide. This justifies a higher quota for biofuels produced using UCOs in Italy, which needs to manage such waste intelligently, gaining economic benefit from it and protecting the environment.    INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 165   Figure 28 - Olive oil consumption in EU: 2010-2018 (in thousands of tons) [Source: International Olive Council]  Figure 29  Global consumption of olive oil: 2013-2018 (thousands of tons) [Source: International Olive Council]    The possibility of increasing the ceiling of 1.7% imposed under RED II for the biofuels listed in Annex IX, part B will be assessed, also taking into consideration animal fats classified as category 1 or 2 by Regulation (EC) 1069/2009, if the production, collection and processing chain is entirely based in Italy.    Measures referred to in section 3.2  Replacement of public vehicles used for the transport of persons   Funding for replacement of the road transport fleet used for the transport of persons INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 166   In the Stability Law 2017, the Italian government launched a significant funding plan for replacement of the road transport fleet used for local public transport for the period 2019-2033. It involves in particular electric and methane buses to supplement and replace the existing bus fleet. In discussion with the Regions and local authorities, it has also been decided to establish an inter-institutional political group for debate and consultation in relation to transport, composed of the Ministries for Infrastructure, Economic Development and the Environment, as well as the Regions and local authorities.   Mandatory purchase of alternative fuel vehicles by public bodies (beyond the first transposition of the DAFI directive) This proposes to accelerate the provisions set out in paragraph 10 of Article 18 of Italian Legislative Decree 257/2016 (transposition of the DAFI directive) stipulating that public bodies, organisations and institutions dependent thereon or controlled thereby, the Regions, local authorities and providers of public utilities for activities carried out in the provinces with high levels of PM10 particle pollution, when replacing their respective fleets of cars, buses and public utility vehicles, including urban waste collection vehicles, must ensure that at least 30% (by 2022), 50% (by 2025) and 85% (by 2030) of the vehicles purchased must be electric and hybrid with off-vehicle charging, powered by methane and hydrogen, and electricity and methane in the case of buses.  Replacement of private vehicles used for the transport of persons   Incentives to purchase more efficient vehicles with lower climate-changing gas emissions The plan is to gradually review the tax system on transport (registration tax, ownership tax, taxes on fuel etc.) and study further methods of financing for promoting vehicles that run on alternative fuels, in particular electricity. The possibility will be assessed of public contributions to the purchase of hybrid and electric vehicles, other than for retrofitting obsolete internal combustion vehicles. The first measures in this regard have already been introduced, having effect from March 2019 to December 2021, and consist of the granting of subsidy to those who purchase a vehicle with CO2 emissions lower than 70 g/km and an official price lower than 50,000. The subsidy is differentiated depending upon emission class (0-20 g/km and 21-70 g/km) and depending on whether the purchaser is at the same time scrapping a vehicle type approved in the Euro 1 to Euro 4 classes or not, and is between 1,500 and 6,000. The same law provides for the trial of innovative means of transport for personal mobility with primarily electric propulsion, including Segways, hoverboards and scooters. In contrast, the law provides, for the same period, for the payment of a tax for purchase of category M1, if the CO2 emissions are greater than 160 g/km. The tax varies 1,100 to 2,500 based on emissions. In addition, Decree-Law No 34 of 30 April 2019 (the Growth Decree-Law) established that anyone who, in 2019, bought, including via leasing, and registered in Italy a new electric or hybrid vehicle in category L1e, L2e, L3e, L4e, L5e, L6e or L7e and who took for scrapping a vehicle in one of those categories that they had owned or held for at least 12 months was that the vehicle taken for scrapping belonged to EURO category 0, 1, 2 or 3. This also applies if the vehicle had been owned or held for at least 12 months by a cohabiting family member.   National Plan for Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure (PNIRE) INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 167   The PNIRE, provided for by Law No 134 of 7 August 2012, aims to create infrastructure networks for charging electric vehicles and activities for the restoration of buildings aimed at the development of these networks. The Budget Law for 2019 also introduced tax deductions for the purchase and fitting of infrastructure for charging electric vehicles, valid from March 2019 to December 2021. The deduction was equal to 50% of expenses sustained, to be split into ten annual instalments. The PNIRE is currently being updated using an integrated approach, which also considers other measures to sustain demand for electric vehicles and to strengthen and increase the usability of the related infrastructure. In addition, the possibility of coordinating the development of recharging infrastructure with the plans to rationalise the fuel network is being assessed.  Regulatory measures Limits and rules will be introduced in relation to stopping, to access in certain areas and to parking. Local regulatory initiatives will also be evaluated and reinforced, including for example, limits on use of polluting vehicles in urban areas, with free access for alternative fuel vehicles and in particular electric vehicles in limited traffic zones, speed limits, priority lanes and car parks exclusively for zero-emissions vehicles. In addition, to disincentivise the use of private vehicles, it is proposed that local rules on access to urban areas be harmonised throughout the country. A first measure, introduced in the Budget Law 2019, provides that the municipalities, in imposing limits on access to several urban areas, permit free access to electric and hybrid vehicles. All the national and regional initiatives for developing the electrical recharging infrastructure should be placed on a system footing within the PNIRE framework, while at the same time:  making more recharging infrastructure available at service stations, on the motorway network and in existing buildings, by extending electrical fittings (in hotels, shopping centres, service stations, car parks etc.) and avoiding, where possible, the opening of a new POD;  simplifying the administrative procedure for authorising the installation of recharging infrastructure accessible to the public;  supporting electric public transport via a tariff regime.   Refuelling points for alternative fuels (DAFI) Italian Legislative Decree No 257 of 16 December 2016, transposing the Directive on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure (DAFI Directive), provides for an increase of:  charging points (public and private) for electric vehicles from the current 2 900, approximately, up to at least 6 500 in 2020;  sales points supplying CNG from the current number of around 1 100 to around 2 400 in 2030;  sales points supplying LNG from the current number of a few dozen to around 800 in 2030   Replacement of vehicles used for the transport of goods Italian Ministerial Decree from the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport 122/2018 provides incentives for purchasing commercial vehicles with alternative motorisation for transport of goods.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 168   Reinforcement of the infrastructure   Regional rail transport For regional railways, following an efficiency assessment the electrification of even small parts of the regional rail network and the doubling of the tracks of the major one-track routes will be promoted with a view to increasing safety and speed, thus making rail travel more attractive. The Government will seek close collaboration with the Regions in monitoring the network and, subject to consultation with them, will envisage entrusting to the Italian railway infrastructure operator (Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI)) some of the routes they currently manage.   Rapid mass transport systems The Budget Law for 2017 planned for the establishing of a fund, with an allocation of 1 900 million for the year 2017, 3 150 million for the year 2018, 3 500 million for the year 2019, and 3 000 million for each of the years from 2020 to 2032, to ensure the funding of investments and infrastructure developments across the country in spending areas relating to, among other things, transport, road systems, sustainable mobility, road safety, upgrading and accessibility of railway stations.  Modal shift in the field of goods transport In general, it is increasingly clear that steps should be taken to interlink the medium and long distances that have to be covered by rail or boat with local distribution to businesses, distribution centres, commercial areas and cities that has to be covered by road using means of transport that are clean and have a low environmental impact. There must be efficient distribution along the logistical chain, with public and private hubs (ports, freight terminals, railway stations, mass retail channels, industrial districts) connected to the railway, motorway and local network.   Marebonus The Marebonus provides for incentives to be given to road transport companies for adopting combined road-sea modes of transport.   Ferrobonus The Ferrobonus provides for incentives to be given to road transport companies for adopting combined road-rail modes of transport.   National Logistics Platform The development of the National Logistics Platform will be continued, aimed at providing services to all logistics and transport operators, with the objective of optimising processes through an increase of interconnection and facilitation of data management.  Modal shift in the field of transport of persons Measures for mobility management:   development of mobility for cyclists through cycle paths;  promoting shared mobility (bike, car and motorbike sharing with low or zero INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 169   emissions);  integration between sustainable mobility services (for example, parking structures for bicycles or car and bike sharing services close to public transport stops) and interchange parking;  promotion of smart working tools;  promotion of car-pooling;  development of ITS (traffic management, infomobility, smart roads).  Electric Road System (ERS): promotion, on the basis of the trials launched, of initiatives for potential electrification of the motorway network using ERS technologies that enable the use of hybrid vehicles for transporting goods or passengers, through conductive or inductive systems (eHighway technology).   Sustainable urban mobility plans (SUMPs)  These are described in section 3.2, together with the other planned measures for promoting sustainable mobility.   iv. Where applicable, national policies, timelines and measures planned to gradually phase out energy subsidies, in particular for fossil fuels  The importance of an intervention aimed at rationalising and eliminating subsidies has been emphasised several times at various G20 summits held since 2009. In fact, at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh in 2009, the countries committed to rationalise and eliminate inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels in the medium term, which encourage waste. In implementing this undertaking, from 2015, G20 launched a voluntary programme for peer review of national reports into fossil fuel subsidies (two countries per year: one with an advanced and one with an emerging economy). The exercise involved China and the USA in 2016 and Mexico and Germany in 2017. Italy agreed to be subject to the peer review by G20 producing a report on fossil fuel subsidies in 2018, in parallel with Indonesia. From an economic and environmental point of view, all fossil fuel subsidies are inefficient, in that they do not internalise the impact on the environment and on human health, and they constantly violasubsidies play an important role in defending social groups in difficulty or economic sectors which are vulnerable or exposed to international competition. However, as indicated by numerous international organisations, including for example the OCSE, it is possible to use economic instruments to help the most deprived sections of the population or production sectors deserving of support, leaving the price signal for energy and natural resources unchanged. It is clear that, in order to reach the target in the Paris Agreement to keep the global average temperature rise to below 1.5°C, it is vital that all countries proceed to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies (in particular petrol, natural gas and carbon), both direct and indirect. Additionally, at G7 at Ise-Shima in 2016, the countries identified the deadline of 2025 for phasing out the principal fossil fuel subsidies, inviting all countries to follow the example of the undertaking to phase out fossil fuel subsidies that the European Commission planned by 2020 in the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe. The G7 Environment summit held in Bologna under the Italian presidency on 12-13 June 2017 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 170   deriving from monitoring progress made towards the phasing out of incentives, including interested in exploring approaches that allow a better alignment of tax systems with  environmentally harmful and from the Ministry of Environment, an informative document for identifying those subsidies that damage or benefit the environment, thus suggesting areas of intervention and reform in order to reach the sustainable development targets provided by the 2030 Agenda and the climate targets provided by the Paris Agreement, enabling new financial resources to be made available for investment in the sustainable development of the country. Once those environmentally harmful subsidies have been identified, those that can be eliminated or reduced can be pinpointed, also in the light of EU regulations, accounting rules and the technical opinions of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, the Ministry of Agricultural, Food, Forestry and Tourism Policy, Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport and the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Natural Resources and the Sea. The aim is to enable production tools to be modernised and the creation of new innovative businesses and markets to be incentivised. In making this change, industrial sectors and citizens must be given clear goals and medium- and long-term milestones. In cases of reconversion of polluting or obsolete equipment, for example, the change will be made using the time frames set out in the amortisation plans of the sectors in question. Thanks to the identification of the subsidies, however, it is possible to develop new tax reform proposals which shift the tax burden away from labour and companies and onto activities that pollute and exploit natural resources, as advocated by the major international organisations.  According to the government study, there are several routes that may be taken. Some subsidies are relatively easy to reform; others need more in-depth work; some require agreements at a European level (for example those relating to differentiation of VAT, free ETS allowances) or on a global level (for example, fuel tax exemptions for international air and maritime travel, linked to the ICAO and IMO conventions. Among the many proposals being assessed, there is the possibility of a progressive, gradual reduction of environmentally harmful subsidies in the energy sector, with the reuse of the revenue recovered to reinvest, at least in part, in compensating and encouraging the ecological energy transition in the sectors directly involved and to compensate the economic actors who benefit from these subsidies in order to create greater social acceptability of their reduction/elimination. As an alternative, the recovered revenue may be used to invest in projects to combat climate change, to reduce the tax wedge on labour and capital income, or to reduce public debt. It is however emphasised that the financial assessment carried out may not correspond to the potential income that the government could collect or save if fossil fuel subsidies are phased out.  In June polluting emissions with a focus on transport, agriculture and domestic heating, was signed by the  , six ministries (the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, the Ministry of Agricultural, Food, Forestry and Tourism Policy, Ministry of Economic Development, the INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 171   Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Natural Resources and the Sea and the Ministry of Health), and the Regions and Autonomous Provinces.  Action 1 of the cross-cutting measures contained in the memorandum provides for environmentally damaging subsidies to be cut back, by:  setting up, within 90 days, an interministerial working group, with the participation of the Regions, coordinated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance to verify the socio-economic impact of environmentally damaging subsidies and identify those which are not necessary;  drawing up, by 31 December 2019, and presenting to stakeholders legislative proposals for cutting back on environmentally damaging subsidies and using the related resources for implementing air quality improvement measures. The Budget Law for 2020 provides that, by 31 January 2020, a Commission be set up within the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Natural Resources and the Sea to study and draw up proposals for ecological transition and for the reduction of environmentally damaging subsidies.   The same Law restructures and raises levies on energy products used to produce electricity with the specific aim of introducing specific rates of excise duties determined on the basis of greenhouse gas and fine dust emission levels. The increase, which applies to all fossil fuels, is particularly high for coal, coke and lignite. The extension envisaged for non-chemically modified vegetable oils remains in place.
