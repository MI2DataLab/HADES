 26  2 NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS  2.1  DIMENSION DECARBONISATION 2.1.1 GHG emissions and removals   Binding national target for GHG emissions and annual binding national limits pursuant to Effort Sharing Regulation Through the ratification of the Paris Agreement, Malta reaffirmed its commitment to address climate issues to their fullest 40% reduction of its GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.  Malta is bound to reduce its GHG emissions by 19% below its 2005 emissions pursuant to the Effort -based economy, specifically in the transport and agricultural sectors as well as the legacy effect in solid waste disposal, have resultant high mitigation costs coupled with significant socio-economic considerations. A thriving economy, which albeit partially decoupled GDP from emissions, still has residual level-off coupling, which in turn drives up emissions. Diseconomies of scale also hinder resorting to alternative technologies. These challenges have led us to seek the most flexible options available in line with the provisions under the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), given the limited geographical area which restricts options for enhancement of land-based carbon sinks such as forests. Malta remains committed to continue working towards mitigation action to meet its obligations and comply with the provisions as listed in the Effort Sharing Regulation. This, whilst acknowledging the geophysical realities including our climatic conditions, which lead us to not having an array of options for modal shifts to reduce carbon emissions. Sectoral challenges are various, from economies of scale and low mitigation potential (as in the case of the agricultural sector) to more challenging technology and innovation issues (e.g. refrigeration and cooling) to land use conflicts due to the geophysical reality of our islands (e.g. transport/renewables). reflected through the recent major infrastructural investments in the energy sector.  As a matter of fact, in emitter in Malta. Malta experienced a significant reduction of approximately 50% in emissions from the energy sector due to the shift from heavy fuel oil to natural gas and as a result of interconnection with mainland Europe. Malta also recognises climate finance as one of the core issues related to the climate discussion.  Nonetheless, Malta considers that there is a lot more potential in reaching out to others, particularly through academia. Indeed, Malta offered technical support through scholarship programmes to nationals from various states, particularly those most vulnerable to climate change. These programmes helped such states to further enhance specific skill sets required to address climate changes challenges. Malta has  27  additionally made financial contributions towards international climate funding and will continue to uphold these commitments. towards a low-carbon economy, sustainable mobility, transition towards low-carbon energy and sustainable buildings and urban development, amongst others. It also sets a precedence for guiding principle for developing policies when planning and implementing projects.  This Vision acknowledges the fact that the transition to a low-carbon economy is central to our future economic development model in view of its win-win opportunities. This in turn provides an opportunity for the business sector to take advantage of the favourable economic policy towards low-carbon investment. This will shore up the competitiveness of the country and contribute to lower emissions, improved air quality and health benefits. Malta has identified the formulation of a long-term Low Carbon Development Strategy as a useful tool in the implementation of the objectives of the Paris Agreement, and has given this process due priority. Malta has initiated the process of developing a national Low Carbon Development Strategy in accordance with requirements under the UNFCCC, European Union legislation, the Climate Action Act 2015 (CAP543), and in line with the decarbonisation ambitions of the Energy Union. This strategy aims to consider national circumstances and realities, especially those aspects that link socio-economic development with climate action.  In relation to this, the Maltese Government published a Vision Document, in 2017, highlighting its aspirations for socio-economic development in a low-carbon and climate resilient manner.  As such the Maltese Government is committed to:  Uphold national GHG emission reduction commitments in the EU up to 2020;   Move towards a reduction of national GHG emissions as opposed to pursing a continued limited increase in emission level post-2020;  Progress in reducing national GHG emissions post-development and priorities of the time;  Set sector-specific GHG emission reduction targets post-2020 to contribute to meeting reduction commitments made at the national level; and   Identify and implement opportunities to enhance climate resilience in Malta.    National commitments pursuant to LULUCF Regulation 2018/841 The Regulation on the inclusion of GHG emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) into the 2030 climate and energy framework (Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the inclusion of GHG emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry in the 2030 climate and energy framework, and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 and Decision No 529/2013/EU) requires Malta to ensure that GHG emissions from land use, land use change or forestry are offset by at least an equivalent removal - 2021 to 2030. Accounting under the LULUCF Regulation is split over two compliance periods, 2021 to 2025 and 2026 to 2030, with Malta being required to show that over each of these compliance periods, it is abiding, at least, by the no debit rule. If this cannot be achieved by actions in the sector, the Regulation also provides for flexibility mechanisms by which Malta can close any gaps that it may have in respect of the no  28  debit rule: the use of annual emission allowances allocated to Malta under the Effort Sharing Regulation or buying net removals from other Member States who have successfully increased their rate of net removals beyond their respective commitment. This Regulation should incentivise Malta to enhance removals or reduce emissions in the LULUCF sector. In view of the high population density of the islands and the limited land availability, and to a certain extent the local climatic conditions (such as limited rainfall), the potential for further reduction of CO2 emissions through carbon sequestration in vegetation is envisaged to be minimal. The woodland areas of the Maltese Islands total about 200 hectares. Native forest is all but extinct, cut down by early colonisers for wood and to clear the land for agriculture and building. These residual woodland areas are now protected by legislation.  It is to be noted that, at present, Malta is reporting net emissions for the LULUCF sector. Efforts are ongoing, through capacity building support being provided by the European Commission on the implementation of the LULUCF Regulation, to revise the methodology for the determination of methodological change; policies and measures in the LULUCF sector will still remain a requirement for Malta to ensure that, at least, compliance with the no debit rule can be maintained.   [If applicable] Other objectives and targets, including sector targets and adaptation goals to meet objectives and targets of the Energy Union and the long-term Union GHG emissions commitments consistent with the Paris Agreement The Government is the main influencer in defining climate policy, and thus driving a shift towards a low-carbon economy as is anticThis is of primary importance for the Government to mainstream across all economic sectors as it will shape national consumption and production patterns, thus reducing emissions without hindering economic growth.     29   2.1.2 Renewable Energy Relevant circumstances affecting renewable energy deployment (Article 5(1)(e)) limitations, technological advancement and resource potential, with resource availability and cost of land being the predominant barriers for further deployment.  The geology and topology of the island does not lend itself to the production of hydro (highest point: 253m above sea level) or geothermal energy (no significant thermal gradient), and wave energy production is still at the research stage. Fresh water and agricultural land are both scarce, thus biomass production is not an option.  Wind was assessed thoroughly pre-201018, but as explained further below, conventional wind technology has been found to be largely incompatible with the local context. These relevant circumstances are expanded below and need to be taken into consideration in terms of its share of energy from renewable energy sources.  Solar PV Solar energy is, so far, the predominant viable renewable energy source in Malta, and this led to efforts aimed at increasing the local RES-share to focus on the deployment of photovoltaic systems.  An assessment of Mtechnical potential for solar PV was conducted by the Energy & Water Agency in 2018. The results are similar (although slightly higher) to those estimated by the Joint Research Centre in 2019 using datasets from ENSPRESO, an open dataset for GIS-based energy models on renewable energy potentials, when the same assumptions were applied19. The technical potential assessment indicates that PV deployment post-2020 will be largely limited to suitable rooftops within the residential, commercial and industrial sectors, as well as a handful of ground-mounted systems.  Sites for ground-mounted systems, predominantly designated for installations above 1 MW, are relatively limited. The total area of the Maltese Islands (316km2), coupled with a population density of over 1,500 persons per km2 largely restricts the availability of green field sites, and therefore Government policy on solar farms was designed to take full advantage of brownfield sites such as car parks, disused quarries and landfills. For this purpose, the Planning Authority, in collaboration with the Ministry for Energy and Water Management, published the policy framework for the development of solar farms in 201720. This provides guidance for the location of new solar farms and identifies environmentally-relevant specifications that need to be integrated into solar farm development. However, the relatively high land costs for such sites, driven by increasing land scarcity, together with significant grid connection costs is impacting the financial viability of solar farms. Disused quarries earmarked for solar farms are typically rented at rates in the region of 5Areas (including rooftops) within industrial zones fetch much higher rental rates.                                                             18 Strategy for Renewable Electrictiy Exploitation in Malta Volume 1: Renewable Energy Target and Volume 2: Policy Options Review, Mott McDonald (2005) 19https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/enspreso-open-data-eu-28-wide-transparent-and-coherent-database-wind-solar-and-biomass-energy - assumptions similar to those taken by EWA are 85 MW/km2, excluding facades and natural areas (the latter being in line with  20 https://www.pa.org.mt/en/supplementary-guidance-details/file.aspx?f=12083  30  In the residential sector, uptake of solar PV has been positive and projections indicate that potential exists for additional installations. Dwellings with a rooftop suitable for PV installations include terraced, semi- and fully-detached houses, and, in some cases, maisonettes. Based on trends, it is assumed that apartments are not suitable to host PV installations due to limited available roof space21 and issues relating to ownership; ownership of the rooftop of apartment blocks is often retained by the original developer in view of the potential for further development.  The majority of residential units currently under development in Malta are either apartments or, to a lesser extent, maisonettes22, to maximize land utilization in view of the significant net inwards migration driven by strong economic growth as reflected by an increase in   GDP of 6.6% in real terms in 2017.  This trend is projected to be sustained over the next decade. In order to cater for the increased demand for accommodation, planning policies are encouraging redevelopment of two or three storey buildings into multi-storey apartment blocks. This has a twofold effect: an increase in the depth of shadows cast on neighbouring buildings, and an increase in PV investor uncertainty, weary of possible overshadowing within the useful lifetime of the PV system. This trend therefore leads to an increase in the number of rooftops which are deemed unsuitable for PV installations. By 2040, apartments and maisonettes are expected to const    Wind Energy Wind energy projects, both onshore and offshore, cannot be successfully implemented in Malta using mature technologies due to significant restrictions in the local context, including technical, social and environmental constraints  Onshore Wind Farms High population density and limited land area inhibit the development of onshore wind power. Planning constraints include the potential interference with the safety of airport operations as well as the significant negative visual impact and proximity to densely inhabited areas. Lack of possible environmental mitigation strategies to reduce impacts on protected bird colonies further contribute to the unfeasibility of onshore wind farms.  Offshore Wind Farms With regards to offshore wind turbines, the deep bathymetry of the Maltese marine area is a major drawback (Figure 3 - Bathymetric map of the Maltese Islands). In nearshore coastal areas and reefs with depths of less than 50m, constituting potential areas for the development of fixed-bottom wind farms, environmental and economic concerns remain significant.  There are a number of competing  (Figure 4). Furthermore, a significant portion of the sea around Malta is a designated as a Special Protected Area and Special Area of Conservation. Indeed, assessments on the environmental impacts                                                            21 Rooftops in Malta have to accommodate water tanks, TV antennae/aerials and other building services, besides an access room, and the area is also used for natural drying and airing of clothes and as a place for family leisure. Therefore, roofs of multi-family buildings often have very limited space for RES installations.  22 Currently, new maisonettes are being built integrated into multi-apartment buildings and are therefore not considered suitable for PV installations for the above-mentioned reasons.  31  of the now abandoned project to develop an offshore wind farm at Sikka l-Bajda23 determined that adverse impacts on bird species, in particular the Puffinus Yelkouan, the marine environment, including potential adverse impact on the marine geology as location is characterised by submarine caves which could collapse, and marine life could not be effectively mitigated.  The selected area is a rafting zone for the Puffinus Yelkouan which is an Annex I species under the Birds Directive and which also requires protection for its habitat24.  Figure 2 highlights the inshore marine areas used by Puffinus Yelkouan as recorded from 31 GPS data loggers, extracted from Borg et al (2010).  Malta hosts some . This constituted one of the compelling reasons for the rejection of this project.    Figure 2 - Inshore marine areas used by Puffinus Yelkouan as recorded from 31 GPS data loggers, extracted from Borg et all (2010) Source: MEPA25   Potential offshore sites for Wind Farms were also assessed based on their technical potential by a study commissioned by the Malta Resources Authority in 2005 (Mott McDonald, 2005). All sites experience moderate to low wind speeds, with only the site at Sikka L-Bajda marginally exceeding 7m/s (7.16m/s at 80m) 26.  Wind speeds at the other sites vary between 6.41 and 6.66m/s (at 90m) and the corresponding projected capacity factor varied between 22% and 25%.  These figures show that even the most promising site would still heavily underperform when compared to similar farms located in more favarouable areas such as North Sea where wind speeds are appreciably higher.  This has significant implications on the level of attractiveness of such sites to potential investors.                                                            23 Sikka l-Bajda was identified, through a study by Mott McDonald (2005) commissioned by the Malta Resources Authority, as the only viable offshore site with a depth of less than 50m in Maltese waters for the deployment of offshore wind.   24 As required by the Habitats Directive. 25 Percentages shown in figure refer to moving speed of <10km/hr for birds tagged with a GPS logger from Rdum tal-Madonna, and they indicate feeding and rafting behaviour.  26  Point: A node for central Mediterranean offshore wind resource evaluation. Wind Engineering, 40(5), pp.438-446.  32  In light of restrictions imposed by bathymetry, the intensity of commercial activity, the concentration of marine protected areas, and the wind resource itself, conventional offshore wind energy cannot be considered economically, socially or environmentally viable based on current technologies. Floating Offshore The potential for deep offshore wind energy via floating platforms remains in its infancy; this, combined with the associated high capital investment costs27, implies that floating offshore wind does not constitute a viable short- or medium-term option for Malta. While certain studies point to the potential commercialisation of floating offshore wind in specific regions with high wind resource, over the short- to medium-term, the LCOE of a floating offshore wind farm installed in Maltese waters would still suffer from relatively low capacity factors and have to rely on significant financial support.  Wind speeds of less than 8m/s are typical of the Central Mediterranean, denoting that wind farms installed in the area would have a relatively low capacity factor, negatively impacting their financial viability. In fact, studies which identify potential hotspots for offshore wind energy in the Mediterranean exclude the Central Mediterranean due to its deep bathymetry and limited wind resource availability28,29. Indeed, WindEurope30 projected limited deployment of offshore wind technology in the Mediterranean until 2030 (Figure 5). In light of the above, neither onshore nor offshore wind energy are included as a viable renewable Nevertheless, Malta shall continue to monitor developments in floating offshore solar and wind technologies, and will seek to attract pilot projects implementing floating solar or wind in view of their potential in the longer-term. In this regard, Malta shall seek to attract private investment in floating solar and/or wind which could benefit from support under the Innovation Fund, or if the technology would near full commercialization, seek funding under CEF.                                                             27 -https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/worlds-second-floating-wind-farm-sets-sail-for-portugal/) though this may be higher depending on grid connection costs. 28 Soukissian, T., Karathanasi, F., Axaopoulos, P., Voukouvalas, E. and Kotroni, V., 2018.

In view of the present state of technology readiness, reliability and affordability34, wave energy is not expected to make any share.  Grid Stability Considerations -2020 is limited by grid integration constraints inherent in small, peripheral, electricity systems.  The highest contribution come from solar PVs, (estimated at approximately 41% of total RES consumption in 2020, increasing  shall be concentrated within a very limited space , and generation is therefore highly susceptible to rapid fluctuations in output due to cloud coverage. A preliminary assessment shows that even with 133MWp of installed capacity, cloud cover can cause rapid variation in output of up to 60MW (Figure 6). These rapid fluctuations already pose a significant risk to grid stability, as at times of high insolation PVs will,  (especially on weekends during the shoulder months).  Ensuring system stability will either require significant spinning capacity, utility scale battery storage or flexible balancing services over the electricity interconnector with Sicily.  However, the latter is limited to 200MW (the capacity of the interconnector) and would in practice be lower if already meeting part of the load.

Currently, Malta has no utility scale battery storage facilities, and keeping large spinning capacity is highly inefficient and may not be technically viable at all times. An assessment is being carried out by the Government to estimate the additional system costs involved to integrate further PV capacity.  However, from the onset it is already clear that the available capacity (and hence balancing capability) of the interconnector is one of the main limiting factors. Figure 6 - The effect of cloud cover on electricity generation by 133 MWp of installed solar PV. Transients of circa 60MW are experienced within 60 minutes with the current level of installed capacity  Heating and Cooling In 2017, 802 GWh of fossil fuels were consumed in Malta for heating and cooling, with the largest contributions coming from LPG and gasoil (Figure 7). More than half of the LPG share is attributed to households for cooking and spatial heating, with the rest being consumed in the services and industry sectors. Gasoil, fuel oil and diesel for heating and cooling is almost entirely consumed by the industry and services sectors for process heating. These fuels are used as alternatives to LPG in cases where the LPG storage requirements cannot be overcome due to space or safety restrictions.  .010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.067891011121314151617181920MWTime of DayPVp= 133MW 36  Figure 7 - Fuels consumed for Heating and Cooling in 2017   of solar and heat pump water heaters between 2021-2030. Also contributing to this are the air-to-air reversible heat pumps which are projected to increase without the need for any further policy intervention.   In 2015, a comprehensive assessment on the potential for the application of high efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling in Malta was delivered to the Commission in accordance with Article 14(1) of Directive 2012/27/EU. This report determined that district heating and cooling systems are not technically viable or cost-effective solutions for Malta.  This makes it more challenging to address the heating and cooling sectors. Furthecultivation of biomass and manufacturing of biofuels means that any fuel switch to biomass/biofuels would require imports of these products at significant additional costs.    National contribution in terms of share of energy from RES in gross final energy consumption in 2030, including indicative trajectory and reference points in 2022, 2025 and 2027  In line with Directive 2009/28/EC, Malta is required to meet a 10% renewable energy share in gross final consumption of energy by 2020. Malta will meet this target mainly through indigenous sources, but also through biofuel imports and the use of statistical transfers in 2020. It is projected that Malta reaches a RES share of 9.3% by the end of 2020, and will therefore be seeking to make use of statistical transfers to cover the shortfall. This gap is mainly due to a higher-than-envisaged increase in electricity and energy demand in the very short term that reflects the overall increase in population, tourist activity and economic growth. Efforts by Government to increase the renewable energy share are ongoing, but the full exploitation of RES within the technical and geographical limitations referred above is not enough keep up with the steep increase in demand. Furthermore, interest in investment in RES (mainly solar) appears to be waning, possibly as a result of other investment opportunities at a LPG40%PetrolKerosene1%Diesel10%Gasoil40%Fuel Oil8% 37  time of rapid economic growth. This was demonstrated by the response to the calls issued by the Government under the competitive bidding process for solar PV installations of more than 1MW35. The total capacity offered in 2018 under the second call was 35MW but the total bids received amounted to less than 18MW.  Renewable energy target and future RES objectives must also be framed within the context of having to rely on land intensive renewable energy sources such as PV. Figure 8 highlights how, albeit the final energy consumption per capita in Malta is the lowest amongst the EU-27, the energy consumption per square km is the second highest, marginally exceeded only by Luxembourg.  It follows that for same percentage targets, the amount of RES which needs to be extracted per unit of area is much higher in the case of Malta. This is particularly relevant for land intensive renewables such as PV. Thus, for example to meet a 10% RES share in Greece would require around 0.015 ktoe/km2/year whereas the same RES share for Malta would require almost ten times higher, 0.145 ktoe/km2/year.

Table 2 also indicates the three reference points in 2022, 2025 and 2027 as required by the Governance Regulation. While in 2022 it is expected that Malta will need statistical transfers to meet the indicative trajectory - reflecting 18% of the total increase in the share of energy - RES trajectory is expected to be higher than the 43% and 65% indicative trajectory reference points. the following three years due to expected commissioning of the Malta-Gozo tunnel; this would significantly decrease the consumption of gasoil by the ferries and consequently affect the gross final consumption of energy, which is expected to increase at a relatively slower pace in 2027.

Since Malta does not have a district heating and cooling system that allows for the use of waste heat, this 1.3% indicative target is limited to an indicative 1.1% instead.  The share of renewable heating and cooling is expected to reach a share of 22.06% by 2020 and rising to 25.71% by 2030. In order to reach the indicative 1.1% target, Malta must endeavour to increase this RES share to a minimum of 33.06% by 2030. In energy terms, this denotes a minimum increase of an additional 130 GWh to be reached over a period of 10 years, which is almost double that projected for 2020.   As indicated in the introductory part of Section 2.1.2, the opportunities for Malta to reach the 1.1% target are highly challenging:  the unavailability of a natural gas distribution system on the Maltese territory, excludes the option to blend biogas;  no sources of indigenious biomass;  the possibilities of replacing/blending LPG with bioLPG (mainly used for cooking/industrial processes) are rather limited due to limited availability and significant additional costs to both 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%2021202220232024202520262027202820292030Estimated trajectories for sectoral share of RES (WPM)RES-ERES-TRES-H&C 40  households and industry.  We consider that the 40% share of LPG is largely unaddressable over the short to medium term;  a share of 28% biodiesel blend would be required to meet the 1.1% target by 2030. The additional cost to industry/services would amount to circa 70 million.  Given that all biofuels would need to be be imported, incurringly additional shipping costs (and associated carbon footprint), such a measure would not provide any tangible economic benefits to Malta.  However, despite it being an inherently challenging target to reach, Malta plans to make use of the recast comprehensive assessment referred to in Section 2.1.2 in 2020, to further assess cost-effective opportunities that could contribute towards an increase in the renewable heating and cooling share by 2030.   Estimated trajectories by renewable energy technology including expected total gross final energy consumption per technology and sector and total planned installed capacity per technology and sector RES-Electricity RES-E trajectory is composed of RES generation from Solar PV and waste-to-energy CHP plants (Figure 11). Figure 10 illustrates the projected capacity of solar PV from 2021-2030, based on the  encourage higher penetration of solar PV through financial support schemes and other measures which facilitate uptake. Under the WPM scenario, solar PV is expected to reach 266 MWp by 2030. This implies a total footprint of approximately 3.2  3.7km2. Both rooftop and brownfield sites will continue to be given priority for installations.  Some repowering is projected to begin as from 2026. However, this is to a very small extent prior to 2030 as installations of solar PV predominantly took place from 2010 onwards.  Solar PV technology is projected to contribute to 42 in 2030, being the largest contributing RES technology in Malta.

Figure 12 shows the relative contribution by each H&C technology towards this share. The Government is planning to implement measures targeting solar water heaters, heat pump water heaters and waste-to-energy plants with the aim of increasing -to-air heat pumps are not deemed to need policy intervention.

The share of renewable energy from electricity in transport is due to a projected increase in the share of electric vehicles in the road transport vehicle fleet. Under the WPM scenario, the stock of electric and plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles is currently projected to increase from just above 1,000 in 2020 to almost 26,000 by 2030, comprising 6% of the projected total fleet. This shift is mainly driven by Regulation (EU) 2018/1832 and Regulation (EU) 2019/318 which impose stricter CO2 emissions standards on manufacturers of road vehicles post-2020. It must be noted that there is no rail system in Malta. Figure 13 - RES trajectory in transport under WPM scenario 2021-2030, GWh    [If applicable] Other national long-term or sectorial trajectories and objectives  The Maltese Government is committed make a decision by early 2020 to establish a cut-off date for the importation and registration of Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) passenger vehicles in Malta.  To comply with this, a holistic strategy will be developed which will identify measures and necessary future energy system, iwould be reflected in future NECP updates and reporting cycles.   0501001502002502021202220232024202520262027202820292030GWhRES Transport (WPM), GWhBiofuelsElectric vehicles 43   Estimated trajectories on bioenergy demand, disaggregated between heat, electricity, and transport, and on biomass supply by feedstocks and origin Bioenergy is projected to grow between 2021-2030 (Figure 14), largely due to an increasing percentage of biofuels in road transport fuels. Production of bioenergy from waste treatment facilities, both electricity and heat, and the use of biomass for space heating in the residential sector are expected to remain largely stable in the projected period. The projected consumption of biofuels, split by type, is shown in Figure 15. Biofuels are expected to continue increasing throughout the projected period mainly due to the continued blending of road diesel with HVO, FAME (to a lesser extent), and advanced biofuels in line with the Renewables Directive. Advanced biofuels are expected to contribute to 25% of the total consumption of biofuels by 2030.  Malta possesses no sustainable sources of biomass and does not have the land area or resources required to cultivate energy crops to any practical extent. Furthedemand, targeting increased efficiency in heating and cooling is deemed more appropriate than promoting the importation of biomass. Imported biomass in Malta primarily includes wood pellets, fuel wood in logs or briquettes, sawdust and wood charcoal, all of which is assumed to be consumed by the residential sector for heating purposes. In 2018, 49% of biomass imports originated from EU countries while 51% was imported from non-EU countries. Under the WPM scenario, imports of biomass are expected to remain largely stable and to follow current trends.
