 Internal Energy Market Dimension149  Electricity infrastructure i. Policies and dimensions to achieve the targeted level of interconnectivity as set out in point (d) of Article 4 The target level of the electrical interconnectivity of the EU Member States is at least 10% for 2020 and at least 15% for 203056. Electricity transmission measures (for more information, see chapter 2.4.2) primarily address the synchronisation of the electrical systems of the Baltic States with the frequency area subject to EU law and increasing the availability of external interconnections. Activities undertaken within the Baltic States synchronisation project take place in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and also Poland. Investments made in connection with synchronisation strengthen cross-border connections as well as the domestic electricity transmission system. In that way, the bottlenecks in the electricity system are removed, and the interconnectivity of the energy grids of the Baltic States and Poland is increased. In 2017, the interconnectivity of the Estonian electricity grids with neighbouring countries (Latvia, Finland) was 63%56. The interconnection capacity from EE to LV was 900 MW, and 1016 from EE to FI. It is estimated that the capacity from EE to LV will increase to 1379 MW by 2030150 based on completion of the third Estonia-Latvia interconnection151. The following measures of the NDPES 20304 mostly contribute directly to ensuring interconnectivity between electricity networks.  Measure 1.2 Transmission that meets the requirements of eligible for electricity management and efficient transmission The following measures will be applied in order to achieve the targets described in Chapter 2.2: EN8 Improving the quality of network services; EN9 Increasing the share of the weatherproof grid; EN10 Transition to the remote reading system; EN11 Synchronisation of the Baltic electricity system with the synchronous areas of Continental Europe.  ii. Regional cooperation in this area152 The Baltic States synchronisation project will be implemented in collaboration between the Baltic States and Poland. An accurate review of the status and activities of the project is available on the ENTSO-E web page62 and Chapter 2.4.2., which describe the project.                                                            149 Policies and measures shall reflect the first principle of energy efficiency. 150 ENTSO-E.

Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.3 Electricity system The following NDPES 2030 measures contribute most directly to the market integration and coupling of the targets (see Table 17) indicated in Chapter 2.4.3.i:  Measure 1.2 Efficient transmission suitable for meeting the needs of the electricity sector The following measures (for more information about the measure see Annex) are implemented for achieving the targets described in Chapter 2.4: EN8 Increasing the quality of network services EN9 Increasing the share of the weatherproof grid EN10 Transition to a remote reading system EN11 Synchronisation of the Baltic electricity system with the synchronous areas of Continental Europe Investments in the Baltic States made within the framework of the synchronisation project contribute significantly to market integration (see Chapter 2.4.2), which helps eliminate the bottlenecks in all of the Baltic States and increase the resilience of the electrical system to rapid changes in electricity production and consumption. Gas transmission system The most important investment in physical infrastructure in the area of gas market integration is the construction of the Balticconnector by 2019, and related additional work on the Estonia-Latvia gas system interconnector. The supplemental works include building of a compressor station in Estonia and the enabling of bi-directional gas flow. ii. Measures that increase energy system flexibility for generating renewable energy. This chapter describes measures to increase the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production, such as smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, dispatching mechanisms, re-dispatching and curtailment, real-time price signals, including the roll-out of intra-day market coupling and cross-border balancing markets. These measures are implemented in order to achieve the targets (see Table 18) indicated in chapter 2.4.3.ii . Electricity system The sufficiency and flexibility of the electricity system will be safeguarded through measures 1.1 (Developing the electrical energy production;) and 1.2 (Transmission eligible for electrical energy sector needs and efficient transmission) of the NDPES 2030 security of supply sub-target (Table 18). The barometers of these measures direct network operators to make necessary investments and develop solutions for more efficient integration of renewable energy into the Estonian electrical system. A good example of this innovation is the map application developed by the Estonian TSO (Elering AS), which shows the available capacities in the electricity grid belonging to the company on a year-by-year basis and enables renewable energy producers to plan their projects more effectively.

The system operator (Elering AS) has created a data exchange platform called Estfeed for the development of the flexibility services market. Estfeed enables the secure exchange of messages in the energy sector (Figure 17)  different data sources and applications (Figure 18) that wish to use these data can be connected to the platform. Estfeed consists of a legal, software and hardware solution to manage the exchange of energy metering data among market participants, support the process of consumers changing electricity supplier on the open market and enable access to software applications authorised by consumers for metering data (i.e. for monitoring and controlling consumption).155  PEER TO PEER DATA TRANSMISSION ARCHITECTURE   APPLICATION  ADAPTER SERVER  SECURITY SERVER  LOG IN AND GIVE PERMISSIONS  MANDATE AND AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM  PUBLISH  REQUEST  ADMINISTRATION  SECURITY SERVER  PERMISSION SYNCHRONIZATION  ADMIN APPLICATION                                                            155 Elering AS.

Simplified architecture of Estfeed155  COMPLETE PICTURE OF DATA FLOWS  Figure 18. Flow of data and management of access rights155 The Estfeed platform can integrate various data sources (e.g. in future also district heating data and data from other remote readers and sensors) and provide appropriate services for converting the data into valuable information to control consumption, manage flexibility, perform audits and make comparisons. For example, gas and electricity data warehouses, the Commercial Register, the Population Register, Foreca weather information and the ENTSO-E Transparency platform are interfaced with Estfeed to obtain the electricity price. Both the TSO (Elering AS) and the biggest distribution system operator (Elektrilevi OÜ) are involved in development projects to provide a more favourable flexibility service within the Estonian electricity system (e.g. the H2020 project EU-SysFlex, and the deployment of a single balancing services market in the Baltic States as of 1 January 2018). This flexibility has also created the need for a project like INTERRFACE (in progress), the main objective of which is closer coordination between TSOs and distribution system operators to encourage acquisition of the services for both transmission and distribution to render management of the network more efficient and effective and increase the level of demand response and generation of renewable energy, thus also enabling the end customer to become an active market participant. These activities are also facilitated by the fact that, according to Government of the Republic Regulation establishing a Network Code, established pursuant to the Electricity Market Act, all Estonian electricity consumers have been supplied with remotely readable meters as of 1 January 2017. As regards the Baltic States, it should also be taken into account that as the electricity system of the Baltic States is not synchronised with the synchronous areas subject to EU law, liberalisation of the balancing market is more complicated than for other EU Member States (e.g. the price of the balancing service is considerably influenced by balancing deliveries from Russia). The system operators of the Baltic States are working actively on consumption control to provide the market with greater flexibility (see, for example, the recent public consultation and the analysis that preceded it  Baltic Electricity Transmission System  a Harmonized Approach in the Baltic Region 156). System operators in the Nordic countries are making plans for a joint Scandinavian mFRR trading platform and a products to be harmonised or integrated with the Scandinavian platform and its product. The Estfeed platform also shows gas system measurement data (e.elering.ee). Consumers themselves can see (and enable gas sellers to see) gas consumption data. Data is sent to the platform from remote reading devices once a day and from domestic meters once a month. Since all gas metering points need to be equipped with meters that can be read remotely as of 2020, all consumers will be able to see their gas consumption in real-time as of 2021. iii. Where applicable, measures to ensure the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets. The Electricity Market Act prohibits discrimination of market participants. The network operator, in response to a request from a consumer, producer, line operator or any other network operator, is obliged to connect any electrical installation which conforms to requirements and is located in its service area to the network and to amend the conditions of consumption or generation66 . As from 20 February 2018, aggregators are able to enter into a contract with the TSO (Elering AS) to provide a balancing service157, which means that the aggregators are able to participate in the electricity market on the same principles as the other market participants. The regulation will be updated to cover independent aggregators and energy storage in accordance with Directive (EU) 2019/944 on the internal market for electricity. Pursuant to the Natural Gas Act, the system operator is obliged to ensure access to the transmission network to third parties in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 715/2009.                                                            156 https://elering.ee/en/electricity-market#tab0 Baltic Electricity Transmission System Operators' Public -  157 Elering AS.

Policies and measures to protect consumers, especially vulnerable and, where applicable, energy poor consumers, and to improve the competitiveness and contestability of the retail energy market. 158158, Electricity Market Act66, District Heating Act and Natural Gas Act. Responsibility for oversight of the electricity and natural gas markets and the settlement of disputes relating to it is shared among several agencies. The Consumer Protection Board deals with issues concerning the terms of contracts and oversees the advertising and sales activities of electricity and gas companies. The Competition Board oversees the functioning of the market and the activities of market participants pursuant to the Electricity Market Act, District Heating Act and Natural Gas Act. The Technical Regulatory Authority deals with issues relating to electrical safety and meters.  The Consumer Protection Act provides that the consumer has the right to: (a) demand and obtain goods and services which meet the requirements, are harmless to the life, health and property of the consumers, and are not prohibited from being owned or used; (b) obtain necessary and truthful information on the goods and services offered in order to make an informed choice, and timely information on any risks relating to the goods or services; (c) obtain information on consumer law and other issues relating to consumption; (d) obtain advice and assistance if their rights are violated; (e) demand compensation for any patrimonial or non-patrimonial damage caused to them; (f) request that their interests be taken into account and that they be represented through consumers' associations and federations in the decision-making process on consumer policy issues. Hence the Consumer Protection Act provides general requirements that are set out in greater detail in special acts (the Electricity Market Act, the District Heating Act and the Natural Gas Act). Section 90 of the Electricity Market Act provides that, during the period from 1 October constitutes a dwelling and which is used as a permanent residence and heated exclusively or primarily by electricity, or in which the use of electricity is unavoidable for the functioning of the heating system that exclusively or primarily uses another fuel source, cannot be interrupted earlier than within 90 days. Section 17 of the District Heating Act provides that if a customer has failed to pay the amount due under a contract entered into with a network operator, the supply of heat required for heating the dwelling may be interrupted during the period from 1 October to 30 April only when 90 days have passed since receipt of the relevant notice and the customer has failed, during that period, to remedy the defect which constitutes the basis for interruption of the supply of heat. Otherwise the network operator has to give at least                                                            158 Riigikogu. Consumer Protection Act. https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/TKS ss. Section 26 of the Natural Gas Act provides that if a household customer has failed to pay the amount payable under the contract entered into with the seller and the household customer uses gas to heat a dwelling used as a permanent residence, the supply of gas may be interrupted during the period from 1 October to 1 May only if ninety days have passed since receipt of the relevant notice. The competitiveness of the retail market for electricity and gas is also strengthened by regulatory and information technology developments (the Network Code applied as of April 2019, developments in Open Government Partnerships, etc.). iii. Description of measures to enable and develop demand response, including those addressing tariffs to support dynamic pricing159 This area is still being development and thus is regulated in legislation in a general manner. More specific regulations will be drawn up as needed, based on the results of the pilot projects in progress.  One aggregator is operating in Estonia as part of one of the pilot projects.  It has been able to enter into the contractual relations necessary for providing the service with both consumers and the system operator. A more specific description as regards the electricity market can be found under point (ii) of section 3.4.3.  Energy poverty i. Where applicable, policies and measures to achieve the objectives set out in point 2.4.4. National policy related to energy poverty is governed by the Social Welfare Act160, according to which the State supports people in need with financial aid. Local authorities pay a subsistence allowance to people in need, and the application, calculation, granting and payment of this allowance is governed by Section 8 of the Act. Section f the Act provides that housing expenses that are taken into consideration when calculating the subsistence benefit, including (points 5-8):  the cost of the thermal energy or fuel consumed by the hot water supply;  the cost of the thermal energy or fuel consumed for heating;  the costs related to electricity consumption;  the cost of household gas; SA Kredex161 provides the following grants to private individuals and apartment associations to improve living conditions:  Small residential home reconstruction grant;                                                              159 In accordance with Article 15(8) of Directive 2012/27/EU. 160 https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/130122015005?leiaKehtiv 161 http://www.kredex.ee/toetus/  Reconstruction grant for apartment associations;  Housing grant for families with many children:  Electrical installation renovation grant for private persons and associations of apartment owners. In January 2019, the Estonian National Social Insurance Board established an advisory unit for local authorities with the aim to ensuring that those local authorities can provide uniform and high quality nationwide social welfare support measures to adults once the public administration reform is completed. The aim of the advisory unit operating under the Estonian National Social Insurance Board since 2019 is to increase the support provided by the State to local authorities in the performance of social welfare tasks, to harmonise and improve the quality of aid measures and contribute towards the development of a strong frontline adult social welfare system. The advisory unit provides local authorities with advice on strategy, implementation and specific cases.  To alleviate the energy poverty that might be experienced during the heating period, the District Heating Act, Electricity Market Act and the Natural Gas Act contain provisions significantly limiting common interruptions of energy supply. Under the District Heating Act 162 and the Electricity Market Act, the electricity supply may be interrupted from 1 October to 30 April only if 90 days have passed since receipt of the relevant notice. The same rule is applied under the Natural Gas Act for the period from 1 October to 1 May163
