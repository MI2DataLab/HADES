Innovative energy technology in Austria  2017 market developments  Biomass, photovoltaics, solar thermal, heat pumps and wind energy28 In 2017, there was a mixed picture in terms of the development of low-carbon energy technology. Biomass fuels, biomass boilers, photovoltaics and heat pumps saw considerable growth, whilst biomass stoves, solar thermal and wind energy saw sales figures fall. A slight increase was observed compared to 2016. Persistently low fossil fuel prices, an increase in the price of solid biomass and competition between certain low-carbon energy technologies were major factors which influenced market activity.  Further details on market developments in individual sectors are presented below:  a) Solid biomass  fuel Use of solid biomass for energy  of which there is a long tradition in Austria  is one of the central pillars in terms of how renewable energy is used in Austria. Between 2016 and 2017, use of pellets increased by 6.7% to reach 16.3 PJ (960,000 tonnes). There are 32 Austrian pellet producers ensuring the supply of pellets who have built up their production capacity to 1.61 million tonnes/year.  In 2017, 10.2 mt CO2eq was saved thanks to solid biogenic fuel. The biofuel industry generated a total revenue of EUR 1.606 billion in 2017, with an impact on employment corresponding to 18,967 full-time jobs in this sector.                                                                      28 Innovative energy technology in Austria  2017 market developments  biomass, photovoltaics, solar thermal, heat series, 4/2018, June 2018, https://nachhaltigwirtschaften.at/de/iea/publikationen/innovative-energietechnologien-in- oesterreich-marktentwicklung-2017.php Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 241 of 268  The availability of suitable competitively-priced raw materials is critical to the success of bioenergy. Improved measures to increase the use of biogenic residue and waste are also a prerequisite. In addition to its traditional use for heating purposes, bioenergy is increasingly taking on the role of becoming part of an overall system in combination with other renewables.  b) Solid biomass  boilers and stoves In Austria, the market for biomass boilers experienced sustained, rapid growth between 2000 and 2006. In 2007, sales of all types of boiler fell due to low oil prices. That same year, there was also a shortage of wood pellets, leading to a significant increase in pellet prices. This caused the pellet boiler market to slump by 60%. With the economic and financial crisis in 2009, sales fell by a further 24%. In 2011 and 2012, sales of pellet boilers rose sharply. Between 2013 and 2016, a decline in sales of biomass boilers was again observed. This was caused by rising biomass fuel prices, early investments in the years following the economic and financial crisis, low oil prices and high average temperatures. 2017 saw renewed growth in sales of all types of boiler, with the exception of log wood boilers (-13.4%). Sales of wood chip boilers (<100 kW) rose by 11.8% as compared to 2016, and pellet boilers by as much as 19.3%.  Austrian biomass boiler manufacturers typically sell approximately 80% of their production abroad. Economic activity in the biomass boiler and stove market generated sales of EUR 863 million in 2017, with an impact on employment corresponding to 3,601 jobs. Research into biomass boilers is focused on how to reduce emissions further and how to use biomass as an energy source in industrial and commercial processes with high heat demand. So that success on international markets continues to be possible, it is essential for the cost of installation technology to be reduced further, while at the same time maintaining high technical quality.  c) Photovoltaics For the first time in three years, 2017 saw a notable increase in newly installed photovoltaic capacity in Austria. Photovoltaic systems connected to the grid with a total capacity of 172,479 kWpeak and self-sufficient systems with a total capacity of 476 kWpeak were installed, which represented an increase of 11%.  In 2017, photovoltaic installations operating in Austria were able to produce electricity of at least 1,269 GWh, thereby reducing CO2 emissions by 377,392 tonnes.  The Austrian photovoltaic industry is active in the production of modules, inverters and other additional components, the installation of equipment, and in research and development. 2,813 full-time jobs were recorded in this sector in 2017. In Austria, the average system price of a 5 kWpeak photovoltaic system connected to the grid fell from EUR 1,645/kWpeak in 2016 to EUR 1,621/kWpeak, i.e. by 1.47%. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 242 of 268   The development of photovoltaic equipment for integration into buildings is of strategic importance to Austria as this is precisely the sector where a particularly high level of national added value is deemed attainable. With building-integrated photovoltaic systems as a research and innovation priority, the Austrian industry may be able to enter a niche market, opening up opportunities on major export markets worldwide.  d) Solar thermal energy Following considerable growth during the period up to 2009, the Austrian market has seen eight consecutive years of decline. The causes of this initially included the effects of the financial and economic crisis. However, there are now other causes, namely the significant fall in the price of photovoltaic systems, increased use of heat pumps and persistently low oil prices.  In 2017, 101,780 m2 of new solar panels were installed, corresponding to a capacity of 71.1 MWth. The solar thermal market in Austria therefore saw a decline of 9.1% as compared with 2016. The share of solar panel exports hit approximately 84% which represents a slight increase. The estimated turnover of the solar thermal sector in 2017 was EUR 178 million. Approximately 1,500 full-time jobs can be inferred from this. Large seasonal heat storage projects are being considered an option for the future of solar thermal energy. Many such projects have already been set up in Denmark.  e) Heat pumps Total sales of heat pumps (domestic market plus export market) increased from 33,094 units sold in 2016 to 36,446 units in 2017. This corresponds to 10.1% growth. Considerable growth was registered on both the domestic market (+9.1%) and export market (+12.5%). In particular, heat pumps with a capacity of up to 20 kW saw strong growth. Domestic hot water heat pumps registered an increase of 7.7% on the domestic market and a decline of 8.5% on the export market.  Research and development efforts in respect of heat pump systems are currently focused on installations which work in combination with other technology, e.g. solar thermal systems or photovoltaic systems. Efforts are also focused on the development of new energy services, e.g. cooling and air-conditioning, and building drainage in the renovation sector. The use of other fuels such as natural gas and its feed-in into smart grids is broadening the scope for innovation.  f) Wind power In 2017, 63 new wind turbines with a total capacity of 196 MWel were installed in Austria.  By the end of the year, 1,260 wind turbines with a rated capacity of 2,844 MWel were on the grid. This capacity means that between 6.5 and 7 TWh of electricity can be produced each year, corresponding to approximately 10 to 11% of electricity consumption in Austria. Electricity Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 243 of 268  production potential has therefore increased by 19% or 1.3 TWh since the end of 2016. Assuming the substitution of ENTSO-E imports, Austria was able to save more than 1.9 mt CO2eq in 2017. When substituting the share of fossil fuels in the ENTSO-E mix, savings amount to 4.3 mt CO2eq.  In 2017, Austrian operators realised just under EUR 551 million through the sale of wind power. Investments of more than EUR 323 million by those companies enabled more than EUR 92 million in domestic added value to be generated. Operating those installations over the next 20 years will make it possible to generate a further EUR 216 million in domestic added value. In 2017, the turnover of the Austrian supply industry was just under EUR 454 million, with the wind power sector generating a total turnover of EUR 1.005 billion. 2017 saw 1,330 people directly employed in the wind power supply industry, with a further 3,074 jobs in the construction, maintenance and demolition of wind turbines. Of those jobs, 372 were with domestic operators. In total, this therefore corresponds to at least 4,404 jobs.     Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 244 of 268  ii. Current level of public and, where available, private research and innovation spending on low-carbon technologies, current number of patents, and current number of researchers.  According to the Austrian Energy Agency, public spending on research, development and demonstration projects in the energy sector amounted to EUR 139.3 million in 2017, down EUR 1.6 million on the previous year.  Figure 31: Time series of public spending on energy research between 1977 and 2017, nominal and adjusted for inflation   Source CPI: Statistics Austria, 2018 Millionen Euro Million EUR nominal Nominal PPP 2017 PPP 2017  There were around 850 projects and activities recorded for 2017. 63.9% of funds were used for -related basic research.  As in previous years, most expenditure was on  65.7 million or 47.2%),  6.2 million to EUR 37.2 million.

Other cross-cutting technology  Spending on renewable energy sources fell significantly in 2017, with a decline of about one third to EUR 21.4 million. These three priorities for publicly financed energy research. Comparatively speaking, far less funding went to the other four areas, namely fossil fuels, nuclear energy, hydrogen and fuel cells and other cross-cutting technology.

The federal ministries made EUR 25.1 million available, which is EUR 5.4 million less than in 2016. Of that EUR 25.1 million, EUR 15.8 million came from the Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and at companies to carry out experimental development activities was as high as Federal Government spending, reaching EUR 25 million thanks to an increase of EUR 10.8 million. Provincial spending in 2017 increased significantly as compared to the previous year (reaching EUR 10.5 million).  There are currently 22 public universities in Austria. In recent years, nine of those universities announced self-financed spending on energy research. As in previous years, 2017 saw a reduction in self-financed activities.  -run technical college [Fachhochschule] degree programmes are relatively new. They were first introduced in 1994 as university-level academic vocational training. There are currently 21 technical colleges in Austria. In recent years, 13 of these have announced self-financed spending on energy research, with considerable variation between them.  Among the non-university research institutions included in this compilation, self-financed energy-related R&D rose slightly between 2016 and 2017, in particular because the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) was able to increase its own funds investment in the energy sector to EUR 27.4 -financing used in this sector for energy purposes.  Private spending on research Whereas data on public spending on energy research in Austria has been gathered on a regular basis for 40 years and is available in detail, only rough estimates had previously been available on the significantly higher spending coming from the business sector. For this reason, detailed surveys and in-depth analyses were carried out by the Austrian Energy Agency in 2017 on behalf surveys from 2007 to 2015.  3,611 Austrian companies declared self-funded R&D totalling EUR 7.5 billion in 2015, of which Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 248 of 268  spending from 571 companies  amounting to EUR 485 million  was classified under the socio- largest of the fourteen areas, corresponding to a share of 6.5%.  Almost half of this amount came from companies in the electrical equipment sector. By quite some margin, mechanical engineering was second with 8.4%, closely followed by manufacturers of electronic components and printed circuit boards. By contrast, energy suppliers contributed just under 2% of energy research spending from businesses.     iii.

Description of energy subsidies, including for fossil fuels  Incentives and support measures that have a counterproductive impact are assessed against the Federal Ministry of Finance and discussed with the Federal Ministry of Sustainability and Tourism and the Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology. A corresponding sector-based list of counterproductive incentives and support measures (for the ETS and non-ETS areas) is updated on a continuous basis and serves as a starting point for the gradual removal of measures classified as counterproductive set to take place between 2021 and 2030.
