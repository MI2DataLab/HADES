Renewable energy   i. Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in each of these sectors  In Austria in 2016, the share of renewable energy within the gross final consumption of energy was 33.5%. The target of 34% by 2020 is therefore already in sight.  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 214 of 268  With regard to energy use for heating and air conditioning, the share of renewable energy in 2016 was 33.3%.  With regard to gross electricity consumption, the share of renewable energy in 2016 was 72.6%.  With regard to energy use in transport, the share of renewable energy in 2016 was 10.6%.
