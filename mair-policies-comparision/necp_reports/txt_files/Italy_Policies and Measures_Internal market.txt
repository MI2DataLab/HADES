INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 208   3.4 Dimension internal energy market20   3.4.1 Electricity infrastructure  i. Policies and measures to achieve the targeted level of interconnectivity as set out in Article 4(d)   Electrical interconnections with other countries A first set of new infrastructure has been identified (Annex III to the NES), which is to be other countries, especially with:    France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia);  the border with South-East Europe, where there is a diversified and competitive production capacity that will increase in the medium to long term, which provides an alternative to gas and petroleum, owing to the mineral and water resources that are present in the countries in South-East Europe and to the potential synergies with the electricity systems in that region. The development of the interconnection capacity with northern Africa may also provide an additional instrument for maximising the use of the energy resources. In addition, interconnectors and a new transport capacity funded by private entities (typically, large energy consumers) will be authorised and promoted. There is still an interest in looking into further interconnection projects, provided that they are technically and financially feasible. Indeed, as was found by the Expert Group and agreed upon by the Commission, in order for a new interconnector to be constructed, it is an absolute prerequisite that its socio-economic and environmental costs and benefits are analysed beforehand, to ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs.  ii. Regional cooperation in this area21 In discussions with other countries with which the reinforcement of interconnections or new interconnections are planned (Slovenia, Austria, Croatia and Malta) there has been common ground with regard to these initiatives and the opportunities that the infrastructures create in terms of the stability of the electricity system. Malta in particular would look favourable on another reinforcement of the interconnection with Sicily in the next few years.  iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds  The development of the interconnection capacity with northern Africa is important from a strategic perspective, and in that context, the power line connecting Italy with Tunisia (under the ELMED project) may provide an additional instrument for maximising the use of both -to long-term effects for other Member States, which is why it is included in the list of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs). However, in order to be economically viable, the project needs a significant financial                                                             20 Policies and measures shall reflect the energy efficiency first principle. 21 Other than the PCI Regional Groups established under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 209   contribution from the EU, most of which originating from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), which will be dispensed over several years.  3.4.2 Energy transmission infrastructure  i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.2, including, where applicable, specific measures to enable the delivery of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and other key infrastructure projects  The measures for promoting the reinforcement and improvement of the electricity -year development plan, are based on the following actions:   Internal network developments Further network reinforcements between the North-Central and Central-South zones, aimed at reducing the number of hours of congestion between those sections. The new interventions include the so-HVDC power line running between the Central-South and North-Central market sections, which is connected to the electricity hubs of Villanova (or Villavalle) and Fano (or Porto Tolle). The decarbonisation objective is posing a number of problems as regards managing the security of the Sardinian network. A new connection with Sardinia (the southern part) is being -- These measures will also require further investment to be made on the distribution networks, which are becoming increasingly affected by the rolling-out of small and medium-sized plants.   Planning for the development of the national transmission network As part of the planning for the development of the national transmission network, provision has been made for the following: measures to speed up the approval of Development Plans; extending the scope of the cost-benefit analysis method so that it also takes environmental impacts into account; coordinating with the planning of the DSOs. The defence plans, on the -fired thermo-electric power plants and the gradual increase in energy production from renewable sources. In-depth analysis and studies of the network will need to be carried out in order to assess what possible countermeasures could be taken in the event of the network deteriorating or in cases of distributed generation (low load). The defence plans must be incorporated by the resilience section of the network.   Developing storage systems that are instrumental in managing the security and efficiency of the national transmission network The development of renewables expected by 2030 has already led the TSO to quantify the requirements of new storage systems that will be needed (listed in section 2.3 iv), together with the development of the networks, in order to ensure that management is maintained under secure conditions. An assessment of the existing capacities in the different parts of the country and the best locations for storage plants is under way, taking into account the residual potential of existing water reservoirs. In addition, in line with the EU Directive that INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 210   is in the course of being adopted, the current rules governing storage infrastructure will be amended and a new regulatory framework will be defined, which will be able to foster the development and coming into operation of the new storage capacity needed according to a market model in which stakeholders compete to offer network services that are different , with tariffs adjusted accordingly). To ensure that the storage needs of the system are met, in case of market collapse, provision has also been made for the TSO to be able, subject to authorisation from the ARERA, and based on the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Economic Development, to construct and operate storage systems directly connected to the national transmission network, but only in the following two cases:  storage facilities incorporated into the national transmission network and instrumental for the security of the electricity system, but which cannot operate on the wholesale markets competing with the operators;  storage facilities capable of providing ancillary services and which, to that end, participate in the service markets, but for which competitive tendering procedures have been launched in order to acquire those resources from market operators. that facilitates innovative projects on energy networks Definition of a regulatory framework that facilitates innovative projects, including by means of a dedicated fund, allowing operators to conduct tests on site and at prototype stage, if necessary granting temporary waivers from the regulations in force, while at the same time providing for adequate mechanisms for effective cost recognition. Network operators will be particularly involved, activating a new approach of system innovation that involves commercial parties in the development of new business models downstream in the chain and in trialling multiservice offers at urban and local level. An example of this is provided by the pilot projects launched by ARERA to foster the participation of distributed resources in the dispatching services market. Guidelines for recognising infrastructure costs on the basis of the service provided to users Progressive and gradual departure from the current approach to cost recognition, which differentiates between operational costs and capital costs, to foster an integrated approach that empowers operators. More specifically, the new integrated approach focuses on the following aspects: development forecasts and plans that are realistic, based on the future and actual needs of service customers; incentives to improve performance in terms of efficiency, cost-effectiveness and quality of service; and removal of any regulatory barriers to the development of innovative solutions. In regulating the network infrastructure the intention is to launch a programme by which new cost recognition methods are gradually consolidated, eliminating the distortions that currently arise from the differentiated regulatory treatment of operational costs and capital costs, and enhancing the service s. It will be equally important to provide the tools and flexibility necessary to support, at the lowest cost possible, the technological development and updating of the infrastructure needed to    Developing the LNG network Legislative Decree No 257 of 16 December Rules for implementing Directive 2014/94/EU of the European Parliament and of INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 211   the Council of 22 October 2014 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructurestipulates, under Article 6, as regards the supply of natural gas for transportation, that by 31 December 2025 in maritime ports, and by 31 December 2030 in inland ports, a sufficient number of LNG refuelling points will have been put in place to allow LNG-fuelled vessels used for inland navigation or LNG-powered vessels used for sea navigation to navigate in the TEN-T Core Network. The same Article also stipulates that by 31 December 2025, a sufficient number of LNG refuelling points also combined with CNG (compressed natural gas) refuelling points will have been gradually put in place, to which the public will have access at least along the Italian sections of the TEN-T Core Network, in order to ensure the circulation of LNG-fuelled heavy-duty vehicles, taking account of the current levels of demand and the short-term development thereof. In Italy, the TEN-T Core Network consists of around 3 300 km of roads in total, divided into three main corridors:  The Palermo-Naples-Rome-Bologna-Modena-Milan-Verona-Brenner line  The Genoa-Milan-Chiasso and Genoa (Voltri)-Alessandria-Gravellona Toce lines  The Fréjus-Turin-Milan-Bergamo-Verona-Padua-Venice-Trieste line In recent years, following the significant increase in the number of heavy-duty vehicles fuelled by LNG (there are currently around 2,000 such vehicles in circulation on Italian roads), a sizeable number of liquid methane refuelling points have been put in place (there are currently 59 such points in Italy, and a further 41 are planned, according to Federmetano). Importing LNG as a supply source to complement gas pipeline supplies Given the increased uncertainty and the possible critical issues  which have all occurred in the past but never all at the same time  arising from disruptions to gas pipeline supplies, the Ministry of Economic Development is actively pursuing a strategy for diversifying and increasing LNG supplies, which currently come almost solely from Qatar and cover around 9% of national gas requirements. The regasification capacity, together with the small scale, will therefore constitute a fundamental factor for Italy as it makes the transition to a completely carbon-free system, since it will make it possible to seize on the opportunities presented by an LNG market that is expected to be in oversupply, probably by the middle of the next decade, and at the same time manage the reduction of imports from southern countries (in particular from Algeria), thus offering supply alternatives for the spot market. In order to increase security, diversification and competition for the Italian gas system, the development of new LNG import capacity may constitute the factor necessary for guaranteeing the presence of more spot supply sources able to compete for the position of marginal source, keeping in line with European prices. In the gas sector various projects for small-scale LNG (SSLNG) coastal storage terminals have already been submitted to the authorities responsible for issuing construction and operating permits (the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport), to be carried out in Sardinia and on the Adriatic coast (Ravenna and Porto Marghera) and in the Tyrrhenian sea (Naples), for unloading LNG from small methane carriers, storing it and then loading it onto bunker barges and cryogenic tankers in order to refuel civilian and/or industrial customers and supply LNG to fuel stations. In Sardinia two of the three initiatives put forward envisage the coupling of SSLNG and mini regasification units. It will be appropriate and cost-effective to (i) provide natural gas to Sardinian industrial undertakings, citizen distribution networks, whether existing (replacing the current propane gas network) and already compatible with natural gas or under construction; (ii) to replace the fuels used by heavy-duty vehicles; (iii) to replace conventional marine fuels with LNG by gradually introducing a limit of 0.1 % of sulphur content in fuels used by ships at berth in ports and passenger vessels, and (iv) to INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 212   supply natural gas to the thermoelectric power plants put in place for the phase-out of carbon fuelled plants. Based on the results of the cost-benefit analysis launched by the RSE for ARERA, which will be available in Spring 2020, more adequate measures will be implemented for transporting natural gas. To offer Sardinian users connected to the distribution network prices in line with the rest of Italy, technical/regulatory solutions will need to be adopted which allow system charges to be levelled and the price of raw material to be correlated to the virtual trading point (VTP). To this end, in order to guarantee Sardinian consumers the requisite level of safety, parity and continuity of supply, consideration will be given to the possibility of connecting coastal storage units being built and authorised and regasification terminals in operation in Italy that will be equipped with a reloading system managed by the TSO, and to adopting a system that correlates the price of raw material to the VTP. In that regard, it should be noted that new projects are under way, including the OLT Offshore LNG regasification terminal in Tuscany that will make it possible to provide, in addition to the other activities it currently carries out, a small-scale service for unloading GNL onto small boats that will refurnish coastal storage facilities and bunkers in Italian ports and ports throughout the Mediterranean, as well as an identical service for the NGL plant in Panigaglia. The direct refuelling of GNL will enable the current mechanism for importing LNG using lorries and foreign terminals to be replaced, fostering the use of LNG as a fuel for maritime and land transport. The authorisation procedure for making the necessary modifications to the plants is being finalised.   ii. Regional cooperation in this area22 Cooperation with other Member States as part of the TEN-T programme for optimising resources and the overall plans for developing the LNG system for heavy-duty road and maritime transport. Possible setting-up of Sulphur Emission Control Areas, coordinated with neighbouring States. Other themes of interest which, following meetings with the other Member States in 2019, will be the subject of joint in-depth study are:  -east Europe (CESEC); and infrastructure in the Adriatic.  iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds  Much of the cross-border infrastructure planned for both the electricity sector and the gas sector forms the subject of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs), i.e. infrastructural interventions having positive effects for European countries, which make it possible to integrate EU markets, diversify energy resources and help bring an end to energy isolation. These are projects that concern the electricity and gas sectors: from LNG terminals to energy storage projects, also taking in the electricity power lines and the gas pipelines that connect the countries of Europe. Necessary infrastructure projects recognised as a Project of Common Interest will have greater access to financial support from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).                                                             22 Other than the PCI regional groups established under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 213     3.4.3 Market integration  i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.3  In order to promote greater market integration with other States, the amended text of the law on electrical dispatching (TIDE), in the finalisation phase following consultation (Consultation document 322/2019/R/eel), defines the guiding principles and provides for the following actions:    Scrapping the Single National Price (SNP) The scrapping of the SNP will be assessed in the medium term, given the management complexities and the operational constraints, which entails the management of the process for integrating European markets through market coupling and greater demand-side participation in the market. For that purpose, consideration will first be taken of the changes in network structures and the need to put in place preventive measures for reducing network congestion and/or the possible economic disadvantages of specific territorial areas, taking into account the increasing market penetration of renewables.   Developing market coupling Market coupling will continue to be developed  it is already at full speed on the day-ahead market, and is currently evolving on the intraday markets and on the dispatching services market  as regards the implementation of the provisions set out in the applicable European network codes (the CACM and Balancing Regulations). The shift to the target model for the intraday market (continuous trading and near real-time closure) is planned for the second half of 2020, in tandem with the reform of dispatching and the rules on imbalances. Indeed, the intraday market design shared at European level is a hybrid model based on continuous trading, interspersed with three auctions aimed, among other things, at allocating and exploiting trans-zonal residual capacity. Introducing negative prices in the Italian markets Italy needs to make up the delay in regulating wholesale prices, also with regard to market coupling, and provide for the possibility of negative pricing. In fact, at the present time, none of the electricity markets in Italy offer the possibility to submit negative price bids, as there markets, however. To foster an even better integration with European markets, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/943, which provides that market rules must not constrain pricing in any way, Italy plans to remove the floor, thus allowing negative price bids on the day-ahead and intraday markets. In fact, the possibility to bid at negative prices will help tackle, according to criteria of economic merit, the excess of supply caused by the lack of flexibility in demand and/or supply of electric energy. This creates conditions in which a producer is prepared to pay for acquire the right to feed electricity into the grid. Nevertheless, account must be taken of the supply of subsidised generation and the potential market power this implies, given that these aspects could attenuate or even nullify the beneficial effects of introducing negative prices. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 214   In this respect it will be necessary to make sure that, during the hours in which the closing prices on the day-ahead and intraday markets are negative, no incentives associated with loading electricity onto the grid are granted (a scenario already taken into account in the Ministerial Decree of 4 July 2019, RES1), whatever their nature, with the potential to recover them at the end of the entitlement period. In addition, in the case of plants powered by renewable energy sources, any incentives for producing electricity or loading it onto the grid will be granted even if the electricity is input because Terna has accepted offers to decease input on the dispatching services market or on account of emergency dispatching orders (such as those that lead to wind energy curtailment). Provisions will be made to ensure that incentives not granted are recovered only at the end of the entitlement period (therefore potentially after several years). This would prevent the absence of negative prices on the dispatching services market representing an obstacle to the provision of ancillary services in the case of plants powered by incentivised renewable energy sources.  ii. Measures to increase the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production such as smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, real-time price signals, including the roll-out of intraday market coupling and cross-border balancing markets   Reorganising and rationalising self-consumption arrangements The rolling-out of self-consumption arrangements and, looking further ahead, of energy communities is aimed at promoting a more decentralised electricity system and the active role of distributed generation and demand. First of all, the self-generation arrangements that can be achieved and the features thereof will be identified, also on the basis of the new EU guidelines. This will allow new, closed-off distribution systems to be produced, and measures will be identified for other private systems connected to plants powered by renewable sources or to high-efficiency cogeneration plants, including those integrated with the stockpile. In this respect, the nature of the entities authorised to implement the measures, the obligations concerning the security of the arrangements, the roles and rights of the individual consumers inside the self-generation systems, the procedures for participating in the markets, and relationships with DSOs and TSOs will all be regulated.  delegation of the necessary powers to the Government, and as far ahead as possible of the EU deadlines, within the framework of Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for electricity, amending Directive 2012/27/EU, and the transposal of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (recast), standards will be issued that make it possible, in an approach which reflects the decarbonisation targets, to implement direct lines, active customers, citizen energy communities and closed-off distribution systems, self-consumption of energy from renewable sources and renewable energy communities.    Supporting self-consumption arrangements The exemption of the payment of the variable parts of the charges for energy not taken from the public network is capable of supporting self-generation in the short term, without there being any particular effects to be managed. In close alignment with the reorganisation of the INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 215   self-consumption arrangements and the energy communities, the sustainability of that model for collecting network and system charges will be assessed for the purposes of any reforms that may need to be made during the evolution of sector, and to balance the effects of the growth of self-consumption expected by 2030. To that end, absolute priority will be given to ensuring transparency as regards the beneficiaries of the exemption, and the effects of the exemption as regards any possible alterations made to the taxable base will continue to be closely monitored. The procedures for contributing to the costs of the system for the new arrangements, other than those up to 50 kW under the exemption scheme, will however be such as to safeguard the support provided to forms of self-consumption from RES and HEC, also taking account of any possible switch to a system of explicit incentives and fewer requirements for support, owing to the latest drop in the costs of the technologies. The arrangements connected to the public network (physical self-consumption or on the outside perimeter) will continue to contribute towards the network charges. The measure is described in detail in section 3.1.2.   Developing energy communities As part of the measures voluntary participation in the markets, provision has been made, also in implementation of the EU legislation in the course of being adopted, to introduce a set of rules to permit and oversee the development of citizen-led initiatives (with other entities, including companies and municipal authorities, also being able to take part) that bring together new entities aimed at managing, predominantly for the benefit of society, energy consumption and generation levels, including through sharing mechanisms that may even be virtual. To that end, an initial analysis will be carried out in order to identify any impacts that the possible models for implementing the communities and any regulatory aspects (e.g. physical and/or virtual arrangements, geographical perimeter, etc.) may have on the system, in line with the provisions on renewable energy communities (section 3.2.1).   Rolling out technology for integrating vehicles with the electricity network (vehicle-to-grid) With the expected conversion of the sector to electric power, connected mobility could also become a flexible resource for meeting the needs that arise in managing the network, by developing innovative technologies like vehicle-to-grid. During a first phase, mechanisms and new rules for participating in the service markets for systems for recharging electric vehicles will be introduced, also providing for specific rebalancing measures for payment of the general charges of the system; in that sense, these initiatives will initially be rolled out on a trial basis. Thereafter, the aforementioned mechanisms will be extensively applied in order to promote the rolling-out of technology for integrating electric vehicles with the electricity network; initial impact assessments will be carried out so as to take account of the results of the trial phase and identify any opportunities for adapting the mechanisms. The Ministerial Decree setting out the rules for the functioning of vehicle-to-grid is currently being finalised. In the public consultation recommendations were made for solutions or incentives to foster vehicle-to-grid technology or smart recharging, for example by encouraging the installation and proliferation of photovoltaic equipment to power electric vehicle recharging points. Lastly, it will be key to put in place the Single National Platform for localising and using existing infrastructure.    Updating the dispatching model and role of distributors (DSOs) INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 216   During a first phase, ARERA will receive guidelines for reforming the operational structure of the dispatching market which, even though within the scope of a central dispatch model, provide for the DSOs to play a more active role by updating their responsibilities with respect to the provision of the network services rendered from the distributed resources and through new models of cooperation between the TSO and the DSOs; this is needed in light of the greater active participation and the resulting greater importance of the distributed consumption and generation resources (including by encouraging the aggregation of installations, potentially starting with pilot projects). In accordance with the approach that is nowadays prevalent both in Europe and Italy, it is deemed appropriate to maintain a model in which the balancing market is managed solely by the TSOs, with the DSOs assigned the role respect, one specific field of intervention will therefore relate to the procedures and systems in place for allowing the (transmission and distribution) grid operators to communicate with each other; it will also be worthwhile to define new standards of controllability and observability between the transmission network operator the users of the dispatching/balance service provider associated with the new entities participating in the ancillary services market (generation, consumption and storage aggregators). During a second phase, the gradual progression of the current central dispatch model towards a more decentralised model will be assessed on the basis of technical efficiency and security criteria, so as to take account of the need to manage an increasing proportion of distributed resources and the impetus provided by the new EU rules assigning new responsibilities to the DSOs, such as the provision of flexible services at a local level. In this regard, and taking into account the guidelines indicated by ARERA for reforming the dispatch model, it would be useful to start by taking a gradual approach based on experience gained through pilot projects involving new models that can effectively guide the way towards a reorganisation of roles and responsibilities. Furthermore, and in line with the guidelines indicated by ARERA in the TIDE, other potential elements aimed at improving, in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and transparency, the functionalities of the dispatching services market will be considered. These include introducing a marginal price system (to substitute the existing pay-as-bid system) for pricing on the market, as well as presenting assessments that could be useful for updating the criteria that Terna will be called upon to use to review the models currently used to optimise dispatching. This will ensure that the models are capable of representing a situation in which flexible resources will be increasingly made available by a plurality of different consumption and/or production units that are aggregated into virtual units.    Developing continuous trading in the intraday market As part of the changes to the operational structure of the intraday market (IM), and also to enforce the provisions set out under EU law, a procedure for allowing market operators to submit offers up to one hour before the market closes, through continuous trading procedures, will be implemented. These are changes that facilitate negotiations close to real time, by reducing the risks of any disparities in the positions of the operators and promoting increased participation in the market by RES operators, which, owing to the non-programmability of their plants, are mainly exposed to that risk. The reforms will be coordinated with the amendments to the rules governing the dispatching market by the TSO. Specific methods for coordination, including in the form of feasibility constraints on the changes to programmes by the enabled units, will be introduced so that continuous trading INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 217   can be carried out in a way that is compatible with the needs that arise from managing the dispatching service and the purchasing of services on that market by the network manager, in conditions of security and keeping costs for the system low.   Developing PPAs The measure is described in detail in section 3.1.2.   Introducing Sulphur Emission Control Areas The gradual introduction of a limit of 0.1% of sulphur content in fuels used by ships at berth in ports and passenger vessels.   Reducing the energy cost gap for gas-intensive industrial sectors compared with other EU Member States The intervention for reducing tariff charges for the industrial sectors most sensitive to energy prices and most exposed to foreign competition consists in putting in place a measure for energy-intensive undertakings, as introduced by the Ministerial Decree of 21 December 2017, for supporting the competitiveness of manufacturing sectors exposed to international competition by adopting efficient consumption parameters at a sector level for the purposes of granting subsidies. The measure is aimed at incentivising the efficient use of gas by gradually reducing the subsidies granted to undertakings classed as energy-intensive owing to the inefficiency of the manufacturing processes, and as a result is aimed at promoting efficient practices.   Stabilising taxes for LNG used for transport To guarantee a stable reference framework for assisting the investment decisions of the industrial branch of the sector and providing for the excise on natural gas, including in LNG form, used for transport to remain stable, based on current values.  iii. Where applicable, measures to ensure the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets   Developing storage capacity The development of renewables expected by 2030 has already led the TSO to quantify, in its own Development Plan, the requirements of new storage systems (described in section 2.3 iv) that will be needed, together with the development of the networks, in order to ensure that management is maintained under secure conditions. An assessment of the existing capacities in the different parts of the country and the best locations for storage plants has already been launched, bearing in mind the residual potential of existing water reservoirs. In addition, in line with the Clean Energy Package, steps will be taken to define a new regulatory framework able to promote the development and operability of the new storage capacity needed according to a market model in which stakeholders compete to offer network infrastructure with tariff adjustment). In that respect, the development of storage systems according to a market model is linked to the organisation of ancillary services, which is itself part of the wider reform of dispatching, on the assumption that the objectives of dispatching and the definition of the criteria for supply selection take account of the need to maximise the use of energy generated from renewable resources, reducing overgeneration to a INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 218   minimum. To ensure that the storage needs of the system are met in the event of market failure, provision has also been made for the TSO to be able, subject to authorisation from ARERA, and based on the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Economic Development, to construct and operate storage systems directly connected to the national transmission network, but only in the following two cases:  storage facilities incorporated into the national transmission network and instrumental for managing the security of the electricity system, but which cannot operate on the wholesale markets competing with the market operators that offer balancing services;  storage facilities capable of providing ancillary services to be supplied to the services market, for which a lack of interest of operators prepared to efficiently provide those services (collapse of the market) has been ascertained following tender proceedings.   Reinforcing concentrated storage systems In addition to putting new storage systems in place, provision has been made to enhance existing pumping stations, which are currently used predominantly for providing services to the network (power). From a long-term perspective, in which the proportion of non-programmable RES in the generation mix is destined to exceed 50 %, it is in fact necessary to have those stations operate in such a way as to be able to also offer energy services making it possible to postpone renewable energy production generated in hours (periods of the year) of excess supply and used in hours (periods of the year) of greater demand. In this context, the introduction of market mechanisms for accessing the power of those stations will be assessed.   Developing distributed storage systems Plans are in place to adopt a specific measure which, in line with the changes to Net Metering (see section 3.1.2, point i.), will allow renewable energy plants that fulfil specific requirements to benefit from a premium on self-consumed energy. The measure, which will be put in place through suitable regulatory provisions, will need to attract distributors by giving them an active role, with the aim of making production from non-relevant entities easier to predict and restricting over-generation.   Developing aggregation in the service and balancing markets Legislative Decree No 102/2014 introduced the possibility of creating aggregations of power generation plants, including alongside storage systems, and of consumption units for accessing the service markets for which the TSO needs to resolve any possible congestion and promote better integration of renewables. To that end, during a first phase, the network operator defines the rules for organising the participation in the services market of those new aggregations through pilot projects that are approved by ARERA. In recent years, various types of aggregations between power generation plants and consumption units have been approved, including those with storage systems. In addition, a decree will shortly be approved to launch specific projects for accessing the services market for electric vehicle batteries (V2G), integrating the current possibilities for participating in the pilot projects. Based on the outcomes of the projects, ARERA will be recommended to move towards a systematic form of control in order to fully open the services markets to those aggregations; INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 219   when the measures are implemented, account will need to be taken of the developments under way concerning the Europe-wide integration of the services markets and also of the technological developments allowing the system to be more flexible. The process for allowing new resources to enter the services market may also entail a review of the services currently defined and of the associated requirements concerning their provision; such a review will also need to take account of the provisions set out in the Balancing Guidelines. New commercial and contractual rules will also need to be developed in order to regulate the relationships between the aggregator entity and the user of the dispatching services or the end customer. During balancing, the short-term price signals and instruments will need to be improved in order to make distributed generation and demand more flexible, with the aim of enabling the new types of resources to actively contribute to the energy market and the ancillary services market to an even greater extent, and in an efficient way.  iv. Policies and measures to protect consumers, especially vulnerable and, where applicable, energy poor consumers, and to improve the competitiveness and contestability of the retail energy market   Completing the liberalisation of the retail markets The process for liberalising the retail market by 1 January 2020 will be completed by identifying the measures instrumental in scrapping the regulated price plans for household customers and small businesses, in accordance with criteria for promoting a competitive retail market structure. The initiatives will be put in place in coordination with the natural gas sector. These actions will need to be aimed at: preventing operators from exercising their market powers (especially in the household segment, which is still the most concentrated segment) and making the rules on unbundling, which currently give a competitive advantage to vendors integrated with distribution, more stringent; qualifying the retail market, which is currently extremely fragmented; encouraging consumers to be mobile and play an active role, and simplifying switching procedures.  A number of measures for consumers designed to accompany the liberalisation process in accordance with the above-mentioned objectives have been planned. These incorporate many of the proposals that emerged from the public consultation: - energy-use portal and other changes to the integrated IT system: the energy-use portal has been online since 2019 on the website of the company Acquirente Unico. The portal provides each consumer, within the limits of privacy laws, data on their own electricity and gas consumption, including general information on their supply contract and energy use over time, thanks to information acquired from the integrated IT system. Going forward, it will be decided whether to make such data available to third parties selected by the consumer. The development of data management tools is also planned, to use and make available to operators data on customers and supply, as well as metering data generated by the responsible entities. Thanks to the integrated IT system, processes for switching, transferring and activating/deactivating the supply, including in cases of overdue payment, will be made easier; INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 220   - new forms of non-price protection: a set of forms of protection (code of conduct, contractual conditions under PLACET (contracts with market-based prices but contractual conditions established by the regulatory authority) and other standard contractual conditions) made possible by maintaining and strengthening contractual protection and developing existing instruments, assessing differentiations on the basis of the diverse skills and tools available to end-customers. To this end, specific monitoring will also be carried out to identify over time any price increases not linked to market fundamentals as well as wrongful conduct on the part of operators; - register of suppliers: in order to do business all vendors of electricity will have to be registered on the list of electricity vendors. This will be established by Decree of the Ministry of Economic Development, as provided for in Law No 124/2017 (Article 1(80)-(81)). To be added to and to stay on the register, suppliers will have to comply with specific criteria and procedures and meet technical, financial and reputational requirements, which will be published and updated on the Ministry of Economic Developmenttools will be designed to assess the financial standing of operators and their solvency in terms of payments to end-customers, as well as their capacity to manage the processes and services inherent to their business, especially those with immediate repercussions on customers; - regulation of services of last resort: there are plans to develop the regulations on selection of operators, conditions of service provision and procedures for entering and exiting those services for end-customers without a free market supplier at the date on which the protection regime ends. This means establishing a safeguarding service for customers who are currently entitled to the Increased Protection service and the potential review of the other last resort services that currently exist;  - other measures: checks and sanctions regarding wrongful conduct, measures of protection for the weakest consumers (also in view of the room for manoeuvre provided by the Clean Energy Package in this regard), enhancing tools for comparing offers (already made available by ARERA and Acquirente Unico), and information campaigns to raise awareness among end-customers are planned. As for preventing wrongful conduct, making operators more responsible, also in relation to sales channels, is becoming fundamental. This will also involve firming up systems for automatically compensating service supply failures on the part of distributors, vendors and managers, to protect consumers in the event of a violation of their rights. Changes are expected to be made to the system of minimum guarantees and mechanisms for recovering outstanding claims from vendors, aimed at guaranteeing revenue for the purposes of the general interest (such as general system charges) and, at the same time, minimising recourse to end-customers to cover outstanding claims.    Measure for energy-intensive undertakings  The development of new renewables will have a lower specific generation cost than the previous phases, especially owing to the reduction in the costs of technologies. This will allow new investments to be made in the market value sector for energy, and possibly include measures for stabilising and reducing the risk of two-way type contracts and the development of PPAs, an instrument that may also meet the needs of many industrial and manufacturing sectors as regards bringing down energy costs whilst stabilising supply conditions. In addition, the measure for energy-intensive undertakings introduced by the Ministerial Decree of 21 December 2017 for supporting the competitiveness of manufacturing sectors exposed to international competition will be supplemented by adopting efficient consumption parameters at a sector level for the purposes of granting INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 221   subsidies. The measure aims to encourage the undertakings concerned to adopt efficient behaviours. -consumption portal  To foster the development of photovoltaic self-consumption, GSE has developed a special IT tool; the Photovoltaic Self-Consumption Portal. The main aims of the portal are to:  1. increase the availability and usability of information on the benefits of, and support tools in place for, photovoltaics; 2. enable an independent and punctual assessment of the initiatives, in order to increase awareness of their potentialities; 3. facilitate and support the launch of photovoltaic projects directed at self-consumption using a simulator, a guide to self-consumption, FAQs, maps and positive examples; these will illustrate the advantages of self-consumption, support tools available and provide examples of models and success stories. Once they are aware of the advantages of self-consumption, consumers will be able to test how useful it could be in their own individual circumstances. On the portal, private individuals, companies and public bodies can carry out personalised simulations. The analysis provided by the portal shows the size the plant should be and provides an economic evaluation of the initiative, on the basis of various potential financial solutions.    Reducing the spread between gas prices at the VTP and the northern European HUB prices The Ten-Year Network Development Plans of the Italian TSO (Snam) and the German TSO (TENP) will also include a joint assessment of the possibility of partially or fully reactivating Italian Regulatory Authorities, by setting out the procedures for carrying out the operation to be funded by the Italian system which, in return for that cost, would obtain a reduction in   v. Description of measures to enable and develop demand response including those addressing tariffs to support dynamic pricing23  Electricity and gas market: smart meters The new smart meters will play an important role in providing consumers with all the information they need to understand and monitor their energy consumption. From that perspective, these smart meters will be made fully operational, and the necessary network infrastructure will be developed. For electricity, the replacement of existing digital meters with the new second generation smart meters is a fundamental vehicle for the products, services and offers to be inserted into the new models of generation, distribution and consumption, also from a demand-response perspective, and smart grids.  The 2G meters were defined and regulated in terms of technical, functional and economic requirements by way of Resolution No 646/2006/R/eel for the period 2017-2019. Four million 2G meters have already been put into service for low-voltage users. In 2019 with Resolution No 306/2019/R/eel the regulations in this area were updated for 2020-2022,                                                             23 In accordance with Article 15(8) of Directive 2012/27/EU. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 222   including a plan for the time frames envisaged for the putting into service of 2G meters for all distribution companies with more than 100,000 customers (corresponding to 98% of extraction points in Italy). The updates provide for the following steps:    -scale replacement of existing meters must be finished by 2026 (for 95% of meters, the same percentage used for the first-generation meters). A target of 90% of replacements by 2025 is also set. For dispatching it will be possible to proceed with a gradual replacement, in line with the plans for activating the new 2G meters, of the mechanisms for profiling the inputs and withdrawals of small-scale users and plants using the measurements made available by new meters to define the physical parts of the dispatching service. In the gas sector the transition to smart metering (Resolution No 669/2018/R/GAS), which makes solutions with better functionalities where the cost differential is kept to a minimum or in any case lower than the expected benefits possible as of now, is expected to be completed according to the following time scale:  -customers, 85% in service by 31 December 2020; -customers, 85% in service by 31 December 2021; mpanies with between 50,000 and 100,000 end-customers, 85% in service by 31 December 2023;  -scale operators as well.  3.4.4 Energy poverty  Generally speaking, the policies for combating energy poverty can be broken down into three groups: 1. policies for reducing the energy bills of families (e.g. social bonuses or tariffs); 2. policies for improving the energy efficiency of households (regulations, tax breaks, energy supply certification schemes, energy tutors, etc.); 3. subsidies to low-incomes families. Various instruments falling within the first two groups exist in Italy, as shown in the following table. The first group (reducing energy bills) includes electricity and gas social bonuses and two tax deductions on electricity and heating fuel. The electricity and gas social bonuses provide, in the form of a bill discount, an amount that varies as a function of the number of family members and, with respect only to the gas social bonus, also as a function of the climatic zone and the type of use. Families wishing to access those social bonuses must have ent children). As well as these social bonuses, there is also an electricity bill discount available to people reliant on life-granted irrespective of income. Those social bo million in  million, for  million; between the launch of the mechanism and 31 December 2018, around 2.9 million families benefited at least once from the electricity bonus and INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 223   around 1.8 million families benefitted from the gas bonus. In both cases, these values have ample room for growth: the ratio of families effectively subsidised to those who might still benefit from the bonuses is between 30% and 35%, according to ARERA. In order to broaden access to the measure, in the last 12 months measures to coordinate the mechanism with other social policy measures have been introduced. Specifically, within the meaning of Article 5(7) of Decree-Law No 4 of 20 January 2019 (transposed in amended form by Law No 26 of 28 March pension) established by the same Decree have automatic access to the social bonuses for electricity and gas. As well as the social bonuses, there are also two tax reductions which reduce, respectively, the excise due for the first 150 kWh of electricity consumed per month by Italian families and the price of fuel used for heating in Sardinia and in mountainous areas/small islands. As regards the measures for improving the energy efficiency of households, there is a tax instrument has first been extended to families living in energy poverty, with loans initially being made available to individuals having insufficient funds, and then subsequently (the Budget Law for 2018), to independent social housing institutes.   i. Where applicable, policies and measures to achieve the objectives set out in point 2.4.4  The priority strategy for combating energy poverty involves several principal measures: 1. setting up a National Observatory of Energy Poverty; 2. reviewing the existing instruments, in particular the electricity and gas social bonuses; 3. subsidies for low income families; 4. putting in place a programme for making social housing buildings more energy efficient. As regards the first measure, in order to better coordinate existing efforts, and given also the fragmented nature of skills and resources, an Observatory of Energy Poverty is scheduled to be set up by the Ministry of Economic Development at the beginning of 2020. Although the Observatory will be coordinated by GSE at operational level, various entities and institutions will be called upon to take part. The Observatory will act as a focal point on the theme of energy poverty, both nationally and internationally. Among other things, the Observatory will be charged with reporting on and monitoring the phenomenon, as well as helping policymakers identify appropriate policies to fight it, including by measures of Table 31  Recipients of the gas and electricity bonus 2015-2018 [Source: ARERA]  Year Electricity bonus Gas bonus Total bonuses granted Economic hardship bonus Bonus for holders of purchase card Physical hardship bonus Economic hardship bonus 2015 622,151 22,520 28,267 448,496 1,121,434 2016 622,410 27,624 30,373 448,707 1,129,114 2017 706,969 25,473 32,643 499,808 1,264,893 2018 771,566 23,589 35,903 519,375 1,350,433  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 224   communication, promotion, training and supporting public bodies, operators and stakeholders.  The measure referred to in point 2, namely the review of the gas and electricity social bonuses, will be achieved by pursuing two main objectives:   reinforcing the two instruments by using a different model for accessing the bonuses based on the ISEE (equivalent economic situation indicator) as provided for by Law 124/2017. That law allows for individual economic benefits to be granted using methods other than cost compensation, identifying a potential joint payment of support measures for the cost of electricity and natural gas supply, and adjusting their amounts on the basis of the equivalent economic situation indicator;  broadening access of families in living in economic or physical hardship. Specifically, in addition to coordination with the instrument associated with citizenship income described above, plans are in place to introduce an automated mechanism for identifying those entitled to the relief schemes, by combining the existing databases at the company Acquirente Unico (Integrated Information System) and at the National Social Security Institute (Equivalent Economic Status Indicator database). To maximise its effects, this automated mechanism will also be extended to the phase for renewing certificates of entitlement.  tatus Indicator and the number of household members; the benefit will be, at most, equivalent to  ideal for covering heating costs (during the winter) or air-conditioning costs (during the summer). With reference to the bonuses for physical hardship, households with very low ISEE scores will be directly provided with highly technologically efficient equipment that will make application of the bonus more functional and concrete. The measures to automate recognition of economic or physical hardship, and the resulting simplification and streamlining of the procedures, accompanied by appropriate and wide-reaching training and information campaigns, will play a decisive role in broadening the base of bonus recipients, currently estimated by ARERA to be between 30% and 35% of potential beneficiaries. is being created. This involves setting up a rotation fund for granting capital contributions covering 100% of the cost of investment in photovoltaic installations for domestic use (up to 20 KW). Among the measures in form of subsidies, there are plans to determine standardised methods of intervention to reduce energy costs for populations affected by exceptional events (for example, the suspension of bills for families affected by earthquakes).  The measure referred to in point 4 involves exploring the option of launching a large-scale programme for making social housing more energy efficient. Such an initiative would pursue a variety of objectives at the same time: making the use of energy resources taken up by the residential sector more efficient (thus having positive effects on both comfort and emission levels), bringing down energy bills for the most vulnerable families who will be using this service, and increasing the value of the public housing assets. These measures will be INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 225   accompanied by actions to promote timely local initiatives aimed at reducing energy consumption, such as the creation of energy communities and self-consumption systems.  To incentivise the use of electricity produced using renewable sources and provide support to disadvantaged sections of the population, the Budget Law for 2020 allows instrumental or non-instrumental public bodies and Regions that manage subsidised, residential public housing to use, under given conditions, the mechanism of net metering of the electricity produced by the plants they own, with no power limit applied, to cover their own consumption and that of the residents of the public housing. This waives the obligation to ensure that the place of generation and consumption of the energy exchanged with the network are the same (exchange elsewhere), without prejudice to the payment, at a maximum of 30% of the entire amount, of general system charges. Decree-Law No 124 of 2019, converted into Law No 157 of 19 December 2019 (Tax Law for 2020) provides that from 1 January 2021, persons whose ISEE score is within predefined limits will have automatic access to the social bonus for electricity, natural gas and integrated water system supply. In addition, the Tax Law enables recipients of citizenship income to benefit from the social bonus for water as well as the bonuses for electricity and gas. Lastly, it provides that domestic users who are living in disadvantaged socio-economic conditions can benefit from subsidised tariffs for the integrated urban and related waste management service. The beneficiaries will be identified according to the same criteria used for the social bonuses for electricity, gas and integrated water services.
