GHG emissions and removals (for the plan covering the period from 2021 to 2030, the 2030 Framework Target). a) Policies and measures to achieve the target set under Regulation [ESR] as referred to in 2.1.1 and policies and measures to comply with Regulation [LULUCF], covering all key emitting sectors and sectors for the enhancement of removals, with an outlook to the long-term vision and goal to become a low-carbon economy with a 50 years perspective and achieving a balance between emissions and removals in accordance with the Paris Agreement; Responsible/involved parties*: Ministry of Climate (MK), Ministry of Infrastructure (MI), Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MRiRW), Ministry of Development (MR), Ministry of State Assets (MAP), Ministry of Development Funds and Regional Policy (MFiPR) * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. 1. Meeting the non-ETS (ESR) 2030 reduction target. Poland has considerably reduced total GHG emissions as compared with 1988. Notably, a profound reduction took place before 2005: from 1988 to 2005, the decrease reached ca. 30%, and from 1990 to 2005 it amounted to ca. 15%. Since 2005, the trend in total GHG emissions of approx. 400 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent may generally be regarded as stable, with some fluctuations in individual years. Given the above-described trends, the reduction of GHG emissions in the non-ETS sectors covered by the ESR by -7% until 2030 as compared with 2005 will be an ambitious challenge for Poland. An analysis of the current 2030 GHG emission forecast shows that aggregate emissions in those sectors will decrease. The following sectors have the largest shares in the GHG emission structure in Poland in the non-ETS sectors: households, i.e. municipal and domestic sector (ca. 30%), transport sector (ca. 27%), agricultural sector (ca. 15%). From the point of view of meeting the ESR target, the following sectors will be crucial for the level of GHG emissions: transport, agriculture, construction and non-ETS industry (which accounts for ca. 8% of GHG emissions in the non-ETS sectors). The emission trends in these sectors, as well as the actual emission levels in the period 2021-2030, will determine the final total emission level in the non-ETS area. Since 1990 the EU has managed to reduce its total CO2 emissions by 23%, mainly due to reductions in Central and Eastern Europe countries. Over the same period, CO2 emissions from car transport have increased by 20%. GHG emissions from the Polish transport sector decreased from ca. 48.8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2011 to ca. 44.1 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2013, to grow again to ca. 63.4 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2017, and constitute ca. 15.3% of the total domestic emission (in the EU transport emissions as much as 25% of the total emissions on average). Road vehicles, in particular passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, are responsible for the largest share (ca. 98%) of the transport sector emissions in Poland. Actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transport and agriculture sectors (which fall in the non-ETS category) are specified in the Sustainable Transport Development Strategy 2030 (TDS) and the Strategy for Sustainable Development of Agriculture, Rural Areas and Fisheries 2030 (SSDARAF). Actions to reduce emissions across the economy are foreseen by the State Environmental Policy 2030, which envisages the development in 2020 of a policy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in non-ETS sectors and support for identified actions to reduce non-ETS emissions by 2030. Generally, the non-ETS reduction target will be pursued based on the existing and new policies  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 52  and measures in the different sectors that fall outside of the scope of the Emissions Trading Scheme, including those discussed in the successive points of Chapter 3.1.1. If necessary, Poland intends to apply flexibility mechanisms provided for in the ESR to account for GHG emissions in the period 2021-2030, namely:  LULUCF flexibility (Article 7)  the ESR takes into account flexibility between the ESR and the LULUCF area, which enables the use of a certain pool of units deriving from removals in LULUCF to cover ESR emissions. Pursuant to Annex III to the ESR, the maximum volume of this pool for Poland for the entire 2021-2030 period is 21.7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. Units generated by the LULUCF sector will accounted towards the ESR target in the period 2021-2030, having regard to the aforementioned limit and the rules defined in the LULUCF Regulation. - adjustment  an additional pool of AEA units (Article 10(2))  Article 10(2) provides for an adjustment for Poland which will constitute a certain additional pool of units increasing the annual limit on a one-off basis, to be added in the first year of the commitment period. The value for Poland envisaged in Annex IV to the Regulation is 7,456,340 tonnes of CO2 equivalent; - banking, borrowing and transferring AEA units (Article 5)  as in the 2013-2020 commitment period, also in the future period, Member States may bank the unused part of their AEA limits to subsequent years of the commitment period, borrow a part of their AEA limits from the following years or buy AEA units from other Member States. The transfer of units among states may be linked to the implementation of GHG emission reduction projects. If necessary, Poland intends to take advantage of the above possibility of having flexible access to and using its own AEA units, as well as of buying accounting units from other Member States; - security reserve (Article 11)  should the remaining flexibilities turn out to be insufficient to cover an AEA shortfall in the period 2026-2030, Poland is planning to use an additional pool of units, taken from the security reserve, at the end of the commitment period (in 2032). The maximum total pool for all Member States that meet specific conditions is 105 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The detailed approach to be followed towards the reduction target in the non-ETS sectors will be outlined in the National Allocation Management Strategy, which will be prepared by 2022 and approved by the Council of Ministers pursuant to Article 21d of the Act on the management of greenhouse gas and other substance emissions. The purpose of the Strategy is to determine the objectives and guidelines for clearing non-ETS emissions, taking into account the actual and forecast GHG emissions and the market situation (the supply of and demand for AEA units). At present, the reduction effort necessary to meet the 2030 non-ETS reduction target cannot be defined in a precise manner, as the key EU implementing legislation (including input data for calculations) which would precisely define the value of the reference point (the emission level in 2005) or emission allowances (allocations of AEA units) for particulars years in the period 2021-2030, are not available yet. However, it is expected that meeting the 2030 target will require a greater effort than attaining the 2020 target.  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 53  2. In accordance with the Sustainable Transport Development Strategy 2030, the negative impact of transport on the environment will be mitigated by supporting, inter alia:  solutions promoting low-carbon vehicles, including electromobility;  diversity and complementarity of individual forms of transport within the network, as well as by supporting the types of transport with the lowest environmental impact;  managing demand for transport, including promotion of sustainable mobility patterns;  deploying innovative traffic management systems;  modernisation and expansion of transport infrastructure in line with EU and national environmental standards and requirements;  modernisation of the rolling stock and vehicle fleet (vehicles and other necessary devices and accessories, including alternative fuel infrastructure) across the transport modes to align them at least to EU and domestic environmental standards and requirements;  managing demand for freight transportation by combining transport volumes;  public transport and vehicle sharing systems, while limiting the use of individual motor vehicles;  reallocation of tasks between individual types of transport (modal split) and maximising the share of zero- and low-emission vehicles;  striving to reduce pressure on the environment by developing transport infrastructure on the basis of existing spatial structure with priority given to the use of brownfield areas and taking into account landscape impact.  following the road transport-related Recommendations of the Economic Committee of the Ministers on 25 April 2017, including recommendations on how to reduce exhaust emissions in road traffic, foster the creation of clean transport zones, and improve supervision over the quality of exhaust emissions from vehicles by redesigning the system of oversight over vehicle inspection stations. The TDS provides for a number of activities dedicated to reducing the negative impact of transport on the environment, which address organisational and systemic issues, investments, as well as innovations and technologies.     3. Implementation of the 2030 Strategy for Sustainable Development of Rural Agriculture and Fisheries (SSDARAF) with a focus on environmental intervention. The Polish agricultural sector accounts for around 12% of GHG emissions (including about half of non-CO2 emissions, which are associated mainly with animal production and fertiliser management). Even though the potential for reducing emissions in agriculture is limited by biological processes, the agricultural sector has significant potential for CO2 absorption and storing in biomass and soil. In agriculture, climate policy objectives can be pursued through the promotion of sustainable farm production structure, agrotechnical practices, fertiliser management, precision agriculture techniques, development of a circular bioeconomy, protection of permanent grassland, protection of organic soils and proper water management. It is necessary to stress the risk that excessively restrictive requirements and too ambitious emission abatement targets in European agriculture, including that of Poland, could quickly    III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 54  cause it to be transferred to world regions with lower production standards and a high environmental and climate footprint (carbon leakage). The SSDARAF provides for a number of environmental actions, including:  -  actions for high air quality in rural areas in transport and spatial management;  maintaining and, if land for afforestation is available, increasing the total woodland area in the country and the compactness of forest complexes and afforested areas;  supporting the development of green infrastructure in rural areas to adapt to climate change;  promoting eco-farming, dissemination of environmentally-friendly methods of agricultural and fishery production, and management of by-products from agriculture, fisheries and agri-food processing;  water quality protection, inter alia by rational management of fertilisers and plant protection products and promoting agrotechnical practices beneficial for water quality, as well as promoting parallel plant and animal production;  protection of soils used for agriculture (against erosion, contamination, acidification, loss of organic matter);  supporting environmentally sound investments in agricultural holdings and fisheries;  dissemination of knowledge on how to protect the environment in agriculture and fisheries, e.g. improving and furthering the system of advice and promoting good agricultural practices;  supporting research on environmental protection in rural areas and in fisheries. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) will be an important policy in reducing GHG emissions in agricultural production and adapting agriculture to climate change in the period 2020-2030. The CAP 2020 legislative package presented by the European Commission assumes, inter alia, introducing a minimum level of spending on climate-related action of 40% of the CAP budget allocation. 4. Reducing CO2 emissions in the construction sector The key measures to reduce GHG emissions in this sector include gradual tightening of energy and thermal insulation standards and fostering the use of renewable energy sources in keeping with new legislation (newly formulated energy requirements, obligation to analyse alternative heating and electricity supply options for buildings) for newly erected and renovated buildings. In parallel, Poland is working on a strategy for renovating the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private ones, the implementation of which will contribute to reducing emissions from the construction sector and reducing energy consumption in the area, while adding to the energy efficiency target. In addition, Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure of 12 April 2002 on the technical conditions to be met by buildings and their siting (Journal of Laws 2019, item 1065) define, inter alia, the maximum values of the thermal transmittance coefficient for the budemand limit values. In addition, the technical and construction provisions that transpose Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings into Polish law are meant to ensure that after 31 December 2020 all new buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. The above actions will reduce emissions    III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 55  from the construction sector. 5. Reduction of CO2 emissions in the power and heating sector through actions envisaged by the State Environmental Policy 2030 and strategic documents for the energy sector (draft Energy Policy of Poland until 2040): - retrofitting of power plants, combined heat and power plants, and heating plants  replacing low-efficiency coal-fired power plants by new high-efficiency facilities that meet strict environmental standards on emissions; - increasing the use of renewable energy sources and developing reserve gas sources in connection with it, as well as expansion of transmission/distribution infrastructure; - deployment of nuclear power; - development of energy-efficient heating systems and low-emission individual heating; - development of low-carbon transport, including electromobility; - increasing energy efficiency. The energy sector (referred to in the Inventory as Energy industries) accounted for ca. 50% of CO213 emissions in 2017. Thus, it is a sector with a major share in the greenhouse gas emissions, where even minor percentage changes result in considerable changes in the volume of emissions in CO2 tonnes and tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The draft Energy Policy of Poland until 2040 from November 2019 provides for evolutionary transition of the electricity generation sector towards a lower-carbon sector, at a rate guaranteeing energy security and without jeopardising the competitiveness of the economy. The share of RES in electricity generation is expected to rise from the current 14% to ca. 32% in 2030 with further development of the sector expected over the next decade. An increase in the use of RES, the decommissioning of end-of-life, low-efficiency coal-fired units which do not meet the emission requirements (under the BAT Conclusions), as well as the deployment of nuclear power, will reduce the average CO2 emission level per unit of generated electricity (kg of CO2/MWh) by ca. 20% by 2030 and by ca. 50% by 2040 as compared with the present level. A major part of the energy sector is covered by the EU ETS, which  by limiting the volume of emissions at the EU level and assessing the EUR value of each tonne of CO2, indirectly contributes to a systematic change in the fuel mix and the level of technologies used to generate energy in the EU and nationally. It should be stressed, though, that the EU ETS itself by definition does not set national reduction targets in relation to greenhouse gas emissions. It nevertheless does result in the need to undertake additional measures to support emission reduction at the level of individual Member States. The use of mechanisms provided for in the EU ETS Directive to support the transformation of the electricity sector is described below in section 3.1.1.(c)   6. Launching climate change mitigation and adaptation measures Testing the capacity of forest ecosystem elements to retain more carbon by methodologies involving the expansion of existing technologies and the scope of growing and management work for all forests irrespective of ownership type For this purpose, measures forming part of the Forest Carbon Farm pilot project carried out by      III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 56  envisages an attempt to achieve an increased carbon dioxide removal by forest areas through additional forest management activities to be carried out within its impact area. As part of the work already conducted in the initial period the scale and location of activities have been established and first forestry works have been started. Based on inventory data concerning the forest area involved in the FCF project, the expected effect, i.e. the volume of additional carbon dioxide accumulation, has been modelled. The pilot part of the Project will last 10 years (2017-2026), with the effect modelling and effect durability periods expected to span 30 years. As one of its effects, the Forest Carbon Farm project, which is important for enhancing the quality of the carbon balance inventory in forest ecosystems, will improve the system for acquiring forest-related data for emission reporting and removal purposes, as envisaged in the project, by launching measures aimed at building a carbon removal model for forests in Central Europe conditions. The acquired data will also provide a basis for considering additional measures in the forest sector on a broader scale. Adaptation actions Measures will be introduced to adapt to climate change by ensuring the sustainable development and effective operation of the economy and society in climate change conditions, including measures to: - ensure good environmental status, to promote compact, multi-function spatial systems and polycentric urban structures; - include an environment-friendly and low-carbon spatial development approach in spatial planning processes; - develop transport in climate change conditions; - ensure sustainable regional and local development having regard to climate change; - ensure effective adaptation to climate change in rural areas; - stimulate innovations facilitating adaptation to climate change; - form social attitudes helpful in adaptation to climate change. The priority areas specified constitute an answer primarily to the ongoing climate changes and their current and expected consequences for vulnerable sectors. The intensity of adaptation measures will depend, inter alia, on the dynamics of climate change until 2030 and in subsequent decades. Furthermore, a low-carbon economy requires a spatial development approach that will ensure efficient use of land and infrastructure and reduce emissions from transport and individual heat sources while following the idea of a compact and cost-efficient city in the spatial planning process. Work is under way to develop an updated strategy for adaptation to climate change, setting out measures and targets beyond 2020 (Strategic Adaptation Plan - SPA2020). The document is planned to be completed by 2020. Currently, in addition to SPA2020, adaptation issues are also addressed by the draft State Environmental Policy 2030, as adopted by Resolution No 67 of the Council of Ministers of 16 July 2019. Owing to the absence of clear national or European indicators concerning adaptation measures, the expected effects of measures undertaken in the period 2021-2030 are of general and qualitative nature.  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 57    7. Rationalisation of the use of fertilisers, including nitrogen fertilisers Issues relating to the storage and use of fertilisers containing nitrogen, including livestock manure, are regulated in the Water Law of 20 July 2017 and Regulation of the Council of Ministers of 5 reducing water pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources and preventing further r Law. The Water Law stipulates in particular that a livestock manure dose used in a year for agricultural purposes may not contain more than 170 kg of nitrogen in terms of pure ingredient per hectare of agricultural area used. Additionally, Chapter 1.5 of the aforementioned Regulation of Council of Ministers provides that a nitrogen fertilisation plan is to be prepared by entities: - having a farm with an area of more than 100 ha of agricultural land used, or - growing intensive crops on arable land in an area in excess of 50 ha, or - maintaining stocking density in excess of 60 livestock units (LU) on an annual average basis. All entities will thus be obliged to apply fertilisers in a rational fashion. The Nitrate Programme will require entities engaged in agricultural production to undertake necessary and long-lasting investment activities. Pursuant to the Nitrate Programme, entities engaged in agricultural production and in the activities referred to in Article 102(1) of the Water Law are obliged to put the area or capacity of sites designated for storing natural fertilisers (livestock manure) in line with the requirements set out in the Programme, by: (1) 31 December 2021  in the case of entities breeding animals in numbers exceeding 210 LU, including entities raising or breeding poultry in numbers exceeding 40,000 places or raising or breeding pigs in excess of 2000 sty places for pigs with weight exceeding 30 kg or 750 sty places for sows; (2) 31 December 2024  in the case of entities engaged in raising or breeding livestock in numbers not exceeding 210 LU. To adapt to the new requirements farmers must ensure appropriate funds in their farm budgets. Additionally, funds must also be ensured in the state budget to support investment activities. The Water Law (by amending Article 400a(1)(2a) of the Environmental Protection Law of 27 April 2001) has obliged environmental protection and water management funds to finance projects involving the implementation of a programme of measures aimed at reducing water pollution with nitrates from agricultural sources. Explanatory MemorandumThe explanatory memorandum of the Law notes that projects involving the implementation of the Nitrate Programme will be funded with the use of repayable instruments, subject to State Aid rules. Additionally, some of the measures relating to the implementation of the Nitrate Programme may be supported by EU funds, subject to State Aid rules. Having regard to the conditions referred to above and the fact that the Nitrate Programme, pursuant to Article 102 of the Water Law, will be applied by all entities engaged in agricultural production, including special branches of agricultural production, and in activities as part of which livestock manure is stored, the following solutions have been applied: - the requirements applicable to date with respect to manure storage have been transferred Programme, and have been set to apply from the effective date of the Programme,      III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 58  - the gradual adaptation of farms to the requirements concerning appropriate facilities to store liquid manure (with watertight bottom and sides and covered) and places for storing solid manure (watertight bottom and sides) for livestock manure storage over 6 and 5 months, respectively, has been staggered over time. Measures in this respect will be continuous, spanning the period 2021-2030. 8. Measures to improve air quality As a result of the air protection policy pursued, emission of pollutants into the air has been reduced considerably over the last thirty years, including that of PM by more than 80%, sulphur dioxide by 70%, and nitrogen oxides by 40%. Nevertheless, in accordance with the report entitled Air Quality Assessment for 201814, out of all 46 zones in Poland, exceedances of limit values were found in 39 zones for PM10 and in 14 zones for PM2.5. Analyses show that the responsibility for this state of affairs rests primarily on the household and municipal and domestic sector, transport and, to a minor extent, industry. Improving the quality of the air is one of the priorities of the Government of the Republic of Poland. Detailed activities in this respect are set forth in the State Environmental Policy 2030, which provides, inter alia, for:  the implementation of the Clean Air strategic project,  support for local governments as regards multi-criteria management of area emissions (heating systems) and line emissions (transport), as well as the siting of investments with point emitters,  supporting the development of low-carbon transport,  abatement of air pollutant emissions through the implementation of the MCP and NEC Directives, support of pro-environmental investments,  developing an odour policy,  -  creation of a nationwide system of advisory support in the field of energy efficiency and RES for the public, housing and enterprise sectors,  Development and financial support of the State Environmental Monitoring as regards air quality measurements. The strategic project of the State Environmental Policy 2030 named Clean Air involves creating nationwide legal and financial mechanisms for effective delivery of air quality programmes at the provincial and local levels, mainly in respect of the municipal and domestic sector and transport, in particular through: - creating and improving a legal framework stimulating effective measures to improve air quality, - popularisation of financial mechanisms that work towards improving air quality, - involving residents in action to improve air quality by raising public awareness and creating sustainable platforms for dialogue with public organisations, - development and populerisation of technologies conducive to improving air quality, - -         III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 59  quality. For several years, Poland has been pursuing a number of measures to eliminate what is referred -National Air Quality Programme15 was developed and adopted on 9 September 2015. It is aimed at bringing emissions below the limit values for particulate matter and other hazardous substances in the air, as set out in the applicable laws. Furthermore, it is worth stressing that to enhance the effectiveness of measures envisaged in air quality programmes and short-term action plans local governments have been provided with an additional tool as part of the amendment to the Environmental Protection Law (known as the Anti-Smog Act) of 10 September 2015 (Journal of Laws 2015, item 1593). Pursuant to Article 96 of the Environmental Protection Law of 27 April 2001 (Journal of Laws 2017, item 519, as amended) provincial assemblies may, by resolution, restrict or prohibit the operation of installations in which fuels are combusted, in order to prevent an adverse impact on the environment. At the same time, such resolutions must specify the types or quality of fuels to be admitted for use or prohibited from being used. By 1 November 2019, 11 provinces had adopted what is referred to Anti-Smog Resolutions. Owing to the unsatisfying condition of the air in Poland, on 25 April 2017, the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers presented Recommendations for the Council of Ministers  the Clean Air Programme, which contain a set of actions necessary to improve air quality. The actions are implemented gradually. It should be emphasised that measures aimed at improving the quality of the air are also envisaged in other documents of key importance for the development of Poland, including in the Strategy for Responsible Development  the Environmental Policy 2030, as well as in the draft Energy Policy of Poland until 2040. At present, Regulation of 1 August 2017 on the requirements for solid fuel boilers (Journal of Laws, item 1690) is in force. The Regulation obliges entities marketing solid fuel boilers with a rated thermal output of not more than 500 kW to comply with boiler design requirements ensuring the achievement of specific limit values of the emissions of carbon oxide, gaseous organic compounds and particulate matter. Additionally, it bans the use of an emergency grate in boiler structures. The adoption of Regulation of the Minister of Energy of 27 September 2018 on the quality requirements for solid fuels is worth highlighting. The improvement of the air quality is also to be achieved through measures relating to the development of district heating systems (in particular heating networks and energy-efficient heating systems based on cogeneration or RES or using waste heat from industrial plants). Additionally, one of the basic measures to improve the quality of the air will be the development of gas distribution to satisfy heating needs. A pilot programme for thermomodernisation and replacement of individual heating devices for the poorest has been prepared under the name SMOG STOP. The programme was published on 22 February 2018. It is addressed to 23 towns ranked among the 50 most polluted towns in Europe presented by the World Health Organization. In 2018, Poland launched the , financed by the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management. It is a comprehensive government scheme aimed at improving air quality, which provides support for  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 60  thermomodernisation of single-dwelling houses and replacement of old heating sources. The programme is dedicated to improving energy efficiency and reducing air emissions of PM and other pollutants, caused by the use of outmoded heat sources and low-quality fuel to heat single-family houses. The programme is to be delivered until 2029, with a budget of PLN 103 billion. Since the transport sector in large cities is the main cause of nitrogen dioxide limit value exceedances, an expert study entitledAnalysis of the possibilities of creating reduced transport emission zones in Poland has been prepared, as required by the National Air Quality Programme. The results of the analysis are the basis for defining eco- and cost-efficient solutions capable of effectively contributing to the reduction of transport emissions in a given area and will constitute justification for taking decisions to create reduced transport emission zones in Poland. It should also be pointed out that under the Act of 11 January 2018 on electromobility and alternative fuels (Journal of Laws 2018, item 317), in order to prevent the negative impact of emissions from transport on human health and the environment, municipal councils can resolve, under Article 39 of the Act, to establish within high-density housing areas with a concentration of public buildings clean transport zones with restricted access for vehicles other than electric, hydrogen-powered, or gas-fuelled vehicles. The problem of inadequate air quality in cities is also caused by inappropriate spatial planning. In city centres, natural aeration corridors become blocked. Therefore, the issue of reducing undesirable urban sprawl and green wedge blocking has been signalled in the reform of the spatial planning system which is currently being prepared by a team of experts. The problem of inadequate spatial planning covers also the issues of the construction of transit routes in densely populated areas. Their location outside urban areas should be considered, along with the construction of by-pass roads taking traffic outside urban areas, the construction of inter-modal nodes and the expansion of environment-friendly transport networks (including a railway system).   8. Just energy transition The idea of just social and infrastructural transition, associated with the transformation of mining regions, plays a central role in achieving the growingly demanding climate goals. Polish mining regions face major transformational challenges, such as changes in the labour market, and reclamation and regeneration of brownfield land. Minimising the social costs that will accompany economic changes towards low-carbon economies will be crucially important. This means that regions exposed to the negative effects of the transformation should receive support. The pace of energy transition must be adapted to the economic standing and financial capabilities of mining regions. Optimally, the development of solutions in support of just transition should take the form of further dialogue with social partners and local authorities, which is particularly important in restructuring the mining regions that are most vulnerable to climate and energy transition. There is a need to implement development programmes for such regions, e.g. through special support for development projects, creating favourable conditions for conducting and developing business activity, or additional labour market mechanisms, as well as through modernising the sector, and investing in low- and zero-emission generation sources. Given the challenges facing coal mining regions, a restructuring plan for hard coal and      III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 61  lignite mining areas, to be co-financed by EU funds, will be developed in 2020. The above plan will require preparing an in-depth analysis of the impact of the transformation of mining regions, notably the economic development of the regions, society, employment and skills. Poland strives to provide adequate financial resources to accelerate the transition of the energy sector (including mining) towards decarbonisation as part of modernising the entire economy. In December 2017, the Polish Government launched the Programme for Silesia (Program dla Poland has actively joined the Coal Regions in Transition Initiative, which was launched by the European Commission in December 2017. Initially, of the 6 Polish coal regions identified by the European Commission, only Silesia participated, which  being the largest mining region in the EU  was selected as the pilot region. Given the growing interest in the programme by other attracting other regions. Poland considers the platform an opportunity for stepping up efforts towards social and infrastructural transition through cooperation between regional authorities, social partners, and the government administration. In addition, there are regional strategies for the transformation of coal regions. These include the two. Furthermore, work is underway to prepare a document setting out the transition strategy for the Wielkopolska region. It is necessary to intensify the transfer of EU funds dedicated to coal and lignite production regions in order to support the transformation and minimise the socio-economic effects produced by the EU climate and energy policy in those regions. Therefore the Polish Government will strive to develop, in cooperation with the EU, financial instruments supporting energy transition, such as the Just Transition Fund, and to ensure that the funds are used by the Polish coal regions with high levels of employment in mining. As regards employment policy, high-quality job creation and requalification efforts will be crucial to transform the economy into a low-carbon one. Actions will be needed in support of just transition in coal-dependent regions to help employees change jobs and acquire new and specialised skills, support employment initiatives and start-ups, while maintaining dialogue with the green economy. A profound moderniregions where hard coal and lignite are extracted. Changes in the economy, including the energy sector and the labour market, should be looked at as development opportunities. The Polish government attaches great importance to the job potential associated with renewable energy sources. The development of renewable energy will translate into new job creation in the wind, solar, bioenergy and other sectors. The development of renewable energy will benefit the national, regional, and local labour markets. b) Regional cooperation in this area. Responsible authority*: MK 1.

Paris Agreement (PA), which are international legal instruments obliging countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Pursuant to the Paris Agreement, all parties are required to prepare, communicate and maintain, on a regular basis, nationally determined contributions to achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement, as well as to take measures at the national level aimed at reducing emissions for the purpose of attaining these contributions. Both the EU and Member States have fulfilled this obligation by submitting, in 2015, their intended Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which envisages, inter alia, a EU declaration to carry out its internal commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% from 2021 to 2030, as compared with 1990, throughout the EU. The Paris Agreement does not impose specific solutions which might affect the sovereign decisions of the parties to the Agreement, but aims at reducing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere through both the reduction of emissions and an increase in their removal by forests and soil. Pocommitments in the form of further NDCs. They will not be legally binding, but in the case of f which will be based on the internal decisions of the EU and its Member States with respect to the future EU energy and climate policies (and thus the emission reduction targets binding under the EU internal laws, defined in such policies). The nationally determined contribution is expected to be achieved in accordance with the adopted guidelines. The decisions on climate neutrality until 2050 adopted at the December 2019 European Council are an important issue in the context of the EU NDC contribution to achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement.   c) If applicable, without prejudice to the applicability of State aid rules, financing measures, including EU support and the use of EU funds, in this area at national level.

Additionally, Poland plans to deploy instruments supporting the reduction and then elimination -connection to district heating networks having regard to the optimisation of expenditures, the development of the natural gas network infrastructure, the introduction of low-carbon zones (at present, clean transport zones are covered by the Act on electromobility and alternative fuels of 11 January 2018). 2. Mechanisms envisaged in the new EU ETS Directive to be in force in the period 2021-2030 According to the emission allowance allocation for the 4th period of the EU ETS (2021-2030),      III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 63  11. On 30 July 2019, by its decision on the division of the 2021-2030 auction pool and on whether or not to take advantage of mechanisms provided for by the Directive, the Council of Ministers auctioning. The proceeds from the sale of 275 million emission allowances will be allotted to the national specific-target fund for the modernisation of the energy sector, which is managed by the minister competent for energy. In addition, decision was taken to auction in 2020-2021 the emission allowances unused in the current accounting period, as per Article 10c. The funds obtained in this way are to constitute state budget revenues, with the proviso that proceeds from the sale of approx. 30 million allowances will be allocated for investments in the energy sector. The Modernisation Fund provided for in the EU ETS Directive is a new instrument of the European Energy Policy, which is to span the years 2021-2030. Its main goal is to promote investments aimed at modernising the energy sector (modernisation of energy systems, improvements in energy efficiency). The Modernisation Fund will be financed through the auction of up to 2% of the total EU ETS allowances (optionally to be increased by another 0.5%). Poland will highly benefit from the Modernisation Fund, consuming a share of 43.41%. A portion of companies, while the rest for implementing programmes addressed to wider target groups. In light of the above, given the Polish and EU climate and energy policy lines, the resources of both Funds should be primarily allocated to investments aimed at delivering the National Energy and Climate Plan, in particular:  nuclear energy;  repowering of generating units in the energy sector,  development of transmission and distribution networks, including heating systems,  improving energy efficiency, including in construction,  RES along with accompanying infrastructure, including dams where hydroelectric power stations can be built,  curbing emissions from transport, including electromobility,  energy storage,  promoting the use of hydrogen fuels,  increasing interconnections between EU Member States,  measures to ensure just transition. In 2023, the funding mechanisms and absorption of funds are to be reviewed, in particular to check whether the mechanisms need to be changed or not. 3. Development of district heating and co-financing of the connection of new consumers Having regard to the need for multifaceted measures to improve air quality, the development of district heating in urbanised areas improves the situation in a unique way and reduces low-stack emissions from inefficient local boilers.                                               11 According to estimates of the Ministry of State Assets, in cooperation with the Ministry of Climate and KOBiZE  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 64  Making use of financial support dedicated to district heating systems is intended to expand their coverage and connect new consumers. This measure is necessary to improve the quality of the air in Poland by eliminating individual heat sources and replacing them with district heating. Consideration should be given (especially in the context of regional measures) to possible financial support for the modernisation of the internal infrastructure of buildings, necessary to receive heat supplied by district heating systems. A parallel measure necessary to increase the efficiency of the use of primary energy carriers, and thus to reduce CO2 emissions from the district heating sector, is the reduction of distribution losses of heating networks. Funds assigned to this measure should be expended, inter alia, on the retrofitting of district heating substations and replacement of heating pipes by pre-insulated piping. Proposed form of financing: a grant or preferential lending. 4. Support for the utilisation of coal-bed methane Approximately 80% of coal resources in Poland constitute deposits classified as deposits containing methane, and the greenhouse effect of methane is 21 times greater than that of CO2. Therefore, if appropriately included in the sector transformation process, methane may become an important raw material in the Polish energy mix, contributing to the energy security of the country and, at the same time, to a considerable reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The use of methane for energy purposes exemplifies an activity which is not only beneficial for the environment, but also brings economic gains (the calorific value of methane is more than double of the calorific value of coal) and social gains (improvement of the work safety of miners). Coal mine methane has already been used to some extent in the econonomy (mainly for the counterparties to which it is sold by mines. Activities are needed to support increased use of CMM, because currently only about 20-25% of methane released in coal mining processes is ultimately utilised. The utilisation of methane is consistent with EU targets concerning the development towards circular economy, since at present a large portion of methane is treated as waste, whereas it can be used as fuel. 3.1.2. Renewable energy (2030 Framework Target) a) Policies and measures to achieve the national contribution to the binding EU-level 2030 target for renewable energy and trajectories as presented in 2.1.2 including sector- and technology-specific measures16. Responsible/involved parties*: MAP, MR, MFiPR,  Support for renewable energy Pursuant to EU regulations concerning State Aid for energy, support for renewable energy should be based on competitive systems, promoting the reduction of costs involved in meeting targets. In Poland, renewable energy sources in the electricity sector are supported with the use, inter alia, of an auction system, which should be regarded as the most effective solution from the economic point of view. Support granted on the basis of an auction offers permanent and stable conditions for investing in new RES installations. The support system adopted in the form of auctions enables aid to be channeled to selected areas and sectors and thus the energy mix to  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 65  * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. be optimised with regard to electricity. The auction system mechanisms make it possible to stimulate the development of areas with potential for the development of renewable energy sources based on economic, environmental and climate conditions, taking into account and having regard to energy security, technical criteria and the needs of local communities. The mechanisms for supporting and promoting energy production from renewable energy and the time horizon of support will be tailored to market needs (although it is expected to be necessary until 2030), and will prioritise the following solutions: - ensuring maximum availability (high efficiency and utilisation rate, controllability, the use of an energy storage facility), with a relatively lowest energy generation cost; - satisfying local energy needs (heat, electricity, transport), but also those relating to waste treatment and disposal (consistent with the waste management hierarchy) and the use of local potential. The support will depend on the type of source and its size, with the following hierarchy: - priority access to the network  currently granted all RES installations and the central focus of support. This measure may be modified in the future, but after 1 January 2020, installations with a capacity below 400 kW (and from 1 January 2026 below 200 kW) will continue to have priority access, as required by Regulation 2019/943 of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electricity.  auctions  designated for commercial power plants i.e. those ensuring that capacity is available at sufficient levels. The choice of areas to be supported depends on preferences as to the stimulation of the development of RES areas, based on economic, environmental and climatic conditions and having regard to energy security; - feed-in tariff system and feed-in premium system  they are targeted on sources with a relatively low capacity and applied to utilise energy which is not consumed by small producers;  grants, repayable aid  a mechanism depending on local needs, mainly distributed in regions; - guarantees of origin  documents confirming to the final customer that a certain amount of electricity supplied to the grid has been generated from renewable energy sources  they take the form of certificates and the demand for them is driven by consumers that wish to be perceived as green companies or want to demonstrate high energy efficiency (e.g. building administrators, SMEs or operators of electric car chargers);  aid mechanisms targeted on special technologies  a solution designated for sources for which there is no competition in the market, since they are a new technology (e.g. offshore wind energy generation), but their implementation is important for the country for various reasons, e.g. high consumption of demand over the year. Progress in the field of renewable energy will be ensured, inter alia, by a range of solutions provided for in the amended RES Act, which entered into force on 29 August 2019. The amendment enabled RES electricity auctioning in 2019, with more than 3400 MW allocated for the auctions. It was assumed that the results of the 2019 auctioning would allow annual RES production to be increased by about 9.2 TWh of electricity. In addition, the above amendment introduced solutions stimulating prosumer energy generation and energy cooperatives.      III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 66  Furthermore, in order to give a boost to prosumer energy production, additional schemes were Scheme, whose goal is to increase energy production from solar sources, foresees the co-financing of new 2-10 kW solar photovoltaic microinstallations. It is estimated that 200,000 beneficiaries will take advantage of the subsidies. In 2019, additional renewable energy schemes were launched with resources available from the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management:  Energy Plus (Energia Plus)  with a pool of funds of PLN 4,000,000,000, intended for projects aimed at reducing the negative impact of enterprises on the environment, including for renewable energy development,   a pilot project with a pool of funds of PLN 500,000,000, intended for projects aimed at reducing the adverse effect of heating enterprises on the environment, including for renewable energy development,  Agroenergy (Agroenergia)  with an allocation of PLN 200,000,000, which involves providing comprehensive support for reducing the negative environmental impacts of agricultural activities, including through the development of renewable energy sources,  Polish Geothermal Energy Plus (Polska Geotermia Plus)  with an allocation of PLN 600,000,000 for increasing the use of geothermal resources in Poland. The boosting of the RES support system in 2019 will contribute to achieving the 15% target for the share of energy from renewable sources in 2020. A stable and competitive RES support system will increase the share of renewable energy in the gross final energy consumption, without leading to a considerable increase in prices or serious disturbances in the operation of energy markets. The stabilisation of legal regulations and the consistent implementation of the long-term action plan covering support for individual sectors will contribute to the dynamic growth of new investments. The optimisation of the support system will enable the 2030 target to be achieved through modern, distributed and cost-effective investments, increasing the security and flexibility of the Polish electricity system. Role of particular RES technologies in the energy mix broken down to controllable and non-controllable sources The role of non-controllable RES sources is expected to be as follows: - solar energy (photovoltaics)  an asset of this technology is a positive interdependence between the intensity of insolation and the daily demand for electricity, and increased generation in summer correlated with cooling demand. They are installations with relatively small capacities, but the total installed capacity is bound to have a growing importance for the National Power System. The use of solar energy is an alternative way for utilising brownfield areas and poor-quality land, as well as building roofs. It is of key importance for the current dynamic development of microinstallations12, strengthened by dedicated financial                                                   12 At the end of 2017, approx. 28 800 microinstallations with a total capacity of approx. 183 MW were connected to the six main DSOs. At the end of 2018, these figures almost doubled to 54 200 of microinstallations with a capacity of 343 MW, and after Q3 2019, the number grew to 106,000 with a total capacity  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 67  support schemes. Photovoltaic sources are expected to achieve economic and technical maturity after 2022 in the sense that they will not require operational support past this date. In accordance with the projections to the National Energy and Climate Plan, the capacity achievable in PV installations is expected to increase to approx. 7.3 GW in 2030 and approx. 16 GW in 2040. - offshore wind energy  offshore wind blows at relatively high speeds not encountering any obstacles (low terrain roughness), which makes offshore wind farms more productive than those located on land. To start investing in these capacities, work on strengthening the transmission network in the northern part of the country must be completed, so that power can be evacuated inland. It is expected that the first offshore wind farm will be included in the electricity balance after 2025. The Polish coastline offers opportunities for building further off-shore installations, but the possibility of balancing them in the NPS remains a key issue. It is expected that in the 2040 perspective, these sources will be responsible for the largest amount of electricity generated from RES. In accordance with the National Plan, the capacity achievable by offshore wind farms is expected to increase to approx. 3.8 GW in 2030 and approx. 8 GW in 2040. - onshore wind energy  it is expected that in the medium term the increase in the share of this technology in the energy balance will be less dynamic than in previous years. An important difficulty in using on-shore wind farms is the absence of correlation between their operation and demand for energy and therefore the rate of their development should depend on costs and balancing possibilities. Another problem is the varied level of acceptance for the construction of wind farms by local communities. To reduce potential conflicts, investors might create systems encouraging resident participation in the implementation of projects; In accordance with the projections of the National Plan, the capacity achievable by onshore wind farms is bound to increase to approx. 9.6 GW in 2030, and the volume will be maintained until 2040. - hydropower  owing to the negligible use of available hydropower potential, it is reasonable to enhance the use of run-of-the-river hydropower. In the long-term, the development of hydropower may be stimulated by the development of inland waterways and the regeneration of dams, which are important from the perspective of watercourse regulation and rational water management (flood and drought retention, increased retention). It should be noted that the operation of run-of-the-river plants can be regulated, but to a limited extent. Pumped-storage hydropower plants are not regarded as RES plants, but play a regulating function for the NPS. Bearing in mind the regulating potential of hydropower, it is worth looking for new ways to use it, also on a small scale. With respect to controllable sources, the use of the following technologies is envisaged:  energy from biomass (and waste-derived heat)  this source will be well suited for households and for cogeneration purposes; it has the largest potential for achieving the RES target in heat generation given the availability of fuel and the technical and economic                                             of 684.8 MW.  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 68  parameters of installations. Generation units working on biomass should be located close to where it is produced (rural areas, wood processing industry areas, or areas where municipal waste is produced) and where it is possible to maximise the use of primary energy contained in fuel, thus making it possible to minimise the environmental costs of transport. The use of biomass for energy purposes also contributes to better waste management;  energy from biogas  the use of biogas will be particularly useful in combined electricity and heat generation. One benefit is the possibility of storing energy in biogas, which may be used for regulating purposes. The high investment outlays are the main factor determining the moderate increase in installed capacity of biogas plants. From the point of view of the overall economy, biogas provides extra value added, since it makes utilising particularly noxious waste (e.g. animal waste, landfill gases) possible. Energy products of biogas plants will be increasingly used in the energy sector. Depending on local demand, biogas plants can provide electricity, biomethane, heat or cold using locally available resources for their production. As regards agricultural biogas plants, the raw material potential is rising from year to year as the Polish agricultural sector grows. - geothermal energy  although its use is currently at a relatively low level, an upward trend is expected. Major financial expenditures are required to determine geothermal potential, with the degree of certainty being very small, but the use of this type of energy may be instrumental to the development of certain areas; - heat pumps  their use in households is becoming more and more common, with the estimated potential similar to that of geothermal energy. Electricity is required for them to be used and therefore linking installations with another RES which generates electricity is a good solution; b) Where relevant, specific measures for regional cooperation, as well as, as an option, the estimated excess production of energy from renewable sources which could be transferred to other Member States in order to achieve the national contribution and trajectories referred to in 2.1.2. Responsible authority*: MAP * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. Statistical transfer and the implementation of joint RES projects Legal possibilities are in place in Poland for a statistical transfer to/from other EU Member States and for the implementation of joint energy projects. It is assumed that until 2030 Poland will rely on its own resources to fulfil the set target, taking into account the required levels of cooperation with other states. At the same time, no excess energy production from renewable sources is envisaged which could be transferred to other Member States in order for them to achieve their national contributions. c) Where relevant, specific measures on financial support, including EU support and the use of EU funds, for the promotion of the production and use of energy from renewable sources in the electricity, heating and cooling, and transport sectors. 1. Support for the production of electricity and heat from renewable energy sources and for the production of biofuels The funds allocated to support the production of electricity and heat from renewable sources as part of the Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment 2014-2020 amount to EUR 150 million. The funds allocated as part of Regional Operational Programmes (ROPs) amount to ca. EUR 890 million, which includes ca. EUR 50 million in the form of repayable instruments.  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 69  Responsible/involved parties*: MAP, MFiPR, MK * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. Support for the production of biofuels is possible within the framework of seven ROPs, as part of may be expended until 2023. Financial support for the area in question in the financial perspectives 2021-2027 and 2028-2034 is likely, but its amount and scope cannot be defined at the present stage. The scope of support for renewable energy sources is also envisaged by the National Fund for Environmental Protection as part of national funds. 2. Support for innovative solutions in the production of 2nd generation biocomponents and other renewable fuels An important element of measures relating to the implementation of the new Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (RED II) will be issues concerning the use of biofuels and electricity in the transport sector, whose share in this sector in 2030 should reach 14%. An increase in the commitment concerning the share of energy generated from RES in transport beyond the current commitments (10% in 2020), combined with the restriction on the use of conventional biofuels generated from raw materials for feed production, shows that there is a need for the development and application, to a much greater extent than so far, of new production technologies, which implies the need to construct plants based on new technologies. Otherwise, it will be necessary to purchase considerable quantities of such fuels from abroad. Given the fact that renewable fuels used in transport are more expensive than conventional (mineral) fuels, and the demand for them stems from law (a high regulatory risk), such innovations pose a high risk. Additionally, in the case of innovative technologies high investment costs must be incurred, which considerably reduces the cost-effectiveness of production. This is why supporting this sector is reasonable. Proposed form of support: grants, subsidies, repayable instruments.   3. Development of distributed energy generation Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (RED II) and the Market Directive introduce new obligations to increase the share of renewable energy: REC (Renewable Energy Communities) and EC (Energy Communities), which additionally emphasises the importance of energy sustainable areas, in particular energy clusters and energy cooperatives. Ultimately, the supply/demand balancing certainty in clusters should be high enough for the energy needs of those areas not to be included in the power reserve planned by the transmission system operator. Considering the above, registration of measurement data, balancing energy volumes, and settlements by energy cooperatives and their members, as well as access to measurement data will be governed in detail by legislation. Support for the development of distributed energy generation in energy clusters and energy cooperatives is particularly important from the point of view of the construction of generation sources, networks and control systems. It is estimated that ca. 300 energy sustainable areas will operate at the local level in Poland in 2030. This task has been included in the Strategy for Responsible Development as one of the priorities in the energy area, and also in the draft Energy Policy of Poland until 2040. Proposed form of financing: grants, repayable aid, guarantee funds.  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 70  What is more, legislation will be amended to improve the development of energy using solar radiation in post-mining areas requiring reclamation, degraded, or mine dumps. 4. Development of stabilising technologies (production and storage) non-controllable RES Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (RED II) introduces new obligations to increase the renewable energy share. The development of storage technologies is a precondition for growth of RES and changes in the energy market. An excessively high number of intermittent renewable energy sources endangers the security of the NPS and drives prices up. Support for stable RES or other stabilising measures useful in balancing non-controllable RES will be important. Proposed form of financing: grants, repayable aid, guarantee funds.   5. Development of installations for generating heat from RES The new Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (RED II) introduces new obligations to increase the share of renewable energy in the heat generation sector. Owing to its local nature, heat generation will require funds to be invested at the local government level, which implies the need for the financing of the development of RES mainly by municipal utility companies, whose financial condition does not always guarantee the availability of surplus funds for investment purposes. Proposed form of financing: grants, repayable instruments, guarantee funds. 6. Development of off-shore energy generation The development of off-shore energy generation is one of the areas of activities that are to guarantee the energy security of the country (satisfaction of the increasing electricity demand) and a contributor to the targeted share of RES in the gross final energy consumption in 2030. Support relating to the development of the off-shore energy generation sector is envisaged. Support in this area will also contribute to building regional cooperation in the Baltic Sea region. d) Specific measures to introduce one or more contact points, streamline administrative procedures, provide information and training, and facilitate the uptake of power purchase agreements. Responsible/involved parties*: MAP, URE * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. 1. Obtaining the confirmation of qualifications/competences of persons operating in the commercial market Regarding the issue of granting official authorisations to installers of renewable energy sources (only biomass-fired boilers, photovoltaic systems, solar heating systems, heat pumps, shallow geothermal systems), the minister competent for energy has issued a regulation to enable persons operating on the commercial market to confirm their qualifications/competence. The provisions of the regulation ensure standardised assembly of microinstallations, small installations or renewable energy installations with an aggregate installed thermal capacity not exceeding 600 kW and the impartial and independent conduct of procedure for accrediting entities providing training and certification for installers of a given type of installations. They also ensure that certification procedures are properly documented and registered, and that documentation concerning the certification procedure is kept. The Office of Technical Inspection is the implementing authority responsible for enforcing the regulation.  2. Enhancing services provided to electricity producers to be covered by the auction-based renewable energy support system  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 71  The solutions adopted by the Energy Regulatory Office guarantee the provision of efficient and modern services to electricity producers to be covered by the auction-based renewable energy support system  from the pre-qualification process and auctioning itself to post-auction support relating to the fulfilment of reporting obligations. Solutions enabling the process to be handled in a swift and intuitive manner with the use of the dedicated IT tools need to be maintained and developed. Streamlining the achievement of the RES target in the electricity generation sector through effective services provided to entities applying for support will speed up investments and construction processes. (e) Assessment of the necessity to build new infrastructure for RES-based district heating and cooling. Responsible/involved parties*: MAP, URE * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. The changing business environment and technological development constitute major challenges for the heating sector. Important issues to be regulated in the near future include: changing the heat market model and tariff policy, developing smart network infrastructure, regulating the rules on the purchase of RES heat, fostering the use of district cooling, etc. The draft Energy Policy of Poland until 2040 envisages the development of district heating as one of the strategic directions. Having regard to the above, measures will be taken to ensure conditions for the development of environment-friendly and efficient heating systems by providing financial, organisational and legal support, including by: - development of cogeneration; - increasing the use of RES and waste in district heating; - conversion of power plants into heat and power plants; - modernising and expanding heating systems and developing technologies for the production of cooling from district heat; - promoting heat storage facilities and smart networks. A measure connected with the measure specified in 3.2.d in this respect.  f) Where applicable, specific measures on the promotion of the use of energy from biomass, especially for new biomass mobilisation taking into account: - availability of biomass, including sustainable biomass  both domestic potential and imports from third countries; - other biomass uses by other sectors (agriculture and forest-based sectors); as well as measures for the sustainability of biomass production and use. Responsible/involved parties*: MRiRW, MAP * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. With respect to the promotion of the use of energy from biomass, especially new biomass mobilisation, Polish agriculture has considerable resources of biomass and agriculture and agri-food processing by-products which should be used for energy purposes (biogas production). The development of new technologies should take into account the needs of individual sectors, both as regards the supply of energy and the utilisation of the types of biomass produced as a by-product of the agri-food sector. The method of utilising this type of biomass should contribute to the sustainable development of agriculture (preserving soil fertility  humus level, water resources management etc.). Changes in agricultural production constitute a long-term process and the introduction of new plant species takes time and requires the production profile to be changed. Often, this also involves the need to replaced the entire machinery stock. Therefore, the proposed amendments to legal regulations supporting the use of agricultural biomass for energy purposes will allow for an appropriate adaptation period.  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 72  3.1.3. Other elements of the dimension a) Where applicable, national policies and measures affecting the EU ETS sector and assessment of the complementarity and impacts on the EU ETS. Responsible/involved parties*: MK, KOBiZE, MAP, MR * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. Participation in the Emissions Trading Scheme  general information. The Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) is a market-type system, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Entities covered by the Scheme account for the quantity of released greenhouse gases by balancing them with emission allowances. Installations eligible for the Scheme are those belonging to specific sectors or meeting the defined threshold conditions set out in Directive 2003/87/EC. The number of installations covered by the Scheme changes from one year to another (ca. 800 installations in Poland). The EU ETS itself by definition does not set national reduction targets, but deploys additional mechanisms that force Member States to reduce emissions at country level. The phasing out of emission allowances (MSR Decision) available at auctions or reduction in the number of free allowances allocated to eligible installations, combined with the rising costs of allowances, forces the units that participate in the Scheme to take measures to reduce emissions. Therefore, it is necessary to undertake modernisation activities in the ETS sectors, especially in the electricity and heating sectors. The introduction of the following, from 2021, within the framework of the EU ETS: - The Modernisation Fund, - The Innovation Fund. At present, work is under way to define, at the national level, in the best possible way, the areas and methods for using innovation support mechanisms provided for in the EU ETS Directive. The framework for the use of revenues derived from the auctioning of CO2 emission allowances in the pool allocated to Poland is described in section 3.1.1(c). It is worth highlighting that pursuant to the EU ETS Directive measures to decarbonise the economy should be partly financed or co-financed with funds originating from emission allowance auctions (at least 50% of revenues from the sale of allowances by auction should be used for at least one of the environmental objectives specified in the EU ETS Directive).   b) Policies and measures to achieve other national targets, where applicable. Responsible/involved parties*:  * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. 1. Actions to adapt the water management sector to climate change - Developing and implementing flood risk assessment methods for urban areas, with particular emphasis on flash flooding. - Improving the resistance of the flood risk management system to the effects of climate change, including by ensuring critical infrastructure. - Enhancing retention capacities and restoring aquatic habitats in watercourses (where this is not contrary to other important public objectives). - Restoring and maintaining the good status of water, water ecosystems and water-dependent ecosystems, including actions stemming from river basin management plans and updates thereof. 2. Measures to adapt the energy sector to climate change - Preparing the energy system for changed conditions, having regard to winter and summer peak energy demand periods.  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 73  - Ensuring reserve energy and transmission sources where the use of primary sources is not possible. - Securing reserve cooling sources in commercial power plants. - Designing transmission and distribution networks, including underground and on-ground ones, having regard to extreme weather circumstances, in order to limit the risk, inter alia, of snow and ice accumulation on them, flooding or damage caused by strong wind. - Supporting distributed RES development, with a focus on microinstallations in agriculture.   3. Measures to protect biodiversity and forest management in the context of climate change - Preparing nature preservation strategies or plans, or plans of nature preservation tasks having regard to changing climate conditions. - Developing programmes aimed at adapting the forest sector to climate change having regard to the conditions and needs of the industry, energy, agriculture and tourism and recreation sectors, regional development and biodiversity. - Increasing woodland area through artificial afforestation and natural succession, and rationalising the use of land and reducing forest complex fragmentation. - Introducing ecosystem-based forestry principles to the economy, ensuring the dynamic protection of existing biodiversity, using both natural genetic processes (adaptation) and human activities aimed at preserving the existing biodiversity, focusing artificial selection also on adaptive traits enabling adaptation to changing climate conditions. - Continuing the implementation of and developing instruments for the protection of agricultural space, forest and high-productivity soil resources. - Diversifying forest stand, in particular during the change of its structure, in terms of: density, species composition (increasing the share of deciduous species), height and age structure and patch/mosaic structure. - Continuing the soil erosion protection programme, continuing and extending the programme for small-scale water retention and soil retention, particularly for forests and grassland. - Monitoring, controlling and counteracting the spread of alien species that endanger native species or natural habitats. - Monitoring forests in terms of tree response to climate change, among others, by phenological observations, changes in species range zones, especially in mountain areas. - Monitoring, in association with the natural dynamics of ecosystems, and conducting periodic assessment of natural areas under protection, and creating a data collection and processing system. - Enhancing forest fire protection by developing systems of monitoring fire risks and fire prevention infrastructure relating to the protection of forests.   4. Measures to adapt rural areas to climate change - Developing monitoring systems and systems of early warning against possible effects of climate change for plant and livestock production. - Providing investment support for farms along with training and technology advisory services, taking into account issues concerning the adaptation of agricultural production to an  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 74  increased climate risk and climate change prevention. - Improving the system of building up and managing food, seeds, and feed reserves in case of poor harvest. - Promotion of farming systems optimising the demand for water as well as fertilisers and plant protection products, including crops under cover. - Growing plants resistant to water shortages and with a lower demand for nitrogen fertilisers. Rural areas, due to agricultural and forestry activities conducted in them, are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Adaptive measures must be undertaken both in the area of the protection of people in crisis situations along with necessary adaptive measures in agricultural and fishery production and forestry. Local risk monitoring and warning systems are anticipated to be established by 2030 and agricultural and fishing activities are expected to be adapted to climate change in organisational and technical terms within the same timeframe. 5. Measures to develop transport in the conditions of climate change - Considering changed climate conditions in the process of designing and constructing transport infrastructure. - Establishing a permanent monitoring system or adapting the existing monitoring systems to the need to control construction and transport infrastructure elements vulnerable to climate change and establishing or adapting warning systems used by technical services. - Reviewing or creating measures and plans designed to maintain smooth traffic flow in transit routes or to change routes and apply substitute means of transport. Most elements of the transport system, especially infrastructure, are directly exposed to climate factors and operate in direct contact with atmospheric factors. The vulnerability of transport infrastructure to climate factors needs to be properly assessed in order to undertake effective adaptive and preventive measures, to be developed as a result of an analysis of climate and weather data and the impact of these factors on the condition of infrastructure. Design standards are expected to be developed and a transport route management system is expected to be implemented by 2030 having regard to climate change.   6. Measures to ensure sustainable regional and local development having regard to climate change - Preparing a risk management strategy at the national, regional and local levels taking into account adaptive measures. - Implementing the local systems of monitoring and warning against, and responding to, extraordinary climate phenomena (e.g. absence of blockages in sewer systems and underground structure drainage systems, situations contributing to an increase in air or water pollution), in cities. - Preventing and reducing the effects of disasters and enhancing the effectiveness of response. - Considering the blue-green infrastructure concept and the system of aeration corridors (wedges) in zoning plans, and specifying permissible heat sources for heating buildings to increase the resilience and improve the operation of ecosystems. Revitalising natural    III.

Replacing water-tight land surfaces with permeable surfaces. In the light of a number of measures relating directly or indirectly to adaptation, as specified in various strategic documents, appropriate monitoring, warning and response systems are needed in the context of regional and local development. At the same time, the vulnerability of cities to climate change is particularly important, and thus they should be given special significance and priority in the adaptation process. A system for monitoring the state of the environment is planned to be implemented by 2030, along with an early warning and response system for cities and rural areas in the context of climate change. At the same time, work on urban spatial policy will be conduced, having regard to climate change aspects. 7. Measures to stimulate innovations helpful in adaptation to climate change. Promoting innovative solutions in the area of adaptation to climate change. - Analysing the potential of the Polish economy to generate and implement innovative adaptation technologies. - Consolidating/creating new financing sources for innovative adaptation technologies, including research and implementation projects. - Creating an online platform providing information on Polish adaptation technologies. Work aimed at developing new, innovative organisational and technical solutions that support adaptation needs to be undertaken. The primary objective is to stimulate innovative technologies and to introduce mechanisms enabling cooperation among institutions in situations of complex hazards relating to climate change. The existing sources of funding research on adaptation technologies also need to be adjusted and new ones need to be created, and the results of work must be published.   8. Measures to encourage social attitudes facilitating adaptation to climate change - Educating people and enhancing their awareness of climate change and methods of minimising its effects, the impact of invasive alien species and the importance of the need to save resources. - Extending programmes for upgrading qualifications for medical professionals by topics relating to climate-dependent and tropical diseases and vector-borne diseases. - Organising training programmes on climate change and methods for preventing and mitigating its impact on people living in areas under threat of floods, landslides and strong winds. - Organising training programmes for farmers concerning climate change and methods for preventing and limiting its impact. - Involving local communities and local government administration authorities in activities preventing the impact of climate change. - Developing comprehensive solutions concerning State Aid granted to cover losses in case of natural disasters and insurance systems covering risks caused by climate change. Effective adaptation to climate change cannot be achieved without raising the awareness of  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 76  hazards and challenges among institutions involved in the adaptation process and people to an appropriate level. In view of the above, educational measures must be implemented, both as part of formal education systems and broadly understood extra-formal education, helping to raise the social awareness of risks related to extreme phenomena and methods for limiting their impact. The primary objectives will also include enhancing the understanding of the impact of climate processes on social and economic life and ensuring appropriate protection to particularly vulnerable groups from the effects of adverse climate phenomena. 9. Mitigation of climate change, adaptation to it and prevention of natural disaster risks by: - Creating a generally available online Base of knowledge about climate change and adaptation to its effect in the context of improving the resilience of the economy, environment and society to climate change, and preventing and minimising the effects of extraordinary hazards; - Developing adaptation plans in cities with population exceeding 100,000; - Developing and implementing plans for counteracting the effects of draught; - Reviewing and updating flood risk management plans; - Implementation of the Water Shortage Prevention Programme for 2021-2027 with an outlook for 2030, - Review and update of the preliminary flood risk assessment and review and update of flood hazards maps and flood risks maps, - Review and update and implementation of river basin management plans, - Developing flood prevention infrastructure on the basis of high-efficiency and highly viable investments and appropriate spatial planning methods, including by constructing multi-function, functionally coherent small- and, in special cases, large-scale retention reservoirs as part of implementing flood-prevention projects; - Protection against sea erosion and coastal flooding by carrying out protective measures on the sea shore and in the coastal zone (e.g. beach nourishment, storm banks, seawalls and groynes, breakwater structures, underwater barriers), along with monitoring the sea coast, including immediate coastal area; - Managing precipitation water in urbanised areas by using various retention forms and developing greenery infrastructure, - Implementing the strategic project Adaptation to Climate Change. Adaptive measures will consist in developing and implementing strategic/planning documents concerning water resource management, supporting the development and implementation of climate change adaptation plans for urbanised areas, constructing necessary flood prevention infrastructure and small-scale retention structures and implementing projects aimed at protecting the coastline. These measures will also be aimed at managing precipitation water in urbanised areas through various retention forms and the development of greenery infrastructure, the development of blue-green infrastructure in urbanised areas, the limitation of land occupation and soil sealing.     c) Policies and measures to achieve low-emission 1. Development of energy efficient low-carbon transport  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 77  mobility (including transport electrification) Responsible/involved parties*:  * subject to potential changes resulting from amendments to the Act on government administration departments. In addition to electromobility and the use of alternative fuels in transport, an improvement in the energy efficiency of transport and emission reduction has been planned. The Sustainable Transport Development Strategy 2030 sets out a number of actions dedicated to reducing the negative impact of transport on the environment, which can be grouped into the following lines of intervention:  organisational and system intervention, inter alia: - support for solutions leading to reducing the transport-intensity of the economy; - promoting energy efficiency through the development of inter-modal freight transport, promotion of energy efficient means of transport resulting in, among other things, reducing the dependence of the transport sector on fuels derived from non-renewable energy sources, developing systems supporting logistical optimisation, including fuller use of freight and passenger spaces of means of transport; - support for environment-friendly transport (railway transport, sea transport and inland waterway transport) and efforts to create conditions for a road-to-rail shift and for inland waterway transport, in particular at distances of more than 300 km, promotion of clean means of transport powered by alternative energy sources, resulting, inter alia, in reduced emissions; - reducing congestion, in particular in urban areas by: increasing the share of public passenger transport, designating lanes reserved for public transport, integrating public transport in cities and urban agglomeration areas with the construction of P&R and R&D parking systems, optimisation and integration of urban and agglomeration transport and regional passenger transport systems, promoting pedestrian traffic and cycling, organisation and development of delivery systems within settlement units (urban logistics) and elimination of heavy freight traffic and mass transport of hazardous substances across urbanised areas, inter alia by using environmentally friendly inland waterway transport, working towards even distribution of urban traffic to reduce rush hours, handling transport by relying on various modes, especially those less harmful to the environment, such as rail and water transportation; - promoting new forms of mobility through: access to travel information, integrated tariffs, delimitation of limited traffic zones in residential areas and city centres, educational and information activities aimed at promoting sustainable and public transport, transport demand management; - Delimitation of low-emission zones (LEZ), with access and parking restrictions for combustion vehicles, especially in city centres; - development of the system of fees and tariffs stimulating desirable transport trends, e.g. with regard to the limitation of pressure on the environment;  investment-related intervention: - modernisation and expansion of linear and nodal transport infrastructure to improve the efficiency of the transport system in line with the EU and national environmental standards and requirements; - modernisation of the rolling stock and vehicle fleet (vehicles and other necessary devices and accessories) across the transport modes to align them, at least, to the EU and domestic environmental standards and requirements, as well as to improve their energy efficiency;      III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 78  - implementation of innovative transport management systems for individual modes and interoperative systems contributing to the optimisation of vehicle traffic and thus to a reduction in transport generated emissions;  innovative and technical interventions, including: - application of new technologies, procedures and systems improving the energy efficiency of transport and contributing to a reduction in pollution emissions to the environment  modernisation and provision of the internal interoperability of telematic systems supporting particular transport modes, such as: ITS (road transport), ERTMS, SDIP, CBRK (railway transport), SESAR (air transport), VTMS (maritime transport), RIS (inland waterway); - more common use of environment-friendly means of transport: low-carbon and energy-efficient cars and municipal vehicles (e.g. using fuel cells and hydrogen, or the following drives: electric, gas, hybrid, compressed air)  along with the establishment, especially in agglomerations and densely populated areas and along the TEN-T core network corridors, of a network of battery recharging or replacement points and natural gas or hydrogen refuelling stations, if cost-effective; environment-friendly low-noise and low-carbon rolling stock and airplanes, maritime vessels fuelled by compressed or liquid natural gas, new generation inland waterway vessels (including energy-efficient and low-carbon inland waterway container vessels ), use of second and third generation fuels and biofuels based on biocomponents. 2. Construction and putting in service of inland vessels using alternative fuels A high proportion of inland waterway fleet on Polish rivers is powered by very obsolete engines, which often do not meet the ambitious combustion and emission standards specified for newer types of vessels. New, well defined financial incentives must appear in the Polish market in order to introduce new solutions based on alternative fuels in place of imported old and long-serving vessels. Proposed measures: - developing systemic legislative solutions to streamline the process of building and placing craft in service, including financial incentives, - economic, business and social analyses for water transport, including supply and demand research, - cooperation in the preparation of prototype barges and pusher vessels by research and development units, - institutional support for the preparation of accompanying infrastructure (wharf equipment; recharging and refuelling stations), - cooperation in the preparation of accompanying technologies for the use of barges by research and development units (e.g. methods of disposing of material excavated from places of rockfill accumulation in rivers  in the case of dredgers etc.), - institutional support for vessels manufactured in Poland.   3. Development of alternative fuel infrastructure, enhancement of operation security, development of electromobility industry and improvement of the quality of the air and comfort of living      III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 79    The market of electric vehicles in Poland is at the stage of formation. The regulatory basis for this changes is provided by the Act on electromobility and alternative fuels of 11 January 2018, which provides for the construction of basic infrastructure for alternative fuels in urban agglomerations, in densely populated areas and along roads forming part of trans-European transport corridors. The Act implements the European Directive on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure into Polish law. The expansion of the core network will enable the free movement of vehicles using alternative fuels  without the need to be concerned that recharging them will not be possible. The Electromobility Act also provides for the removal of the excise duty on electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV), the exemption of such vehicles form parking fees as well as greater possibilities for depreciation charges for companies than in the case of combustion vehicles. In addition to financial benefits, the act envisages a package of solutions useful for drivers in their everyday lives. It is planned that the core network will comprise 6,000 normal recharging points and 400 high power recharging points and 70 CNG refuelling points in 32 urban agglomerations and densely populated areas by 2020. Pilot programmes aimed at intensifying measures in the area of the construction of infrastructure and the development of electromobility industry will be implemented. Conditions and tools will be defined the implementation of which will make it possible to commence the strengthening of the Polish electromobility industry. Regulatory conditions for the development of electromobility were created in the period 2017-2019. It is envisaged that the prototypes of vehicles adapted to the needs of the Polish and European markets will be created and the production of short series of electric vehicles will be launched in the period 2020-2030. In subsequent years, other measures will be proposed, such as further tools aimed at integrating electric vehicles with the network, and instruments for the development of the charging infrastructure will be indicated, which will accelerate the process of constructing it. It is expected that the aforementioned measures will contribute to changes in social awareness, which will lead to electromobility being seen as a necessary response to the challenges of the changing reality. Growing popularity of electric vehicles in households and public transport will drive the demand for green transport. The newly constructed recharging infrastructure will be an additional factor. The network will be fully prepared to provide power to 1 million electric vehicles and will be adapted to the use of vehicles as the electricity system stabilisers. The public administration will use electric vehicles in its fleet. Polish industry will produce subassemblies for electric vehicles, vehicles themselves and instrumentation and infrastructure necessary for the development of electromobility. The task of the Low-Emission Transport Fund is to support the expansion of alternative fuels infrastructure and to build up a market for those fuels. Over the next 10 years, the Fund will have financial means of ca. PLN 6.7 billion. The following areas will be financed from the Fund in the period 2018-2027: (1) supporting investments related to the production of biocomponents, liquid biofuels, and other renewable fuels; (2) supporting the construction or development of infrastructure for the distribution or sale of compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG), including that derived from biomethane, or for the distribution and sale of hydrogen, or the construction or development    III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 80  of infrastructure for recharging electrical vehicles, used in transport; (3) assistance for manufacturers or producers of biocomponents, liquid fuels, liquid biofuels, other renewable fuels, compressed natural gas (CNG), or liquefied natural gas (LNG), including that derived from biomethane, used in transport; (4) supporting: a) producers of vehicles powered by electricity, compressed natural gas (CNG), or liquefied natural gas (LNG), including that derived from biomethane, or by hydrogen, b) Entrepreneurs within the meaning of the Business Enterprise Law of 6 March 2018 (Journal of Laws, item 646) conducting activities in the field of production of subassemblies for the vehicles referred to in (a); (5) supporting public transport based on liquid biofuels, other renewable fuels, compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG), including from biomethane, hydrogen or electricity, especially in urban agglomerations, health resorts and nature conservation areas delimited pursuant to nature protection laws; (6) subsidising port fees charged for the mooring of vessels propelled by compressed natural gas (CNG), or liquefied natural gas (LNG), including that derived from biomethane, or by hydrogen, or powered by electricity; (7) supporting: a) research aimed at developing new types of biocomponents, liquid biofuels, other renewable fuels, or the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG), including that derived from biomethane, or hydrogen, or electricity, used in transport, or at developing new design-related solutions in this area, b) operational implementations of the outcomes produced by the research referred to in point (a); (8) supporting educational programmes intended to promote the use of liquid biofuels or other renewable fuels, compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG), including that derived from biomethane, or hydrogen, or electricity, used in transport; (9) supporting the purchase of new vehicles and vessels powered by liquid biofuels, compressed natural gas (CNG), or liquefied natural gas (LNG), including that derived from biomethane, or by hydrogen, or powered by electricity; (10) supporting analyses and research of the market for biocomponents, liquid fuels, liquid biofuels or other renewable fuels, or the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG), including that derived from biomethane, or hydrogen, or electricity, used in transport; (11) promoting the production and use of biocomponents and liquid biofuels; (12) and performance of other tasks specified in specific legislation. The development of draft documents involves the need to eliminate legislative barriers, to create a market framework (e.g. to define the vehicle charging service) and to develop alternative fuel infrastructure. In connection with the introduction of new legislation dedicated to electromobility, actions are planned to stimulate the implementation of the following directional goals at the national level: - for 2025:  III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 81   there will be 1 million electric vehicles on roads in the segment of electricity-powered vehicles;  there will be 54,000 vehicles on roads in the segment of vehicles fuelled by CNG, and 32 refuelling points will be available along the core TEN-T corridors;  there will be 3,000 LNG-fuelled vehicles, and 14 LNG refuelling points along the core TEN-T roads;   - there will be 3,000 electric buses in the public transport segment at the national level in 2030. The above benefits and related instruments aimed at influencing the market will contribute both to the security of operation and to the development of the electromobility industry, as well as to the improvement of the quality of the air and the comfort of life. 4. Zero-Emission Public Transport Programme Public transport is an important segment of the development of transport using alternative fuels. At present, a growing number of local governments and bus transport companies in Poland add electric buses to their fleets or plan to do so in the near future. Electric buses are still a small part of municipal transport fleet in Poland. Public transport is a transport segment that may be used as a testing ground for a new technology and may be an element contributing to the development of electricity-based transport. Public transport is also an element of the strategy of switching the economy to alternative fuels, with fleet replacement projects constituting a perfect area for the development of new technologies and, consequently, of the entire economy. Local governments, when deciding to purchase electric buses, are guided mainly by the need to improve the quality of the air, the intention to reduce the noise level or the need to systematically raise the standards of passenger transport. The partial replacement of fleet with electric vehicles reflects commitment to modernisation, thus attracting investors and tourists. These objectives are consistent with the government Electromobility Development Plan for Poland, as well as with the EU Clean Mobility Package of 2017. Among the main barriers to transport electrification, the higher costs of purchase of electric vehicles should be mentioned, along with the lack of access to rapid charging infrastructure and the lengthy investment process. None of these barriers may be overcome without the commitment of public funds. Therefore, the Government is planning to provide financial support for investments aimed at expanding electric bus charging infrastructure, to be carried out by entities providing mass transport services. Support for zero- and low-carbon public transport is one of the priorities of the Polish Government listed in the Strategy for Responsible Development. This segment requires support in the form of public funding not only in the area of the construction of infrastructure for public transport, but also in the area of fleet replacement. The reduction of the emissions of pollutants and CO2 in the public transport sector is linked to its development and, consequently, to at least partial departure from individual motor transport in urbanised areas. It may significantly contribute to the improvement of the air quality in Poland, the reduction of emissions, the achievement of climate targets and the protection of health and the natural      III. Policies and measures - Dimension Decarbonisation 82  environment. At the same time, there is a need for financial support for local governments in the field of public transport fleet replacement, which may be carried out only by co-financing the purchase of zero- and low-carbon vehicles, enabling not only the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of both means of transport to be brought to the same level, but primarily the difference in the purchase price, which is often decisive in the provision of public transport services, to be compensated for. The financing of the purchase of low-carbon buses and the construction of charging/refuelling infrastructure for these types of vehicles will be provided from, among others, the Low-Emission Transport Fund (LETF). The Act of 11 January 2018 on electromobility and alternative fuels includes a number of obligations and recommendations for local governments, which in many cases may be fulfilled with the use of methane fuel-based transport services. Among more important provisions in this respect is the provision stipulating that local government units in areas with more than 50,000 residents must procure, from 1 January 2025, the performance of public tasks from companies with at least a 30% share of electric vehicles or natural gas-fueled vehicles in the fleet in use. It is estimated that there will be 3,000 electric buses in the public transport segment at the national level in 2030.   5. Supporting public transport systems in cities with EU Cohesion Policy funds Public transport systems in cities are also supported by EU Cohesion Policy funds under Operational Programmes for 2014-2020 (Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment, Operational Programme Eastern Poland, Regional Operational Programmes), e.g. the Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment allocates approx. EUR 2.3 billion worth of subsidies for the construction and modernisation of infrastructure, and the purchase and modernisation of low-emission rolling stock and fleets in the 13 provincial capitals that implement Integrated Territorial Investment Strategies, as well as for competition-based projects related to electric rolling stock, also in medium-sized cities that are losing their socio-economic functions. Financial support for the area in question in the financial perspective 2021-2027 is likely, but its amount and scope cannot be defined at the present stage. d) Where applicable, national policies, timelines and measures planned to phase out energy subsidies, in particular for fossil fuels In the context of the potential phase-out of subsidies in the energy sector, it is crucial that a balanced approach be used, such as to allow maintaining the competitiveness of the national economy and achieving the development goals. The subsidy phase-out process should be supported by flexible transitional measures enabling enterprises to adapt to the new way of production funding, and by preparing mechanisms helping enterprises to modernise production. A list of support measures in the energy sector, including subsidies, is provided in Chapter I.
