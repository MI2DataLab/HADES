Dimension Decarbonisation  GHG emissions and removals i. Trends in current GHG emissions and removals in the EU ETS, effort sharing and LULUCF sectors and different energy sectors 2 eq, excluding net emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). Between 1990 and 2017, GHG emissions decreased by 48.4% (see Figure 20). The main reasons for the decline were the transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy and successful                                                            173 https://www.redshawadvisors.com/european-commission-sees-e40-eu-ets-price-by-2030/ 174 EC_recommendations parameters projections 2019 (15.06.2018) implementation of the associated reforms.    kt CO2 eq  Energy  Industrial processes and product use  Agriculture  Land use, land use change and forestry  Waste 2 eq (Source: GHG emissions inventory 1990-2017, 2019175) The energy sector is indisputably the largest source of GHG emissions in Estonia.

Emissions from industrial processes and product use and waste accounted for 3.06% and 1.57% of total emissions respectively.                                                             175 G emissions inventory 1990-2017: https://www.envir.ee/sites/default/files/content-editors/Kliima/Inventuur/nir_est_1990-2017_150319.pdf   Energy  Industrial processes and product use  Agriculture  Waste Figure 21. GHG emissions by sector in 2017, % (Source: GHG emissions inventory 1990-2017, 2019176) Greenhouse gas trends in the EU ETS The share of emissions of total emissions from the energy sector accounted for by emissions from heat and electricity production covered by the EU ETS was 70.26% in 2017 (see Figure 22). Carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector have varied over time mainly due to economic trends, the structure of energy supply, and climatic conditions. GHG emissions declined from 1990 to 1993 owing to big changes in the structure of the economy which took place after the fall of the Soviet Union and the restoration of ently remained quite stable. In 2003, emissions increased mainly due to the export of electricity produced from oil shale. The significant growth in emissions from 2006 to 2007 is associated with generalised economic growth and the reduction in emissions from 2007 to 2009 is associated with a generalised economic recession. Since 2009, GHG emissions have been closely linked to the volume of exported electricity, which is mainly produced from                                                            176 -2017: https://www.envir.ee/sites/default/files/content-editors/Kliima/Inventuur/nir_est_1990-2017_150319.pdf oil shale.    kt CO2 eq Figure 22. 2 eq. (Source: Ministry of the Environment, 2019) Trends in greenhouse gases in sectors covered by the Shared Effort Regulation The sector with the biggest greenhouse gas emissions outside the EU ETS in 2017 was the transport sector. In 2017, the transport sector accounted for 13.2% of the energy sector and 11.7% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Compared to 1990, emissions from the transport sector have decreased by 1.4%. In comparison to 1990, emissions from the manufacturing and building sector falling within the energy sector have decreased by 74.8%. 2 eq, 48.93% lower than in 1990. Total emissions from the waste sector have been declining in recent years. In comparison to the reference year (1990), GHG emissions were 11.15% lower in 2017. Trends in GHG in the LULUCF sector Being the only potential GHG emissions sink in Estonia, the LULUCF sector plays an important role in the national carbon cycle. In 2017, the LULUCF sector removed a total of 1792.74 kt CO2 eq. Carbon removal in 2017 was 20.36% greater than in the reference year (1990). The main factors influencing removal in the LULUCF sector were primarily logging volumes, the expansion of populated areas, timber products and emissions from peat soils. Over the last decade, LULUCF sector emissions have varied considerably due to fluctuating logging intensity and deforestation caused by changes in the socio-economic situation in woodland, with a total surface area of 2.44 million ha. In 2017, the carbon stock of Estonian forests increased by 1,934.3 kt CO2 eq. or the increase in wooden biomass exceeded GHG emissions from logging, the decay of dead wood, soil respiration, drainage of peatland soils, and fires. ii. Projections of sectoral developments with existing national and Union policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) Projections for GHG emissions under a scenario with existing measures (i.e. projections take account, directly or indirectly, of the impact of applied and/or accepted measures) are given below. The projections for industrial processes and use of products, for agriculture, for waste and for the LULUCF sector are the same as submitted to the European Commission in March 2019. By virtue of the changes in the energy sector, projections for the energy sector were updated in the middle of 2019, resulting in changes to all GHG emissions. Projections for GHG emissions have been calculated for the period from 2016 to 2040; the reference year (base year) was 2016 (see Figure 23).

Projections for GHGs in the energy sector The energy sector covers GHG emissions from the consumption and production of fuels and energy (electricity and heat). The main components of this sector are the energy industry, manufacturing and construction, transport, other sectors (incl. the commercial and public, housing, agricultural, forestry, fishery and fish farming sub-sectors) and diffuse emissions from the natural gas distribution system. Figure 24 shows projected GHG emissions from the energy sector in the case of a scenario with existing measures, broken down by sub-sector. According to the projections, by 2040, emissions will be 54.7% less than in 2016. The biggest reduction will take place in the energy industry. According to the projections, by 2040, GHG emissions from the energy industry will be 60.7% less than in 2016 after gradual cessation of the direct combustion of oil shale, construction of the more efficient Auvere power plant and the commissioning of new oil shale production plants. It is projected that by 2040, GHG emissions from manufacturing and construction will be 30.3% greater than in 2016.   kt CO2 eq  Diffuse emissions  Other sources  Other sectors*  Manufacturing industries and construction  Energy industries Figure 24 Projected GHG emissions from the energy sector, broken down by sub-sector (excluding transport), in kt CO2 eq * Other sectors  fuels consumed in the commercial/public sector, households and agriculture/forestry/fisheries Projections for GHGs in the transport sector The majority of GHG emissions from the transport sector come from road transport. Historically, the share of GHG emissions represented by road transport has been over 95% of total GHG emissions from transport. By 2040, it is assumed that total GHG emissions from the transport sector will have increased under a scenario with existing measures by approximately 8.2% in comparison to 2016. An increase in road transport is projected. According to estimates, emissions from domestic aviation and railway transport will remain stable from 2016 to 2040. Emissions from domestic shipping are projected to decline because of lower fuel consumption.

The reason for this is Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 and Directive No 2006/40/EC. Figure 26 shows projected GHG emissions from industrial processes and product use, broken down by sub-category. Some of the smaller producers in the mineral materials industry who sell their products to the European Union plan to increase their production capacity, but this will not significantly impact projections of total emissions from the industrial processes and product use sector. All plants already use the best available techniques (BAT) in accordance with BAT reference documents, hence reduction of GHG emissions owing to the deployment of newer technologies is not envisaged. According to the projections, emissions from the use of fuels and solvents for non-energy purposes will increase by 17% from 2021 to 2040. Consumption of these products depends a lot on the economic situation of small manufacturers and the use of solvents depends considerably on the size of the population.

Projections for GHGs from the agricultural sector According to projections, total GHG emissions from the agricultural sector will grow steadily and reach 1625 kt CO2 eq by 2040, an increase of 22% above the 2016 level (see Figure 27). The trend of growth in GHG emissions from the agricultural sector stems from an increase in the number of animals and increasing dairy production from dairy cattle in the enteric fermentation, manure management and arable land sub-sectors. The reason for an increase in emissions from agricultural land is a projected increase in use of the synthetic and lime fertilisers.   kt CO2 eq  Application of urea  Liming  Agricultural areas  Manure management  Enteric fermentation Figure 27. Projected GHG emissions from the agricultural sector, broken down by sub-sector, kt CO2 eq GHG projections in the waste sector According to projections, by 2040, emissions in CO2 equivalents will be 40% lower than in 2016 (see Figure 28). The reduction in emissions is mainly related to an increase in the reuse and recycling of waste, a decrease in the volume of landfilled biodegradable waste and waste incineration at the Iru cogeneration station, as emissions mainly stem from landfilling solid waste. The increase in GHG emissions from the biological treatment of solid waste is related to a decrease in the total volume of landfilled biodegradable waste. The reduction of emissions from wastewater treatment is linked to expansion of the sewerage network.   kt CO2 eq  Other (incineration of biogas in flame)*   Waste water treatment  Incineration and open burning of waste*  Biological treatment of solid waste  Solid waste disposal Figure 28 Projected GHG emissions from the waste sector, broken down by sub-sector, in kt CO2 eq. * Amounts of burnt biogas have not been added either to the 2019 greenhouse gas inventory or to greenhouse gas projections stemming from the comments made during the 2018 shared effort obligation decision audit (so-called ESD audit) as regards this sector Projections of GHGs in the LULUCF sector The forested surface area is currently expanding, but for these greenhouse gas projections the Forest Reference Level (FRL) is derived from calculation rules, according to which the forested surface area remains constant. The area of arable land decreased from 1990 until 2004, the year Estonia joined the EU and agricultural support began to be provided. No further growth in the area of arable land area is forecast. Grassland area should still decrease in the near future, mainly due to natural afforestation. The surface area covered by infrastructure and buildings is constantly expanding to the detriment of other land use classes. The National Forestry Development Plan forecasts further growth of regeneration felling, cleaning and thinning. The management method described will bring about a temporary decline in carbon removal. According to projections, the LULUCF sector will remain a carbon sink until 2030, after which the sector is expected to produce emissions. The main reason for this is emissions from arable land and a reduction in the amount of carbon stored in forests, as replacement of older forests with newer ones will lead to a reduction in forest stock. In the near future, the forest stock will reach its peak and then start to decline, hence a reduction in carbon removal is expected.   kt CO2 eq  Other*  Harvested wood products  Other land  Built-up areas  Wetlands  Grassland  Arable land  Wooded area Figure 29.

Renewables i. Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in each of these sectors. State of play According to the Eurostat SHARES model, the share of gross energy consumption accounted for by renewables was 29.29% in 2017, including 17.33% of gross electricity consumption, 51.64% of gross heat consumption and 0.40% of gross consumption by the transport sector. According to current projections, the estimated share of renewable energy in gross final consumption will total 32.3% by the end of 2019, including 17.76% of gross final consumption of electricity, 53.92% of gross final consumption of heat and 8.2% of gross final consumption by the transport sector. Overview of the transport sector by technology: The biggest hike in the share of renewable energy can be seen in the transport sector. First generation biofuels account for the largest share  a total of 6.4%, which results from the obligation, imposed on suppliers of liquid fuels, to add a biocomponent. The share accounted for by second generation fuels or domestic biomethane is 1.4% (including multipliers) and electromobility accounts for 0.4% (including multipliers). Overview of renewable electrical energy by technology: According to current (unofficial) projections, the share represented by renewable electrical energy will be around 18% by the end of 2019; hydraulic power will contribute around 30 GWh, wind energy 670 GWh, solar energy 100 MWh, biomass 1,150 GWh and other renewables 47 GWh. Heating and cooling energy from renewable energy sources: According to current projections, the share of renewables in heating will account for around 53.9% of final energy consumption by the end of 2019, to which wood as local heating will contribute 5,000 GWh, consumption of transformed heat 3,800 GWh and heat pumps 905 GWh. Projections for the future Estonia has made a detailed assessment of whether the overall target can be achieved by 2020. According to this, the share of renewables in gross energy consumption will be at least 30% in 2020177. According to current unofficial projections, renewables are projected to account for the following sectoral shares by 2020:  18.95% of electricity consumption;  55.28% of heat and cooling energy consumption;  10% of energy used in transport. 0.88% a year. Hence gross final energy consumption will increase to between 41 and 43 TWh by 2030. Taking into consideration the NDPES 2030 renewable energy targets (achieve a share of 80% of gross heat consumption and 50% of gross electricity consumption accounted for by renewables, on condition that the statistical transfers of renewable energy are used), the new Renewable Energy Directive, which determines the share of renewables in transport fuels, and also potential interest in statistical transfers of renewable energy, the share of renewable energy may account for over 50% of final gross energy consumption. The domestic renewable energy target reflects the ambitions of the NDPES 2030, but also takes into account a reasonable contribution by Estonia towards                                                             177 Calculations of this share consider take into account agreed statistical transfers of renewable energy. ii. Projections of sectoral developments with existing national and Union policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) Chapter 2.1.2. describes the development of the renewable energy sector to 2030 and trajectories, taking into account current trends in renewable energy generation and consumption. The formulation of trajectories for renewable energy in 2040 takes into account general climate policy targets established both by the European Union and domestically. On the basis of the general principles of climate policy with a view to 2050, Estonia is aiming to reduce GHG emissions by approximately 72% of 1990 levels by 2040. In future we will be able to see more and more cooperation and synergies between sectors, which will bring about the more widespread introduction of renewable energy and energy savings in both primary electricity generation and in the use of secondary energy in all sectors, as we move towards a carbon neutral economy.  The trends which the renewable energy sector will follow in the lead-up to 2040 will depend substantially on the megatrends we can perceive in Europe and globally,  where the main keywords are carbon neutral energy generation, energy saving and storage, and smart consumption. It is clear that fossil fuels are being replaced more and more by renewable energy. Renewable energy is produced in locations with the best geographical and climatic conditions for doing so at both the micro- (production of renewable energy for own consumption) and the macro level. As a result, we can see big wind and solar farms on-shore, offshore and in water bodies, because as the technology develops and prices drop, factors such as the depth of the sea, for instance, are no longer significant (anchored floating foundations will be used). To maximise benefits and meet national targets, countries will cooperate actively in the area of renewable energy in joint projects, support schemes and by engaging in statistical transfers. Thanks to technology leapfrogging, pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations, hydrogen being used as an energy carrier and batteries, it will be possible to harmonise consumption in the network in view of 2040 because peak hours will be covered using stored energy. To ensure the security of supply of electricity in Estonia, it will be possible in future to use a combination of renewable energy generation equipment and storage solutions (including seasonal storage), capture, storage and sequestration and new generation modular nuclear reactors. Use of new technologies and combinations thereof requires extensive preliminary work to be carried out in the form of research, preparatory work and construction. after 2030 presupposes the making of thorough political preparations at the State level, the recruitment of people with relevant training and the creation of a legal basis. The commissioning of nuclear energy requires legislation to be drawn up which would establish the terms, conditions and process of building a nuclear power plant in Estonia and, if necessary, the creation of the necessary structures. Currently Estonia does not have the necessary legal framework, competent authorities or thematic experts to build nuclear stations. According to the Radiation Act, permission for such an activity can be applied for only after the Riigikogu has adopted a decision on commissioning of a nuclear facility. It is also worth mentioning that smaller modular reactors that are not yet operating anywhere in the world could be suitable for Estonian conditions. ly, an analysis is to be carried out in 2020-2021 to identify roadmaps towards climate neutral electricity generation in Estonia and the socio-economic impacts of different roadmaps. There is increasing movement towards more energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable solutions also in terms of consumption. We see that the building stock is applying effective solutions for generating, consuming and monitoring automated household energy (as well as for selling surplus energy). Households use means to generate heat which leave a low carbon footprint (biomethane, heat pumps, hybrid solar panels). Unfortunately the automated systems and, for instance, the charging of so-called light duty vehicles at home result in an increase in electricity consumption in buildings. Rapid electrification can also be seen in the transport sector, both in road and rail transport. Alternative fuels are replacing fossil fuels. Thanks to convenient public transport and light traffic roads, cities are becoming practically car-free, giving rise to a pleasant urban environment with clean air
