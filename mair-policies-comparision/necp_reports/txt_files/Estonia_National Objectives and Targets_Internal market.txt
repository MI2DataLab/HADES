 Dimension Internal Energy Market   Electricity interconnectivity i. The level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030. The target level of the electrical interconnectivity of the EU Member States is at least 10% by 2020 and at least 15% by 203056. The Estonian electrical interconnectivity level is 63%, thereby exceeding the EU target level by many times. Cooperation between the Member States is of critical importance in increasing the electricity interconnectivity. The Member States should rely on three minimum criteria for achieving the interconnectivity level: a) the price differential of the pool price of the electricity among the regions,  b) nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors is below 30% of their peak load; c) nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors is below 30% of installed renewable generation capacity; It is important to note that planning of new cross-border interconnectors must consider the socio-economic and environmental effects. In 2017, the electrical interconnectivity level of Estonia with other EU countries (Latvia, Finland) was 63%56. The interconnection capacity from Estonia to Latvia was 900-1,000 MW, and from Estonia to Finland it was 1,016 MW. It is estimated that the capacity from Estonia to Latvia will increase to 1379 MW by 203057, due to completion of the third Estonia-Latvia interconnection58. The long-term development plan (TYNDP 201859) of ENTSO-E has estimated that in 2030, Estonia will fulfil all three criteria above for all analysed scenarios, as shown in Figure 10.                                                            56 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/communication_on_infrastructure_17.pdf  57 ENTSO-E.

Although Estonia and other Baltic States meet the three criteria for electricity connectivity, the networks of the Baltic States have not been fully interconnected to the EU electricity grids; the Baltic States are not located in the synchronous area subject to EU law The electricity systems of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania operate synchronously with the Russian Unified Energy System (IPS/UPS). Synchronisation of the electrical system of the Baltic States with the synchronous area subject to EU law around 2025 is one of the most important energy policy targets for Estonia and other Baltic States and will significantly affect the long-term development of the electricity network.  In the roadmap61 that was signed in the summer of 2018,the Prime Ministers of the Baltic States, the President of the European Commission and the Prime Minister of Poland confirmed the importance of the synchronisation project and recognised the wish of the Baltic States to synchronise with the Continental Europe frequency band. The interconnections between the Baltic States will also be strengthened by the synchronisation project and the project will help increase the interconnection of Poland in the electricity grid62.                                                            60 EUCO 2030 scenario = Scenario for meeting the EU-wide energy and climate objectives agreed in 2014. 61 Political Roadmap on the synchronisation of the Baltic States' electricity networks with the Continental European Network via Poland. https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/c_2018_4050_en_annexe_acte_autonome_nlw2_p_v2.docx  62 ENTSO-E.

Key electricity and gas transmission infrastructure projects, and, where relevant, modernisation projects, that are necessary for the achievement of objectives and targets under the five dimensions of the Energy Union Strategy Electric system The main target for the Estonian electricity system in the near future (until 2030) is to synchronise the electrical system with the mains frequency subject to EU law. Common Interest (PCI) since 2013 and relevant activities have been undertaken under it in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (Figure 11).   Figure 11: Synchronisation of the Baltic electricity system with the Continental European frequency band62. The figure shows the preliminary draft of the synchronisation plan and covers the updated lines. Table 15 below gives an overview of actions carried out in the Estonian electricity grid under the synchronisation project. The project will be carried out as cooperation between the Baltic States and Poland A detailed overview of the status and activities of the project is available on the ENTSO-E website presenting the project62.

The Estonian electricity system must also prepare for strengthening the connections between West Estonia and its islands in connection with added major capacity from the development of the off-shore and on-shore wind farms.  Looking to the future, it is expedient for local governments to add the guideline to their comprehensive planning using for planning infrastructure sites (e.g. cable connections of wind farms) related to off-shore activities via public procedure on land. On this basis, Elering AS will build the West Estonia Harku-Lihula-Sindi 330/110 kV high voltage overhead line, which is one of the biggest national infrastructure projects and capable of integrating up to 1,000 MW wind farms. Cooperation has begun with Latvia to develop joint projects (e.g. a Latvian-Estonian joint wind farm in the Gulf of Riga) that would be eligible for co-financing for developing the connections via the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). Gas system The greatest challenges for the Estonian gas system include interconnection of the system with the Finnish gas system via the Balticconnector by 2019 and the associated renovation of the Karksi gas-metering station in 2019. The transmission capacity of the Balticconnector in the project is 7.2 million m3 of natural gas per day. Renovation of the metering station will ensure two-way gas flow between Estonia and Latvia. Facilities related to the construction of Balticconnector have been on the PCI list since 2013 (Balticconnector project number 8.1.1). When completed, the Balticconnector will contribute to the physical integration of the   Improved security of natural gas supply in Estonia as well as Finland;  Larger natural gas market that covers Finland and the Baltic States, with alternative supply channels that will increase competition in the gas market;  Improved opportunities for using renewable energy (biomethane);  Increase in security of natural gas supply in the Baltic States-Finland area by allowing natural gas equal opportunities for competing with other primary fuels;  Improved integration of the single gas market covering Finland and the Baltic States with the EU single market once the Lithuanian-Poland gas interconnector GIPL is completed;  allowing Finland access to the underground gas storage in Latvia. The construction of Balticconnector will expand the interconnections of the Estonian-Latvian gas systems. The project is about improving the interconnection pipeline between Estonia and Latvia, including the construction of a compressor station and a new gas metering station in Estonia. Balticconnector relates to the following dimension of the Energy Union strategy:  Energy security, solidarity and trust (improves security of the gas supply):  A fully-connected to the Baltic States and in future to the Central European gas market);  Climate - low-carbon economy (transfer of gas produced from renewable energy sources);  Research, innovation and competitiveness (liquid market, new market opportunities).  ii.

The development plan sets an indicative target level of 96% for the external interconnection availability in 2030. Table 16 above shows that this level has been achieved for the Estonia-Finland interconnections. 330 kV (Sindi-Riga and Sindi--Latvia interconnection) in sub-objective of the NDPES 2030 security of supply, addresses increasing the availability of the Estonia-Latvia interconnectors, with implementation planned for 2021. Other investments in the Baltic States made within the framework of the synchronisation project also help increase the availability of external interconnectors (see Chapter 2.4.2), which helps eliminate the bottlenecks in all Baltic States and increases the resilience of the electrical systems to fast changes in production and consumption.

Estonia is connection to synchronisation frequency Connected (2030)  In addition to the development of the electricity infrastructure, the TSO (Elering AS) together with the largest distribution system operator (Elektrilevi OÜ) deal with development projects promoting the deployment of the flexibility service in the Estonian electricity system (e.g. H2020 project EU-SysFlex;  Deployment of the single balancing services market in the Baltic States, starting 1 January 2018).  This is helped by the fact Electricity Market Act, all Estonian electricity consumers have been supplied with remotely readable meters since 1 January 2017. Gas system Table 14 gives an overview of the targets relating to gas market integration. The integration of the Estonian gas market with the gas markets of the other Baltic States and Finland has been under way since 2016, when the relevant ministries, system operators and regulators of the Baltic States and Finland acted to establish a single gas market. The parties have organised a working group for cooperation with the aim of creating a harmonised rules for the gas market and single price for access to gas in the gas system gas (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania + Finland) by 2020. The Prime Ministers of the Baltic States approved the roadmap of necessary activities in December 2016. One of the most important tasks is to abolish the transmission fees on the borders of the countries on the regional gas market. The aim is that from 2019 onwards there will be no gas transmission fees between Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland. Only the price of the gas flow incoming to the region will remain unchanged (uniform across the region) and the gas flow output price (each country decides itself). The establishment of a single market of the region will mean uniform market rules, a joint balancing zone across four countries, no transmission fees on the borders of the countries and system operators will have a single IT platform to meet system requirements. For market integration, the key points of development of the physical infrastructure include completion of the Balticconnector in 2019 and supplementing the interconnection of the Estonian-Latvian gas systems with the compressor station and building a new gas metering station.  ii. Where applicable, the national objectives with regard to ensuring electricity system adequacy, as well as for the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met. The adequacy and flexibility of renewable energy production is ensured by the Electrical Market Act and harmonisation with the legislation laid down pursuant to it. According to the current Electrical Market Act, the system operator (including the  transmission system operator) in Estonia develops the system in their service area in a way that ensures provision of consistent network service that is based on the legislation and an operating licence to consumers, producers, transmission line owners and other system operators who are connected to the system considering their justified needs and to connect to the electrical installation of the market operator in their service area According to the Electricity Market Act, the customers may start to produce electrical energy for their own consumption and sell excess to the grid. It is also possible to get supports for electrical energy that is generated from renewable energy sources. By developing the grid, the system operator will follow the need for ensuring the security of supply, efficiency and market integration considering the results of the studies carried out in these areas66. In the case of grid connections or change in the consumption or production conditions, the electricity producer has to pay all costs necessary for connecting the production capacities or changing the existing production conditions, including the costs for building new electrical installations and renovation of existing electrical installations67.

A good example of this innovation is the map application shown in Figure 12, developed by the Estonian TSO (Elering AS) that shows the available capacities in the electricity grid belonging to the company by years and enables the renewable energy producers to plan their projects more effectively.  68. The synchronisation project (see chapter 2.4.2) also contributes to the renewable energy integration capacity-building by which the electrical system bottlenecks will be removed across the Baltic States. iii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to ensuring that consumers participate in the energy system and benefit from self-generation and new technologies, including smart meters; Since 1 January 2017, all Estonian electricity customers have had smart readers that record and transmit at least the hourly data to the central database (data storage - e.elering.ee).  Consumers have free access to their data. They may also enable data access for the freely selected service provider iv. National objectives with regard to ensuring electricity system adequacy, if applicable, as well as for the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production, including a timeframe for when the objectives shall be met Described in 2.4.3 ii above. v. Where applicable, national objectives to protect energy consumers and improve the competitiveness of the retail energy sector Not applicable.   Energy poverty69  Where applicable, national objectives with regard to energy poverty, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met Current Estonian national development documents do not deal with energy poverty as an separate issue.  Household subsistence is monitored fully at national as well as local -202370reduction and aims at the reduction of the absolute poverty rate to 5.8% and reduction of the relative poverty rate to 15% by 2023. Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive EU 2018/2002 was transposed in 2019 by amendment of the Energy Sector Organisation Act, and measures for tackling energy poverty will be specified in the course of drafting the legislation. Achievement of the energy efficiency targets via different measures, renovation or other measures requires consideration whether and how the energy purchase risk groups and persons in energy poverty shall be involved in the energy efficiency measures so that                                                            68 Elering AS. Available connection capacity map application https://elering.ee/vabade-liitumisvoimsuste-rakendus/  69  70 https://www.sm.ee/et/heaolu-arengukava-2016-2023 the measures to make housing more energy-efficient are also accessible to these groups. Transposition of the Directive links the person in energy poverty with the subsistence allowance, which means that recipients of the subsistence allowance also includes people experiencing energy poverty. A person living alone or a family who in the last six months has received once the subsistence allowance for housing costs (incl. energy purchase) and whose previous month income (gross) is not higher than the minimum wage for equivalence scales 1,0;0,8;1,2 is deemed to be experiencing energy poverty. In 2018, 21,000 people, 1.6% of Estonian population, received the subsistence allowance to cover housing costs, including the apartment house loan. During the first half of 2019, the support for covering the housing costs amounted to 5.8 million euros of which 136,317 euros were used for the loan payment for the apartment house renovation. Directive (EU) 2018/2002 aims to improve the situation of natural persons and households who are not able to participate in the energy saving measures without additional support. To achieve this, the policy measures, a list of which is approved by the Government of the Republic from among the measures necessary for meeting the general energy saving obligation, must be assigned to the natural persons or households in economically insecure situations or the service providers responsible for them to mitigate energy poverty. Even now, the energy saving measures for persons experiencing energy poverty include provisions on access to energy-efficiency measures: 1) Housing benefit for families with many children. This benefit helps to improve the living conditions of low-income households with many children. 2) Support for the reconstruction of apartment buildings This grant helps to improve the energy efficiency of apartment houses and supports all members of the apartment association to carry out energy-efficiency measures. Specifications have been created for the regions where property values are lower and energy poverty is greater. 3) Case-by-case investment aid to develop local government building stock.  This aid helps to improve the availability of rented accommodation for households that are not able to buy or rent it from the rental market, including socio-economically disadvantaged persons. The statistics of the European Energy Poverty Observatory71 suggest that Estonia does not have major problems in this area. For example, 2.9% of households had problems with ensuring heating, while the EU average is 7.9%. 6.3% of households had payment debts for energy bills, while the EU average is 7%. The amount of income Estonian families spend on energy (16.3%) is very close to the EU average of 16.3%.

Overall it would appear that poverty is slightly better than the EU average
