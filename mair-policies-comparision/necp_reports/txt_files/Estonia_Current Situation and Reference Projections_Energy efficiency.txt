Dimension Energy efficiency i. Current primary and final energy consumption in the economy and per sector (including industry, residential, service and transport) According to Eurostat data, 257 PJ (71.3 TWh) of primary energy and 118 PJ (32.8 TWh) of final energy were consumed in Estonia in 2016. The figure below describes the structure of final consumption (see Figure 30). In comparison to 2004, when Estonia joined the European Union, energy consumption in the services and transport sectors and transport has grown by a quarter. Household energy consumption has not significantly changed in comparison to 2004, whereas industrial energy consumption has reached the same level. At the same time, the added value of the manufacturing industry has increased more than twofold but its share of total added value has declined by 1.6%178. To create added value (in current prices), manufacturing used less than half the energy in 2018 than it did in 2004.                                                            178 Data sheet RAA0042 of Statistics Estonia   Industry  Final energy consumption, TWh/a  Agriculture and fisheries  Transport  Commercial and public services  Households Figure 30.

Current potential179 for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling. According to sub-measure 4 of NDPES 75 MW more heat to the district heating network through high-efficiency cogeneration 2017 with a thermal output of 76 MW. A cogeneration plant in Mustamäe in Tallinn with a thermal output of up to 47 MW will be added in 2019. A district cooling sector has not yet been established in Estonia. A district cooling pilot project has been launched in Tartu. iii. Projections considering existing energy efficiency policies, measures and programmes as described in point 1.2.(ii)180 for primary and final energy consumption for each sector at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) Domestic consumption of primary energy (fuels used in Estonia + import - export) will fall markedly by 2030 (to around 6061 TWh/a, or -11% of 2016 levels). However, according to projections, final energy consumption will remain stable at the same level as in previous years (3233 TW/h). No significant changes in cross-sectoral distribution are forecast in respect of final energy consumption (see Figure 30).                                                            179 In accordance with Article 14(1) of Directive 2012/27/EU. 180 consumption target described under point 2.3, and for the conversion factors.

Cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements resulting from national calculations, according to Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU. Cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements were ascertained in -optimal energy efficiency minimum requirements for completed in 2017182. The results are summarised in the following table (see Table 26). When analysing the table, consideration should also be given to the weighing factors of the energy carriers, the most important of which are the weighing factor 0.75 for fuels obtained from renewable raw materials; 0.9 for district heating, 1.0 for natural gas and 2.0 for electricity.
