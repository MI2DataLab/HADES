3.1 Dimension Decarbonisation  GHG emissions and removals  Climate change mitigation objectives are closely linked with the goals defined in National Energy Independence Strategy (NEIS), the National Renewable Energy Resources Development Strategy, the Lithuanian Housing Strategy, the Law on Energy from Renewable Sources and the Energy Efficiency Action Plan 2017-2019. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 54    The Lithuanian progress strategy Lithuania 203050 highlights the need for joint work to tackle problems in the areas of sustainable development, environment, energy, transport, economy and strengthening of democracy, but does not detail specific directions. There is a strong focus on social responsibility and green growth.  In this section, policies and measures are grouped and presented on a sector-by-sector basis. The detailed measures and policies needed to achieve this will be discussed for each GHG emitting sector and for each sector where improvement in removals is required, taking into account the long-term vision and objective of a low-carbon economy and ensuring a balance between GHG emissions and removals under the Paris Agreement.  Presented below are the policies and measures covering non-ETS and LULUCF sectors which were implemented to reach the 2020 targets and which will be continued to achieve more ambitious GHG emission reduction targets by 2030. Based on the national GHG projections, it was determined that Lithuania might face difficulties in attaining non-ETS targets due to the projected GHG emissions increase in the transport and agriculture sectors. Thus, additional measures have planned for the period 2021-2030 to increase GHG emission reduction.  Transport sector The Sustainable Development Strategy stresses that, following the restoration of independence, the eco-dropped approximately in half, while atmospheric emissions of pollutants went down by more than 2.5 times, yet this is more related to GDP growth itself.  The National Transport Development Programme 2014-2022 has, among others, objectives to increase the mobility of goods and passengers, to improve the corridors of the EU Trans-European Transport Networks as well as their connections with national and local transport networks, to increase the energy efficiency of transport, to reduce the adverse impact of transport on the environment and to improve traffic safety. It contains an analysis of the potential future development of road, rail, maritime, inland waterways and air transport.  Objective 3.2.1 of the Progress Programme, 'Developing modern transport infrastructure and sustainable mobility', is important from the standpoint of climate change. The directions foreseen for the implementation of the target are aimed at increasing the attractiveness of public transport, reducing urban congestion by improving infrastructure, improving land transport by developing missing links, improving intermodality, developing pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, introducing and developing environmental measures, reducing CO2 and other measures. All these measures also ensure that the negative environmental effects of the transport sector are reduced. However, it is also important to note that some of the areas of implementation of the objective, in particular  those intended to develop and modernise the urban street network and reduce traffic congestion; to develop the insufficient land transport infrastructure connections with other EU States and third-country transport networks, and other areas related to infrastructure improvement, also increase road transport on account of the establishment of better conditions.                                                             50 https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/TAIS.425517 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 55   The programme also identifies the main targets for the development of infrastructure in order to use alternative energy sources in transport, including electricity. It is expected that by 2025 there will be 46,066 electric cars in in Lithuania. Lithuania also has drafted strategic documents for the long term; for example, according to the NEIS, the energy intensity of transport will be reduced by 2.4 times in comparison with the current level in the transport sector by 2050.  In the transport sector, it is necessary to transform the old car fleet (currently the average age of passenger cars in Lithuania is 15 years) into a newer and more efficient one, to use vehicles powered by alternative fuels, to promote innovative transport technologies, the use of clean vehicles and the mobility of electric and N1 class electric vehicles were registered in Lithuania. This represents less than 1% of the total fleet (approx. 1.5 million). The number of electric cars is increasing, with an average of about 30 each month. The majority of electric cars registered in the country are used electric cars.  There are currently two main incentives for choosing an electric vehicle: the availability of specially designated lanes in Vilnius and the reduction of parking and entry fees in Lithuanian cities. For easier identification, electric vehicles are also given vehicle registration plate numbers consisting of a combination of two letters and four digits, the first of which must be the letter "E".  Electric vehicle recharging infrastructure in Lithuania was first established and developed in five major Lithuanian cities and resorts, as well as in the main trans-European road network ("TEN-T Core Network"), i.e. alongside international motorways (public highways) E85 and E67, and later alongside other roads belonging to the TEN-T network, approximately every 50 kilometres, in order to ensure electric vehicle connections between cities.  In 20142019, 25 public high-capacity electric vehicle recharging stations were installed on the Vilnius--e information system www.eismoinfo.lt provides information on the type, status and real-time availability of recharging access for these electric vehicles.  Many municipalities in Lithuania have provided for electric car recharging points in their existing or future plans for sustainable urban mobility. 17 Lithuanian municipalities have taken advantage of the EU investment opportunity to install electric vehicle recharging points by the end of 2020 (a total of 56 electric vehicle recharging stations are planned: 33 high power and 23 regular power).  This public recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles (located alongside roads and in municipalities) is being established and developed in accordance with approved European Union standards, yet it also enables recharging other types of electric vehicles (combined stations with three types of access: AC, DC (Combo2) and DC (CHAdeMO)).  The capital currently has around 130 electric car recharging stations, more than a half of which were established through private sector initiatives. The private sector is also planning the development of electric vehicle recharging infrastructure, not only in cities, but also along national roads.  However, due to the increase in GHG emissions in the transport sector, achieving 9% savings compared to 2005 requires reducing the GHG emissions by nearly a third. The National Plan provides for a wide range of measures to achieve this.  3.

T4. Promotion of the RES use in the transport sector. This measure is identical to RES measures 12 to 16 and is intended to:   Promote the use of advanced (generation II) liquid biofuels (biodiesel and bioethanol) not produced from food and feed crops, in line with sustainability criteria, by progressively increasing the obligation for fuel suppliers to blend them with mineral fuels. As a result, the share of advanced liquid biofuels in total consumption will increase to 0.2% in 2022.   Promote the emergence of sustainable biomethane gas production and supply chain guarantees through regulatory and financial instruments by encouraging public transport fleets to use gas from renewable sources. The projected volumes of production and consumption for 2030 are 81.5 ktoe.   Promote the biogas guarantees of origin market so that 100% of biogas producers are registered in the guarantees of origin register in 2030.  T5. Implementation of the objectives of the EU White Paper. As a result, there should be no polluting cars in cities by 2050. This requires the development of a long-term plan for the promotion electric vehicles and electric vehicle recharging infrastructure, defining the targets and measures to that end.  T6. Developing and promoting economic and ecological driving skills. Reduced fuel consumption due to changes in driving skills achieved through training on economical and ecological driving, education, advertising, etc. Social advertising and other measures will reach 5% of drivers, reducing fuel consumption by 3.7%.  T7. Promoting the purchase of cleaner vehicles. A financial incentive will be offered for 4.8% of transactions. Of these, 50% will benefit from the incentive and the efficiency of newly purchased cars will improve by 42%. The amount of financial support will be EUR 1,000.  T8. Introduction of E-tolling for freight transport. As a result of the toll, 60 lorries and an average of 5.5 buses will be changed from the lower Euro standard to the higher Euro standard per year.  T9. Introduction of incentives for combined freight transport. To encourage intermodal unit carriers to opt 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 64   for combined transport instead of transporting intermodal units by road. By 2030, 5% of freight will be shifted to combined transport. This will reduce GHG emissions by 19% compared to road transport only.  T10. Restriction of access to designated urban areas for vehicles with ICEs. Creation of urban low-emission zones is planned, in which the traffic of both diesel and petrol-powered vehicles will be limited. The number of ICE-powered vehicles will be reduced or they will be replaced by zero emission vehicles. The reduction in the number of passenger cars will be 5% over the whole period.  T11. Creation of a Sustainable Mobility Fund. The Fund is the primary and necessary instrument for the implementation of other instruments. The fund should consist of all funds from targeted pollution taxes and be aimed at promoting cleaner transport (incentives for the installation of recharging points for electric vehicles, purchase of zero-emission vehicles, parking of zero-emission vehicles, social distribution and habit building). The mentioned measures are included and assessed individually, with no final list or scope.  T12. Renewal of the transport fleet through green procurement and ensuring minimum procurement objectives in the field of transport. Changes in the legal framework are planned to increase the use of clean vehicles and reduce the share of conventionally fuelled vehicles by implementing the minimum procurement targets: by 31 December 2025, in green procurement the share of clean passenger vehicles (categories M1, M2 and N1) in the total vehicle fleet must be at least 60%, the share of clean heavy duty vehicles (categories N2 and N3) in the total vehicle fleet must be at least 8% and the share of clean buses (category M3) in the total fleet must be at least 80%; by 31 December 2030, in green procurement the share of clean passenger vehicles (categories M1, M2 and N1) in the total fleet must be at least 100%, the share of clean heavy duty vehicles (categories N2 and N3) in the total fleet must be at least 16% and the share of clean buses (categories M3) in the total fleet must be at least 100%  T13. Promoting the use of electric vehicles and developing the recharging infrastructure. It is intended that electric vehicles should account for 10% of annual class M1 purchase transactions (registered and re-registered cars) in 2025 and 50% in 2030.  Facilitating electric vehicle acquisition, electric vehicle subsidising and increasing the availability of electric vehicle recharging infrastructure through the following instruments:   Purchase allowance for pure electric vehicles (indicative amount fixed at EUR 4,000 for a new vehicle and EUR 2,000 for second-hand electric vehicles up to 5 of age);   Allowance for the purchase/installation of semi-public and private normal power recharging points for electric vehicles (up to 22 kW  and up to EUR 250);   Allowance for the purchase/installation of public high power recharging points for electric vehicles in problematic or commercially unattractive locations by national roads and in the cities (up to 50 kW   EUR 5 000 000; up to 100 kW   EUR 10 000);   The obligation to install recharging points for electric vehicles in new or reconstructed buildings and parking lots (at least 2 access points per 10 parking spaces);   The obligation to install electric vehicle recharging points at new or reconstructed filling stations belonging to filling station networks and located by national roads.  T14. Construction of new cargo vessels and barges. Under the measure, vehicles for the carriage of goods would be prepared or built. This would shift part of the cargo from the polluting road transport to cleaner 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 65   inland waterway transport. Proposed funding is up to 30% (up to 50% for LNG vessels or self-propelled barges), while the rest of the required funding would come from own funds. 54.5 million tonne-kilometres will be transferred from road transport to inland waterway transport.  T15. Construction of new passenger ships. It is assumed that the construction of new vessels and barges and the development of passenger transport by waterway will allow modern waterborne transport to contribute to GHG savings. Increased passenger flows in waterborne transport (0.6 million passenger-km) will reduce passenger flows in road transport accordingly. New vessels should be fuelled by LNG or RES. Proposed funding is up to 30% (up to 50% for LNG vessels or self-propelled barges), while the rest of the required funding would come from own funds.  T16. Replacement of existing inland cargo vessels, passenger vessels, fishing vessels and other inland waterway vessels, and upgrading of other mechanisms related to the replacement of those vessels. Many of the power stations installed on board inland waterway vessels in Lithuania, consisting of main and auxiliary engines, are highly polluting. This measure would provide for the conversion of existing power plants into cleaner power plants or conversion of diesel or petrol power plants into power plans fuelled by LNG, electricity and renewables  T17. Development and/or upgrading of inland waterway infrastructure, including ports and landing places. ate Seaport) that need to be further expanded or reconstructed. The infrastructure suitable for the transport of goods above Kaunas to the state border with Belarus is scarce and must be developed. The measure would allow the development of cargo shipping on the Kaunas-developing cargo shipping on the Kaunas-Grodno route, including intermediate points on these routes. Loading sites, warehouses, special fixed and mobile equipment must be installed at these loading points. The infrastructure would be used for the transport, loading and storage of goods and for serving passenger ships and passengers.  T18. Establishment and implementation of a system of tax incentives Establishment and adaptation of a system of tax incentives for inland waterway transport would provide practical incentives for carriers to develop their freight and passenger transport business, which would significantly improve the chances of reducing air pollution. Opportunities to build new and upgrade old ships, as well as incentives for their use, can significantly reduce land transport of freight and encourage passenger transport business, which would improve mobility opportunities in cleaner transport, and encourage the introduction of advanced, cleaner technologies in inland waterway transport. Port dues concessions would also apply to ships running on   T19. Support for the purchase of commercial vehicles fuelled by liquefied natural gas. To grant subsidies to businesses in order to compensate the cost of purchasing vehicles for them. The plan is provide a single non-repayable flat-rate subsidy for around 1,000 vehicles per year.  T20. Annual car pollution charge. Higher environmental taxes as well as the annual vehicle tax depending on the level of emissions have been found to encourage the replacement of cars by cleaner ones, which are taxed less heavily. Each year, 5% of newly purchased petrol and diesel cars will be replaced by zero-emission vehicles.  T21. Differentiation of the vehicle registration/re-registration charge according to the level of pollution. The 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 66   pollution-dependent registration/re-registration charges for new and used cars will reduce CO2 emissions by 3.5% per year, as this will encourage the purchase of less polluting vehicles.  T22. Marking of vehicles by level of pollution. Carbon labelling of vehicles will lead to more efficient implementation of other measures related to the determination of emissions levels and will ensure rapid identification of the vehicle group to which the vehicle belongs. Vehicles would be marked with special stickers indicating the group to which they belong and the data would be included in the database with the vehicle registration numbers. Newly registered vehicles would be marked at the time of registration of the vehicle, while vehicles already registered would be marked at the time of the mandatory roadworthiness test of the vehicle.  T23. Establishment of the LNG distribution system. Installation of a liquefied natural gas distribution system to supply refuelling points for liquefied natural gas; installation of 2 LNG stations, which will be supported by covering 50% of the installation costs. The sales of one LNG station are estimated at 792 tonnes per year.  T24. Traffic congestion reduction through traffic organisation solutions. Traffic organisation changes through traffic planning measures (flow distribution, rush hour traffic restriction) and /or smart traffic management technologies (smart traffic lights, crossings, etc.) help to reduce congestion and fuel consumption. 35% of traffic jams. In traffic congestion, vehicles consume 1.8 times more fuel.  T25. Reducing traffic congestion through spatial planning solutions. Making recommendations to municipalities covering spatial planning solutions that will contribute to efficient traffic management (optimal layout of public transport stops, development of commercial areas according to traffic intensity, etc.).  T26. Promoting flexible working hours and remote work. Education and information for employers and workers on the use of flexible working time options (remote work, flexible opening and closing hours, additional days off, etc.) helps to reduce the number of trips to and from work.  T27. Elimination of pollution tax concessions for operators engaged in individual activities. To abolish the concessions for the tax on pollution from mobile sources applicable to natural persons engaged in individual activities within the meaning of the Law on Personal Income Tax and using private vehicles in their activities.  T28. Allowance for the purchase of N1 electric vehicles. Electric vehicles will account for at least 30% of annual class N1 (light commercial vehicles) purchases (new and second-hand vehicles first registered and re-registered) by 2025 and 100% by 2030 . Class N1 vehicles with ICE will not be registered as of 2030.  T29. Promotion of zero-emission taxi and ridesharing service providers. The obligation for taxi and ridesharing providers to direct orders to the drivers of zero-emission vehicles first, using telephone or application. Orders received by taxis and ridesharing companies (their operators / administrators) should be directed first to drivers of zero-emission vehicles providing those services by phone or application, only later to others; at airports and bus and railway stations, zero-emission taxis enjoy priority in queues. The measure will change 2% of taxis and ridesharing vehicles into zero emission vehicles.  T30. Development and implementation of a cross-cutting study on public transport in Vilnius city. An integrated study on the Vilnius city's public transport network and fleet will be developed to optimise public transport lines and adapt them to zero emission public transport. It is planned to explore all transport lines 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 67   in order to ensure rapid and convenient transportation in the expanding city and its access roads. Development of trolleybus lines and reduction of the use of diesel buses in the downtown is envisaged. A study on other alternative zero emission fuels for passenger transport was also carried out with a view to urban applications and the most suitable vehicles and required infrastructure have been proposed for the establishment of the necessary infrastructure. A study will be implemented in 20232030. Strategic optimisation will reduce CO2 emissions from buses by 12.64%  T31. Broad social dissemination, public information, habit building and pilot projects to reduce fossil fuel consumption. Changing the behaviour of residents and their habits through education and opinion formation (training, publicity, presentations, advertising, promotion, etc. in kindergartens, schools, universities, for residents, public, municipal and private enterprises and organisations, etc.). Impact factor: 5% of the affected population reduces fuel consumption by 3.7% as a result of the measures.  T32. Improving access to and use of public transport. The following measures will be implemented:   Revision of public transport routes and/or introduction of new ones in response to changing societal needs with a view to more actively reducing the number of vehicles in the city;   Step-by-step introduction of free public transport (reimbursement of tickets) to regulate urban traffic (free public transport for primary school children, then for school children, then for students and seniors).   Alternative policy measures in the transport sector. These measures were additionally included in the National Plan, in line with the proposals received during the public consultation. Their effect is not taken into account in the calculations in part B, but these measures will be considered as an alternative to the elements of the PPM scenario in order to ensure at least the same effect on the achievement of the national targets prior to approval thereof in the legislation (see Section 3  for more details). Alternative policy measures: 1. Alternative policy measures to promote renewable fuels are outlined in Section 3.1.2 . 2. Development of alternative fuel filling points on inland wSeaport. 3. To strengthen the control of fuel suppliers to reduce GHG intensity of fuels placed on the market by 6% compared to the overall EU target for 2010 (under Article 7a of the Fuel Quality Directive).   Financing of planned measures in the transport sector51. The bulk of the investment is directed towards the promotion of electric vehicles and the development of electric vehicle recharging infrastructure, low-emission vehicles, inland waterway transport and other measures in the transport sector. The total financial requirement of the sector amounts to EUR 3,752.66 million, of which EUR 2,798.96 million should be public funds and EUR 953.7 million private funds. The public portfolio will mainly consist of the 2021-2027 EU funds, LIFE IP, State and municipal budgets, the Climate Change Programme, and the ERDF. Sector of industry and industrial processes In Lithuania's progress strategy Lithuania 2030, one of the smart economy initiatives is to increase business incentives to invest in green technologies, goods and services. It also highlights the need for advanced, resource-efficient and environmentally friendly technologies and products to reduce climate change in other sectors and industry. One of the indicators measuring the success of the Smart Economy Initiative is atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 equivalent) in million tonnes per GDP unit targeted for                                                            51Indicative funding requirement. 3.

The Sustainable Development Strategy draws attention to the current situation in Lithuania, where a number of companies use obsolete technologies and substances that are hazardous to human health. According to the vision, thanks to the introduction of the latest technologies distinguished for efficient use of resources, smaller negative environmental effects and cleaner production methods in the areas of production and services, environmental pollution will not be linked to economic growth and will grow much slower than production. Promotion of recycling of secondary raw materials and recycling capacity building is highlighted as one of the more important objectives in industrial development.  The progress programme identifies green procurement as well as the creation of incentives for business to invest in green technologies, goods and services as one of its objectives. The horizontal principles in the programme also include the components of sustainable business development, and one of the areas of change is to promote an environmentally friendly business culture and the development of a green market by encouraging the introduction of energy- and resource-efficient processes and technologies in enterprises, to promote the recovery of energy and materials through the development of technologies and production methods that recycle waste, reduce the use of natural resources and ensure waste prevention.  The Industrial Development Programme covers the need promote energy efficiency in industry: increased use of renewable sources of energy as well as introduction of technologies reducing carbon dioxide emissions. It stresses that EU assistance could help raise the efficiency of energy production and consumption as well as the use of renewal energy sources, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  The National Air Pollution Reduction Plan identifies industry as one of the main pollutants (with a particular focus on oil refining and storage and transportation of petroleum products). In 2015, 19% of total SO2 emissions came from the industrial sector.  The Lithuanian Industrial Digitisation Roadmap 2019203052 provides various measures for the improvement and digitisation of the industrial sector. The document primarily focuses on improving and developing the industry itself, irrespective of its positive or negative potential environmental impact.  The Ministry of Economy and Innovation of the Republic of Lithuania is currently preparing a roadmap for transition to a circular economy, the results of which are expected in 2021. Once these documents are approved, concrete measures will be developed to implement the principles of circular economy.  The objective of the F-gas Regulation53 is to reduce fluorinated GHG emissions. This Regulation establishes rules on containment, use, recovery and destruction of fluorinated greenhouse gases, and on related ancillary measures; imposes conditions on the placing on the market of specific products and equipment that contain, or whose functioning relies upon, fluorinated greenhouse gases; imposes conditions on specific uses of fluorinated greenhouse gases; and establishes quantitative limits for the placing on the market of hydrofluorocarbons.  The 2014-2020 Programme for Promotion of Investment and Industrial Development is intended to increase energy efficiency and the use of RES. The implementation of this programme is financed from the EU structural funds. According to the NEIS, the promotion of low energy consumption in subsectors and the                                                            52 https://inovacijos.lt/media/industry%20digitalization%20ROADMAP%20pre-final%20draft.pdf 53 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/LT/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014R0517 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 69   application of eco-innovative technologies are expected to result in electricity savings of around 620 GWh by 2025.  Lithuania has also introduced requirements for fluorinated gases, which will reduce total emissions of fluorinated gases by two thirds in 2030 compared to 2014 levels. They prohibit the sale of fluorinated gases on the market in certain circumstances where alternatives are available. Between 2018 and 2020, quotas for legally placing HFCs on the EU market were reduced to 63% of the 2015 levels Lithuania implements the EU F-gas regulation through four domestic orders issued by the Minister for the Environment. In 2018, Lithuania ratified the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, which is intended to provide universal protection against the effects of HFCs, and started the process of progressive reduction of HFCs as of 2019. Lithuania will achieve the objectives of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol by implementing the requirements of the F-Gas Regulation.    Table 3.1.1.3.

As coal is the most polluting fossil fuel in terms of GHG emissions, the proposal is to abolish the subsidy as from 2024.  P8. Reducing the use of F-gases in businesses. The measure is aimed at encouraging undertakings to acquire new equipment or to replace old equipment using technological alternatives other than fluorinated gases or using low-GWP gases. In providing financial support for the purchase and installation of cooling equipment, priority should be given to those applicants who plan to purchase equipment using lower-GWP coolants. In view of other countries' experience, this measure is expected to lead to a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  P9. Promoting the replacement of polluting technologies with cleaner ones. The measure is targeted at the participants of the EU ETS. It is intended to partly finance projects for the replacement of polluting production technologies by less polluting ones, the implementation of BATs, etc. On average, BATs and other technology improvement solutions based on the best practices are expected to reduce GHG emissions by 22%.  P10. Introduction and promotion of technological eco-innovation. The measure is intended for small and medium-size enterprises. In order to reduce the negative effects of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, investment in tangible assets (installations, technologies) is envisaged, which reduces the negative environmental impacts of economic activities, promotes industrial symbiosis and ensures a continuous environmental impact, i.e. investments in cleaner production innovations (implementation thereof) with rational use of resources and pollution prevention techniques (e.g. process modernisation/optimisation to reduce negative environmental impacts and/or to conserve natural resources, lean production, reuse/recycling of waste, use of waste heat (recovery, regeneration), separation of flows, etc.). On average, technological eco-innovation can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 20%.  P11. Implementation of modern technologies.

P16. Improving energy efficiency in enterprises. In order to improve the energy efficiency of businesses, Lithuania has planned a financial instrument that will encourage companies to implement energy efficiency improvement measures identified in the energy audit. It is planned to provide a subsidy for the energy savings achieved and to save 100 GWh annually and close to 5.5 TWh by 2030.  Alternative policy measures in the sector of industry and industrial processes. These measures were additionally included in the National Plan, in line with the proposals received during the public consultation. Their effect is not assessed in part B of the calculations, but these measures will be considered as an alternative to the elements of the PPM scenario in order to achieve at least the same effect on the achievement of the national targets prior to their adoption in the legislation (see Section 3 for more details). Alternative policy measures:  1. Assessment of CO2 capture, use and storage chain alternatives. To carry out a feasibility study on the application of CO2 capture, use and storage technologies in Lithuania. Also, to carry out a detailed analysis of the feasibility and usefulness of projects implemented with other countries of the EU common economic area (to the geological structures of which the CO2 captured in Lithuania could be exported).  Financing of planned measures in the sector of industry and industrial processes54. The bulk of the investment is directed towards the introduction and promotion of technological eco-innovation, the deployment of modern technologies and the digitisation of industry. The total need for funding for the sector is EUR 875.8 million, of which public funding amounts to EUR 341.53 million and private funding to EUR 534.3 million. The public portfolio will mainly consist of EU Structural Funds 2021-2027, Invest EU, LIFE and the Climate Change Programme.   Agricultural sector                                                            54Indicative funding requirement. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 75   In assessing the impact of EU support for agriculture and rural development on sustainable development, the National Progress Programme highlights the positive impact of investments to modernise farms, on the environment and labour productivity, and on the development of organic farming.  The long-term objectives set out in the Sustainable Development Strategy for the agricultural sector include the creation of an economically efficient and competitive agriculture, based on farming with a lower environmental impact; development of eco-farms and production of high-quality certified agricultural and food products; conservation of natural resources. The main long-term tasks for the agricultural sector are the following:   to intensify the development of ecological crop production and animal husbandry;   to promote effective development of biofuel production.  The 2014-As many as 7 needs are directly related to climate change mitigation.  The National Air Pollution Reduction Plan states that pollution is increasing due to the use of inorganic nitrogen fertiliparticular attention should be paid to measures reducing the use of inorganic nitrog. The measures provided for in the plan concern both the livestock and crop sectors.  Most of the sectoral agricultural programmes will be updated in 2020, and the development of livestock and crop production is planned until 2027.  In the agriculture sector the main focus is on the more effective and precise use of mineral nitrogen fertilizers and the education of farmers. The Lithuanian Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 promotes the growth of the agricultural sector based on technologies that are territorially and environmentally balanced, climate-friendly, climate change- resilient, competitive and innovative. It also promotes sustainable farming (25 000 ha), development of organic farming (110 000 ha), crop rotation, rational use of the mineral fertilizers, and replacement thereof with organic fertilizers. The total budget of the programme was EUR 1.978 billion. 36% of all funds were allocated for climate change mitigation (this amount included the previous programming period). However, the assessment of recent GHG inventories shows an upward trend in CO2 emissions and action will be taken to contribute to GHG reduction targets in the development of new agricultural policy solutions. The political guidelines of the EU Common Agricultural Policy also pay close attention to this. Since 2014 In Lithuania, biogas power plants producing biogas by processing manure from livestock farms have gained momentum. Another important mitigation activity is the protection of waters against nitrate pollution (such as the implementation of the EU nitrates directive and its latest amendment (1137/2008)), which contributes to reducing N2O emissions. Lithuania will prepare a National Strategic Plan for the Common Agricultural Policy for the period 2021-2027.   Table 3.1.1.5.

The public portfolio will mainly consist of the EAFRD and the EAGF for 2021-2027.   Waste management sector The Sustainable Development Strategy emphasizes that ineffective application of principle to waste management will not lead to an effective waste management system and failure to ensure a universal, high-quality and affordable public service of municipal waste management may increase pollution by waste. The vision emphasises that a regional waste management system will be developed and primary sorting of waste will considerably reduce the flows of waste to dumpsites and increase recycling.  The National Progress Programme mentions that, with a view to rational use of natural resources, ensuring the quality of public utility services in the environmental sector would contribute to improving the quality of life. A specific objective of the programme is dedicated exclusively to the waste sector: improving water management and waste and air quality management systems. The objective is to manage wastewater in a way that reduces environmental pollution, with attention also devoted to preventing waste generation from other economic activities, so that the volumes of waste from production and other economic activities do not grow or at least grow much slower (twice as slow) than production. The aim is to recycle or reuse as much waste as possible and to encourage the use of technologies and production methods that reduce the use of natural resources and/or prevent waste.  The Industrial Development Programme emphasises the need to encourage companies to jointly implement the principles of industrial symbiosis in the region, which enable saving of raw materials and waste reduction. It is estimated that, as a result of these measures, the proportion of recycled or otherwise utilised waste from manufacturing and other economic activities (apart from phosphogypsum waste) is likely to increase from 90 per cent in 2012 to 92 per cent in 2020.  The Waste Management Plan identifies opportunities and threats related to waste management in Lithuania, stressing that the implementation of waste prevention measures at national level will reduce waste generation and the quantities of unused waste, rationalise the use of natural resources and materials, and reduce the risk of negative impacts of waste on public health and the environment. The order of waste prevention and management priorities is applied taking into account the general environmental protection principles of caution, sustainability, technical feasibility and economic viability, protection of resources as                                                            55Indicative funding requirement. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 81   well as the overall environmental impacts.  One of the objectives of the Waste Management Plan 20142020 is to reduce GHG in the waste sector By 2020, the reuse and recycling of waste such as paper, metal, plastic and glass from households and from other sources with similar waste streams should be increased to a minimum of 50% of the total waste quantity. Recycling and other recovery of municipal waste should increase to at least 65% of the total amount of municipal waste. By 2020, municipal biodegradable waste disposed of in landfills should make up no more than 35% of municipal biodegradable waste generated in 2000. This Plan is scheduled to be updated in the middle of 2020 to cover the 2021--2027 period.  An equally important aspect of reducing GHG emissions in the waste sector is waste prevention. The plan sets a target of a quantity of municipal waste per capita not exceeding the European Union average and a quantity of production waste per GDP unit.  The National Waste Prevention Programme covers all waste streams, but priority is given to reducing the generation of packaging, waste electrical and electronic equipment, biodegradable waste, hazardous waste and construction waste. It is the said priority waste streams that have the greatest negative impact on the environment and public health and/or generate significant quantities compared to other waste streams.  The implementation of the National Waste Prevention Programme will reduce the growth of waste generation, negative impacts of waste on the environment and public health, the presence of harmful substances in materials and products etc., and the implementation of the measures foreseen in the Action Plan will also achieve the main objective of reducing the growth of waste generation and unused waste, rational use of natural resources and materials, and reducing the risk of negative impacts of waste on public health and the environment. It should be noted that the waste sector is currently undergoing a number of changes designed to reduce its negative environmental effects. Until now, most of the waste has been disposed in landfills, but various measures are being implemented which should contribute to the reduction of the quantities landfilled waste.

The bulk of the investment is directed towards waste reduction and sorting prevention. The total financial requirement of the sector amounts to EUR 5.1 million, of which EUR 4.9 million will come from public funding. The public portfolio will mainly consist of funds from the EU Structural Funds 2021-2027 and the Waste Management Programme.   The sector of land use, land use change and forestry  The Lithuanian progress strategy 'Lithuania and it must be important for Lithuanians to preserve and develop natural heritage and to use resources wisely. Initiatives for fundamental change in the area of the smart economy aim at ensuring the stability of ecosystems and protecting biodiversity through sustainable development of forestry.  The National Strategy for Sustainable Development examines the possibilities of afforestation of more fertile soils in the LULUCF sector, identifies the need to use economic and administrative measures to ensure successful recultivation of used up quarries and peat bogs and maintenance of abandoned old farm buildings and provides for the possibility of creating conditions for landscape protection, management, use and planning by drawing up a national landscape management plan. Spontaneous renaturalisation and a targeted increase of the Lithuanian forest area as well as other perennial vegetation areas, rational development of protected areas and the nature framework, as well as their integration into the international ecological networks will help to protect landscape and biodiversity, slow down processes of soil erosion and strengthen ecological stability of territories. According to the mission, implementation of the Lithuanian Programme for Forest Area Expansion will not only facilitate the use of unproductive farmland, but also supplement the missing elements of the nature frame, and, upon establishment of the necessary links, to facilitate the integration of the Lithuanian system of protected territories into the European ecological networks.  The National Forest Sector Development Programme 20122020 aims to increase forest cover to 34.2% of the territory by 2020 through afforestation of uncultivated land and financial incentives for reforestation activities. During the period covered by the Lithuanian Rural Development Programme, i.e. 2007-2013, 17 200 ha were afforested and 8400 ha were afforested in 20142016. The draft National Programme for the Development of the Forestry Sector 20212030, which is due to be drawn up by the end of 2020, will aim to promote sustainable forest management and increase the absorption potential of the LULUCF sector.  The objective of the Landholding Programme is to improve the structure of agricultural holdings and to reduce the areas of abandoned land. Measures have been put in place to achieve that objective: restoration of productive abandoned land to good agricultural condition, including land reclamation work (assessment criterion:90 ha of restored farmland in 2020); preparation of low-productivity areas not suitable for agricultural activity for afforestation, including nature frame formation, and creation of an ecologically stable landscape.                                                            56 Indicative funding requirement. 3.

Strategies, plans and measures for adaptation to climate change In Lithuania, the most climate sensitive sectors are agriculture, public health, energy, industrial, transport and communication infrastructure, forestry, ecosystems, biodiversity, landscape and water resources and the coastal area; urbanised areas are important. Successful adaptation to climate change requires not only the contribution of the state, but also the initiative of municipalities and residents and cooperation with scientists. There is a need to raise awareness of emerging threats among residents, farmers and entrepreneurs and to promote preventive protection against the damage caused by climate change.  It is important to coordinate disaster risk, emergency and natural phenomena management, prevention, warning systems and rescue actions under the United Nations Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and climate change adaptation measures. The impact of climate change is often felt not only at national level but also locally, and the contribution of municipal authorities to the fight against climate change is therefore necessary and essential. Climate phenomena can affect individual regions differently, so municipalities have to come up with the most appropriate response to the challenges they face. If climate change poses a threat to the region as a whole, the neighbouring municipal administrations can, in cooperation with each other, find an optimal way to mobilise available resources and address the negative consequences. At municipal level, it is easier to build close communities where good examples of climate 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 94   change mitigation or adaptation can be shared and promoted. The targets and objectives of climate change adaptation entail the avoidance of threats, dangers and risk factors identified in the National Security Strategy and contribute to the implementation of the priorities and objectives of the national security policy.  The National Strategy for the Climate Change Management Policy 20132050 is currently being developed. This is an integrated Strategy, which covers both adaptation to climate change and climate change mitigation policies. The strategic objective of the Lithuanian policy for the adaptation to environmental ecosystems and national economy and to strengthen the capacity to adapt through the introduction of measures, cost-effective reduction of risks and damage, the preservation and improvement of resilience to climate change, in order to ensure the creation of favourable conditions for the sustainable development of public life and economic activities.  The strategic objective will be implemented through adaptation measures in climate change- sensitive sectors (agriculture, energy, transport, industry, forestry, ecosystems and biodiversity, landscape, public health, water resources and the coastal zone, urbanised areas, etc.). The strategic objective will be pursued along the main pathways:   Regional cooperation in implementing adaptation measures in specific areas. Possible ways of reconciling the different interests of the regions, making efficient use of available resources and thus achieving an optimal choice of instruments are sought.   Compatibility and synergy of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. Innovative solutions to the challenges ahead can offer significant economic opportunities in terms of technological development and new environmental products and services, which can help to improve the quality of life.   To promote RDI and strengthen the knowledge base on climate change impacts, vulnerabilities and climate change adaptation capacity. State and municipal institutions must promote cooperation among scientific, business and financial institutions in order to provide the most cost-effective solutions minimising risk and damage;   Gathering knowledge and sharing of good practices and examples on climate change phenomena and damage caused by them. Research and systematic monitoring, data collection, modelling of scenarios and forecasting of climate change effects in Lithuania should be carried out on an ongoing basis. This information should be easily accessible to interested parties and to the implementers of the measures;   The role of local authorities and the local community in the planning and implementation of climate change adaptation measures is important, as it enables the territory concerned to adapt better to the natural, social or other characteristics of that region and to find optimal measures.  Short-term targets and objectives for climate change adaptation in the sectors most sensitive to climate change:   The target in agriculture is to improve the resilience of the agricultural sector to climate change.   The goal of forestry, ecosystems, biodiversity and landscape protection is to preserve and enhance 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 95   the sustainability of natural ecosystems and the value of ecosystem services.   In the public health sector to goal is to reduce the negative effects of climate change on human health.   The objective of protecting water resources and the coastal zone is to reduce the effects of rising water levels and natural disasters on the quality of surface water, groundwater and the Baltic Sea.   In the energy, transport and industrial sectors, the goal is to improve engineering infrastructure resistance to threats posed by climate change.  Short-term cross-sectoral targets for climate change adaptation:  In urban areas the objective is to carry out sustainable planning of small town and urban areas and spaces based on a nature-based approach and solutions.  The objective in the area of emergency and natural disaster management is to ensure coordination between state and municipal authorities responsible for planning disaster risk, emergency and natural phenomena management, prevention, warning systems and rescue actions and climate adaptation measures.  In the area of collection and dissemination of data and information, the objective is continuous monitoring and assessment of risks, sensitivity and adaptability in individual sectors of the economy, forecasting and modelling of climate change scenarios on the Lithuanian territory and in individual regions. The indicative medium-term (until 2040) and long-term (until 2050) objectives for climate change adaptation are to further monitor and study the vulnerability of the country's ecosystems and economy, to strengthen the capacity to adapt, to plan measures, to minimise risks and damage effectively, and to maintain and enhance resilience to climate change. The main tasks for the achievement of the set objective are as follows:   To ensure coordination of the planning of disaster risk management, emergency and natural phenomena management, prevention, warning systems, rescue and climate change adaptation measures.   To promote cooperation with international organisations and other countries in the fields of climate change adaptation, loss and damage, emergency and natural phenomena management.  The Lithuanian National Risk Analysis updated in 2018 provides an assessment of risk factors with the greatest impact and likelihood. The following phenomena have been identified as posing a very high risk to Lithuania:   natural, catastrophic and meteorological phenomena (catastrophic effects on the operation of the transport system);  epizootics (African swine fever) (very significant impact on property and environment);  flooding (very significant impact on property and the environment and on the functioning of the transport system);  epidemics and/or pandemics (very significant impact on human life and health and provision of health care services);  major industrial accident (catastrophic effects on human life and health).  Of the said five factors, at least two can be directly linked to climate change. Drought, forest and peat fires, 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 96   which can also be linked to climate change, are also among the factors of lesser impact but of high and very high probability.   Table 3.1.1.11.

POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 111     Electricity sector The development of RES in the electricity sector aimed at a 45% RES share by 2030 is based on the following principles:   Gradual integration of renewable energy sources into the market: the most cost-effective technologies must be developed, taking into account technology maturity and considering the trends in their near future development.  Affordability and transparency: the renewable energy promotion scheme must be designed based on market principle, with a minimum market distortion and ensuring a minimum financial burden on energy users as well as clarity and a non-discriminatory competitive environment;  Active participation of energy consumers: with the increasing share of renewable energy sources in the total energy balance, it is necessary to promote decentralized electricity generation, enable consumers to use energy from renewable energy sources for their own needs and receive market-based compensation for the surplus energy supplied to the grid; it is also necessary to introduce solutions to manage consumer behaviour and energy demand and supply. In order to achieve the RES objectives, measures have already been adopted to increase the share of RES in the electricity sector (Table 3.1.2.1).  Table 3.1.2.1.

Support scheme for electricity produced from RES 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 112   Although RES technologies are constantly improving and equipment costs are declining, power generated from RES in the new installations is not yet able to compete in the market, so energy generation from RES is being incentivised and this will continue up to a limit that is economically and technically acceptable for the country, with a view to active participation of producers of RES-E at market conditions, or until the production of RES-E reaches the market price. Currently Lithuania has approved a support scheme58 covering the following support measures:  A price premium for RES-E;  Priority transmission of RES-E;  Exemption of electricity producers operating a power plant with a capacity below 500 kW from responsibility for balancing the produced electricity and/or capacity during the incentive period. The specified incentives are only applicable where a producer participates in a technology-neutral auction and, if successful, offers the lowest price premium. The winner of the auction enjoys support measures for a period of 12 years, and the price premium offered by it, or a part thereof, is paid as follows: 1) The price premium won at the auction, where the sum of the next day's hourly price on the exchange and the price premium won at the auction is lower than or equal to the maximum price set by the VERT; 2) A portion of the price premium won at the auction, calculated as the difference between the maximum price set by tpremium won at the auction exceeds the maximum price set by the VERT. The producer will not receive the price premium won at the auction in the following cases:  If the next day's hourly price on the exchange is higher than or equal to the highest price;  If the next day's hourly price on the exchange is less than or equal to zero for 6 hours or longer;  If the producer actually generates the amount of electricity allocated in the auction. The producer who has won the auction undertakes to produce the amount of electricity offered at the auction for a period of 12 years. The first auction to meet the 2030 target began on 2 September 201959, distributing 0.3 TWh of electricity. The auction is scheduled to end in 2020. March. Given the construction time of the power plants, which may take more than 3 years, the auction results are expected to be visible in 2023. Considering the 2025 electricity generation target of at least 5 TWh of electricity from RES, the amount of electricity produced from RES in 2018, which was 2.2 TWh, the 0.3 TWh amount to be auctioned during the auction launched on 2 September 2019, also taking into account the climatic conditions and the development of electricity consumers, the Lithuanian Government approved an timetable for 2020-2022, setting out the dates of the auction notice and the planned amounts of RES-E to be distributed, which will be subject to the following support measures:   Table 3.1.2.2. 2020-2022 auction timetable                                                            58 http://enmin.lrv.lt/en/sectoral-policy/renewable-energy-sources/auctions 59 https://www.vert.lt/en/Pages/Auctions.aspx 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 113   Opening of the auction Annual quantity of electricity produced from RES to be auctioned 29 May 2020 0.7 TWh 5 April 2021 0.7 TWh 19 April 2022 0.7 TWh The auctions will be organized according to an approved timetable until the interim 2025 target of 5 TWh of RES-E annually is attained. In the event that 2025 the target is reached before 2025, with power plants being constructed without support, auctioning will be halted and the need for continued support will be assessed. In order to determine the effectiveness of the support scheme applicable in Lithuania and the continued need for it, the Government-authorized institution performs a technological, economic and social evaluation of RES technology development and the support scheme at least every 5 years, taking into account the possible impact of a modification to the support scheme. Based on this assessment and taking into account the objectives set by the NEIS in the field of RES and the actual amount of electricity from RES, make a decision on the further development of RES within the established support scheme. AEI2. Financial support for prosumers. Promoting active participation of electricity consumers in the market, a scheme for generating electricity was created in 2015. The target for 2030 is to have 30% of the producing consumers compared to the total number of electricity consumers. In order to ensure that the electricity generating scheme is available to all electricity consumers, the acquisition of the power plant is funded from European Union Structural Funds and the National Climate Change Program. As of 2019, prosumers received EUR 323 per kW  in support. In total, it is planned to invest more than EUR 16 million from EU funds by 2023, with four invitations being planned during this period.  AEI3. To implement projects for co-generation plants using local and renewable sources of energy, with priority given to Vilnius and Kaunas. In December 2016, the Vilnius cogeneration plant received a loan of EUR 190 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB), backed by the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), a key element of the Investment Plan for Europe. The Vilnius cogeneration unit will produce about 0.3 TWh of electricity. The total electrical capacity of the power plant will be about 92 MW . The boiler will only use municipal waste left over from sorting and not suitable for recycling. The other two biofuel boilers, with a capacity of about 3 times that of the waste boiler, will use biofuels.  No support was granted to the Kaunas cogeneration plant. A high-efficiency waste-fired cogeneration power plant with electrical capacity of around 26 MW  will be built. Municipal waste remaining after sorting and not suitable for recycling, non-hazardous industrial waste and sludge from water treatment plants will be used. Such a capacity will allow electricity generation of around 175 GWh per year. At the same time, in view of the ambitious RES-E targets for 2030, new measures are planned (Table 3.1.2.3.).

Financial support for investment in low-capacity power plants Preparations are underway for investment in individual low-capacity power plants, with priority being given to power plants built by renewable energy communities. Support will be granted through a tendering procedure from the revenues generated by implementing the agreements on statistical energy transfers between Lithuania and Luxembourg and/or other Member States. The first tendering procedure is expected to take place in 2020.  AEI5. Development of RES-E in the Baltic Sea. Studies were launched in November 2018 to assess the development and operation of power plants using RES in the Baltic Sea and to determine the installed capacities of these plants. After carrying out the studies and taking into account the ensured adequacy of the Lithuanian electricity system, the synchronisation of the Lithuanian electricity system with the European electricity system and the results of the cost-benefit analysis, a decision will be taken by 2021 on the parts of the Baltic Sea where it is appropriate to organise a tender for the development and operation of RES and the installed capacity of these power plants. The Government should adopt the Procedure for organising                                                            60 The newly installed power may vary depending on the Government's decision on the development of RES at sea. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 115   tenders and issuing permits by February 2021. Construction of power plants in the Baltic Sea can only be carried out after winning a tender granting access to such activities. A tendering procedure for the development and operation permit should be organised by early 2022. The successful tenderer must obtain the construction permit within 3 years of the date of receipt of the development and operation permit and must obtain the permit to generate electricity within 6 years from the date of receipt of the development and operation permit. Taking into account the duration of tendering procedures and the construction of the power plants, electricity generation is expected to begin after 2028. In order to connect the planned wind farm in the Baltic Sea to the transmission network, a 330 kV substation should be built at sea, a new cable -- AEI6. Industrial deployment of renewable energy sources. Installation of capacity for energy generation from renewable energy sources and development of new technologies for a more effective use of renewables and introduction thereof in industrial enterprises in order to use energy for the internal needs of the enterprises and to enable the supply of excess energy to other industrial enterprises or its transfer to centralised energy networks. The measure was financed during the period 20142020 from European Union funds (Renewable energy sources for industry LT+) and it is expected to continue in the next funding period, focusing on micro, small, medium and large industrial enterprises. The amount of funding for a project depends on the size of the company and the manner in which eligible costs are determined:  80% of eligible expenditure for micro and small companies;   60% of the eligible costs for a large company (intensity determined in accordance with the provisions of the EU Block Exemption Regulation). In view of the ambitious objectives in the field of RES, it is important to ensure the existence of this instrument also in the 20212027 financing period. It is planned that 70% of this measure will be allocated to the development of RES in the electricity sector and the remaining 30% will go to the heat sector. AEI7. Use of RES in public and residential buildings. The Climate Change Programme provides financial incentives for the use of renewable energy sources (sun, wind, geothermal energy, biofuel, etc.) in public and residential buildings (for different social groups). AEI8. Financing of energy generation from RES and storage solutions. In view of the ambitious objectives in the field of RES, it is planned to promote the use of RES by granting EU support in 20212027. EU support will be granted to the installation of low-power plants generating electricity from renewable sources which belong to prosumers, energy communities, businesses or individual energy consumers. The need for EU support funds, possible measures in this area of activity, the need for funds and the expected results are currently being assessed. AEI9. Integration of RES into transmission and distribution networks. The target is a 45% share of RES in the electricity consumption. The total power increase of RES between 2021 and 2030 is expected to be 1,944.5 MW . Such an increase will require measures to integrate new producers safely and reliably into electricity transmission and distribution networks. It is estimated that seven 110 kV substations and three 330 kV substations would need to be built to connect these RES capacities to the transmission network; it is also estimated that reconstruction of distribution networks and the introduction of new technologies to ensure voltage quality (controlled transformers and voltage regulators) would be required. Additional support measures contributing to the development of RES-E:  RES-E exemption from the excise duty. Electricity produced from RES is exempt from the excise duty. This provision applies to both electricity produced in Lithuania and imported electricity. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 116    Guarantees of origin for RES-E. Guarantees of origin are issued to RES-E producers. Guarantees of origin are also be issued to RES-E producers who have won the auction and receive the electricity price premium.  RES purchase and sale contracts. RES producers are allowed to sell electricity to final customers under contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity from renewable sources without holding the licence of an independent electricity supplier. Such producers will still have to comply with the requirements for an independent electricity supplier.  Alternative policy measures for RES in the electricity sector. These measures have been additionally included in the National Plan, in line with the proposals received during the public consultation. Their effect is not taken into account in the calculations in part B, but these measures will be considered as an alternative to the elements of the PPM scenario in order to ensure at least the same effect on the achievement of the national targets prior to approval thereof in the legislation (see Section 3  for more details). Alternative policy measures: 1. To assess the regulatory conditions for the generation and consumption of non-subsidised electricity; 2. To amend legislation by obliging municipalities and public bodies to purchase only green electricity from 2022 onwards (certified by certificates of origin).  Funding of planned measures in the RES-E sector61. Most of the investments related to the use of renewable energy sources in the electricity sector are intended to develop RES capacity and to prepare the grid for the integration of large quantities of RES. Only a small part of the funds is intended to cover the costs of electricity generation. The total financial requirement of the sector amounts to approximately EUR 1,870 million, of which EUR 1,167 million will come from public funding and EUR 703 million from private funding. The public portfolio will mainly consist of 20212027 EU Structural Funds, revenue from services provided in the public interest (SPI funds), the electricity tariff, revenue from statistical transfers, and the Modernisation Fund.  Transport sector Development of RES in the transport sector aimed at a 15% RES share by 2030 is based on the following principles:   Competitiveness: ensuring a diversified supply of petroleum products and alternatives and effective competition between market players;  Integration (transformation): integration of alternative fuels by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels, increasing energy efficiency and reducing pollution.  The RES-T objectives are pursued by reference to the energy content of transport fuels, without applying the multipliers laid down in Directive 2018/2001.  In order to achieve the RES objectives, measures have already been adopted (Table 3.1.2.4) to increase the share of RES in the transport sector.  Table 3.1.2.4.

Mandatory blending of biofuels into mineral fuels The share of biofuels in final energy consumption in transport: 5.9% in 2030; of which biodiesel 5.67% (137.7 ktoe) and bioethanol 0.23% (5.58 ktoe) From 2011 Ministry of Energy, fuel suppliers AEI11. Excise duty concession for biofuels Share of biofuels produced from food and feed crops in final energy consumption in transport: 7% From 2010 Ministry of Finance  AEI10. Mandatory blending of biofuels into mineral fuels. Fuel sales points must sell the following fuels meeting the Lithuanian or European standards:  petrol containing a minimum of 10% of biofuel (blending into A98 petrol is optional);  diesel containing at least 7% of biofuel (from 10 April to 10 November);  Arctic diesel grades 1 and 2 may contain no biofuels during the winter period;  in the transitional periods (1020 November and March 10 to April 10), diesel must contain at least 5% of biofuels (with a tolerance of -0.5%).  AEI11. Excise duty concession for biofuels. Biofuel and fuel blends complying with the requirements laid down in the Law on Excise Duty and the standards EN 14214 and CEN/TS 15293 adopted by the European Committee for Standardization are subject to an excise duty rate reduced in proportion to the percentage of impurities of biological origin in the biofuel and fuel blend.  Additional support measures contributing to the development of RES-T. Guarantees of origin for gases produced from RES. The guarantee of origin is issued at the request of a producer of gas from RES per unit of energy (1 MW h). The guarantee of origin must be used within 12 months of the date of generation of the corresponding unit, otherwise it becomes invalid. The system of guarantees of origin for biogas allows identification, registration and monitoring of the origin of the gas produced, and enables gas producers and consumers to know whether the gas they produce and consume is produced using RES.  New measures are also planned in view of the ambitious RES-T targets (Table 3.1.2.5).                                                                 62The RES-T objectives are pursued by reference to the energy content of transport fuels, without applying the multipliers laid down in Directive 2018/2001. 3.

POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 119   AEI16. Obligation imposed on operators of natural gas stations, supplying gas for direct consumption in transport. Obligation covering the supply of biomethane gas, estimated at 92.7 million cubic meters of gas. 2024-2030 Ministry of Energy National Energy Regulatory Council  AEI12. Support for operating costs of generation II biodiesel through mandatory blending. Reducing the operating costs of producers and ensuring the competitiveness of the product on the market is expected to result in additional quantities of generation II biodiesel. Half of all biodiesel consumption in 2030 would come from generation II feedstock. Different tariff measures would be applied to compensate producers for the price difference of generation II biodiesel. The price of the measure was calculated on the basis of a subsidy of EUR 0.55 per litre. AEI13. Support for financing generation II bioethanol production facilities. Promotion of generation II bioethanol production in Lithuania could lead to a share of generation II bioethanol in the fuel mix, estimated at 6.45 ktoe. It is assumed that, with the help of the incentive, facilities for the production of generation II liquid biofuels from straw, which currently has the highest potential, will be installed. AEI14. Investment support for biomethane plant facilities Biomethane gas production facilities, including biogas treatment facilities, would be financed. In order to meet the domestic demand, new production capacities are necessary by 2030 to ensure the production of 81.5 ktoe of biomethane gas per year. A one-off subsidy for production facilities could amount to a 73% intensity. AEI15. Support for the purchase of public, utility or other commercial vehicles fuelled by compressed natural and/or biomethane gas. In order to ensure that the biomethane gas output (81.5 ktoe) is consumed in the transport sector, purchasing of gas-fuelled public transport vehicles is encouraged. The measure proposes respective amendments to the public procurement legislation, requiring that municipalities, when purchasing public transport services, should stipulate that the service provider must carry passengers using buses adapted to run on biomethane gas. The measure would compensate for the price difference between vehicles running on natural gas and those running on liquid fuel. AEI16. Obligation imposed on operators of natural gas stations, supplying gas for direct consumption in transport. In order to ensure parallel demand for and supply of biomethane gas, and given the projected increase in natural gas consumption in the transport sector, suppliers of natural gas for direct consumption in the transport sector would be obliged to supply a fixed amount of gas from renewable energy sources. The intensity of the obligation would be measured in terms of the quantity and price of biomethane on the market.  Alternative policy measures in the transport sector: These measures have been additionally included in the National Plan, in line with the proposals received during the public consultation. Their effect is not taken into account in the calculations in part B, but these measures will be considered as an alternative to the elements of the PPM scenario in order to ensure at least the same effect on the achievement of the national targets prior to approval thereof in the legislation (see Section 3  for more details). Alternative policy measures: 1. Gradual increase of obligations for fuel suppliers. When supplying fuel to final consumers, fuel suppliers must ensure that biofuels make up an appropriate proportion in the fuel supplied. A gradual increase in biofuel blending obligations is foreseen in order to achieve a share of 15% of 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 120   renewable energy sources in the transport sector in 2030. Without prejudice to fuel quality requirements, the aim will be to increase the quantity of first-generation biofuels in total fuel consumption in terms of energy value, but within the 7% limit for biofuels made from raw materials for food set by the Law on Energy from Renewable Sources. In addition, a fixed proportion of fuel supplied by fuel suppliers will have to consist of advanced (generation II) biofuels starting in 2022 and this obligation will be gradually increased until 2030 to a minimum of 3.5% set in Directive 2018/2001. 2.  Reorientation of biogas power plants for biomethane gas production. Currently Lithuania only has biogas production facilities intended for electricity and heat production, and in order to maximise the potential of biogas, re-orientation of biogas use for electricity and heat production towards biogas treatment and supply to natural gas networks will be proposed. Such a measure would allow the fastest possible deployment of existing infrastructure and the expected emergence of biomethane gas on the Lithuanian market in 2022. The measure would consist of investment support for the construction and installation of biogas treatment plants in the already existing biogas plants. 3.  Revision of the quality requirements for natural gas in the context of biomethane gas supply to networks. In order to facilitate the connection of biomethane gas producers to natural gas networks, the need for minimum adjustments to the current natural gas quality requirements applicable to the producers and suppliers of natural gas and biogas will be assessed. Taking into account the aspects of biomethane gas production and cleaning, the aim is to avoid any additional barriers for producers in connecting to natural gas networks and making efficient use of the production capacity, but first of all, it is necessary to assess the impact on consumers, economic operators and international standards. Changes to the qualitative requirements must not disrupt the activities of household customers, economic operators using gas in their production processes or the transboundary transfer of gas. Financing of planned RES measures in the transport sector64. The sector's investments focus on the development of infrastructure for the production of biomethane and alternative fuels, the partial reimbursement of the costs of production of alternative fuels for producers and the promotion of the acquisition of vehicles fuelled by biomethane. The total funding requirement of the sector amounts to EUR 385 million, of which EUR 1,167 million will come from public funding. Available sources of public funds: 20212027 EU Structural Funds, State and municipal budgets, and the Climate Change Programme. Heat and cooling sector Individual households mainly use the cheapest heating fuel on the market, i.e. biomass. Development of RES in the heating and cooling sector with a view to a 90% RES share in district heating and domestic heat production by 2030 is based on the following principles:  Transparency: to ensure that heat supply activities are managed in an efficient, transparent and non-discriminatory manner between the operators in the heat economy market and its users, including the purchase of energy resources in the most transparent and competitive manner, at the lowest cost to the final consumer;  Competitiveness: rational use of the investments needed to ensure the reliable supply of environment-friendly heat to consumers at an affordable price, ensuring the ability of district heating to compete with alternative means of heat supply;  Efficiency: establishment of regulatory principles to encourage the introduction of technical and                                                            64Indicative funding requirement. 3.

In Lithuania, biofuels are already used in most municipalities. In 2017, RES already accounted for 68.7% of district heating and more than 46% of total heating and cooling. Coal and gas oils are still used in some municipalities. The measure is designed to convert their heating sectors for RES. AEI27. To promote the use of RES in district heating (using solar technologies, heat pumps and/or heat storage). Heat pumps are already used in other countries and have proved their worth in terms of energy efficiency. As the period is 20212030, there is no technology-specific focus. Implementation of the most cost-effective solution will be supported. AEI28. To promote the use of heat from waste generated by industry, the waste sector or due to cooling energy in district heating. This heat is generated by chemical processes in the production companies in any case, so considering that in theory its potential in Lithuania is about 3 TWh per year, it is planned to use part of it in the district heating sector. Full utilisation is not possible as part of the industrial facilities are located in areas too far away from heat consumers. The priority in the heat sector is collection, storage and efficient use of energy from the environment and waste energy emitted into the air by power plants, industrial installations and buildings. Waste heat from thermal power stations can be used to heat buildings. AEI20. To carry out the assessment of the current situation and future developments in the supply of heat in the decentralised sector and to create a favourable regulatory environment for gradual transition of individually heated households (dwellings) to clean and low greenhouse gas emission technologies or their entry into the DH system A study has been completed and appropriate legislation has been adopted. AEI21. Existing requirements for reserve heat generation capacity and for fuel reserves have been reviewed. Heat suppliers using natural gas who pay the natural gas security component will not be required to store reserve fuel. The security component already ensures security of supply. AEI23. To upgrade and/or modernise the heat transmission network and its installations/elements. Worn out heat transmission networks have been upgraded and modernised. AEI25. To perform a general inventory of household/home heating installations. To inventory equipment used for heating households. AEI29. Modernisation of the heat metering system. The EU Internal Market Directive (2009/72/EC) and its revised version (2016/0380(COD)) require all heat meters to be replaced by remote sensing by 2027 in case of a positive cost-benefit analysis.  Planned (enabling) policy measures in the heat sector:  establishment of a regulatory environment conducive to attracting investment and providing a non-discriminatory environment for all players in the district heating market;  promoting transparency and competition in the biofuels market, ensuring a low level of market concentration;  ensuring an optimum and sustainable balance between domestic production of biofuels and imports of biofuels from third countries , which allows a high level of competition and low market concentration in the long term;  promotion of the use of environmentally and sustainably produced and supplied biofuels (use of certificates confirming best forest management practices for biofuel origin guarantees, ensuring product quality and sustainability throughout the biofuel production and supply chain);  promotion of district heating in buildings, giving priority to urbanised areas in order to reduce air pollution;  assessment of the current situation and the prospective evolution of heat supply in the decentralised 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 126   sector, with rational development trends, taking into account changes in heat production technologies that increase the efficiency of heat production and consumption;  assessment of the current situation in the cooling energy sector, performance of a prospective analysis and establishment of guidelines for the most rational solutions for cooling energy provision;  feasibility assessment and, where economically justified, introduction of waste heat collection and use technologies, technologies using solar and heat energy, heat pumps, low-temperature heating and heat storage facilities for district heating;  rational development of high-efficiency cogeneration plants to increase the availability of local electricity generation;  timely upgrading of existing (or construction of new) biofuel combustion plants or cogeneration plants, existing heat transmission installations and their systems, heating stations in buildings, and heating and hot water systems;  Other specific measures are used to ensure the development of the RES, facilitating the development processes of the RES, reducing the administrative burden and promoting active energy consumers.  Alternative policy measures in the heat sector: These measures have been additionally included in the National Plan, in line with the proposals received during the public consultation. Their effect is not taken into account in the calculations in part B, but these measures will be considered as an alternative to the elements of the PPM scenario in order to ensure at least the same effect on the achievement of the national targets prior to approval thereof in the legislation (see Section 3  for more details). Alternative policy measures: 1. To gradually limit and attempt to fully eliminate the consumption of coal and petroleum products in the heat sector by 2030 through economic and legal measures. 2. From 2022, to restrict the connection of newly built (planned) buildings to natural gas networks and the possibility of heating with other fossil fuels in the areas of DH networks by amending the Lithuanian Law on the Heat Sector accordingly by the beginning of 2021. 3. To establish a green heat certification and guarantee of origin system by the end of 2020. 4. To amend legislation by obliging municipalities and public bodies to purchase only green heat from 2022 onwards (certified by certificates of origin). Funding of planned RES measures in the heat sector65. The sector's investments are intended for the modernisation and development of heat generation and transmission infrastructure. The largest portion of investments will be allocated for the development of generation capacity from RES and only a relatively small portion for the modernisation of heat transmission infrastructure. The total financial requirement of the sector amounts to EUR 570 million, of which EUR 382 million will come from public funding and EUR 188 million from private funding. Available sources of public funds: EU Structural Funds 2021-2027, the heat tariff, the Climate Change Programme and the Life Programme.  General/specific measures to promote RES development: Point of contact Legislative amendments are being made obliging public institution Lithuanian Energy Agency to advise and provide methodological assistance to potential operators in the electricity sector on all issues related to the establishment and construction of power plants using RES, i.e. to assist in the entire process related to the type of operations in the electricity sector (production, production and consumption, electricity prosumer                                                            65Indicative funding requirement. 3.

Simplification of administrative procedures Potential electricity prosumers and persons wishing to produce electricity for their own use and for the needs of the household, without supplying electricity to the grid, enjoy simplified procedures for the installation of power plants up to 30 kW. Such persons are not required to apply for the authorisation to develop electricity capacity or for the electricity generation permit. They may start operations by informing the electricity network operator.   Organisation of information provision and training State and municipal authorities, bodies and undertakings have the obligation, within the limits of their competence, to prepare, deliver and make public information on the procedures for issuing permits, licences or certificates, the procedures for examining certification applications, assistance to applicants and support schemes. Within their remit, ministries are responsible for developing and implementing appropriate public information and awareness-raising campaigns, providing advice, and developing educational programmes on the practical uses and benefits of developing and using RES. Exchange of experience in the use of RES between public authorities, bodies, undertakings, organisations and private entities are organised and examples of good practices are publicised. The general programmes for formal education include knowledge and skills in the field of RES use, benefits and technological solutions. Research, education of the public, training for civil servants and vocational training in the field of RES are being promoted. The use of pilot projects is encouraged.  Information on support measures, legal information, organisations, statistics and other information related to the development and use of RES is published on the website www.avei.lt.  Information on the issuance of certificates for operation of energy installations and on certificate holders is available at https://vei.lrv.lt/lt/veiklos-sritys/energetikos-irenginiu-eksploatavimo-veiklos- atestatu-isdavimas-1.  Education programmes on the benefits and practical possibilities of using RES are included in the curricula of Lithuanian general education schools as well as Lithuanian universities and non-university higher education institutions.  Contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity from RES The legislation lays down the general principle that producers may sell electricity to final customers under contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity from renewable sources. A study is currently planned to identify the minimum requirements applicable to contracting parties; legal, administrative and regulatory obstacles to the conclusion of such contracts; and recommendations for removing these obstacles and creating of more favourable conditions. The study is expected to be completed in the first half of 2020.   Prosumers (use of energy from RES)  Electricity prosumers. Natural and legal persons planning to produce electricity in solar, wind and biomass power plants with an installed capacity of not more than 500 kW  can become the producing consumers. Prosumers are hem and not consumed for their own or household use and in the electricity networks from April 1 of the current year to March 31 of the following year. The 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 128   m the electricity networks66. The amount of electricity supplied to the grid in excess of the electricity consumed by the prosumer during the storage period is not carried over to the next storage period. Prosumers may establish their own power plants or purchase them on the basis of bilateral contracts from third parties, thus making it possible for the occupants of multi-apartment buildings to become prosumers. Also, the power plant of the prosumer may be remote from the electricity consumption point. In this case, the power plant must be owned or managed by the prosumer. il 1 April 2040  Assessment of the established conditions will be carried out in accordance with Directive 2018/2001.   In order to promote the development of prosumers, the Prosumers Alliance, made up of representatives of RES business associations and consumer organizations, is being created.67 The aim of the Alliance is to promote small green energy focused on residents and business by promoting consumer education and awareness of green energy and the possibility of owning and generating electricity. In addition, all partners in the Alliance are expected to offer high-quality and competitive products and services. Yet another goal is to intensify cooperation in search of innovative solutions that would help to accelerate the development of small green energy in Lithuania.   Renewable energy communities (RES-E consumption) The Ministry of Energy together with the Office of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania carried out a public consultation to identify the main obstacles and drivers for establishing renewable energy communities. The main obstacles to the establishment of renewable energy communities were identified as:    it is difficult to create a community for multi-apartment buildings where apartment owners make unanimous decisions in the communities that unite them;  securing a bank loan;  protected areas;  complex legal requirements;  frequently changing legal framework;  lack of space in major cities to build power plants. The following stimulating factors were also identified:  closer cooperation by the distribution system operator;  application of incentives;  leadership by public administrations (consulting, practical examples);  assistance and coordination by public bodies.                                                            66 https://www.vert.lt/atsinaujinantys-istekliai/Puslapiai/elektros-energija-gaminanciu-vartotoju-naudojimosi-elektros-tinklais- paslaugu-kainos.aspx. 67 The founding documents of the Prosumers Alliance were signed by representatives of the Lithuanian Confederation of Industrialists, the Lithuanian Solar Energy Association, the National Energy Association of Lithuania and the Alliance of Lithuanian Consumer Organisations. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 129   More information on the results of the public consultation can be found here In the light of the observations received during this public consultation, the Law on Energy from Renewable Sources was amended and a scheme for renewable energy communities was created. A renewable energy community is defined as a legal status accorded to a public body which fulfils the specified criteria and which owns and develops installations for the production of energy from renewables in a defined area and has the right to use them to produce energy, to consume and store it in energy storage facilities and sell it. Participants in the renewable energy community may be natural persons, small or medium-sized businesses and/or municipalities, of which: 1) at least 51 per cent of the voting members or shareholders are natural persons whose place of residence is declared in the municipality in which the construction or installation of the power generating unit(s) is planned, or in the subdistricts of another municipality adjacent to this municipality; 2) each member or shareholder has a maximum of 20 percent of the voting rights in another energy company. Renewable energy communities are entitled to participate in the auctions without the obligation to produce and supply to the grids the total amount of electricity they have won in the auction. The communities may also carry out any activity in the energy sector subject to authorization. In order to facilitate the establishment of renewable energy communities, municipalities are obliged to evaluate and make public the locations where a renewable energy community's energy production facilities may be built or installed. Opportunities for facilitating the transfer of electricity within the renewable energy community are currently being assessed.   Regional cooperation In the field of RES, regional cooperation is focused in the field of electricity on issues such as opening of support, joint projects and a joint support scheme. Lithuania is also open for the statistical transfer of energy to other Member States or, if necessary, for statistical reception of energy from another Member State.  Statistical transfer. It is estimated that the measures specified will be sufficient to reach the target of 45% by 2030, so currently no energy surplus is projected hat Lithuania could transfer to other Member States. Lithuania already has experience in bilateral cooperation in transferring surpluses to other Member States: in October 2017 it became the first Member State to sign a cooperation agreement with Luxembourg on the transmission of statistics on renewable energy sources. Since Lithuania's share of RES will reach and exceed the target of 45% by 2030, it is ready to enter into agreements with other Member States on the statistical transfer of a specified amount of RES from the Republic of Lithuania to another country. Similarly, if the measures imposed are not sufficient to reach the 45% target by 2030, the Lithuanian Seimas may decide to accept a statistical amount of RES from another Member State. This transfer or acceptance may take place through the European Union renewable energy development platform.  Opening of support. Lithuania has opened its support scheme to other Member States. Another Member State may participate in the auctions organized in Lithuania that allocate an annual amount of electricity 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 130   generation and a price premium for electricity produced from renewable energy sources. The auctions organized in Lithuania are open to a Member State having a direct electrical link with the Republic of Lithuania, having concluded an agreement with the Republic of Lithuania and committed to allowing Lithuanian natural and/or legal persons and/or other organizations or their units intending to build or equip power plants in Lithuania to participate in the distribution of assistance organized in that Member State. In the case of an agreement with another Member State, the quantity to be auctioned is calculated on the basis of: the quantity of electricity imported during the preceding calendar year from the Member State seeking to participate in the auction; the share of RES in electricity production in the Member State wishing to participate in the auction in the previous calendar year; total final electricity consumption in the Republic of Lithuania in the previous calendar year; the planned annual volume of electricity generation to be auctioned as specified in the timetable. Joint projects and joint support scheme. Lithuania is open to agreements with other Member States on joint projects or joint support schemes.   Other elements of the dimension  Policies and measures affecting the EU ETS sector All the policies and measures listed in section 3.1.1. affect to some extent the operators of stationary installations and aircraft operators participating in the EU ETS. In 2018, 86 fixed installations and 1 aircraft operator carried out activities falling within the scope of the EU ETS in Lithuania. Most of these installations are small district heating units. However, this sector is covered by two measures P7. Promoting the substitution of polluting technologies with cementas.  In 2017, emissions from the EU ETS sectors in Lithuania amounted to 6.28 kt CO2 eq. EU-level mechanisms in the ETS sector, such as the Market Stability Reserve, and funds for innovation and modernisation will affect EU and Lithuanian operators in the ETS sector, encourage them to invest in modernising production by introducing new energy-efficient technologies or by switching to RES.  As the main measures in the ETS sector are a fuel switch from conventional (gas, oil etc.) to RES (biomass mostly), energy efficiency (building renovation and other) is affected by the targets and objectives set in the National Energy Independence Strategy (2018). Electricity savings in industry will amount to 1 TWh by 2030. Over the 10-year period, energy efficiency improvement measures will result in energy savings of 35 TWh and GHG emissions will be reduced to 1,144 kt CO2 eq. It is projected that the use of RES will increase by sector will be reduced in ktoe.  Policies and measures to achieve low emission mobility All the policies and measures listed in section 3.1.1. to some extent have an impact on the promotion of low-emission mobility. Measures T7, T8, T13, T14 and T29 and tax measures T21 and T22 contribute the most to that end.  Energy subsidies Lithuania will aim to reduce polluting and wasteful energy consumption by 2025, as well as tax incentives for fossil fuels that lead to market distortions. In total, thirteen energy subsidies have been identified in 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 131   Lithuania: 1. A reduced excise duty rate on heating gas oils; 2. A reduced rate of excise duty on coal, coke and lignite used for business purposes; 3. A reduced rate of excise duty on natural gas used as heating fuel for business use; 4. A reduced excise duty rate on marked diesel for agricultural use; 5. Excise duty exemption for petroleum gases and gaseous hydrocarbons for household use; 6. A reduced rate of excise duty on electricity used for business purposes; 7. Excise duty exemption for natural gas used for combined heat and power generation; 8. Excise duty exemption for electricity, if supplied to household customers and beneficiaries; 9. Excise duty exemption for natural gas supplied to household customers and beneficiaries; 10. Excise duty exemption for electricity produced from renewable energy sources; 11. Excise duty exemption for natural gas used as engine fuel; 12. Concessions for biofuels; 13. A reduced 9% VAT rate applied to the supply of heat for the purposes of heating dwellings and water supplied to dwellings.  It has been decided to phase out or reduce some of the above subsidies (see Table 3.1.3.1). Some of the subsidies, such as the exemption of natural gas supplied to household customers and beneficiaries from the excise duty, are essential for the well-being of the population. More detailed information on subsidies is provided in section 4.6.   Table 3.1.3.1.

POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 135   information on solutions  Household income and protection of vulnerable consumers The first step towards protecting vulnerable groups in society is to ensure social guarantees, including support. The main social guarantee for vulnerable consumers is social assistance in cash for deprived people who cannot afford to keep their homes adequately warm. The Ministry of Social Security and Labour is currently applying financial support measures to address energy poverty:   -supported income per person/family (in 2019, State-supported income was EUR 120). (EN1.)  If the owners of an apartment in a multi-apartment building are carrying out or have already carried out a project supported by the State and/or the municipality for the renovation/modernisation of a multi-apartment building, the apartment owners are fully reimbursed for the monthly loan and interest payments due during and outside the heating season over the repayment period specified in the loan contract (EN2.)  Drinking water costs and hot water costs are also reimbursed for deprived people: reimbursement of drinking water costs is granted when the costs exceed 2% of the income; reimbursement of hot water costs is granted when the costs exceed 5% of the income. (EN3.) Reimbursement of heating and water costs (hot, drinking) has been chosen because these services represent the largest share of a family's housing costs. The domestic heating costs reimbursement is granted irrespective of the type of heating, i.e. which type of fuel (wood, gas, etc.) is used to heat the dwelling. Reimbursement is available not only to those who have declared their place of residence in that housing unit but also to its tenants, thus ensuring that all persons in need of assistance can receive it. Additional legal safeguards for vulnerable customers (EN4.) cover cases where68 the supply or transmission of electricity to vulnerable customers cannot be restricted or discontinued, as well as more favourable debt repayment conditions. For example, failure by vulnerable customers to pay electricity bills may not result in discontinuation of supply if the amount owed to the distribution system operator or supplier by those vulnerable customers is or was equal to or less than 3 basic social benefits; nor may it be discontinued on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, public holidays or the day before a public holiday or when the average daily air temperature is below -15 °C or above +30 °C. There are plans to extend this measure by setting a higher air temperature threshold (EN7.) (For details see section 3.4.3. on market integration.)  Energy efficiency Over the last couple of decades, Lithuania has seen a significant difference between newly constructed energy efficient homes and the majority of households in old buildings. In old multi-apartment buildings, heat is distributed inefficiently and unevenly, and technical reasons prevent heat control in the apartments; the temperature on some floors (upper or lower) is below the minimum hygiene standards even during the                                                            68Law on Electricity of the Republic of Lithuania:  https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/TAIS.106350/asr?positionInSearchResults=17&searchModelUUID=d0be70a9-254d-4ec7-a183- 101f436cb116 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 136   heating season.  Energy efficiency can help alleviate energy poverty. Appropriate measures are divided into the following groups: improving the energy performance of buildings and equipment, and changes in consumer behaviour. it should be noted that the breakdown of the household indicator in Table 3.1.4.2 shows that energy poverty in Lithuania is a particularly serious problem for families living in urban areas. In addition, families living in apartments are particularly vulnerable to energy poverty, so particular attention should be paid to multi-apartment buildings and their inhabitants.     Lithuania EU Average 28.9 7.8 Urban 37.7 7.9 Rural 21.9 8.0 3.1.4.2. Table Inability to keep home adequately warm in 2016,%  Measures in the area of building and equipment efficiency include renovation of buildings (EE2 and EE11.) and replacement of boilers with more efficient technologies (EE7.). In future, financial instruments will promote the modernisation of indoor heating and hot water systems in multi-apartment buildings (EE10.) with a view to further progress. (For a more detailed description of these and related measures, see section 3.2. on energy efficiency).   Energy prices High energy prices are another possible cause of energy poverty. In Lithuania, opportunities for technological progress and the promotion of a competitive market are taken into account to ensure energy prices that meet consumers' needs (see sections 2.4.3 and 3.4.3. for more details). Lithuania, as a small, open economy, purchases all imported energy resources at global market prices, but wages are lower than in western European countries, so energy poverty in various forms affects a considerably larger proportion of the population. The National Energy Independence Strategy sets the objective of phasing out the regulation of electricity retail prices. The aim is to make regulation of retail prices of electricity through social tariffs and requirements possible in exceptional cases, thus protecting socially vulnerable electricity consumers and not exacerbating energy poverty in the country (ERK20.).  In the area of energy poverty, a measure related to market liberalisation is also relevant, enabling consumers to compare offers from different suppliers and to choose the best deal (EN5.). The competitive market dimension, including the imminent liberalisation of the electricity market, is described in more detail in section  3.4. .  Consumer awareness Consumer awareness and consciousness and related behavioural changes play an important part in reducing energy poverty. Accordingly, a well-informed consumer may find it easier to obtain financial support, take measures to improve energy efficiency or, following the liberalisation of the market in Lithuania, choose the most suitable energy supplier. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 137   Accessibility of information on benefits to consumers is also ensured in order to make cost reimbursement available to the society's vulnerable groups (EN6.) Currently, information on reimbursement of domestic heating and water costs, including an interactive calculator, can be found in the Family Social Support Information System (SPIS) at http://www.spis.lt/ 69 along with information on available social support (social benefits and reimbursement, student social support for schoolchildren, social services, etc.). Agreements with energy suppliers on informing customers about the services they provide (EE6.) are an additional measure to increase consumer awareness of energy efficiency (EE6.). In the period 2017-2030, energy suppliers will ensure the implementation of the scope of consumer education and consulting and of the measures provided for in agreements concluded between them or through other persons. In the context of energy poverty measures, synergies between the public sector and non-governmental organizations are important to ensure the continuity of the measures. Accordingly, taking into account the activities carried out in the course of the STEP project70 , additional measures are planned:  Inclusion of energy poverty and efficiency advice in the catalogue of social services (EN9.). Extension of the catalogue of social services to include advice on energy poverty and energy efficiency by social workers in direct contact with consumers affected by energy poverty. Appropriate social worker training to provide them with energy counselling qualifications.  Ensuring early intervention  obligations of energy suppliers concerning the prevention of energy poverty (EN10). This means imposing an obligation on energy suppliers to include minimum information on eligibility for energy poverty assistance in reminders on unpaid bills received by customers who have delayed payments  Improved access to information on energy poverty following the updating of the national energy portal for consumers (EN11.). Development of a price comparison tool for energy suppliers and updating of information on energy poverty to provide energy consultants and consumers with information on solutions. This tool will help consumers to choose a cheaper supplier and take additional energy efficiency measures, thereby reducing energy costs.  Policy coherence It is important to note that energy poverty policies and measures aim at policy coherence and promote a cross-sectoral approach, which is most evident from the combination of energy efficiency and financial support measures. For example, persons who are reimbursed for heating costs have a duty to keep their costs to a minimum and to contribute to energy efficiency. The Law of the Republic of Lithuania on Cash Social Assistance to Low-income Residents71 stipulates that apartment owners in multi-apartment who apply for reimbursement of the cost of heating the dwelling must participate in the meeting for the consideration and adoption of a decision on the implementation of the project for the renovation of the multi-apartment building, if such a decision is considered and adopted, and participate in the implementation of the project. Where a person does not respect the above obligation, his/her access to reimbursement of the home heating costs is restricted if the project for the renovation (modernisation) of the multi-apartment building did not begin a result of his/her action or omission.                                                            69 http://www.spis.lt/Skaiciuokles/BustoSildymoIslaiduKompensacijos 70 The STEP project, described in more detail in section 2.4.4 , is carried out in 8 EU countries and aims to alleviate energy poverty by encouraging changes in consumer behaviour. 71 https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/TAIS.215633/asr 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 138   An identical process is followed when choosing the buildings for renovation. In the selection of buildings to be renovated and upgraded, if buildings score the same number of points under the other selection criteria, priority is given to buildings housing socially vulnerable persons. Such processes improve the compatibility between measures and bring mutual benefits in terms of energy efficiency and protection of vulnerable groups.
