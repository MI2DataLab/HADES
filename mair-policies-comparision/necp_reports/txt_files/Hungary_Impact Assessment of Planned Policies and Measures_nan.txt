 5. IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF PLANNED POLICIES AND MEASURES  5.1. Effects of planned policies and measures described in Section 3 on energy systems and GHG emissions and removals, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures (as described in section 4).  i. Projections of the development of the energy system and GHG emissions and removals as well as, where relevant of emissions of air pollutants in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/2284 under the planned policies and measures at least until ten years after the period covered by the plan (including for the last year of the period covered by the plan), including relevant Union policies and measures. GHG emissions Summary Under the WAM scenario, GHG emissions will significantly decline by 2040. The rate of the decrease will be 8 % between 2017 and 2030 and roughly 17 % between 2017 and 2040. Thus, under the WAM scenario, a total decrease of 7 600 kt CO2eq is expected by 2040, which would realise the targeted 40 % reduction over the level in 1990.

By 2030, CH4 emissions are expected to drop by 12 %, N2O emissions by 8 % and F-gas emissions by 73.4 %. NF3 is not expected to appear in the Hungarian inventory. Under the WAM scenario, emissions under the EU ETS will decrease by 7.5 % by 2030 over the value in 2017, while emissions under the ESD/ESR will decline by 14.1 % during the same period.  Figure 82  ETS and ESR emissions with additional policies and measures, 2015-2040  Source of actual data: National Inventory Submission, 2019    The LULUCF sector will remain a net sink, but CO2 capture will decrease by 63 % by 2030. Energy Under the WAM scenario, GHG emissions from energy sources will significantly decline by 2040. GHG emissions will fall by more than 12 % by 2030 over the year 2017, and overall by almost 25 % by 2040. Thus, with additional measures, by 2040 GHG emissions will decrease overall by 5 700 kt CO2eq. In 2017, mainly the energy industry (30.2 %), transport (28.5 %), households (18.6 %) and industry (10.7 %) contributed to energy emissions. Under the WAM scenario, total emission will significantly change.  Figure 83  GHG emissions by sector, under the WAM scenario, kt CO2eq Source of actual data: National Inventory Submission, 2019 HU EN Energiaipar Energy industry Közlekedés Transport Lakosság Retail Egyéb Other Ipar Industry Kereskedelem és közszolgáltatások Commerce and public services  Agriculture, forestry and fishery Szivárgó emissziók Bleed emissions   Among the key sectors, by 2030 the transport sector will become the largest emitter, maintaining its currently high share (28.7 %). The largest increase in the amount and share of GHG emissions is expected in the industry by 2040. While emissions will increase by 85 % by 2030 over the value for 2017, an increase of around 120 % is expected between 2017 and 2040. The above is attributable to the forecast of rising demand, to be satisfied by the industrial sector mainly with oil and coal. At the same time, a sharp decline in GHG emissions (similarly to the WEM scenario) is expected in the energy industry: 30 % by 2030 and 58 % by 2040. Thus, in 2040 the energy industry is expected to only account for 17 % of energy sector emissions. The decline in emissions is expected to be largest in the retail segment, mainly attributable to falling natural gas consumption and the increasing use of electricity and renewable energy sources. Emission will sharply decline up to 2030, by 60 % compared to 2017, but the rate of the decline will significantly slow, reaching 63 % in 2040. The sector will account for around 9 % of total GHG emissions in 2030 and 2040. Non-energy sectors In relation to the agriculture and waste sectors, the WAM scenario does not include actual additional measures; the difference between the WEM and WAM is attributable to emissions reduction required in the sectors. Renewable energy In terms of the future, as opposed to the WEM scenario, under the WAM scenario the share of renewable energy consumption will dynamically grow up to 2030, followed by only moderate growth.   Figure 84  Share of renewable energy (%) in gross final energy consumption under the WEM and WAM scenarios Source of actual data: Eurostat HU EN  Megújuló arány (%) Share of renewables (%)  Under the WAM scenario, the share of renewable energy consumption will reach 21 % by 2030, and increase to 22.4 % by 2040. Growth will be linear in the 2020s. The rise in total renewable energy consumption between 2016 and 2030 will exceed 60 %. The electricity sector is the main engine of the rise in renewable energy consumption. While energy production of the sector based on renewable energy sources amounted to 262 ktoe in 2016, this figure will be more than three and a half times higher in 2030, equalling 970 ktoe. However, cooling and heating will continue to account for more than two thirds of renewable energy consumption. The increased share of renewables in the transport sector is highest in the use of second generation biofuels and of electricity on the road, although the latter is registered not in the transport but the electricity sector when assessing the total target.  Figure 85  Consumption of renewable sources of energy in individual sectors (ktoe) and the rate of total renewable energy consumption (%) under the WAM scenario Source of actual data: Eurostat HU EN Villamos energia Electricity  Cooling, heating Közlekedés Transport Megújulfelhasználási arány, % Share of the use of renewables, % Megújulóenergia-felhasználási arány, % Share of the use of renewable energy, %  Since four fifths of total renewable energy consumption was based on biomass in 2016, Hungary has set the target of diversifying the composition of renewable energy consumption. By 2030, the dominance of  biomass can be reduced with an upturn in solar energy. Under the WAM scenario, in parallel with growing use of solar energy, the use of both geothermal and other renewable sources of energy will increase. The use of biomass, however, will still account for more than two thirds of total renewable energy consumption in 2030.    Figure 86  Use of renewable sources of energy in the breakdown of sources under the WAM scenario, ktoe  Source of actual data: Eurostat HU EN Biomassza és biogáz Biomass and biogas Nap Solar Egyéb Other Bioüzemanyagok Biofuels Geotermikus Geothermal  Renewable energy consumption in the electricity sector As a result of additional measures, among regenerative sources of energy, the use of solar energy is expected to increase most in the electricity sector. The total installed PV capacity of over 1 GW in 2020 will increase to 2.5 GW by 2025, to over 6 GW by 2030 and may approximate even 12 GW by the 2040s. Thus, with additional measures, the system may have available around 4 000 MW more and over 8 000 MW more PV capacity in 2030 and 2040, respectively, than under the WEM scenario. Biomass and geothermal capacities are also expected to increase. The biomass waste capacity will increase by around 60 % in 2030 over the level in 2016, followed by a temporary downturn in the level of installed capacity, to be then followed by renewed growth up to 2040. Geothermal capacity is also expected to grow at a moderate pace; Hungary is expecting installed capacity of 60 MW in 2030 and 104 MW in 2040. Current wind capacity (approximately 330 MW) is expected to be maintained.    Figure 87  Installed renewable capacity under the WEM and WAM scenarios, MW Source of actual data: Eurostat HU EN Beépített kapacitás, MW Installed capacity, MW Biomassza-hulladék Biomass waste  Hydroelectric Szél Wind Nap Solar Geotermikus és egyéb megújuló energia Geothermal and other renewable energy  In 2016 electricity from renewable resources amounted to roughly 3 TWh. Under the WAM scenario this figure can even rise above 11 TWh by 2030, and even reach 17 TWh by 2040. Under the WAM scenario Hungarian power plants will be able to produce by around 80 % (5 069 TWh) more renewables based electricity than under the WEM scenario. Under the WAM scenario, the share of renewable energy within total electricity consumption will increase from 8 % in 2016 to over 21 % in 2030, and exceed 29 % in 2040. Compared to the WEM scenario, this amounts to a 7.7 percentage point and 12 percentage point surplus in 2030 and 2040, respectively.

Under the WAM scenario the quantity of electricity generated with solar energy will dynamically increase. In 2030, 58 % of electricity from renewable energy sources will be generated by PV power plants; this share will further increase to 66 % by 2040 (a share of only 7 % in 2016). The share of biomass will decline in parallel from 60 % in 2016 to 29 % in 2030.

Renewable energy consumption in the transport sector: Currently biofuels account for the largest share of renewable energy consumption in the transport sector, while electricity consumption in the rail segment is less substantial. Although the number of   Under the WAM scenario, gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources in transport will increase significantly.  Figure 90  Renewable energy consumption in the transport sector, and share of renewable energy in transport (RES-T, %), without multipliers, under the WEM and WAM scenarios, ktoe and %  Source of actual data: Eurostat HU EN energia bruttó végsközlekedésben Gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources in transport  To facilitate the comparability of figures before and after the period, from 2020  in conformity with the Renewable Energy Directive235  we are forecasting the figures below with multipliers. Calculation is based on multiplication by one and a half, four and two in relation to renewable energy consumption in the rail segment, road transport and advanced biofuels, respectively. As an additional important methodological change, from 2020 only the share of renewables in the domestic electricity sector may be used for calculation, the EU average may no longer be used. For the calculations, modelling was based on this assumption for the entire period. The share of renewables in transport  also taking into account multipliers  equalled 6.3 % in 2016, which will increase to 16.9 % by 2030 as a result of additional measures. This value is 4.2 percentage points                                                       235 Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (recast) (text with EEA relevance).  higher than under the WEM scenario. The higher increase compared to the WEM scenario is attributable to rising electricity consumption in road transport, on the one hand, and the partial replacement of first generation biofuels with second generation biofuels, on the other (second generation biofuels are considered with double weight based on the methodology). Rising renewable electricity consumption in road transport is partly attributable to the increase in the number of electric cars in absolute value and partly to the expected significant increase in the share of renewable electricity in the next decades. This factor also drives the increase of renewable energy consumption in rail transport. Eligible renewable energy consumption in this subsegment is increasing almost fourfold. In 2030 advanced biofuels and first generation biofuels (including consumption of used frying oil) will account for a 45 % and 20 % share in Hydrogen may also play a major role in transport by the end of the 2020s. Renewable energy consumption in road transport will account for one quarter of renewable energy consumption in the transport sector.

Its share is not expected to change in the long term, either, not even under the WAM scenario. Biomass based thermal energy production will increase by 28 % between 2016 and 2030, followed by stagnation after 2030. The quantity of geothermal energy consumption in this segment will increase to around 58 % by 2030; only increase to 5 %. Only minor changes are forecast in relation to other fuels. Based on the foregoing, the share of renewable energy consumption in the cooling and heating sector will increase from around 20.7 % currently to 28.7 % by 2030. The share  without additional measures  is expected to decrease thereafter, equalling 25.5 % in 2040.

Final energy consumption under the WAM scenario will be 31 % less in 2030 than final energy consumption forecast under the WEM scenario. Under the WAM scenario, as result of implementing the planned additional measures, in 2030 final energy consumption in the retail sector will be one third lower than the value for 2016.   Figure 93  Comparison of final energy consumption in the retail sector under the WEM and WAM scenarios  impact of new policy measures, ktoe Source of actual data: Eurostat Natural gas consumption will decrease most within declining final energy consumption in the retail sector; based on planned measures retail natural gas consumption will fall by around 50 % between 2016 and 2030 (approximately 2 billion m3, around 1 500 ktoe). (The share of natural gas within district heat generation also declined significantly; with additional measures the share of natural gas in district heat generation can fall by one half.) Consumption patterns will significantly change between 2016 and 2030. The share of natural gas  45 %  in 2016  will decrease to 32 % by 2030. The share of electricity is expected to increase from 15 % to over 28 %. The share of renewable energy will be at current levels: 27-28 %.  Figure 94  Projection of retail final energy consumption and change in composition  impact of new policy measures, WAM scenario, ktoe Source of actual data: Eurostat HU EN Szén Coal Olaj Oil Gáz Gas Villamos energia Electricity  District heat Megújuló Renewables  A minor increase in final energy consumption in the tertiary / services sector is forecast under both the WEM and WAM scenarios. A significant difference between forecasts of the two scenarios is expected only in 2040, when additional measures will reduce energy consumption by 4 % compared to the WEM scenario.    Figure 95  Comparison of final energy consumption in the tertiary sector under the WEM and WAM scenarios  impact of new policy measures, ktoe Source of actual data: Eurostat Under the WAM scenario, the quantity of energy consumed in the services sector will increase by 10.2 % between 2016 and 2030. The largest increase in quantity and share is forecast in renewable energy consumption between 2016 and 2030: the rise in renewable energy consumption will reach 435 ktoe during this period, indicating a rise of over 900 % over the year 2016. Electricity consumption will also increase during the same period by 9.8 % (increase of 68 ktoe). A significant decline, however, is expected in natural gas consumption (a decrease of 121 ktoe, 9.9 % over the year 2016) and district heat consumption (decrease of 36 ktoe, 20 % over the year 2016). As the most important structural change, the share of natural gas will decrease from 56 % in 2016 to 44 % in 2030, with an increase in the share of renewable sources of energy from 2 % to 19 %.  Figure 96  Projection of final energy consumption in the tertiary sector and change in composition  impact of new policy measures, WAM scenario, ktoe  Source of actual data: Eurostat HU EN Szén Coal Olaj Oil Gáz Gas Villamos energia Electricity  District heat Megújuló Renewables  In the tertiary sector, the energy consumption of public services will decrease further as a result of implemented new policy measures, while the energy consumption of market services is expected to increase based on the dynamic growth of added value and related infrastructure. In relation to the industrial sector, there are no major differences in energy consumption data forecast under the WEM and WAM scenarios. Both the WEM and WAM scenarios forecast a significant rise in energy consumption. Under both scenarios, industrial energy consumption in 2030 will be more than 50 % higher than in 2016. The near identity of energy consumption values forecast for 2030 under the two scenarios is attributable to the following factors:  Firstly, the two scenarios assume identical production patterns and an identical increase in production value, i.e. energy efficiency is the only source of the difference;  The existing energy efficiency aids have substantial incentivising power;  The tightening standards, which are mandatory in all EU Member States, and provisions of the Energy Efficiency Directive (2012/27/EU) were already considered in the WEM scenario;  The new policy measures result in a faster increase in housing construction under the WAM scenario, resulting in higher energy savings in the retail sector, but projecting higher energy consumption resulting from the manufacturing of building materials in Hungary.    Figure 97  Comparison of final energy consumption in the tertiary sector under the WEM and WAM scenarios  impact of new policy measures, ktoe Source of actual data: Eurostat Upon analysis of the composition of growing industrial energy consumption, in terms of share, between 2016 and 2030 renewable energy consumption (74 % increase), and coal and oil consumption (67 % increase for both) are expected to increase at the highest rate. In terms of absolute value, electricity consumption will rise at the highest rate: Between 2016 and 2030 industrial electricity consumption will rise from 1 369 ktoe to 2 059 ktoe, resulting in 690 ktoe in additional electricity consumption in 2030 over the year 2016. The extent of change in consumption patterns potentially occurring in the retail or services sector is not expected in industry. As a key change, the share of natural gas consumption within total industrial energy consumption will fall from 31 % to 27 % between 2016 and 2030.  Figure 98  Projection of final energy consumption in the industrial sector and change in composition  impact of new policy measures, WAM scenario, ktoe  Source of actual data: Eurostat HU EN Szén Coal Olaj Oil Gáz Gas Villamos energia Electricity  District heat Megújuló Renewables  The difference between energy consumption in the transport sector in the WEM and WAM scenarios will be approximately 112 ktoe in 2030, i.e. the new policy measures can reduce energy consumption in transport by 2.6 % compared to the trajectory under the existing measures. Upon the combined implementation of the new policy measures  resulting in the faster spread of electric vehicles and a decline in the fuel consumption of motor vehicles with traditional propulsion  the increase in energy consumption in transport may be reduced to 19.3 % between 2016 and 2030. (For comparison: the increase is 21.9 % under the WEM scenario.)   Figure 99  Comparison of final energy consumption in transport under the WEM and WAM scenarios  impact of new policy measures, ktoe Source of actual data: Eurostat Under the WAM scenario, the share of the energy value of oil-based fuels may be reduced to 75 % by 2030 in terms of the entire transport sector.  Figure 100  Projection of final energy consumption in transport and change in composition, impact of new policy measures, not incl. international air transport, WAM scenario, ktoe Source of actual data: Eurostat HU EN Olaj Oil Gáz Gas Villamos energia Electricity  Megújuló Renewables  There are no significant forecasting differences between the WEM and WAM scenarios in the agriculture, forestry and fishery sector. Both scenarios forecast a 17 % increase between 2016 and 2030.   Figure 101  Comparison of final energy consumption in the agriculture, forestry and fishery sector under the WEM and WAM scenarios  impact of new policy measures Source of actual data: Eurostat The figure below shows the energy consumption patterns of the agriculture, forestry and fishery sector by fuel type. Between 2016 and 2030 natural gas consumption will increase significantly by 61 % (increase of 89 ktoe).  Figure 102  Projection of final energy consumption in the agriculture, forestry and fishery sector and change in composition in consideration of the impact of new policy measures, WAM scenario, ktoe Source of actual data: Eurostat HU EN Szén Coal Olaj Oil  Gáz Gas Villamos energia Electricity  District heat Megújuló Renewables  Finally, we review below expected aggregate final energy consumption. The value of total final energy consumption under the WAM scenario in 2030 is 1 939 ktoe (~81 PJ) less than the value forecast under the WEM scenario. In consideration of the impact of existing policy measures, a 15.9 % increase in final energy consumption was projected between 2016 and 2030, without significant changes to the internal distribution of used energy sources. By implementation of additional measures, this rate of increase can be reduced; under the WAM scenario only a 5 % increase is expected between 2016 and 2030. Also taking into account average annual GDP growth of 4 %, it follows from the above that the value of final energy consumption relative to the GDP, i.e. the energy intensity indicator, will improve.  Figure 103  Comparison of final energy consumption under the WEM and WAM scenarios  impact of new policy measures, ktoe Source of actual data: Eurostat The value of the GDP final energy intensity indicator is expected to decrease by 38.6 % between 2005 and 2030 (from 0.199 toe/1 000 EUR to 0.123 toe/1 000 EUR). The value is expected to decrease by 25 % between 2016 and 2030. An additional improvement of the intensity indicator is expected by 2040, falling further to 0.106 toe/1 000 EUR.

Figure 105  Projection of final energy consumption and change in patterns  impact of new policy measures, WAM scenario, ktoe Source of actual data: Eurostat  HU EN Szén Coal Olaj Oil Gáz Gas Villamos energia Electricity  District heat Megújuló Renewables  Primary energy consumption Primary energy consumption will significantly increase at the end of the 2020s. A substantial increase is expected under both the WEM and WAM scenarios mainly as a result of higher transformation loss caused by the entry into service of the new Paks nuclear power plant units. A falling, stagnating trend will follow the decommissioning of the old units. Upon implementation of the new policy measures, the value of primary energy consumption may equal 30 664 ktoe (approximately 1 284 PJ) in 2030, which is 29.2 % higher than the value for 2016. Implementation of the new policy measures would allow 1 109 ktoe (around 46.4 PJ) in total savings of primary energy consumption by 2030, compared to the trajectory under the existing policy measures.  Figure 106  Comparison of primary energy consumption under the WEM and WAM scenarios  impact of new policy measures Source of actual data: Eurostat   The primary energy intensity of the Hungarian economy, i.e. ratio of primary energy consumption to the GDP, will decrease by 31 % between 2005 and 2030 after implementation of the new policy measures. A 2.5 % decrease is expected between 2016 and 2030. Thus, the value of the indicator will fall from 0.289 toe/1 000 EUR in 2005 to 0.201 toe/1 000 EUR in 2030, and to 0.162 toe/1 000 EUR in 2040.

The preliminary findings of the SEA  not yet presented for social consultations at the time of the  relating to effects on other Member States are as follows: The objectives, programmes and projects of the NECP represent substantial progress in a number of areas concerning the environmental impact of the production and consumption of energy in Hungary. Implementation of the programmes will result in a significant decline in GHG emissions, a growing share of energy production units using renewable energy sources and improved energy efficiency. The launch of a number of measures is planned under the NECP (promotion of energy innovation, expansion of consumer choice, local energy production, support of energy communities) that may contribute to laying the groundwork for important future environmental processes. The NECP not only considered environmental criteria. Its most important objective is the simultaneous management of conditions ensuring the security of supply, cost efficiency and environmental sustainability. Main observations relating to conformity with NECP environmental requirements:  The reduction of consumption and termination of wasteful energy consumption should be key elements of complex energy development projects. In this regard the NECP defines a number of programmes and projects, although some commitments under the energy saving measures could be expanded (e.g. reduction of energy consumption in transport by promotion of alternative mobility, more radical reduction of industrial and retail energy consumption, more efficient use of produced waste heat etc.);  As regards energy efficiency measures, the NECP does not contain an options analysis that would prioritise possible areas and means of intervention based on economic, environmental and social criteria;  The NECP aims to contribute to energy objectives mainly through technical and regulatory measures; awareness raising elements, e.g. resulting in savings targets and the reconsideration of consumer needs, are less prioritised;  The renewal of the Paks nuclear power plant capacities is key to future electricity generation;   As regards the satisfaction of the natural gas demand of gas turbines necessary for ensuring the grid regulation of weather-dependent renewable technologies and the flexibility of the electricity generation system, notwithstanding the need for establishing a diversified supply infrastructure, the security of supply may also be important to address in relation to potential political and market risks. It is therefore necessary to develop other options of grid regulation;  By exploring and extracting unconventional hydrocarbon reserves we are exhausting important  Hungarian resources that may be of strategic importance for future generations. Accordingly, it is necessary to conserve still available hydrocarbon reserves in Hungary;  The NECP does not elaborate the management of waste produced in connection with energy production. In this regard it is necessary to ensure the long-term, safe disposal of the spent fuel assemblies of the nuclear power plant units, or to provide for appropriate recycling possibilities (if such technologies become environmentally suitable). Additionally it is necessary to provide for the appropriate recovery of waste produced after the service life of PV units planned in large quantities and the recovery of valuable materials contained in them;  The NECP assigns an important role to energy production from biomass, which, apart from its generally positive view, may carry a number of environmental risks. It is important to satisfy growing demand for energy from biomass with the lowest possible environmental impact, taking into account optimal conditions for energy, forestry, soil science, agriculture, nature conservation and transport;  The development programmes planned in the NECP (power plant investments, system development requirements, investment and price subsidies) will impose major budgetary burdens. The Strategy, however, only partly specifies the sources of development. In some areas of intervention, extra costs may lead to severe State budget strains or the suspension of planned development projects. 5.3. Overview of investment needs i. Existing investment flows and forward investment assumptions with regard to the planned policies and measures The TIMES model used for preparing the NECP not only accounts for investment costs but also for changes in operating costs in the field of energy.236 The model calculates the additional costs of the measures implementing energy strategy targets, as set out in this document, among other places. It is therefore the existing measures) scenario. The model covers energy-transforming sectors, the energy consumption of the household and tertiary sectors, the transport sector, and the industrial and agricultural sectors. According to its operating logic, the model seeks the most cost-effective means of satisfying the given final customer demand (e.g. million passenger-km, quantity of produced cement, lighting demand etc.)  this is considered the cost of the WEM scenario. As a limit to the model, the WAM scenario, however, includes quantifiable targets presented in Chapter 1.2 and seeks optimal costs in consideration of these. The discounted value of costs estimated for the entire period, the                                                       236 Estimates are not available for the cost of reducing non-energy GHG emissions.  so-called total system cost237, is higher under the WAM scenario because the use of more expensive technologies is also necessary, e.g. for meeting higher emission reduction targets. Modelling results In the analysed period between 2016 and 2040, the additional, fully discounted system cost under the WAM scenario amounts to HUF 20 401 billion, equalling an average annual value of HUF 582.9 billion. The steadily increasing net additional costs peak at around 2030, because based on the modelling results, it is worth delaying investments aimed at meeting 2030 targets due to declining technological costs. As a result of new investments aimed at meeting the 2040 targets, costs again  moderately  rise after 2035. The results also suggest that although new investments are capital intensive, they can significantly reduce variable operation and maintenance costs in parallel with the more optimal use of existing technologies.

The model calculates costs in euro, which we converted at a 310 HUF/EUR exchange rate assumed to be constant in the long term.   The additional cost requirement under the WAM scenario mainly arises in the retail sector: such overall cost equals of 80 %, accounting for 90 % of total costs in 2030. The investment requirement in the transport sector will reach the highest level at the end of the period. A moderate increase in additional costs is expected in electricity and heat generation, and in the services sectors; there are no differences in investment requirements under the WEM and WAM scenarios in relation to industry and agriculture.

The latter cost is particularly high in the transport sector: the new technologies introduced under the WAM scenario not only require more capital, but their fixed operation and maintenance costs are also higher.

At least 25 % of cohesion funds should be used for implementing climate change e financed with HUF 1 300 billion in cohesion funds; these serve, inter alia, the transition to clean energy sources, renewable energy investments, the combating of climate change and support of clean vehicles in urban transport. Within the framework of th-European networks   also targeting climate policy targets  can be supported. In the third trading period (2013-2020) of the EU emissions trading scheme, a specific share of revenue from the sale of emission allowances (50 % of EUA III allowance sales, 100 % of EUAA aviation allowance sales) is used for budget appropriation managed under the Green Economy Financing Scheme chapter. Between 2021 and 2030 we are planning around HUF 910 billion in carbon credit revenues238, assuming an average CO2 price of 25 EUR per tonne. Of the above amount, HUF 726 billion may be spent in accordance with general rules on carbon credit revenues239, i.e. 50 % thereof (HUF 363 billion ) serves targeted green economy development objectives. Funds of the Modernisation Fund240 in the value of HUF 184 billion supplement 50 % of carbon credit revenues serving green economy development; Hungary will be entitled to amounts used in accordance with current general rules on carbon credit revenues. The Modernisation Fund  operating from 2021  aims to enhance upgrades of energy systems and energy efficiency. At least 70 % of available funds must be used to support investments on the priority list of the Modernisation Fund. The remaining 30 % of funds may be used to support other projects serving the modernisation of energy systems. The intensity of aid is maximum 100 % for projects on the priority list and maximum 70 % for other projects. The priority list, subject to revision in 2024, contains the following elements:  Electricity from renewable resources and its consumption;  Improvement of energy efficiency, including investments in energy efficiency in the transport, buildings, agriculture and waste sectors;  Energy storage;  Modernisation of energy networks, including district heating pipelines and electricity transmission networks;  Expansion of interconnection between Member States;  --skilling and up-skilling of workers, education, job-seeking initiatives and start- The application of Article 10c derogation in the 2021-2030 period aims at the replacement of electricity generation resulting in high GHG emissions with natural gas or other sustainable technology. Aid intensity is                                                       238 The estimation of revenues is very uncertain because carbon credit prices evolve on the exchange, and they are also affected by the market stability reserve, demand for free allocation and certain political factors (e.g. Brexit). Therefore the figure is only an indicative estimate.

Successful projects are selected by way of tender. Among indicative targets serving fulfilment of other Hungarian energy and climate policy objectives, the Building Energy Performance Tender Programme  with a budget of HUF 0.4 billion  provides funding for the following:  Development of energy production with renewable sources of energy;  Increased use of renewable energy;  Energy efficiency actions;  Investments, measures reducing GHG emissions;  Public awareness raising of climate policies, the green economy, energy literacy;  Supporting the construction of low energy buildings. Within the framework of the REAS (Renewable Energy Support Scheme) replacing the feed-in system, the HEA has the right to decide, under normative conditions, on the period of the feed-in of electricity from renewable resources and on the quantity of electricity subject to feed-in. Within the framework of the REAS tenders launched in the near future, producers will compete for aid in the overall annual amount of HUF 2.5 billion based on offers for subsidised prices. In the 2021-2027 Union programming period, programmes under direct Union management will be available with increased funds for financing energy projects. These include Horizon Europe (RDI), Connecting Europe Facility (energy infrastructure), LIFE (environmental protection), EURATOM (nuclear energy), Structural Reform Support Programme (institutional and growth-enhancing reforms, climate and energy objectives), Digital Europe Programme (digitalisation), European Defence Fund (defence, military energy projects), and InvestEU (efficient transport infrastructure, green energy and innovation). A substantial amount of private investment will also be necessary for the energy transition, for meeting the 2030 targets and due to the difference in funds available from investment and operating aids. ii.

Effects of planned policies and measures described in Chapter 3 on other Member States and regional cooperation at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures i. Impacts on the energy system in neighbouring and other Member States in the region to the extent possible  Finalisation of the strategic environmental assessment (SEA) relating to the NECP objectives and measures is in progress. The preliminary findings of the SEA  not yet presented for social consultations  relating to effects on other Member States are as follows: The natural units found in Hungary  e.g. flowing waters, larger regions, mountains  commonly expand beyond its administrative borders. As a result, resources withdrawn from the natural environment in the course of energy production and consumption, waste deposited in the environment, substances re-entering the environment in the form of pollution are a matter of concern not only for Hungary, but also for neighbouring countries. The joint extraction of deep geothermal reservoirs may be a source of conflict (e.g. along the Croatian border); without appropriate cooperation and regulation, the resource may be overused. In relation to solid biomass, too, there is a cross-border supply of raw material, therefore its environmental impact is produced partly in neighbouring countries. In relation to biofuels, Hungary is also an exporter; the environmental impact arises in Hungary, while the benefit from the replacement of fossil fuels is enjoyed in the importer country. In transport, in the event of disasters involving the transport of goods or passengers by water, Hungary's waterways may suffer cross-border pollution. electricity and gas markets is a strategic objective of the NECP, which has a profound impact on energy trade with neighbouring countries and enhances the security of supply. The investments will deepen Hungary's integration in the European energy system (supply of electricity, gas), thus changes in domestic consumption can increase or decrease the environmental impact beyond its borders. The environmental impact of extracting raw materials and energy sources for domestic energy production and consumption (e.g. transport), and of the production of imported electricity arises beyond Hungary's borders but it is important to consider. The measures of the NECP reducing import dependency (in relation to both energy sources and electricity) mitigate these external effects. Equipment necessary for using solar energy are commonly imported products; mining of the rare earth elements used for these is also carried out outside of Hungary. ii.
