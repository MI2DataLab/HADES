3.3.  Dimension energy security45 i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.346 The relevant policies and measures considered by Romania are described below and ordered by their interaction with other dimensions of the Plan: main vector in the trans-sectoral impact, secondary effect of measures pertaining to other dimensions and to the dimension concerned. Trans-sectoral policies and measures  1) Energy security - main dimension  The 2020-2030 Development and Decarbonisation Plan of CE Oltenia                                                  45 Policies and measures shall reflect the energy efficiency first principle. 46Consistency shall be ensured with the preventive action and emergency plans under Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2017 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and repealing Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 (OJ L 280, 28.10.2017, p. 1) as well as the risk preparedness plans under Regulation (EU) 2018/2001 [as proposed by COM(2016) 862 on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector and repealing Directive 2005/89/EC]. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         In the context of current European decarbonisation policies, which culminate with using less and less fossil fuels and, in particular, coal, CE Oltenia envisages implementing a development and decarbonisation plan which enables them a realistic and sustainable transition, as much as possible, towards production of low-carbon electricity; in this respect, the following actions are considered, with the possibility of being implemented by 2030: o The construction of three photovoltaic parks with a total installed capacity of approximately 300 MW on the closed sludge and ash landfills (pertaining to th2023 and commissioning will be achieved in 2024 (150 MW) and in 2025 (150 MW more) o Construction of a new energy cogeneration unit of 200 MW on natural gas at SE Craiova, which will replace the current 2x150 MW lignite-based capacities from 2024 o Construction of a power unit of 400 MW on natural gas at SE Turceni, which will replace the current 330 MW lignite-based capacity from 2026 o Construction of two gas-fired power units of 400 MW (additional total installed capacity of 800 MW) at SE Isalnita, which will replace the lignite-based unit 8 of 315 MW from 2024 and the lignite-based unit 7 of 315 MW from 2025. In this respect, the trend in the production capacities of CE Oltenia until 2030 is set out in the chart below. Chart 12 - Trend in the power available at CE Oltenia [MW]  Source: The 2020-2030 Development and Decarbonisation Plan of CE Oltenia RO EN Solar Solar Gaz natural Natural gas Lignit Lignite  Sustainable transition is projected from 2024 onward by developing new gas-fired capacities with total installed capacity of 1 400 MW. This fuel has the advantage of enabling flexible operation, which will make it possible to integrate more RES into the national energy system because natural gas can balance the system, taking into account the intermittent nature of RES.  The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          Maintaining the mandatory crude oil and natural gas stocks, increasing the natural gas storage capacity The minimum stocks of crude oil and petroleum products are established under Law No 85/2018, which transposes Directive 2009/119/EC. The stocks established in 2019, which must be maintained in 2020, amount to 1 402 801 tonnes of crude oil equivalent. ANRE has established so far, on an annual basis, the minimum stock of natural gas, which every holder of the natural gas supply licence must establish in the underground storage facilities and the total stored amounts exceeded the minimum stock every year. In 2019, the total stored amount was 3.056 billion cubic meters, whereas the minimum stock was 2.18 billion cubic meters. For security in the supply with natural gas and crude oil, Romania also considers the following measures: o fostering initiatives involving modernisation of the existing gas storage capacities in order to enhance flexibility by using the storage capacities in a multi-cycle mode47; o increasing the natural gas storage capacity by promoting the respective projects as projects of common interest; o increasing the underground storage facility (cluster 6.20.6); o 6.20.4)   Development of high-efficiency cogeneration capacities/integration of RES in the production of heat for centralised heating systems The following projects provide for the deployment of cogeneration units or for the rehabilitation of existing ones, their development being a priority for a series of local communities in Romania:  o the implementation owhich entails developing a new high-efficiency cogeneration unit for production of energy in a combined gas-fired gas-steam cycle technology; o the implementation of a combined cycle cogeneration unit at CTE Bucharest South, which entails developing a new high-efficiency cogeneration unit (gas-steam combined cycle) of approximately 200 MWe and 200 MWt; o the implementation of a gas-fired new high-efficiency cogeneration capacity for production of energy at CTE Progresu; o the rehabilitation of the combined cycle of CTE Bucharest West in order to extend its lifespan/implementation of a new combined cycle unit of approximately 186 MWe and 170 Gcal/h; o the construction of a gas-fired cogeneration (CHP) plant at CET Govora; o the development of a new cogeneration unit at Midia (approximately 70 MW);  Cogeneration units will contribute to security in energy supply, in particular at local level, reducing the risk of disruptions in power and heat supply.                                                  47 Development Plan for the National Natural Gas Transmission System for 2019-2028 (NNGTS) - Transgaz SA -  The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Another potential advantage of the cogeneration production is that it entails a lower fuel demand compared to other technologies, which can have a positive effect on the reduction of dependency on imports. However, the abovementioned capacities are not the only ones to be developed and we are to assess in the forthcoming period the opportunity of developing new cogeneration capacities in various localities depending on the interest and involvement of local authorities.    Encouraging the development of energy storage capacities The development of energy storage capacities is a solution for securing the energy supply. In order to achieve this, Romania plans the following measures: o to clearly define the concept of energy storage in the primary law; o to lay down the conditions for release of energy storage licences and for connection to the network; o to define standards for deployment and use of various storage technologies; o to develop a market design which facilitates integration of storage capacities in the electricity market (e.g. enabling and facilitating access to storage contracts on various markets - for example, the intra-day market, the day-ahead market, the balancing market, laying down conditions for access to these markets, calculating system tariffs so as to reflect costs etc.). The opportunities identified to date are related to the conclusions of the NES adequacy study developed by Transelectrica, which mentions storage of energy in the NES through the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). This system may constitute a valuable resource for remedying situations where the load curve is not covered and the impact of BESS integration in the ETN has an overall positive impact by improving adequacy (at least 10 %). According to the same study, BESS is dual: it acts as a production source when unloading and as additional consumption/load when loading. From the temporal viewpoint, the optimum operation scheme entails loading BESS at no-load hours and unloading at peak load hours. In this respect, it is recommended to integrate battery energy storage systems (BESS) in the NES for capacity of at least 400 MW, in particular in order to flatten the load curve and to secure an additional reserve for exploitation in the form of technological system services (TSS) - swift secondary and tertiary control. Romania will support the development of these technologies in order to ensure the adequacy of the NES.   Promotion of demand response Article 114(2) of Order No 169/18 September 2018 of ANRE approving the Methodology for determining the tariffs for the electricity distribution service provides that the distribution system operator must offer dynamic distribution tariffs at the request of users or their suppliers from 2020 onward. This is a first step in the promotion of demand response, which is likely to bring about multiple benefits in the light of the fact that this will enable the final consumer to voluntarily adjust their demand. If this leads to a reduction in demand, final users thus contribute to the offer and demand balancing and to security in the supply. Moreover, the final consumer (household or non-household) will be able to ensure the cost-effectiveness of energy.  Support measures under the internal energy market dimension will be required to promote and develop demand response, which are focused on market organisation and The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         introduction of networks and smart meters, and on access of aggregators to the market. These measures are detailed in Chapter 3.4.3. The implementation of demand response implies explicitly providing consumers (either directly, or through aggregators) with the possibility of participating in the wholesale and balancing markets. 2) Energy security - secondary dimension  - the GHG emissions and removals component o Promoting investments in new low-carbon power generation capacities The development of new capacities will contribute to the establishment of the NES, considering that, by the end of 2030, certain coal-based plants having reached the end of their life cycle, the upgrading of which is not warranted, will be decommissioned; the development of new production capacities will thus contribute to the diversification of energy supply sources.   o Developing the power transmission grid, thus reaching an interconnectivity level of at least 15.4 % in 2030 The increase in interconnectedness plays a pivotal role in the security of electricity supply as it will facilitate cross-border trade, in particular in emergency cases. o Digitalisation of the Romanian energy system The digitalisation of the Romanian energy system will be conducive to its functioning under safety conditions following the improvement in the capacity of response to cyberattacks.  o Implementing a deregulation calendar for the electricity and gas market, which entails full liberalisation of markets as of 2020-2021 Market liberalisation and development of a legislative framework that is favourable for investments are likely to contribute to energy security because they will enable to develop new capacities, also enhancing the flexibility of the national energy system. o Integrating Romanian energy markets into the European single energy market  The integration of Romanian energy markets into the European single market aims at adapting market conditions so that they ensure better supply with electricity. o Developing a support mechanism of the Contracts for Differences (CfD) type A mechanism that fosters investments in order to facilitate the development of new low-carbon electricity production capacities (e.g. nuclear power, RES etc.), thus ensuring diversification of energy sources and the flexibility of the national system. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Other policies/measures pertaining to the dimension System adequacy and flexibility A study was conducted in 2017 on the adequacy of the National Energy System (NES) on the medium and long term, which was purposed to present the status of the NES at that time in terms of energy production sources (dispatchable or non-dispatchable) and of the available control reserves and to determine the adequacy of NES on the medium and long term (2020 and 2025).  The analysis on the NES adequacy by 2025, which was based on various scenarios, has revealed following main conclusions: 1. if new capacities are not commissioned, the system adequacy will erode in time against the background of projected increase in consumption and in the exporting net balance; 2. the additional capacity required by 2025 to include the estimated loss of load expectation (LOLE) in the 3-8 hours interval is approximately 600-700 MW. In order to assess the adequacy indicators, the NES behaviour by 2025 was examined assuming the existence of an additional production capacity. In order to determine the demand for additional capacity, account was taken of the recommendations on the adequacy level that must be reached by transmission system operators under the ENTSO-E [the LOLE (loss of load expectation) value is between 3 and 8 hours]. In order to ensure compliance within the interval recommended by ENTSO-E for LOLE (3.8 hours) for the time horizon 2025, the assessment has revealed the need for an additional available capacity of at least 570 MW (the conservative scenario) and of 670 MW (the baseline scenario). In conclusion, for the time horizon 2025, new electricity production capacities with a total installed capacity of 600-700 MW need to be built at NES level. The new capacities producing electricity from classical sources will be envisaged with additional technical capabilities compared to the current ones: short start-up time (one hour till synchronisation with the NES is advisable), high loading/unloading speed, high flexibility (to have the possibility of power variation at least in the range 55 ÷ 100 % of the rated power). 3. In the event of failure to supply natural gas to the gas plants connected to the NES, the mean load loss reaches 1 700 MW by 2025 - high values requiring disruption of consumption. Moreover, a risk assessment was carried out with the purpose of simulating the limit case where, in the absence of fuel during the winter season, most of the gas-fired central heating plants are not operational. In this context, the shutdown of several dispatchable plants was simulated. Account was taken of the winter regimes considered to be critical in the analysis of the baseline scenario - winter evening peak (WEP) and the heat minimum (HM). The analysis revealed that, for the two critical regimes, mean load loss reaches 1 500 MW (WEP) and 1 700 MW (HM). Disruption of consumption is required at these imbalance values. The increase in the natural gas storage capacity and in the connectivity of natural gas networks will be envisaged in order to mitigate this risk. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         4. Consideration of support in failure cases when simulating the functioning of the NES leads to an improvement in the adequacy indicators. The optimal solution to increase system safety consists in implementing the capacity market. In this respect, the Ministry of the Economy, Energy and Business Environment intends to develop a capacity mechanism that is adapted to the specific conditions of Romania in order to secure electricity supply, under any circumstances, including in extreme cases (weather and/or operational conditions). Therefore, the mechanism is purposed to provide for additional production capacities alongside the active capacities on the electricity market, which are required in order to maintain balance between generation and consumption of electricity in extraordinary unpredictable cases, having regard to the particularities of the energy market in Romania. The capacity mechanism thus intervenes to secure supply when the offer on the electricity market becomes scarce in order to enable balance between offer and demand. In order to secure production that meets the consumption demands domestically, thus initiate the investment for the development of a new gas-fired mixed cycle energy capacity in the North-West area (Mintia) with an installed capacity of 400 MW.  Diversification of energy sources and reduction of dependency on third countries Fostering exploitation of resources in the Black Sea The tapping of natural gas resources in the Black Sea is an essential element in securing energy independence. The Romanian Government has thus proposed to develop an investment climate which fosters complex infrastructure projects in the upstream sector.  In this context, a draft act amending the law in force was submitted, namely the draft Law amending and supplementing Law No 256/2018 regarding certain measures needed for the implementation of petroleum operations by petroleum agreement holders regarding offshore oil perimeters and Law No 238/2004 on petroleum, which enables to attract investors with technical expertise and to make investments for an extended time horizon. The draft law submitted to public debate entailed amendments regarding:   removing the additional taxation of revenues for prices generating no excess profit for investors;  increasing the maximum threshold for deduction of investments on the upstream segment for determination of the additional offshore tax in order to maintain the competitiveness of the offshore sector in Romania and to ensure uniform taxation for all business sectors;  removing the trading obligations on the centralised markets in Romania on the medium and long term;  removing the use of the reference price in determining the calculation base for the tax on additional revenues in order to bring the Offshore Law in line with the Romanian taxation principles and with the international practice regarding the determination of upstream taxes based on established prices. Projects related to electricity and natural gas transmission In the electricity transmission sector, the priority investment projects, apart from the declared projects of common interest (PCI), concern closing the 400 kV ring in Romania, i.e. OPL 400 kV - Oradea Sud, and the 400 kV ring of Bucharest Municipality towards the east by deploying an electrical line of 400 kV from the electricity transmission station in Bucharest South to that of Brazi West, including the installation of a new transmission station in the North-East area of the capital city (Bucharest Municipality and Ilfov County). The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         The following PCIs are also a priority in terms of energy security for Romania:  400 kV OPL in double circuit (equipped circuit) Smârdan    400 kV OPL in double   Stâlpu, in accordance with the project for transition to 400 kV voltage for existing 220 kV lines Brazi West - Teleajen  Stâlpu, including the Teleajen and Stâlpu stations;  Upgrading the network corridor Iron Gates - R- - - Arad from 220 kV to 400 kV, developing the following projects (stages): o 400 kV OPL Iron Gates - by building a new 400 kV station; o - Timi-  o  - Arad, including the station. Romania will maintai-South for electricity in Central Europe and South- from renewable sources from Member States (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, -Mukacevo) will remain functional and in use.  On the other hand, the BRHA corridor concerns the development of natural gas transmission capacities between the interconnections in the Romanian transmission system and the similar systems in Bulgaria and Hungary.48 The southern transmission corridor, although it lies within the national territory, is also of regional strategic relevance, being designed to facilitate transmission of future output from the depths of the Black Sea plateau to the European gas pipelines.  At the same time, the existing interconnection pipeline between Romania and the Republic of Moldova (Iasi-Ungheni) requires further developing the Romanian natural gas transmission system in the area. Consequently, four subprojects meeting this requirement were initiated,  -  See also Chapters 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 for more details regarding the interconnection rate and the relevant projects.  Nuclear energy The nuclear energy is an important element for the energy security of Romania. In order to ensure supply with feedstock, as required for the production of the nuclear fuel used in the NPP Cernavoda reactors, SN Nuclearelectrica has established contractual relations with two qualified suppliers: the Canadian supplier Cameco Inc and the domestic supplier the National Uranium Company (- CNU).  In order to enhance the security in supply with the feedstock needed to produce the nuclear chain, SN Nuclearelectrica considers diversifying the uranium supply sources in the form of uranium octoxide (a product for which there is a market/competition) and purchasing the                                                 48 Development Plan for the National Natural Gas Transmission System for 2019-2028 (NNGTS) prepared by Transgaz SA The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Feldioara plant of CNU in order to insource the processing services and to improve the cost-effectiveness of the feedstock required to produce the nuclear fuel for NPP Cernavoda.  Refurbishment of nuclear units in NPP Cernavoda Unit 1 has been in operation since 1996. The refurbishment of Unit 1 is three-phased and the actual shutdown of Unit 1 is to take place between December 2026 and December 2028.  Phase 1 (2018-2022) includes activities related to project organisation, preparation of the nuclear security documentation required to ensure the operation of Unit 1 for another 30-year cycle by extending the number of operation hours based on a study conducted by Candu Energy, and the completion of the feasibility study required to develop the refurbishment project. Phase 2 (2022-2026) of the project includes activities related to the preparation of works in the Refurbishment Project, provision of financial resources and procurement of all approvals and endorsements required. Phase 3 (2027-2028) of the project consists in shutting down Unit 1 and in the actual performance of the works in the Refurbishment Project to the unit installations.  For Unit 2, which started its commercial exploitation in 2007, the refurbishment will be initiated after 2037. The lifespan of new and existing nuclear reactors, their impact on the energy mix and the interconnections, and export of electricity The extension of the operating period of Units 1 and 2 of NPP Cernavoda is an efficient solution considering that extension by another lifecycle costs approximately 40 % of the value of a new equivalent capacity, enabling to secure electricity supply without greenhouse gas emissions, with a low impact on the environment, and at competitive costs, thus sustainably contributing to the decarbonisation of the energy sector and to the achievement of the energy and environment targets by Romania by 2030 in line with the objectives undertaken at European level and even globally (the Paris Agreement). Considering that the construction/operation of future nuclear units at NPP Cernavoda (U3 is commissioned at the end of 2030 and U4 in 2031) overlaps the decommissioning of several power production capacities the lifespan of which ends, the commissioning of the new nuclear units is not projected to have a significant impact on the existing interconnections and/or the export of electricity. Risk prevention and management In order to protect the critical infrastructure against physical and computer attacks, and against calamities, Romania envisages the following policies and measures:  implementing measures for the physical security of the critical infrastructure against potential terrorist acts;  the computer security of electricity grid control systems by strengthening the protection barriers, and by international cooperation;  ensuring maintenance and modernisation works to the overall energy system in order to keep the critical facilities at the required security standards (lakes, dikes, dams etc.);  operationalising population warning/alarm systems and practising civil protection drills. Specifically, the implementation of the Transelectrica projects on standardisation of communication protocols with network operators and the strengthening of efforts to prevent cyberattacks will contribute to the management of such risks. On the other hand, collaboration The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         partnerships between specialised cyber security centres [e.g. CERT-RO (Romanian National Computer Security Incident Response Team)] and private energy operators and support will be provided for projects involving new testing centres for industrial control equipment in terms of cyber security.  Moreover, in the framework of Regulation (EU) 2019/941 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector, the establishment of a competent authority at MEEMA level is envisaged and it will have the following objectives:  to identify the national electricity crisis scenarios;  to prepare and to adopt the risk-preparedness plans (until 5 January 2022);   to test regularly the efficacy of the procedures developed in the risk-preparedness plans for the prevention of electricity crises, including the information exchange and cooperation mechanisms, and to run electricity crisis drills once every two years;  to update the plans every four years, except for where circumstances justify more frequent updates;  to issue early alerts;   to declare the electricity crisis if the authority faces such a situation. In regard to combating climate change, Romania will seek to implement the following policies and measures:  reducing the risk of water deficit;  reducing the risk of flooding;  increasing the safety of dams and dykes;  improving the water infrastructure;  adjusting the existing codes and rules in the field of constructions or other codes and rules in this field in order to ensure consistency with the weather conditions and extreme events;  adapting analysis and risk coverage plans and defence plans to emergency cases related to climate change;  strengthening the local capacity;  increasing the usage rate of preventive measures and good preparedness for emergency situations related to climate in key industries;  enhancing the awareness of private owners of industrial undertakings of adaptation to climate change;  supporting the wider use of insurance against industrial loss caused by weather conditions. ii. Regional cooperation in this area Romania will seek to proactively participate in the European energy diplomacy initiatives49, as follows:  in energy supply crisis situations;  participation in the Central and South Eastern Europe energy connectivity (CESEC) initiative in the natural gas and electricity fields;  securing gas supply by ensuring the correct and ongoing operation of the internal natural gas market;  enabling the application of exceptional measures when the market is unable to supply the required gas quantities, including a solidarity measure of last resort;                                                 49 See CESEC 11742/2017 and Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          establishing clear definition and allocation of responsibilities between the enterprises in the natural gas sector, Member States and the Union as regards preventive actions and the reaction to actual supply disturbances;  establishing transparent mechanisms for coordinating the planning of measures and reactions for certain emergency situations at national, region and Union level. iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds As a priority, Romania will facilitate the funding of the following capacities to ensure a diversified and balanced energy mix with the purpose of securing energy supply by 2030: Type of source   New production capacities (2021-2030)  Capacity (Production of electricity MWe/ Production of heat MWt) SACET (MWe) (MWt) Industrial clients (MWe) (MWt) Nuclear energy CANDU 675   Natural gas CCGT 1 600/ -   Natural gas CHP 1 302 /1 214 952/914 350/300 Hydro (watercourse/reservoir) Units > 10 MW 1 088   RES Wind 2 302   SRE Photovoltaic 3 692   Source: Deloitte calculation based on the information submitted by the INECP Interinstitutional   the construction of a new 200 MW gas-fired block with flexible operation in SE Craiova, which entails the construction of a gas-fired high-efficiency cogeneration unit to supply heat to Craiova Municipality and the economic operators (Ford etc.), which will replace the current lignite-fired energy capacities of 2 x 150 MW;  the construction of a new 400 MW unit with CCGT technology in SE Turceni, which entails the construction of a high-efficiency energy unit with flexible operation (2 gas turbines and one recovery tank + steam turbine), which will replace a current 300 MW lignite-fired capacity in SE Turceni;  entails the construction of high-efficiency energy units with flexible operation, which will replace units 7 and 8 having a current lignite-fired capacity of 2 x 315 MW in SE    speeding up the initiation of the investment for developing a new mixed cycle gas-fired energy capacity in the North-West area (Mintia);  the construction of a new unit of approximately 70 MW in Midia;  which entails developing a new high-efficiency cogeneration unit for production of energy in a combined gas-fired gas-steam cycle technology;  the implementation of a combined cycle cogeneration unit at CTE Bucharest South, which entails developing a new high-efficiency cogeneration unit (gas-steam combined cycle) of approximately 200 MWe and 200 MWt; The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          the implementation of a gas-fired new high-efficiency cogeneration capacity for production of energy at CTE Progresu;  the rehabilitation of the combined cycle of CTE Bucharest West in order to extend its lifespan/implementation of a new combined cycle unit of approximately 186 MWe and 170 Gcal/h; At the same time, having regard to the RES indicative trajectory that must be reached for the time horizon 2022, 2025 and 2027, the RES-E projects will be considered equally a priority and the aim is to deploy an additional wind energy capacity of 2 302 MW and a solar energy capacity of 3 692 MW.  By their participation in the achievement of the targets committed to in this Plan, the projects access to the funds offered through the Modernisation Fund and the Just Transition Fund in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner
