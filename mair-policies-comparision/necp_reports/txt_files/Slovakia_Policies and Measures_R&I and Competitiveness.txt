3.5. Dimension: Research, innovation and competitiveness i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.5 Basic climate change signs and greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements bring with them the need for a basic awareness in the population of energy sectors and of technologies that reduce negative environmental impacts. The greatest prerequisites for awareness raising and support for public information are in the areas of RES support, energy efficiency and energy savings. These are the cross-sectional areas of the energy industry that can help developments across the economy. Basic information on sustainability and its associated energy and RES savings should be part of the tuition as early as at elementary school, bringing into peoples lives these ideas on sustainable lifestyles. In this respect, it would be advisable to develop a National Strategy for raising awareness in the field of energy efficiency, targeting the public from children to specialists and manufacturers. The strategy should support the development of awareness and education for the lay and professional public on energy efficiency, support the implementation of information campaigns on energy efficiency and support the implementation of consultancy and training projects for state and local government employees in the field of energy efficiency, with the aim of monitoring and evaluating energy savings, as well as the design of measures for the efficient use of public funds in the field of energy efficiency. Education in basic funding and the available financial instruments will help to improve energy efficiency and RES development. The national strategy should assume smart metering systems that are the basis for information about consumption, or about generation from customers own distributed sources. ii. Where applicable, cooperation with other Member States in this area, including, where appropriate, information on how the SET Plan objectives and policies are being translated to a national context (SET Plan) Slovakia is widely involved in international activities in research, development and innovation through bilateral agreements on scientific and technological cooperation with EU countries and outside the EU. Slovakia is a member of the IEA, through university and SAS workplaces, it participates in scientific and technological cooperation within the EU through the 7th EU Framework  Programme (7th EU FP) and EURATOM. Promoting science and research is one of the priorities of the EU 2020 Strategy. The European Commission has adopted the strategic document Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan), which represents the technological pillar of the EUs energy policy. Through one of the industrial initiatives related to nuclear energy, Slovakia is involved in the Allegro project (cooperation in nuclear energy between Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic and France). iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds These financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds were included in earlier chapters.
