42 2. National objectives and targets 2.1. Dimension decarbonisation 2.1.1. GHG emissions and removals i. The elements set out in point (a)(1) of Article 4 1. ESR target As regards Demission reduction target of 35% by 2030 (compared with 2005 levels) for non-ETS sectors. This is 5% higher than the European average under Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of 30 May 2018 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013. To that end, the various entities will implement the following measures:  Federal State In view of its federal powers and its policy of supporting the Regions in achieving their joint climate targets, the Federal State will pursue existing internal policies and measures, implement the measures recommended in the NECP and adopt new measures contributing to the achievement of GHG reduction targets.  If those measures prove impossible or insufficient, the Federal State will propose alternative federal policies and measures with a similar effect to those that could not be implemented. The federal measures will continue to be updated, as far as possible, as part of the NECP assessments. The Federal State will, if possible, quantify its measures in terms of resources and results as part of the biennial assessment of the policies and measures.  Flemish Region Non-ETS target 2021-2030 The Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) requires Member States to reduce their annual GHG emissions in non-ETS sectors over the period 2021-2030 by way of a linear trajectory. This linear trajectory for Belgium is as follows: - The start point is in May 2019 and is based on average non-ETS emissions in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018. - The end point is in 2030 and is based on a reduction in non-ETS emissions, compared with the year 2005, in line with the target set for Belgium in the ESR, namely 35%. - This linear trajectory then determines the annual emission allocations for the intermediate years of 2021 to 2029. The final annual emission allocations for the years 2021-2030 will not be set by the European Commission until 2020, based on the non-ETS emissions in the base years (2005, 2016, 2017 and 2018) as indicated in the emissions inventory submitted by the Member States in that year. The approach taken in this Flemish Energy and Climate Plan assumes that the trajectory for each region is structured in the same way as the trajectories for the Member States. Pending an intra-Belgium distribution of the Belgian non-ETS target of -35%, the precise target for Flanders is not yet known. In this plan, the Flemish annual emission allocations are based on an (indicative) non-ETS reduction target of -35% and the inventory data that is currently available for 2005, 2016 and 2017, supplemented by the provisional inventory data for 2018.  European calculation methods, which are not yet formally set out in the European regulations, will be used to determine the end point of the trajectory. The non-ETS emissions for 2005 will therefore be recalculated based on the non-ETS target for 2020. 43 If we look at the most recent emissions inventory, this 2005 recalculated non-ETS emission allocation is 47.8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (Mt CO2eq), which is higher than the actual emission allocation in 2005 for non-ETS sectors, based on the years 2013-2020. The actual emission allocation is 46.1 Mt CO2eq. The difference between these two allocations can be explained by the way in which the changes made to the scope of the EU ETS (during the transition from the period 2008-2012 to the period 2013-2020) were calculated by the European Commission when defining the non-ETS trajectory for the period 2013-2020. The 35% reduction target based on the 2005 recalculated non-ETS emissions (which are higher than the actual 2005 non-ETS emissions) equates to an indicative reduction target of 32.6% by 2030 compared with the actual 2005 non-ETS emissions. In this plan, the reductions made will always relate to a given sector compared with the 2005 actual emissions, given that the 2005 recalculated allocation cannot be distributed between different sectors. The precise emission allocation cannot therefore be finally set until a later date. We would point out that there are still currently some uncertainties about the indicative emission allocation used in this plan:  The calculation method for defining the 2030 end point has yet to be formally confirmed by the Commission.  The emissions inventory for 2018 is only provisional. The annual emission allocations for the period 2021-2030 will be finally set using the baseline annual emissions in the Flemish greenhouse gas inventory 1990-2018, which will be submitted in early 2020 to the European Commission.  A technical issue relating to the fluorinated gas monitoring methodology will be explained further on. This issue may have a significant impact on the Flemish non-ETS emissions for the baseline years. If this technical issue ultimately results in an amendment, its impact will be indicated in the aforementioned inventory. Unlike the current period 2013-2020, from the 2021 compliance year an annual emissions breakdown will no longer be required. The compliance cycle is described in the Governance Regulation.  The Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) stipulates that the Member States will continue to report every year on their emissions, even for the period after 2021-2030. The Commission will also continue to verify every year, through an initial check, the accuracy of reported emissions. The emissions inventories of the Member States will be examined in depth only twice during this period: once in 2027 (for the years 2021-2025) and once in 2032 (for the years 2026-2030). Following this in-depth examination, the Commission will officially set the non-ETS emissions for each Member State for each year of the five-year period and may reintroduce the breakdown requirement. This would mean Member States having to indicate, on an annual basis, compliance units to cover their non-ETS emissions. They could use for this purpose, for a short period of time, the various flexibility options available to them through the ESR and the LULUCF Regulation. The compliance of each Member State would then be formally established. Any shortfalls noted in a given year would be multiplied by a compliance factor of 1.08 and added to the emissions for the following year.  Overview of emissions and projections for 2005-2030 Overview of projection results In terms of sectoral distribution, this plan uses the inventory categories used in European and international reporting formats, namely the CRF categories. In Chapters 4 and 5 of this plan, the main categories of the non-ETS sectors (transport, buildings, agriculture, industry and waste) are also subdivided into sub-categories. In 2018, the transport sector (36%) and the buildings sector (28%) contributed the most to total non-ETS GHG emissions in Flanders (Figure 2.1). The agriculture and non-ETS industry sectors accounted for a smaller share of non-ETS emissions at 17% and 14% respectively. The waste sector contributed the smallest amount at 5%. 44 Sectoral shares of Flemish non-ETS GHG emissions in 2018  Afval Waste Industrie Industry Gebouwen Buildings Landbouw Agriculture Transport Transport  The figure gives an overview of the non-ETS GHG emissions by sector during the period 2005-2030 based on the 2005-2017 inventories, the provisional 2018 inventory and the projections to 2030. There are two scenarios with regard to the projections: - olicy measures. - explained further on in this plan. Non-ETS GHG emissions in Flanders fell by 5% from 46.1 Mt CO2eq in 2005 (actual non-ETS emissions in 2005) to 43.8 Mt CO2eq in 2018. According to the projections, the WEM scenario results in an 11.8% reduction by 2030 compared with the 2005 recalculated non-ETS emissions (which equates to an 8.6% reduction compared with the actual 2005 figures). Taking account of the measures included in this plan, the projections indicate that non-ETS emissions will fall by 32.6% by 2030 compared with the 2005 recalculated non-ETS emissions in the WAM scenario (which equates to a 30.1% reduction compared with the actual 2005 figures). In the draft plan approved in July 2018, projections were made for the BU scenario (equivalent to the WAM scenario in this plan), which indicated a 35% reduction in non-ETS emissions in Flanders compared with 2005 levels. The main reason for this difference between the projections of the policy scenario in the 2018 draft plan and those of the WAM scenario in this plan is a sophisticated methodology for determining the projection for the buildings sector. In the draft plan (climate part), a top-down approach was used for the buildings sector, which was based on a target of an average EPB index of 100 kWh/m² for residential buildings in 2050, by combining an extensive renovation process to achieve the renovation objectives and a drastic reduction in the use of fossil fuels. The projections were then determined for the period 2021-2030 by interpolation between 2017 and 2050. However, in this plan (climate part under energy efficiency), the projections for the buildings sector are based on a bottom-up calculation of the impact of planned policy measures. Furthermore, adaptations have also been made in other sectors when calculating the projections by using the most recent inventory database and small technical corrections. 45 Non-ETS GHG emissions in Flanders 2005-2030 (Mt CO2eq)  Emissie (Mton CO2-eq) Emissions (Mt CO2eq) Afval Waste Industrie Industry Landbouw Agriculture Gebouwen Buildings Transport Transport Totaal Total  Over the period 2005-2018, reductions were mainly recorded in the buildings sector (-22%) and the waste sector (-21%). In the next few years, in the WAM scenario, an additional reduction of 40% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels is estimated in the buildings sector. The agricultural sector stabilised between 2005 and 2018 (+1%). In the WAM scenario, a 25% reduction is estimated in the agricultural sector by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. An increase of 1% was recorded in the transport sector over the period 2005-2018. Given the policy intentions, the trend observed in the transport sector is expected to reverse by falling 23% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. In the industry sector, emissions rose by 36% between 2005 and 2018, but, once again, this trend is expected to reverse with a 16% reduction by 2030 compared with 2005 levels.  Assessment of the non-ETS target 2021-2030 In Figure 2.3, the projection scenarios are compared with the non-ETS allocations for the period 2021-2030 (see also point 2.1.1.1). The WEM scenario results in a shortfall from 2021 onwards, which amounts to 11 Mt CO2eq by 2030 (on an annual basis) or 59 Mt CO2eq by 2030 (total for the period 2021-2030). In the WAM scenario, minor shortfalls are expected from 2023 onwards, which amount to 1.1 Mt CO2eq by 2030 (on an annual basis) or 3.8 Mt CO2eq by 2030 (total for the period 2021-2030). In the plan approved in 2018, no shortfall was estimated for the BU scenario (equivalent to the WAM scenario in this plan) for the period 2021-2030. The main reason for the shortfall estimated in the WAM scenario in this plan is the sophisticated methodology used to determine the projection for the buildings sector, as indicated in point 2.1.1.2.1. Based on the WEM scenario for 2021-2030, the cost of inaction is roughly estimated at between EUR 1.8 billion and EUR 3.0 billion, using an estimated unit price of emission allocations between EUR 30 and EUR 50. The costs are likely to increase year on year. Using the same unit price assumptions, the costs for the WAM scenario could be between EUR 0.1 billion and EUR 0.2 billion. 46 When interpreting the results of the WEM and WAM scenarios, various uncertainties inherent in projections must, however, be taken into account. We can mention in this respect exogenous assumptions in various sectors (including economic growth, fuel prices, demographic change and degree-days) and a series of policy assumptions. A biennial progress assessment must monitor the reduction path and ensure that this stays on course. Assessment of the non-ETS target 2021-2030  Emissie (Mton CO2-eq) Emissions (Mt CO2eq) Emissieruimte Emission allocations  Application of flexibility mechanisms The ESR provides for several flexibilities that Member States can use to achieve their targets in the period 2021-2030 if they have insufficient emission allocations. In addition to keeping some flexibilities (banking, borrowing and transferring emission allocations) from the period 2013-2020, certain mechanisms have been abolished (purchase of allocations from CDM and JI projects) and new mechanisms have been established (ETS flexibility and LULUCF flexibility). The ESR imposes a quantitative limit on the use of a number of flexible instruments. The distribution between the Regions of access to these flexibilities forms part of the intra-Belgian burden-sharing exercise in relation to the climate targets for 2030. For the period 2021-2030, some Member States can also, to a limited extent, auction fewer ETS emission allowances and benefit from an additional quantity of emission allocations for the non-ETS sectors. This flexibility is limited for Belgium to 2% of non-ETS emissions in 2005 on an annual basis. If Member States want to use this flexibility, they must inform the European Commission before 31 December 2019. As it is not clearly known whether a flexibility offer will be made to the market by other Member States, Flanders will propose that Belgium informs the European Commission that it intends to use this flexibility.  47 Walloon Region  2008-2012 2020 2030 2050 GHG -7.5%/1990 -30%/1990 (Climate Decree) -14.7%/2005 for non-ETS (burden sharing) -37% non-ETS/2005 -80% to -95%/1990 RE  13% of gross final energy consumption (burden sharing: 14,850 GWh) 23.5% of gross final energy consumption  EE   -23% of final energy/2005   GHG target and link with the ESR The following graph shows a comparison for Wallonia between the GHG emission inventories for 2005 and 2015, and the two projected scenarios with existing measures (WEM) and with the additional measures (WAM) set out in Chapter 3. Trends in GHG emissions in Wallonia in non-ETS sectors  Évolution des émissions de GES pour les secteurs non-ETS Trends in GHG emissions in non-ETS sectors Autres Other Déchets Waste Agriculture Agriculture Tertiaire Tertiary Résidentiel Residential Transport Transport Industrie Industry  Energy (electricity generation)  48 It should be noted that the overall projected effects of the new policies and measures will be a 37% reduction in emissions from non-ETS sectors compared with 2005 (-24.5% if policies remain unchanged). This 37% reduction includes a biofuel incorporation rate of 14% by 2030 according to the trajectory set out in the NECP. This percentage may change in response to national debates.  It should be noted that the ESR 2030 trajectory is calculated by applying a correction due to changes in the scope of the ETS since 2005: some businesses were included in the ETS between the periods of 2008-2012 and 2013-2020 and their emissions must therefore be excluded from the ESR trajectory. As the change in scope only became effective in 2013, the 2005 emissions reported in the inventory include businesses that since then have been included in the ETS. A correction is therefore necessary, which has been made in accordance with European rules. A correction of the same type has been made for the period 2013-2020: a 14.7% reduction applied to the 2005 data in order to remove from the trajectory the emissions transferred to the ETS. For that reason, the 2020 trajectory corresponds to an apparent reduction of 18.46% compared with non-ETS emissions as reported for 2005. The overall trajectory to 2030 indicated as a percentage in this plan takes account of this correction.  Brussels Capital Region Faced with the climate emergency, the Brussels Government is taking responsibility in this plan and intends to make an ambitious contribution to the Belgian GHG emission reduction target for 2030. At the same time, because short-term efforts are not sufficient and must be developed into a long-term perspective (2050), the government has decided to equip the region with a long-term strategy based on binding -region. This strategy will be rapidly introduced as part of the implementation of the Governance Regulation, but will then be examined in depth and submitted to wide-ranging public debate. This challenge can only be solved if the people of Brussels share a vision. The government will therefore initiate a public debate, bringing together Brussels residents, economic, social and institutional operators, transition - The Brussels Capital Region, like other large cities in Europe and worldwide, wants to commit to tackling climate change. To do so, the government wants to prioritise the reduction of fossil fuel emissions in the policies developed during all future parliamentary terms. The government is therefore setting a double cap in this plan in order to define a long-term vision.  - By 2030, the quantifiable measures in this plan must together result in a 40% reduction in direct emissions from the non-ETS sector. In order for Brussels to -region, the government will, however, reinforce the interim commitments and the measures currently included in this Brussels contribution to the NECP so that there is a 40% reduction in GHG emissions (compared with 2005 levels) by 2030. - By 2050, the region undertakes to be close to the European carbon neutrality target. In order to reduce the rgovernment has therefore decide to include a framework for reducing indirect emissions in the regional climate policy. This will ensure consistency in the fight against climate change and show solidarity with the other regions and areas on which we depend.   2. LULUCF targets Belgium undertakes to comply with at least Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 and therefore with the non-debit rule. The various entities will therefore make the following efforts: 49 Flemish Region Land use, land use change and forestry, shortened to LULUCF, is a sector in the GHG inventory that covers the emission and storage (immission, capture, sequestration) of greenhouse gases stemming from use of the land, changes in land use and forestry activities. The target that applies to all Member States for the period 2021-2030 is the no-debit rule. This means that existing carbon stocks at the beginning of the period must, according to the rules defined in the LULUCF Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2018/841), at least remain the same at the end of the period, subject to the permitted flexibility. This does not mean that none of the land use categories can cause an emission, but rather that carbon stocks as a whole cannot fall. In particular, credits (carbon storage) from a given land use category can be used to offset a shortfall (carbon emission) in another land use category. The LULUCF Regulation sets annual net emissions or net storage for two sub-periods, namely 2021-2025 and 2026-2030. Member States that record a surplus receive credits in this case and can sell them to Member States that record a shortfall. Another possibility is to use these credits, to a limited extent, to comply with the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) target. On the other hand, any shortfall must be offset by purchasing LULUCF credits from Member States (or regions) that have a surplus or by using, without limitation, their own emission allocations from ESR sectors. Flanders has set itself the target of complying with the no-debit rule without having to purchase additional LULUCF emission allocations within Belgium or from other Member States and without using its own scarce ESR emission allocations.  Walloon Region LULUCF commitments In accordance with the LULUCF Regulation, the forest reference level (FRL) is based on the forest management observed during the period 2000-2009 and does not take account of current trends in species changes. According to the data that is currently available, an alternative scenario taking account of such species changes, particularly the gradual replacement of spruce with Douglas fir, would result in a slightly higher sink during the period 2021-2030, given that the Douglas fir is more productive. If this trend continues, forest management accounting based on the FRL could result in a net sink in the order of 105 kt CO2 per year. However, this projection is very uncertain, particularly given that around half of the Walloon forest belongs to private owners, with its management being guided by various factors. Furthermore, the afforestation/deforestation balance currently represents a net emission source (308 kt CO2 in 2017) and cropland/grassland management, according to the accounting rules, also seems to be an emission source in the order of 89 kt CO2/year for 2013-2016. These estimates need to be confirmed as the land use change matrix is currently being updated and could alter these figures. Furthermore, no projection of land use in 2030 is currently available. Given these changes in methodology and the significant uncertainty about developments to 2030, in terms of both forest management and land use, it is not currently possible to determine whether the sector will be a carbon sink or a net source in 2021-2030 according to the rules of the LULUCF Regulation, even though several measures aim to help maintain or increase carbon stocks (see point 3.1.1(i)). Given these points, Wallonia is therefore assuming that it will simply comply with the non-debit rule and neutrality in the LULUCF sector, without using the flexibilities between LULUCF and ESR.  50 ii. Where applicable, other national objectives and targets consistent with the Paris Agreement and the existing long-term strategies. Where applicable for the contribution to the overall Union commitment of reducing the GHG emissions, other objectives and targets, including sector targets and adaptation goals, if available In 2010, Belgium adopted the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (24). This describes the main consequences of climate change, the measures taken to adapt, the roadmap to a future national adaptation plan for 2020-2030 and the different strategic guidelines for the development of adaptation policy. The strategy has three objectives: - improve consistency between adaptation activities in Belgium (assessment of the impact of climate change, vulnerability to climate change and the adaptation measures already implemented); - improve communication at national, European and international level; - start developing a national action plan. The National Adaptation Plan was adopted on 19 April 2017 by the National Climate Commission. It sets out 11 national measures to reinforce cooperation and develop synergies between the various governments (federal, regions) on the subject of adaptation. Belgium will continue implementing this plan and its updates, particularly the measure designed to assess the impact of climate change on security of supply and energy transmission and distribution infrastructure in order   Federal State Long-term strategy The long-term vision for sustainable development, established by the Royal Decree of 18 July 2013, sets long-emissions by at least 80% by 2050 compared with 1990 levels. Objective 32 states and indirect impact of the consequences of National Adaptation Plan (adopted on 28 October 2016 by the Council of Ministers) (25) aims to respond to the need to: - strengthen the capacity to assess, anticipate and respond to the risks associated with climate change impacts (improvement of knowledge); - anticipate and mitigate risks and maximise any benefits of climate change. Buildings  Scenario of the progressive banning of the placing on the market/installation of boilers using fossil fuels (from 2035, heating oil boilers will no longer be sold).  Make the federal authorities carbon-neutral, make buildings energy-neutral and make mobility climate-neutral by 2040, taking into account the existing building stock, technical, legal and HR constraints, accessibility of public buildings and continuity of public services. Mobility & Transport  Decarbonisation and reduction of externalities in relation to the environmental aspects (pollution, noise, etc.) and the societal aspects (accidents, congestion, public health, etc.) of mobility in Belgium with a switch to zero-emission vehicles as the ultimate objective.                                                            24 National Climate Commission, 2010.

Federal contribution to the National Adaptation Plan. http://www.climat.be/index.php/download_file/view/1628/1205/  51  Promote and regulate alternative fuels such as biofuels (taking account of an overall bio-based policy) and, in this context, enhance the sustainability criteria of biofuels at European level and limit the use of problematic alternatives and gradually exclude them.  The objective is to reach a modal share in terms of the use of environmentally friendly modes of travel (walking/bicycles/electric motorised vehicles limited to 25 km/hour and speed pedelecs) for commuting by 2030. In addition, mobility plans for pedestrians will also be promoted.   Promotion of the electrification of transport: electric cars and electric bicycles, scooters, mopeds and motorcycles, etc.  Green the vehicle fleet of public authorities (exemplary role) with zero-emission vehicles as the ultimate objective.  In the maritime sector, and in consultation with other Member States, Belgium will explore the introduction of a mechanism to ensure a transition to carbon-neutral energy sources at national and international level, as well as the introduction or strengthening of emission standards. To that end, a step-by-step plan is to be developed for shipping in Belgium. In parallel, active cooperation at international level should continue and proposals for measures should be submitted to and supported by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).  Within the framework of the interfederal cooperation agreement on sustainable mobility, taxes and regulations on monowheels, bicycles, scooters, mopeds, electric motorcycles and light electric vehicles will be assessed and, if necessary, reviewed in terms of tackling environmental and mobility issues, so that there is a clear framework for these modes of transport to confidently take their place in the mobility offer.  An interfederal cooperation agreement on mobility will be concluded by 1 January 2021 on the basis of consultations between the Federal State and the Regions on specific subjects (e.g. public transport, transport taxes, etc.) for which an interfederal agreement is necessary in order to implement certain measures included in this plan. Circular economy  Action plan for a strong circular economy in which raw materials last, are reused and retain their usefulness for as long as possible.  By means of sustainable public procurement, public authorities will give the necessary impetus to the market to commit to a decarbonised transition of the economy (by greening their vehicle fleets, purchasing green electricity, purchasing according to the principles of the circular economy, choosing appropriate tender selection criteria, etc.). Tax instruments, public finances and financial regulation  Shifting of charges from raw materials with less fossil material content to raw materials with more fossil material content.  Gradual phasing out of the support given to fossil fuels.  Bring financial flows into line with the transition to a low-carbon economy. Organisation of the labour market  Ensure a fair transition. Education and awareness-raising  Focus on changing mindsets through initiatives in the areas of teaching, education and cultural awareness-raising, with particular attention being paid to the importance of raising awareness of the environmental impact of consumption and with the aim of motivating, stimulating and informing the public to change their behaviour and continue to engage. 52  Provide information on the climate issue and climate policy, and encourage the public to initiate and strengthen climate actions (behavioural and investment changes).  Commitment to education, public awareness, public participation, public access to information and public debate under Article 12 of the Paris Agreement in order to strengthen support for the transition to carbon neutrality among stakeholders and the general public. Governance  Establishment of a robust system of governance, throughout the cycle of planning, implementing, assessing and refining the various components of energy and climate policy.  Strengthening and optimisation of existing governance structures.  Alignment of internal governance structures with the arrangements put in place at European level (Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action) and international level (Paris Rulebook).  Optimisation of the complementarity and synergies between the measures implemented at federal and regional level, in particular through the systematic application of the principle of mutuality (each entity verifies the potential impact of a measure on the climate policy of another entity and endeavours to act to strengthen the effectiveness of the measures of all the other levels of power). International cooperation  Remain at the forefront at international level and build on strong and ambitious climate collaboration and diplomacy.  Ensure that Belgium makes a fair contribution to international climate financing. Adaptation  Objectives of the federal contribution to the National Adaptation Plan (26): o strengthen the capacity to assess, anticipate and respond to the risks associated with climate change impacts (improvement of knowledge); o anticipate and mitigate risks and maximise any benefits of climate change.  Walloon Region Transport Development and distribution of demand The Walloon Government has set ambitious targets for mobility. These are outlined in the FAST Vision, particularly in terms of passenger-kilometres and tonne-kilometres, and are indicated in the following tables. Passenger mobility (passenger-kilometres): Distribution of passenger-kilometres  2017 2030 Walking 3% 5% Cycling 1% 5% Bus 4% 10% Train 9% 15% Car 83% 60% Average occupancy rate per car 1.3 persons 1.8 persons  This table takes account of a 5% reduction in demand for passenger transport.                                                            26 Federal Public Service Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment, 2016. Federal contribution to the National Adaptation Plan. http://www.climat.be/index.php/download_file/view/1628/1205/ 53 Other modes of transport that are currently being developed may also be added to this vision, such as motorised two-wheelers travelling at more than 25 km/h (mopeds, speed pedelecs) or electric scooters. Freight mobility (tonne-kilometres): Distribution of tonne-kilometres  2017 2030 Rail 4% 7% Water 14% 18% Road 82% 75%  Compliance with these targets will ensure that GHG emissions from transport are reduced by at least 24% compared with 2005 levels, which is the target set in the NECP. In order to promote progress towards the extremely ambitious targets set in the FAST 2030 Vision, certain measures have been supported through the Walloon Investment Plan, mainly with a view to improving mobility in Wallonia. The Regional Mobility Strategy is an action plan for achieving the FAST 2030 Vision, and provides general guidelines for meeting those targets.  Change in and greening of the vehicle fleet - Greening of the private vehicle fleet The 2030 fleet composition target set out below may need to be adapted to medium-term developments that cannot currently be foreseen, such as developments in technology, changes in the price of equipment or the various energy sources, market launches of new products, etc. At present, the transport sector consumes petroleum products on an almost exclusive basis, and diesel accounts for a significant share of this figure (56% of the car fleet in 2018, i.e. 1.8 million vehicles in the Walloon Region). Diesel engines are also used in almost all other vehicles (lorries, buses, vans, tractors, etc.).  Eventually, the aim is to increase the share of alternative fuels in the energy mix of transport, with, in the meantime, a (presumed) temporary transition to fossil fuels with significantly reduced climate and environmental effects. These changes will be coordinated with the targets set under the National Action Plan adopted pursuant to Directive 2014/94/EU on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure. They will also be dovetailed with the targets set under the Energy Pact, mainly in terms of electric vehicles, which should see their share substantially increase from 2030 with an annual renewal rate of the fleet set at 25% (i.e. between 40,000 and 45,000 electric vehicles/year from 2030). Trends in the private vehicle fleet  2019 2030 Diesel (including micro-hybrids) 52.52% (0.06%) 17% (3%) Petrol (including micro-hybrids) 46.36% (0.9%) 40% (13%) CNG 0.07% 18% BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) 0.13% 19% PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) 0.23% 5% Hydrogen 0% 1%  In addition to the regional measures aimed at achieving these targets, account should be taken, in discussions, of market developments as a result of the expected reduction in production costs of electric vehicles and European obligations on average emissions of vehicles sold by motor vehicle manufacturers, and more specifically the application of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009. The targets indicated in Table 5 will be refined based on technological and market developments and the potential of each type of engine in terms of its environmental, economic and social impacts. 54 - Diversification of the bus fleet The TEC Group has already started greening its in-house fleet, which numbers around 1,850 buses. This process commenced with the purchase of 11 plug-in hybrid electric buses in 2016 and 71 in 2017. By 2020, 298 hybrid buses will be in use in Wallonia (i.e. 15% of the in-house bus fleet).  From 2021, the obligations under Directive 2009/33/EC, as amended by Directive (EU) 2019/1161, will have to be strictly fulfilled. They will require the bus and tram operator Opérateur de transport wallon (OTW) to engage in a structured reflection on the development of its fleet, which should ideally be incorporated in the Regional Mobility Strategy for the long term. It is already evident that Article 34 of the Service Contract signed between Wallonia and OTW for the period 2019-2024 provides for an ambitious approach to improving the environmental indicators of public transport, with an overall target of reducing GHG emissions by 30%, in particular by diversifying energy sources for vehicles already in use. If this target is met, the obligations under Directive 2009/33/EC, as amended by Directive (EU) 2019/1161, for the period from 2 August 2021 to 31 December 2005 will be fulfilled (share of category M3 vehicles meeting the requirements of the Directive in the indicative period for Belgium). Trends in the bus fleet  2018 2030 Diesel (including micro-hybrids) 96% 50% (15%) CNG  10% BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle)  20% PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) 4% 15% Hydrogen  5%  - Greening of goods transport by lorry and van The issue of logistics and freight must be considered hand in hand with specific structural support for those technologies most suited to fuel transfer. In this context, the breakthrough of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in heavy freight will enable savings in terms of both energy consumption and emissions (CO2 and local air pollutants). In the case of shorter heavy logistics (less than 150 km per day), it will also be important to improve the potential of hybrid or pure electric lorries as the technology develops (the first fully electric lorries are still currently being tested). Eventually, hydrogen could become an important fuel in this respect. At the moment, it is difficult to foresee the developments in technology that could allow this segment to be electrified. However, it seems reasonable to consider that one quarter of the lorry fleet could be converted to natural gas based on 2012 levels. Trends in the lorry fleet  2019 2030 Diesel 10% 75% CNG (all technologies) 0% 25%  The case of vans also merits special attention. The Walloon van fleet currently stands at 240,000 vehicles (category N1), but has increased considerably since 1990 (it has tripled). This growth is mainly explained by the introduction (on 1 April 2016) of the tax per kilometre for vehicles with a maximum permissible mass of more than 3.5 tonnes and by the growth in online sales. Further growth in online sales of 60% by 2030 could lead to a considerable expansion in this road segment. - Roll-out of transport infrastructure The following infrastructure will need to be rolled out: 1. LNG stations: 25 LNG stations will have to be operational by 2030, mainly along arterial roads. 55 2. CNG stations: 220 CNG stations will have to be operational in Wallonia by 2030. Some of these will be decentralised so that gas can be distributed directly from local biomethanisation plants. 3. Support will be provided to the biogas sector so that it can supply a growing share of gas on the basis of short supply chains (5% biogas in 2025 and 15% in 2030). Although the natural gas network is well-established in Wallonia, biogas can be used to cover areas that are not connected to this network. 4. Charging points for electric vehicles: 6,900 public charging points will be installed. A total of 185,000 charging points will be needed for B2B solutions. This roll-out must be consistent with the Corporate Mobility Plan, which encourages the use of low-emission or zero-emission vehicles in company fleets.  5. Hydrogen stations: it is estimated that 10 stations (mainly for HGVs) will be required by 2025 and 20 stations by 2030 in connection with the transition to hydrogen.  Walloon Region  Specific fluorinated gas target Fluorinated greenhouse  GHG emissions. Unit emissions from certain pieces of technical equipment can be very high. This is particularly true for cooling equipment in the retail sector, which can contain significant quantities of refrigerant gas with a global warming potential of almost 4,000 and high leakage rates. For example, the global warming potential of the gas emitted by a piece of cooling equipment containing 1 tonne of refrigerant gas with an annual leakage rate of 5% is equivalent to burning 75,000 litres of heating oil. Steps must therefore be taken to prevent these emissions, in particular because alternative technologies using refrigerants with low or zero global warming potential are now available. The cost-benefit ratio of GHG emission reduction measures in the fluorinated gas sector has been assessed as good. The overall target is to reduce fluorinated GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels (in line with the Kigali Agreement (27)).  2.1.2. Renewable energy i. The elements set out in point (a)(2) of Article 4 An agreement has been reached at European level to set an overall EU target of at least 32% renewable energy by 2030. to this target will consist of the total contributions of the various entities and will be 17.5% by 2030 according to the following table.

Every two years, a study will examine the following aspects: technical feasibility of the incorporation rate; availability of raw materials; environmental integrity and potential usage conflicts; availability of advanced fuels, including recycled carbon fuels, and technological developments on the European market; availability of other renewable energy sources; consumer costs. The first of these interfederal studies will be carried out in the second half of 2020, after consulting the relevant stakeholders, and will allow the incorporation rate to be adjusted, if necessary. If the target is not met, alternative federal measures will be implemented to achieve the same level of emissions reduction and to contribute to the renewable energy target. The Regions may themselves adopt additional alternative measures, if they so wish.  Flemish Region Based on an update of the sub-targets in the Energy Plan 2020, additional growth is anticipated in the generation of renewable energy in Flanders. This presumed growth will particularly stem from the future development of green heat and also solar and wind energy. The projections for Flanders, taking into account additional policy measures, therefore indicate a total renewable energy generation in Flanders of 28,512 GWh in 2030, which is an increase of 812 GWH over the draft Flemish Energy Plan of July 2018, which projected a figure of 27,700 GWh.  Walloon Region In its resolution of 28 September 2017, the Walloon parliament called on the government to set a target of 100% renewable energy in the final energy consumption of Wallonia by 2050. The Energy Pact drafted by the four Belgian Energy Ministers in December 2017 set a target of 40% renewable electricity by 2030.  57 Renewable energy targets GWh Achieved in 2015 Achieved in 2016 2020 target 2030 target WEM (28) WAM (29) Electricity Heating Transport* 4,060 8,108 906 4,463 8,706 1,596 5,555 8,900 2,382 5,691 9,170 2,263 10,081 14,233 3,187 Final consumption of renewables 13,073 14,765 16,837 17,124 27,501 Gross final consumption 121,700 124,194 120,770 131,955 117,032 Share of RES in final consumption 10.74% 11.89% 13.94% 12.98% 23.50%  * Biofuels (incorporation rate of 14% set by the Federal Government) and biogas only (renewable electricity for transport   The envisaged policies and measures will lead to a total share of renewable energy sources of 23.5% in 2030, i.e. 10.5 percentage points more than the scenario with existing measures. The highest share in the WAM scenario compared with the WEM scenario results not only from an increase in renewable generation, but also from a reduction in gross final energy consumption.

The strategy and policy for the development of renewable energy in Brussels will ensure that they:  are adapted to the availability and scarcity of the natural resources needed for this purpose;  remain consistent with the water policy (in particular the installation of green roofs to delay flooding, etc.).  Targets  Intra muros  The context for setting the renewable energy target for Brussels for 2030 is complex. The dense urban configuration, proximity of the national airport (which prevents wind projects) and large number of tenants (which are specific regional characteristics that make uniform and rapid deployment of renewable energy complex) will all have an impact during the period 2021-2030 on the generation of renewable energy in the Brussels Capital Region.  1. Firstly, bio-waste flows that are currently recovered at the Neder-Over-Heembeek incinerator will be reduced (see above).  2. Secondly, the use of bioliquids in cogeneration plants is set to gradually reduce. The volatility of rapeseed will undoubtedly prevent new investments in this segment.  3. Thirdly, public health imperatives will gradually reduce the use of solid biomass (wood and coal segment) in the coming years due to its emissions of fine particulate matter.  4. Finally, Eurostat recently provided us with clarification on how to deal with the incinerator-turbine coupling at Neder-Over-Heembeek in our figures. The result is a decrease in the contribution from this installation of approximately 80 GWh due to the ban on including energy consumed internally during the process, which was previously included in the regional accounting. 59 Despite this intrinsic context, the region fully intends to continue the intra muros roll-out of renewable energy sources suited to the urban context. The combined target set for the electricity and heating and cooling sectors is therefore 470 GWh by 2030. By way of comparison, the revised figures for 2020 incorporating the Eurostat information indicate a combined level of renewable energy for electricity and heating of around 330 GWh. The table below shows the expected trend in the use of renewable energy sources in the regional territory between 2021 and 2030. In view of the division of powers, the efforts made by Brussels, as indicated in this table, concern only the generation of electricity, heating and cooling using renewable sources (30).

The Energy Pact also focuses on a future based on the increased and very significant use of renewable energy sources. Despite its significant current and future efforts, the Brussels Capital Region has limited capacity in its territory. Renewable energy resources are, however, available (sometimes at a better price) in neighbouring territories or ones that are relatively close to the region. In this context, the region therefore also wants to develop a policy of extra muros investment in new renewable energy generation plants by, for example, setting up joint projects with other Member States or other cooperation mechanisms provided for Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Such investments should enable the region to have an additional 700 GWh in order to reach the threshold of 1,170 GWh of renewable energy in 2030, by combining the intra muros efforts in the electricity and heating sectors with extra muros efforts. This should enable the region to play a full role in the European and Energy Pact processes.  This investment strategy is yet to be refined, but a choice based on the generation of electricity from renewable sources would be consistent with the prospects of increased electrification of a number of uses. These included heat with heat pumps and transport with electromobility.  The region currently imports over 90% of the energy that it consumes and this extra muros investment policy would therefore significantly develop the rand contribute to the reduction of regional indirect emissions.  ii. Estimated trajectories for the sectoral share of renewable energy in final energy consumption from 2021 to 2030 in the electricity, heating and cooling, and transport sectors In 2017, 18.2% of the electricity generated in Belgium came from renewable sources.                                                            30 Renewable energy in the transport sector (included in the template for the NECP) is the responsibility of the Federal State. 60  Federal State   Offshore: In 2020, the final three wind farms will be constructed and the total capacity will reach 2,261 MW. A call for tender system will be set up to handle the next wave of offshore wind energy. Given that much of this area is within the Natura 2000 area, studies will be carried out in advance of the calls for tender in order to resolve any issues connected with this area. The first study, which is already being carried out by the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences (Institut royal des Sciences naturelles de Belgique  IRSNB), will specifically look at the impact of wind farms on this Natura 2000 area. Its first results will be published in 2020. Along the lines of the Dutch model, a coordinator will also be appointed to carry out several preliminary offshore studies which will allow a wind farm to be constructed and operated with less risk, and therefore less cost. These studies will take time. In addition, the harmonisation of the offshore transmission system and the onshore transmission system must be guaranteed. Given all these stages, the first call for tender is expected in the first quarter of 2023, meaning that the first farm with a maximum output of 700 MW may be operational by 2025. The second call for tender should be launched in 2025, providing an additional capacity of 1,050 MW by 2027. With 2,261 MW of installed capacity in 2020, and 1,750 MW of additional capacity over the period 2020-2030, by the end of this period there will be 4,011 MW of installed capacity in the Belgian North Sea. Since October 2018, Belgium has had an installed offshore wind capacity of 1,553 GW. In 2030, the  GW.  In the context of the regional cooperation with other countries bordering the North Sea, Belgium will further exploit the MOG/North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC)/international waters potential. Belgium will engage with its neighbours in regional and bilateral cooperative relationships with a view to developing joint projects for the generation of offshore energy, particularly within the framework of NSEC. The development of renewable energy must also take account of a social objective and must benefit all consumers.   Biofuels: Suppliers of diesel and/or petrol are required to demonstrate on an annual basis that the volumes released for consumption contain a nominal volume of sustainable biofuels.  Since 1 January 2017, the minimum content of sustainable biofuels has been 8.5% by volume for petrol and 6% by volume for diesel (5.5-5.6% expressed in energy terms for both petrol and diesel). Under the Law of 13 July 2013, in 2020 this minimum content will increase to 8.5% expressed in energy terms for both petrol and diesel. The Royal Decree increasing the minimum content of sustainable biofuels to 8.5% in energy terms will enter into force on 1 January 2020. Another Royal Decree is being prepared that will increase the minimum content to 9.55% expressed in nominal terms from 2020. To overcome the coexistence of two Royal Decrees for 2020, a transitional period has been specified: - 8.5% expressed in energy terms for the first quarter of 2020; - 9.9% expressed in energy terms for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020. 61 This transitional period will enable the figure of 9.55% expressed in nominal terms to be achieved for the whole of 2020. For 2021, the minimum content will be 8.95% in real terms or 9.55% expressed in nominal terms. For the trajectory beyond 2020, see point 2.1.2(i).

Renewable heat targets The estimated production of renewable heat in 2030 is 14.2 TWh, i.e. an increase of 5.3 TWh over the 2020 estimate. An increase of 55% in renewable heat production is envisaged with regard to the baseline scenario. These efforts will result in renewable heat contributing 24.7% of the gross final heat consumption (compared with 13.1% in 2015 and 14.7% in 2020). Renewable transport target The renewable transport target is significantly higher than the WEM figure due to a higher biofuel incorporation rate (14%), the breakthrough of biogas and the increased take-up of electric vehicles.  iii.

The draft plan took into account only the estimated potential for new sites. In addition, the repowering potential has also been determined, based on projects reaching the end of their life during the period 2020-2030. For these projects, the increase in power and generation has been calculated if the previous generation turbines are to be replaced with new, more efficient turbines offering increased power and more full-load hours. As a result, the potential growth in onshore wind energy has risen from 50 MW/year to 100 MW/year. As for biofuels, the recently amended incorporation rates of 8.4% have been applied to the appropriate fuel consumption figures. Since the draft plan, a year of additional figures for generation and for renewable energy projects carried out in the meantime has become available. For 2020, the starting point has therefore changed given the more up-to-date and realistic data and projections, meaning that we can now estimate generation for 2020 with much more accuracy. This has particularly resulted in the following changes: Green electricity (GWh) Projection 2020 Sub-target 2020 Solar 3,230 3,544 Onshore wind 2,736 3,030 Hydroelectricity 9 9 Biomass 2,923 3,024 Biogas 797 912 Total 9,695 10,519  Green heat (GWh) Projection 2020 Sub-target 2020 Solar water heaters 193 246 Heat pumps 610 610 Deep geothermal energy 95 164 Biomass households 3,850 4,327 Biomass other 3,841 4,327 Total 8,589 9,197  Green heat Increased use of green heat potential has been chosen for the various heat technologies. It is nearly always more cost-effective to achieve the same contribution from green heat as through green electricity or transport. 64 For heat pumps, the system cost (impact on network load, higher investment and support costs than for other green heat sources) is higher than for other (renewable) options. Not everyone will choose a heat pump for a renovation or replacement investment. To encourage greater use of heat pumps, the cost effectiveness of heat pumps in dwellings with a falling demand for heat and the integration of heat pumps in the electricity market and system must improve. This can be achieved, for example, by adopting a more flexible approach to heat pumps, allowing owners to take advantage of cheaper energy prices through a smart meter. District heating systems contribute to more efficient heat production and offer the infrastructure needed to facilitate the transition to renewable energy sources. The main focus will continue to be on district heating systems that facilitate the use of renewable heat or waste heat. This has been the focus in recent years, through regular calls for green heat (including district heating systems), waste heat (networks), biomethane injection and geothermal energy. A Heat Plan 2025 (Plan Chaleur 2025) with projections to 2030 will be prepared in order to increase green heat production.  Solar water heaters The potential of solar water heaters has been determined from the data in the EPB database and from the number of incentives granted by system operators, taking into account the expected number of households by 2030. An average annual increase of 5,000 solar water heaters is expected. This figure is lower than the assumptions made in the Energy Plan 2020, but will be offset by the noted shift from solar water heaters to heat pump water heaters and by stronger growth in the production of heat pumps. Between 2014 and 2017, on average 7,250 solar water heaters were added each year. The number of additional solar water heaters fell in 2018 to 3,602. The production is estimated by multiplying the number of solar water heaters by indicators for the required (roof) area and for related production. These indicators are based on information gathered for the Flanders Inventory of renewable energy sources 2005-2016 (Jespers et al., October 2017). It is assumed that a domestic solar water heaters needs an average roof area of 5 m² and achieves an average heat production of 0.37 MWh per m² per year. These are representative figures for solar water heaters used for domestic hot water (i.e. excluding space heating).  Heat pumps To ensure a realistic growth scenario, a projected production of 1,455 GWh by 2030 is proposed. To achieve this, the number of additional heat pumps will have to increase every year from 4,550 in 2021 to 12,000 in 2030. Installation of heat pumps in new buildings will increase sharply due to several measures planned in the government agreement. Heating oil boilers can no longer be installed in new buildings and during major energy renovations from 2021, and a gas connection will no longer be possible in new large-scale developments and large apartment buildings, except for district heating by cogeneration or in combination with a renewable energy system as the main heating system. Overall (new-builds and renovations), 3,832 and 4,196 heat pumps were installed in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Furthermore, this potential anticipates 1,000 gas condensing boilers being replaced every year by hybrid systems in existing dwellings that are not being renovated. This figure has been revised downwards from the draft Energy Plan because it was found that only a few tens of these hybrid systems are being installed every year. In addition, it is estimated that 4,500 electric boilers are being placed every year by heat pump boilers. In 2017 and 2018 respectively, 3,029 and 3,194 heat pump boilers were installed in this context. The government agreement stipulates an increase in the minimum share of renewable energy in new-builds. In this context, it has also been considered whether the minimum share of renewable energy in new-builds should be split into a minimum share of green electricity and a minimum share of green heat. Use of local energy communities could also result in additional heat pumps.  65 Deep geothermal energy Paper on the potential of deep geothermal energy, December 2016) was used to assess the potential of deep geothermal energy. This type of energy is still limited to a few projects in Flanders. Any estimate of the future supply of deep geothermal energy is consequently rather theoretical. Under the present circumstances, it is difficult to find worthwhile business cases. Pilot projects provide greater insight into the geothermal potential and the technical, economic, social and legal conditions. The production of green heat by 12 installations with boreholes at between 500 and 3,500 metres and associated district heating systems has been used to determine the potential to 2030. This projection will not change until two ongoing geothermal projects included in the government agreement have been assessed.  Biomass and biogas The potential of green electricity from biomass and biogas was examined in the Vito study bio-energie in Vlaanderen in 2030, April The potential of bio-energy in Flanders in 2030, April 2017). In consultation with experts, a realistic growth target to 2030 was determined. Seven biomass value chains were chosen in the study, which examined the flows used in existing bio-energy installations in Flanders and recent developments in the commercial market. Incineration and anaerobic digestion are the basic conversion technologies chosen for Flanders up to 2030. When determining the potential, it was important to realistically estimate changes in the existing bio-energy capacity. This is due to the fact that each existing installation will reach 10 years of age during the period to 2030. Support for those installations with a start date prior to 2013 will end after the initial period of aid and the legally guaranteed possibility of extension, as provided for in Article 7.1.1(1) of the Energy Decree (i.e. two five-year extensions are possible based on full-load hours). As each installation individually assesses whether or not to continue, work on the existing value chains assumed a range from complete closure to status quo of the existing bio-energy capacity. In addition to changes in the existing capacity, consideration was given to the possibilities of extending the various value chains. This study, which estimates the potential, shows that, for those bio-energy value chains in Flanders that are currently fully developed and that will reach 10 years of age during the period to 2030, it remains important to provide a forward-looking policy framework. New biomass value chains are gradually finding their way into the existing Flemish renewable energy policy. For these value chains, the potential as an energy source is often linked to challenges in other policy areas, such as agriculture and materials. For residential wood-burning, we have committed to a partial shift towards medium-sized combustion plants that use local biomass to efficiently heat local public and private buildings, with fewer toxic emissions, via a (small-scale) district heating system. As a result, the focus is on replacement of plants to improve overall efficiency and emissions. The same quantity of heat is supplied, but less wood is used. According to the Eurostat methodology, the wood consumption is taken into account for the target, but not for the heat production. This results in a reduction in the contribution to the European renewable energy targets due to the consumption of wood by households. The falling wood consumption in the residential sector is 60% offset by the quantity of wood that this releases to be partly used in medium-sized installations (1 MWth) in industry, agriculture or the tertiary sector. The shift from residential consumption of wood to medium-sized combustion installations is included in the objectives and actions of the Flemish Green Deal for domestic wood heating. Through a systematic approach, a structured action plan and broad cooperation among the public bodies involved, social organisations, businesses and other stakeholders, this Green Deal aims to encourage solutions that will reduce emissions from domestic wood heating by at least 50% by 2030. The focus will therefore mainly be on decommissioning old heating appliances that are the most polluting. The target is to decommission 100% of these old appliances by 2030 (with a minimum of 50%). This will be achieved, on the one hand, by replacing these old appliances with new, more efficient wood heating appliances or alternative heating systems and, on the other hand, by simply decommissioning them without any replacement. This could release a quantity of 66 wood in line with the projections for the generation of renewable energy by 2030, as indicated. The Green Deal action plan for domestic wood heating is included in the Flemish Air Policy Plan 2030. As regards waste incineration, a significant shift from green electricity to green heat is anticipated in the form of district heating systems. A 25% reduction in waste by 2030 due to waste policy measures has also been calculated. The incineration capacity to be maintained in the meantime must achieve the highest possible energy efficiency and the lowest possible emissions. In collaboration with major partners, the firm focus will be on compulsory selective collection of organic waste from large and medium-sized producers of this waste. The potential for anaerobic digestion will increase as a result. The pre-fermentation of vegetable, fruit and garden waste, before the waste is composted, releases biogas that can then be used to generate renewable energy. To this end, it is expected that some composting plants for vegetable, fruit and garden waste will be (partly) converted to pre-fermentation followed by composting.   District heating systems An important role is assigned to the further expansion of district heating systems in Flanders. Approximately 560 GWh of heat is supplied every year via the current systems. Based on the projects submitted in various calls and in relation to strategic environmental aid, further growth of 1,000 GWh is estimated by 2020 (250 GWh/year in the period 2017-2020). This growth will continue to 2030. Based on the district heating systems planned to 2020, around 50% of these heat supplies are expected to come from renewable energy sources, which represents an increase in the use of green heat of approximately 125 GWh per year. As the supply of green heat via district heating systems will mostly come from heat pumps, geothermal energy, solar water heaters and biomass (waste incineration), for which significant additional growth is already projected, no extra renewable energy potential through district heating systems has been taken into account. District heating systems are an instrument allowing renewable energy sources to be used, with this use having already been taken into account for each heat source. In accordance with the government agreement, the regulatory framework, EPB regulations and call for green and waste heat are being assessed with a view to further promoting the development of district heating systems supplied with green and waste heat. Flanders is helping local authorities to produce a Heat Plan. Heat zoning plans are being prepared for the 2019-2024 parliamentary term. The public and businesses can only make the right investment choices if they have sufficient information on the long-term strategy. This strategy is set out in a heat zoning plan and is based on data on energy consumption and generation, new or existing waste heat sources, the possibility of establishing a district heating system, the possibility of a new decentralised (and preferably renewable) heat production plant, and so on.  Green electricity Photovoltaic solar power As solar panels can be installed with limited subsidy costs (with no more direct subsidies for installations up to 40 kW, large projects have fewer unprofitable parts than other technologies in the same aid period), the vision of the Solar Plan continues to be pursued, with maximum use being made of this potential. Other secondary conditions are being taken into account in this respect, such as integration in the system and the generating potential within a stable supply side (stable market for suppliers and installers).  Detailed potential has been identified on the basis of the solar map. This map depicts the available roof areas, with only those roof areas with optimum orientation, without shade and with a sufficient surface area being included. Using the solar map, a potential of 57 GWe has been identified incident solar radiation of more than 1,000 kWh/m²incident solar radiation of between 800 kWh/m²/year and 1,000 kWh/m²/year is 15 GWe. At the end of 2019, the installed PV 67 capacity was approximately 3.2 GWe. The solar map shows that there is sufficient potential available on roofs to achieve significant growth. Further annual growth of 300 MWe is estimated over the period 2021-2025, with 318 MWe per year from 2025 onwards, with the aim being for solar PV capacity to reach 6.7 GWe in Flanders by 2030. This target is easily within the potential identified using the solar map, and also within the system integration and balancing capacity. A Solar Plan 2025 with projections to 2030 will be produced in order to increase solar power. Under the Flemish government agreement, the existing investment aid system is to be expanded through budgets set annually for small and medium-sized wind farms and medium-sized PV projects from 2021 so that the most cost-effective projects are carried out. The aid system is to be funded by the Energy Fund.  Wind energy As regards wind energy, the targets of the wind plan Windkracht 2020 have been taken into account with the installation of 280 additional wind turbines between 2016 and 2020. This corresponds to average annual growth of 50 to 60 turbines or 150 MWe of additional wind capacity, largely on the basis of projects that have already been authorised. Windkracht 2020therefore corresponds to an installed capacity of 1.5 GWe by 2020, including around 80 MW that is likely to be completed after 2020, or a further 8 MW/year on average over the period 2021-2030. According to the latest projections, the average growth rate of approximately 59 MW/year due to new sites will continue over the period 2021-2030, with 49 MW/year due to the repowering of existing sites. With this total additional annual capacity of 108 MW/year, the total installed capacity will amount to 2.5 GWe by 2030. A Wind Plan 2025 with projections to 2030 will be produced in order to increase wind power.  Biogas Biogas plants need significant energy subsidies (compared with sun and wind), but must be viewed in a broader context than just energy policy. This is an energy source that not only is available in the country, but that also contributes to other objectives such as security of supply and system stability, conversion of fertilisers and nutrients, the circular economy and land carbon stocks. In this respect, the use of available domestic flows, thereby ensuring the desired transfer to green heat, should be supported. This potential is already being exploited to a significant extent, with no real increase being expected unlike the other potentials that have already been mentioned. In order to maximise the energy potential of biogas, a biogas usage framework is being developed, particularly involving injection into the natural gas system. As already mentioned, the potential of green electricity from biomass and biogas was examined in the Vito study -energie in Vlaanderen in 2030, A-energy in Flanders in 2030, April 2017). With regard to biogas, a slight rise in production has been included because 10 additional plants for the anaerobic digestion of vegetable, fruit and garden waste and additional small-scale anaerobic digesters are planned in the agricultural sector.  Biomass With regard to large-scale biomass plants run on waste wood, it is assumed that the capacity projected in the Energy Plan 2020 will be maintained to 2030. The Max Green power station run on wood pellets will be decommissioned in the period between 2020 and 2030, and conversion to green heat via district heating systems is assumed for most plants running on biomass waste. This explains the fall in the generation of green electricity from biomass. 68 This renewable energy source also needs significant energy subsidies of various types. In addition, reservations have been expressed about the impact of using biomass on sustainability targets, more cost-effective use of biomass to produce green heat, the limited availability of biomass and the affordability of the targets. Due to the potential impact on raw material markets (for industry and food), the impact on ecosystems and the effects of the indirect change in land use, new projects will be approved on the basis of (existing) secondary conditions and maximum energy efficiency (expressed as maximum primary energy savings), which will allow negative effects to be avoided. For that reason, the Energy Decree stipulates that aid for green electricity can be granted only for biomass or biogas that is used in qualitative cogeneration.  Biofuels  The incorporation rate has been applied to fuel consumption that takes account of a WAM scenario and a recent increased incorporation rate of 8.4% (excluding double counting of advanced biofuels) from 2020 to 2024. As regards biofuels in transport, reference has been mainly made to federal policy plans as most of the powers in relation to policy are held by the federal level. Furthermore, expectations are for a stabilisation of the relatively limited use of renewable energy sources (compared with the production of green heat and electricity), although there will be a shift from first generation biofuels to advanced biofuels. In accordance with RED II, the share of biofuels will gradually be increased to 14% by 2030.  Incorporation rate 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 (%) 8.4 8.4 8.4 8.4 8.4 12.0 12.0 12.0 12.0 12.0 14.0  Walloon Region Renewable electricity targets Trends in renewable electricity by technology in the WEM and WAM scenarios (GWh)   Electricité renouvelable (GWh) - par technologie Renewable electricity (GWh)  by technology Biomasse - cogénération Biomass  cogeneration Biomasse - électricité uniquement Biomass  electricity only Géothermie Geothermal energy 69 Hydraulique Hydropower Photovoltaïque Photovoltaic Eolien on shore Onshore wind  A larger increase, compared with the baseline scenario, is projected in the wind and photovoltaic sectors (+58% and +195% respectively). According to these estimates, 10,081 GWh of renewable electricity will be generated; in other words, the share of renewable electricity in final electricity consumption in 2030 will be around 37%. It should be noted that the development of offshore wind will by itself achieve 40% of the Belgian target.

All the technologies and sectors are involved in meeting this target, as shown by the following graphs for solar thermal, heat pumps and biomass (31) (excluding cogeneration).                                                            31 Solid biomass and biogas. 70 Trends in consumption from biomass (excluding cogeneration) in the various sectors  Biomasse (hors cogénération) Biomass (excluding cogeneration) Résidentiel Residential Tertiaire Tertiary Industrie Industry  Trends in consumption from solar thermal in the various sectors  Solaire thermique Solar thermal Résidentiel Residential Tertiaire Tertiary  71 Trends in consumption from heat pumps (energy gain) in the various sectors  Pompe à chaleur (gain énergétique) Heat pump (energy gain) Résidentiel Residential Tertiaire Tertiary  These efforts will result in the share of renewable heat in gross final heat consumption being 24.7% (compared with 13.1% in 2015 and 14.7% in 2020). The share of renewable energy sources in the heating and cooling sector will therefore rise by an average of 1 percentage point every year between 2020 and 2030. It is anticipated that each technology will develop in terms of its technical and economic potential. Furthermore, with regard to biomass, the impacts on air quality, the availability of materials and sustainability have also been taken into account. The potential has been calculated based on the hierarchy of plant resources.  iv. Estimated trajectories on bioenergy demand, disaggregated between heat, electricity and transport, and on biomass supply by feedstocks and origin (distinguishing between domestic production and imports). For forest biomass, an assessment of its source and impact on the LULUCF sink  Federal State The quantified and detailed measures and policies requested by the Commission are set out below in point 3.1.  Flemish Region As regards the priority applications for biomass in the Flemish Region, we would refer you to the Action Plan by the Public Waste Agency of Flanders (Société publique des Déchets de la Région flamande/Openbare Vlaamse Afvalstoffenmaatschappij  OVAM). In the period 2021-2030, we are expecting biomass to be much less used for generating electricity. With regard to heat production, we are also expecting less use of biomass in households due to the reduced consumption of wood by more efficient heating appliances. We predict that 60% of the biomass released from households in this way will be used in large-scale plants with better energy performance and lower emissions. The Action Plan also contains a framework and measures for the sustainable use of forest biomass. 72  Walloon Region ii. Targets by sector and technology, heat and electricity are produced from both solid biomass and biogas.   Forest resources With regard to the local supply of fuelwood, the proposal is to maintain the current status quo in the forest-wood sector (logging, softwood lumber industry, industry, etc.) so as not to disrupt the organisation of the wood sector. In a business-as-usual scenario, the latest simulations predicting changes in the use of Walloon forest resources therefore project an increase in the standing volume (32) and, as a result, the continued function of our forests as a carbon sink. According to the estimates proposed by ValBiom (33), all the local supply sources combined total 7,806 GWh of fuelwood, distributed as follows: Local forest resources (2030) GWh Primary energy available in 2030  1,943 Pellets 2,342 Black liquor 2,447 Roadside wood 75 Grade B wood waste 925 Woodchips 74 TOTAL 7,806  With regard to imports, we note that the planned closure of the Awirs plant (100% fuelled by imported pellets) will reduce imports by around 800 GWh. On the other hand, a relatively small increase in fuelwood imports is expected, mainly for the production of heat.  Agrofuel resources (34) As a result of favourable and attractive conditions, it is considered that surface areas will increase faster than the recent trend, with 1,500 ha being estimated as available for production in 2030.  Biomethane production resources The exercise was carried out based on data from: - edition (2017 figures); - injectable en Belgiquein which the section on sources valorisable énergétiquement -  recoverable for energy - 2015, reupdated in 2019). The types of material have been grouped into seven main categories, as shown in the table below.                                                            32 J. Perin et al., 2019. Prediction of changes in forest resources using the SIMREG model applied to data from the permanent inventory of Walloon forest resources). 33 Note méthodologique sur la contribution des bioénergies aux objectifs du PACE/PNEC (Methodology note on the contribution of bioenergies to the PACE/NECP objectives (August 2019). 34 Miscanthus, short-rotation willow coppice, etc. 73 According to ValBiom, local sources realistically total around 7,625 GWh (theoretical potential to which a mobilisation factor is applied to take account of the technical, agronomic and environmental reality). Biogas  Realistic sources by type of material GWh Overview for 2018  (already used) Realistic sources Biogas from landfills 150 0 Fermentable portion of household waste  24 113 Biogas from wastewater treatment plants 2 37 Biogas from agri-food residues 148 737 Biogas from crop residues 50 1,079 Biogas from livestock manure 48 1,635 Biogas from dedicated crops 59 4,024 TOTAL 482 7,625  To reach the assumptions made in this plan for cogeneration, heat only (mainly via injection) and transport (incorporation of 5% biogas) applications, less than one quarter of the total realistic sources need to be mobilised. We note that the percentage of use of the realistic sources varies according to the type of material in question: for example, these percentages will be higher in the case of waste and lower in the case of dedicated crops. This additional potential can be used only if different mechanisms are introduced in the sector. and Resources Plan 2025 (Plan Wallon des déchets-ressources  PWD-R horizon 2025), which are confirmed in the Regional Policy Statement, will impact on the data/projections for recoverable biomass (through composting and/or biomethane production). These projections are currently being reviewed and updated. In particular, widespread selective collection of biowaste from households and businesses, which is also required under the new Waste Framework Directive (EU) 2018/851 by 2023, risks impacting on the carbon balance of biowaste collection and treatment (incineration, biomethane production and composting). These new factors will be included in the Walloon Air, Climate and Energy Plan when it is revised in 2021.  v. Where applicable, other national trajectories and objectives, including those that are long term or sectoral (e.g. share of renewable energy in district heating, renewable energy use in buildings, renewable energy produced by cities, renewable energy communities and renewables self-consumers, energy recovered from the sludge acquired through the treatment of wastewater) Flemish Region In the past, there has not been widespread use of urban heating in Flanders. However, since the introduction in 2013 of financial support through regular calls for tender for green heat, waste heat, district heating systems and geothermal energy, a large number of new projects have been carried out and are still planned. At the end of 2017, around 600 GWh of heat were supplied by urban heating systems. Based on planned and approved projects, this figure is expected to continue rising to reach 1,500 GWh by 2020. According to the Energy Plan 2021-2030, there will be average growth of 250 GWh/year (4,000 GWh by 2030). In 2017, 39% of the heat in these district heating systems was provided by renewable energy sources, with this figure being estimated to rise to 52% by 2020.
