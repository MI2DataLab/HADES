INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 172   3.2 Dimension energy efficiency   Planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030 as well as other objectives referred to in point 2.2, including planned measures and instruments (also of a financial nature) to promote the energy performance of buildings, in particular with regard to the following:  i. energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative policy measures under Articles 7a and 7b and Article 20(6) of Directive 2012/27/EU and prepared in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation   In order to achieve the minimum cumulative end-use energy saving to be attained in the period 2021-2030 within the meaning of Article 7 of the EED, confirmed at 51.4 Mtoe, compared with 50.98 Mtoe calculated on the basis of average end-use energy consumption in 2016-2018, Italy will use the set of requirements based on White Certificates and a set of alternative measures that are already in place, to be revised and strengthened in the next few years in order to reach the targets set.   As the consultation on the draft INECP showed, to improve the efficiency of the support mechanisms in place the tools need to be better tailored to each sector and measure, in order to avoid measures overlapping and competing with one another and to focus resources, facilitate access and maximise savings.  In particular, the instruments in place expressly dedicated to the promotion of energy efficiency and monitored for the purposes of achieving the savings target pursuant to Article 7 of the EED are the following:  the White Certificates scheme;  tax deductions for energy-efficient measures and restoration of existing buildings;     The National Fund for Energy Efficiency;   Industry 4.0  programme for upgrading the energy efficiency of central government buildings (PREPAC);  programme of energy efficiency measures under the cohesion policies 2021-2027;  national energy efficiency information and training plan (PIF)  a set of sustainable mobility measures including:  renewal of the fleet of local public transport vehicles;   measures for the modal shift in goods transport;   other measures still to be assessed in terms of savings in the transport sector (renewal of goods and private vehicle fleet, modal shift in passenger transport and development of transport infrastructure). All of the above measures, already operational or in the process of being launched at a national level, are summarised in the following sections, including for each one an estimate of expected savings and the resources needed to meet all of the objectives on sectoral saving described in section 2.2.  The savings estimated from the above-listed measures is based on the assumption that they will function and be funded until 2030. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 173   As mentioned above, in Italy numerous measures for promoting energy efficiency, in the transport sector in particular, are in place or planned. These can be monitored and reported on following the analyses currently under way.  Please refer to Annex III of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on Governance of the Energy Union (in which the measures and methods adopted by the Member states for applying Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU are made public) for more information and details on the individual measures described below (beneficiaries, who is involved in and responsible for implementation, admissible interventions, methods for calculating savings, monitoring, verification and auditing).  White Certificates For a description of the measure, please refer to the report submitted in accordance with Annex III of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on Governance of the Energy Union. Development trends The process for updating and reinforcing the White Certificates will be continued with a view to simplifying the scheme and optimising the methodologies for quantifying and recognising energy savings, and reducing the time frames for approval, issuance and supply of certificates on the market. These aspects, which also came up in the public consultation, are fundamental for the effective continuation of the measure in 2020-2030.  The possibility of implementing a radical reform of the scheme is being examined. Points being analysed include the potential expansion of the category of obligated parties and the potential modification/integration of the White Certificates market scheme with other complementary ones. Regarding admissible measures, it will be crucial to effectively promote the measures in the civil and transport sectors, including by developing behavioural measures. In line with the outcome of the public consultation, more support will also be dedicated to the training and information stages by distributing, for the various sectors and interventions, guides, databases with predefined baselines and approved best practices. Furthermore, there will be more focus on supporting operators. These last aspects are key to effecting the necessary improvements to the quality of the projects submitted, which will also relieve some of the administrative burden on GSE.   Estimate of energy and economic indicators In order to estimate the contribution of the White Certificates to the savings targets fixed by Article 7(1) of Directive 2012/27/EU, end-use energy savings, estimated to be generated by new projects implemented from 1 January 2021 and which will continue to generate benefits up until 31 December 2030, will be calculated. In the following figure, an estimate is given of annual generation of these savings of around 12.3 Mtoe of cumulative end-use energy.      INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 174   Figure 30 - Annual savings of end-use energy expected from new measures promoted with the White Certificates scheme (Mtoe)    In terms of investment raised to generate the aforesaid savings, this is estimated at around  billion in the period 2021-2030, compared with a budgetary commitment for the  billion.  Tax deductions for energy-efficient retrofitting and restoration of existing buildings   Description of the measure For a description of the measure, please refer to the report submitted in accordance with Annex III of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on Governance of the Energy Union.   Expected development trends  A tax deduction scheme for the energy-efficient retrofitting and restoration of existing buildings, to run for three years, is currently being assessed.  In order to strengthen the measure, maximise results and optimise resources, the plan is to integrate the Ecobonus, Sismabonus and Bonus Casa schemes into a single mechanism. The scheme will provide a benefit scalable in relation to the expected saving, based on the total technical life of the measure, is to reward the most cost-effective interventions and to increase the trend towards deep renovation, including the earthquake proofing of buildings. Lastly, pursuant to Article 1(3)(a) of the Budget Law for 2018, an implementing provision is being drafted for the creation of a specific segment in the National Energy Efficiency Fund for providing guarantees to credit institutions that issue loans to private persons or joint-owners of housing blocks for the purpose of improving the energy efficiency of their part of, or the whole, building, in synergy with the tax schemes described. This measure will help overcome one of the barriers to the implementation of energy-efficient retrofitting: initial investment.   Estimate of energy and economic indicators INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 175   The results obtained through the implementation of the instrument to date have been significant and allow estimation of the saving potential of the scheme in future years and up to 2030. The figure below shows the estimated annual savings achievable up to 2030. The overall contribution of the measure to the above targets is around 18.15 Mtoe of cumulative end-use energy. Figure 31 - Anticipated savings for tax deductions (Mtoe) Ecobonus  Ecobonus  Deductions for building renovations  Ecobonus + Deductions for building renovations       In terms of investment raised to generate the aforesaid savings, this is estimated at around 82.5 billion in the period 2021-2030, compared with a budgetary commitment for the State for the promotion of the measures carried out estimated at 45.4 billion.  Conto Termico:  For a description of the measure please refer to the report submitted in accordance with Annex III of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on Governance of the Energy Union. Expected development trends As the results of the public consultation showed, to avoid fragmentation and overlapping of instruments for promoting energy efficiency, the plan is to focus the Conto Termico scheme on energy-efficient retrofitting and restoration of non-residential buildings, in the public and private tertiary sector. The intention is to continue the task of simplifying access to the scheme for public bodies, also through promotion of the ESCo model and the use of energy performance contracts (EPCs). In addition, the possibility of extending the admissibility of interventions, including measures to connect to efficient district heating systems, will be explored.   Estimate of energy and economic indicators 0.33 0.66 0.99 1.32 1.65 1.98 2.31 2.64 2.97 3.30 0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80 1.00 1.20 1.40 1.60 1.80 2.00 0.13 0.26 0.39 0.52 0.65 0.78 0.91 1.17 1.30 1.04 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 176   In the period of operation of the Conto Termico, a growing trend has been observed that saw the first significant results attributable to the scheme in 2016, a year in which there was an increase of 81% in applications received in relation to 2015, which corresponds to an increase of 80% in incentives applied for. In 2017, the increase in applications received was as high as 289% in relation to the preceding year, confirming an extremely positive trend in favour of the scheme, particularly concerning applications submitted by public bodies. The results obtained through the implementation of the instrument to date allow estimation of the saving potential of the scheme in future years and up to 2030. The figure below shows the estimated annual savings achievable up to 2030. The overall contribution of the measure to the above targets is around 3.85 Mtoe of cumulative end-use energy.  Figure 32 - Anticipated end-use savings for the Conto Termico (Mtoe)   0.70 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030  In terms of investment raised to generate the aforesaid savings, this is estimated at around 17.5 billion in the period 2021-2030, compared with a budgetary commitment for the State for the promotion of the measures carried out estimated at 7.5 billion.  Italian National Fund for Energy Efficiency Description of the measure  For a description of the measure please refer to the report submitted in accordance with Annex III of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on Governance of the Energy Union. Anticipated development trends In order to increase the capacity of the Fund to promote energy-efficient measures, the financial allocation currently available will be increased, favouring the payment of resources dedicated to energy efficiency managed by central and local public bodies (structural funds, European investment funds) and directing the scheme towards the promotion of measures in the civil sector (both the housing and tertiary sectors) and the transport sector.  To this end, in 2019 part of the resources of the Italian Fund for investments and the development of infrastructure, established by the Budget Law for 2017 and refinanced by the Budget Law for 2018, have gone towards increasing allocations for the National Fund for 0.63 0.56 0.49 0.42 0.35 0.28 0.21 0.14 0.07 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 177   Energy Efficiency. For 2021-2030 the additional funding mentioned above will be  million.  As the results of the public consultation indicate, projects should be pooled together using investment groups or platforms. It will also be important to provide for information-dissemination activities to increase awareness of the instrument and its usability. In addition, as previously mentioned in the section on tax deductions, a new section of the fund is being created that will be used to offer guarantees for financial institutions funding energy-efficient retrofitting. Lastly, consideration will be given to broadening the types of financial and economic support offered by the Fund, in order to maximise the effectiveness of the available resources.  Estimate of energy and economic indicators The Fund became operational in March 2019.  As operational results from previous periods are not available, the estimate of additional annual savings due to new measures is carried out on the basis of a mix of the measures planned by the Fund and the resources that the law makes available. The figure below shows the estimated annual savings achievable up to 2030. The overall contribution of the measure to the above targets is around 4.09 Mtoe of cumulative end-use energy. Figure 33 - Anticipated end-use energy savings for the National Fund for Energy Efficiency (Mtoe)   In terms of investment raised to generate the aforesaid savings, this is estimated at around 4.4 billion in the period 2021-2030, compared with a commitment from the State to increase the allocation to the Fund to 80 million a year in the same period.  Industry 4.0  For a description of the measure, please refer to the report submitted in accordance with Annex III of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on Governance of the Energy Union.  Expected development trends The Budget Law for 2020 (Law No 160 of 27 December 2019) changes the existing regulations governing Industry 4.0, introducing a new tax credit for expenses incurred in investing in new capital goods. The provision applies to all businesses and, for certain investments, also to professionals. The tax credit is granted at a differentiated rate according to the type of goods invested in. It covers investments in new capital goods, including INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 178   intangible assets that are used for technological transformation under the Industry 4.0 model.  Estimate of energy and economic indicators For energy efficiency interventions carried out in accordance with Industry 4.0, a cumulative saving of 2.8 Mtoe in 2030 in end-use energy is estimated, assuming that the Industry 4.0 measures described above remain active until 2030.  Figure 34  Savings in end-use energy expected under Industry 4.0 (Mtoe)    Investments made in order to create the above-mentioned savings are expected to total  billion in 2021-2030, against an estimated State commitment of expenditure of  billion for promoting the interventions.  Programme for upgrading the energy efficiency of central government buildings (PREPAC)  For a description of the measure, please refer to the report submitted in accordance with Annex III of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on Governance of the Energy Union.  Expected development trends Funding for the measure will cover 2021-2030 and updating and strengthening measures will be implemented in order to simplify administrative procedures. The aim is to draw on the synergies between the public bodies involved in managing the scheme and enable adequate management IT support to be developed. Estimate of energy and economic indicators Energy efficiency interventions carried out in accordance with PREPAC are expected to result in a cumulative saving of 0.1 Mtoe of end-use energy by 2030, originating from new projects implemented from 1 January 2021.    INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 179   Figure 35  Expected annual end-use energy savings under PREPAC (Mtoe)   Investments made in order to create the above-mentioned savings are expected to total around  billion in 2021-2030, against an estimated State commitment of expenditure of  billion for promoting the interventions carried out. Cohesion policies  For a description of the measure, please refer to the report submitted in accordance with Annex III of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on Governance of the Energy Union.  Expected development trends For the guidelines please refer to the guidance on investments financed by the 2021-2027  Country Report of 27 February 2019, as cited in Annex III of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on Governance of the Energy Union.  Estimate of energy and economic indicators The energy efficiency interventions facilitated by the cohesion policies are expected to result in a cumulative saving of 1.7 Mtoe of end-use energy by 2030.  Figure 36 - Expected annual end-use energy savings under the cohesion policies (Mtoe)   INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 180   Information and training programmes for consumers Description of the measure For a description of the measure, please refer to the report submitted in accordance with Annex III of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on Governance of the Energy Union.  Expected development trends From 2021 to 2030 more importance will be placed on information-sharing and training activities, and the launch of a potential new programme based on experience gained as a result of the one coming to a close will be assessed. The theme of monitoring the savings generated by awareness-raising programmes will be explored, with a view to offering evermore robust support to decision-making in that area, as well as to meeting the energy efficiency targets. Estimate of energy and economic indicators Energy efficiency interventions carried out under the information and training programmes for consumers are expected to lead to cumulative savings of 1.4 Mtoe of end-use energy by 2030.  Figure 37- Expected end-use energy savings under the information and training programme (Mtoe)    Measures in the transport sector There are many national and local measures in place in the transport sector aimed at reducing consumption and emissions. In this section are listed, by type of target, the principal measures that contribute and will contribute to achieving the energy efficiency and decarbonisation targets in the coming years. More information on this is contained in the report submitted in accordance with Annex III of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on Governance of the Energy Union, sent alongside the final version of this Plan. In particular, in order to reach the minimum target for energy saving set by Article 7(1)(b) of the EED, Italy is focusing on two different measures: - Replacement of the fleet of vehicles for local public transport; - Interventions for the modal shift in goods transport.  Replacement of the fleet of local public transport vehicles INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 181   Description of the measure For a description of the measure, please refer to the report submitted in accordance with Annex III of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on Governance of the Energy Union.  Expected development trends It is proposed to accelerate the provisions set out in paragraph 10 of Article 18 of Italian Legislative Decree 257/2016 (transposition of the DAFI directive) stipulating that the public administration, the Regions, local bodies and providers of public utilities for activities carried out in the provinces with high levels of PM10 particle pollution, when replacing their respective fleets of cars, buses and public utility vehicles, including those for collecting urban waste, must ensure that 30% by 2022, at least 50% by 2025 and 85% by 2030 of new vehicles purchased are electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles with off-vehicle charging, powered by methane and hydrogen, and electricity and methane in the case of buses. In the case of replacing transport fleets used for local public transport, this limit applies solely to urban services. The percentage is calculated using purchases planned on a triannual basis from the reference data. For the law to be effective, additionally, it will remain the case that public tenders which do not comply with this provision are void. Law No 141 of 12 December 2019, converting Decree-Law No 111 of 14 October 2019, introduced measures for the replacement of vehicles for local public transport (LPT). The  million for each of the years 2020 and 2021. The funding is intended to finance the investments necessary to implement experimental projects introducing hybrid or electric vehicles into the school transport service. Beneficiary schools will be state and municipal infant schools and state schools during the first teaching cycle. The measure is restricted to municipalities or groups of municipalities with populations of over 50,000 that are affected by EU infringement proceedings No 2014/2147 of 10 July 2014 and No 2015/2043 of 28 May 2015 for non-fulfilment of the obligations set out by Directive 2008/50/EC on air quality; they are linked to specific geographical areas. The measure is funded by a portion of the revenues from CO2 emission quota auctions, earmarked for the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Natural Resources and the Sea and deposited by GSE into the relevant Chapter of the State Budget. Using this funding source and with application only to the above-mentioned municipalities, Law No 141 of 12 December  million for each of the years 2020 and 2021 for projects to create, modernise and upgrade reserved lanes for LPT. Estimated energy and economic indicators The planned measures for the replacement of public vehicles used for the transport of persons are expected to generate cumulative savings of 0.2 Mtoe of end-use energy by 2030.   INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 182   Figure 38 - Annual savings in end-use energy expected from the replacement of the local public transport fleet (Mtoe)    Description of the measure For a description of the measure, please refer to the report submitted in accordance with Annex III of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on Governance of the Energy Union.  Expected development trends Marebonus and Ferrobonus are fundamental measures for improving energy efficiency in the transport sector, because the modal shift is a highly effective measure in terms of the cost to benefit ratio. It will therefore be important to relaunch them for 2021-2030, to update and reinforce them on the basis of experience gained, and to monitor the resulting energy savings more effectively. Decree-Law No 124 of 2019, converted into Law No 157 of 19 December 2019 and providing for measures to improve the environment and promote the development of more sustainable forms of goods transport, authorises expenditure of  million  million for each of the years 2021 and 2022, to improve goods transport on inland waterways and river and sea routes. Estimated energy and economic indicators The measures put in place to encourage the modal shift in goods transport are expected to result in a cumulative end-use energy saving of around 13 Mtoe by 2030.    INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 183   Figure 39  Annual end-use energy savings expected from modal shift in goods transport (Mtoe)   Below is a list of further measures to encourage sustainable mobility in terms of incentives and infrastructure, as well as decarbonisation and a behavioural change in the transport sector. However, these measures were not taken into account in the estimate of energy savings for the purpose of reaching the minimum target set out in Article 7(1)(b) of the EED.   Replacement of private vehicles used for the transport of persons With Law No 134 of 2012, Italy gave impetus to the development of mobility with low-emission vehicles. The law in fact provides, among other things, for the preparation of a National Infrastructure Plan for Charging Electric Vehicles (PNIRE) which provides guidance for a plan on a national level to ensure homogeneous distribution across the whole country of an integrated and interoperable network. Therefore, even before the publication of European Directive No 94/14, the PNIRE (Italian Prime Ministerial Decree of 26 September 2014) had been approved, subsequently updated with Prime Ministerial Decree of 18 April 2016 (currently in force). The subject of the Plan is the creation of infrastructure networks for charging electric vehicles and measures for the restoration of buildings aimed at the development of said networks. The Plan, other than clarifying the concept of charging services, has implemented the provisions of Italian Law No 134 of 2012 relating to funding for creating charging networks on a national level, allocating around 33 million in two phases: PHASE ONE: The Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, by means of a call for tender addressed to all Regions, has assigned, with Ministerial Decree No 469 of 7 November 2014, around 4.5 million to projects aimed at creating infrastructure in the main urban areas of the country characterised by high levels of traffic congestion. The installation of around 700 charging points is planned by way of these projects, in over 100 municipalities in Italy. To date, 50% of the recharging points have been installed. The projects have also enabled the launch of the first communication and information actions on a national scale concerning policies dedicated to electric mobility. To this end, it seems necessary to bring all the national and regional initiatives on electric mobility and the INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 184   recognition of recharging infrastructure under the PNIRE together under one system and to provide for strengthening and concentrating the available resources on strategic projects to develop the national recharging network. PHASE 2 - With Prime Ministerial Decree of 1 February 2018, the Programme Agreement between the Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport and the Regions and the autonomous provinces was approved, aimed at identifying programmes for creating widespread charging networks on national territory aimed at promoting the proliferation of electric vehicles. With this agreement, the Ministry is making available around 28 million, to which further funding from the Regions is to be added, from a minimum of 50% to a maximum of 65%, which brings the investment plan to an estimated value of more than 70 million in total. Specifically, with this funding the Ministry is supporting local bodies in the implementation of charging networks in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas in the following four ways, considered priorities for development of electric mobility, also in view of the examples of the principal experiences on a Community and international level, which have focused mobility policies on the incentive of zero-emission forms of mobility: a. public charging infrastructures; b. fuel distribution installations; c. private charging infrastructures accessible to the public (garages, multi-storey car parks etc.); d. domestic charging infrastructures. In addition, in validating several projects as part of the CEF call for proposals, which plan for the creation of infrastructure for TEN-T road and motorway networks, the Ministry is monitoring and coordinating the creation of over 300 fast (and ultra-fast) charging stations at fuel dispensers at roadside and motorway service stations.  The PNIRE is currently being updated using an integrated approach that takes into account other measures for sustaining demand for electric vehicles and increasing the usability of the infrastructure.  The possibility of coordinating the development of recharging infrastructure with plans to rationalise fuel networks is also being explored. The Italian government then intends to promote a progressive reduction of motor vehicles with diesel and petrol engines, in order to limit polluting emissions and to meet the targets on climate change given in the Paris Agreement. For this purpose, the plan is to gradually review the tax system on transport (registration tax, ownership tax, taxes on fuel etc.). A potential review of the ownership tax so that it is determined on the basis of the actual use of the vehicle will be explored in the framework of the debate on the issue at EU level. Further methods of financing for promoting low-emission vehicles will also be examined. The first public contributions to purchasing vehicles with very low CO2 emissions have been introduced (see section 3.1.3, point iii). In addition, Law No 145 of 30 December 2018 (the Budget Law for 2019), as amended by Decree-Law No 34 of 30 April 2019 (the Growth Decree-Law) established that anyone who, in 2019, bought, including via leasing, and registered in Italy a new electric or hybrid vehicle in category L1e, L2e, L3e, L4e, L5e, L6e or L7e and who took for scrapping a vehicle in one of those categories that they had owned or held for at least 12 months was entitled to a subsidy INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 185   for scrapping belonged to EURO category 0, 1, 2 or 3. This also applies if the vehicle had been owned or held for at least 12 months by a cohabiting family member. The rules for applying the incentive were established by the Ministry of Economic Development in a Ministerial Decree of 20 March 2019. Law No 141 of 12 December 2019, converting Decree-Law No 111 of 14 October 2019,  million  million  million  million for  million for 2024. The measure applies only to residents of the municipalities subject to infringement proceedings No 2147/2014 of 10 July 2014 and No 2043/2015 of 28 May 2015 for non-compliance of Italy with the obligations set out in Directive 2008/50/EC, who scrap type-approved passenger vehicles up to EURO category 3, or type-approved motorcycles up to EURO category 2 and EURO category 3 two-stroke motorcycles. motorcycle scrapped. The vouchers can be used within three years to buy local or regional public transport season tickets or bicycles, including e-bikes. The tickets can also be bought for cohabiting family members. The measure is funded by a portion of the revenues from CO2 emission quota auctions, earmarked for the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Natural Resources and the Sea and deposited by GSE into the relevant Chapter of the State Budget. Different pilot initiatives have been launched, such as for example the incentives for some areas of law enforcement to purchase electric or hybrid cars for surveillance in protected areas. Specifically, the intention is to provide a sum of 10 million for the purchase of around 220 electric or hybrid cars (around 80% for the military police and the remaining 20% for the port authorities), which will be used for surveillance and monitoring operations in protected natural areas. The initiative also assumes the importance of promoting the use of electric or hybrid cars, considering that protected natural areas are visited every year by over 100 million people. The Budget Law for 2020 establishes that from January 2020, when public administrations purchase or hire at least two vehicles to replace their vehicle fleets, at least 50% of that purchase or hire must be for road transport electric, hybrid or hydrogen-powered vehicles, within the limits of the budget earmarked for that category of expenditure. In accordance  million for 2020 are destined for the replacement of the vehicle fleet of companies operating in Italy and registered in the national electronic register.  The Budget Law for 2020 also envisages tighter rules, from July 2020, on fringe benefit taxes on newly registered highly polluting company cars. The tax decreases to 25% for company cars with CO2 emissions of below 60 g/km; it stays at 30% for those with emissions over 60 g/km and up to 160 g/km. For vehicles with emissions of over 160 g/km and up to 190 g/km, it increases to 40% (and 50% from 2021), whereas for all cars with emissions over 190 g/km it rises to 50% (and 60% from 2021).  Decree-Law No 124 of 2019, converted by Law No 157 of 19 December 2019 (the 2020 Decree-Law on Tax), extends the application of the very low VAT rate of 4% to the sale of hybrid and electric vehicles to persons with permanent reduced or impaired mobility or with hearing and/or visual impairments, and their families. The low rate also applies to the cost of garage services for adapting such vehicles to the needs of the drivers. Exemption from the INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 186   transcription tax, the additional provincial transcription tax and the registration tax to cover declarative or change of ownership documents is also provided for. As regards regulatory measures, limits and rules will be introduced in relation to stopping, to access in certain areas and to parking that promote the use of vehicles with low CO2 emissions or powered by renewable energy sources, including biomethane. Local regulatory initiatives will also be evaluated and reinforced, including, for example, limits on use of polluting vehicles in urban areas, with free access for alternative fuel vehicles and in particular electric vehicles in limited traffic zones, speed limits, priority lanes and car parks exclusively for zero-emission vehicles. In particular, in Italian Legislative Decree No 257 of 16 December 2016 (transposing the DAFI Directive), Article 17(2) and Article 19(2) provide for the promotion of an agreement with the Regions for:  ensuring implementation of consistent positions in terms of parking regulations, access to inner city areas, measures for incentivising and harmonising interventions and common objectives on national territory in relation to infrastructure networks for charging and refuelling of vehicles powered by electricity and other alternative fuels;  ensuring homogeneous regulation for access to limited traffic areas for vehicles powered by alternative fuels and for their exclusion, subject to compliance with environmental protection constraints, from bans, including temporary bans, on road traffic.   Replacement of vehicles used for the transport of goods From the point of view of promoting development of commercial vehicles powered by alternative fuels, Ministerial Decree No 221/2018 from the Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport also provided incentives for the year 2018 for the purchase of industrial vehicles powered by alternative gas fuel capable of transporting goods of overall mass with full load equal to or greater than 3.5 tonnes, with alternative drive systems powered by CNG methane, liquefied natural gas and electricity (full electric). For this purpose, resources of around 33.6 million are to be used to promote initiatives for creating capital investment projects to replace vehicle fleets of haulage companies. The Italian Ministerial Decree No 221/2018 identifies 4 homogeneous types of investment which are to receive a share of the resources, on the basis of agreements made with haulage associations and on the basis of historical data relating to the greater or lesser success that the same measures have achieved in previous years.  9.6 million are to be used for contributions to promote the purchase, including by means of leasing contracts, of new vehicles suitable for the transport of goods, of overall mass with full load equal to or greater than 3.5 tonnes, with an alternative drive system powered by CNG methane, liquefied natural gas or electricity (full electric) and for purchasing devices suitable for carrying out the conversion of vehicles for transport of goods with a combustion engine into electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles (electric-diesel);  9 million to remove more obsolete vehicles for scrapping with the purchase of new Euro 6 tractor units.  14 million for purchasing new semi-trailers for combined rail and/or maritime transport and equipment for vehicles used for transport under the ATP agreement (refrigerated transport) with low environmental impact;  1 million for purchasing of containers and swap bodies, considered to be standardised INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 187   intermodal loading units, along with semi-trailer container chassis.   Reinforcement of the infrastructure The Budget Law for 2017 planned for the establishing of a fund, with an allocation of 1 900 million for the year 2017, 3 150 million for the year 2018, 3 500 million for the year 2019, and 3 000 million for each of the years from 2020 to 2032, to ensure the financing of investments and infrastructure developments across the country in spending areas relating to, among other things, transport, road systems, sustainable mobility, road safety, upgrading and accessibility of railway stations. The fund was refinanced by the Stability Law for 2018, for 800 million for the year 2018, for 1 615 million for the year 2019, for 2 180 million for each of the years from 2020 to 2023, for 2 480 million for the year 2024 and for 2 500 million for each of the years from 2025 to 2033. Italian Ministerial Decree No 360 of 2018 provided for the distribution of the fund for the completion of rapid mass transport measures, allocating 1.4 billion for this purpose. For the development of regional railways, following consultation with the Regions the Italian government will promote close cooperation with those Regions in monitoring the network, providing the possibility of entrusting to Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI), the Italian railway infrastructure operator, several routes currently managed by the Regions. For the development of the Electric Road System (ERS), on the basis of the results of trials the government will assess whether to launch initiatives for electrification of the motorway network using ERS technologies that enable the transfer of power to hybrid vehicles for transporting goods or passengers while moving, through conductive or inductive systems (eHighway technology).  With Italian Legislative Decree No 257/16, transposing Directive 94/14, measures were introduced in favour of development and distribution of electrical mobility, and in particular:  measures aimed at promoting the deployment of charging infrastructure in buildings (Article 15 paragraphs 1 and 2);  simplification of building authorisations through unequivocal recognition of declarations, statements, certifications and the technical documents to be presented for application for the necessary authorisation for the fitting of recharging infrastructures (Article 15 (4);  introduction of the obligation for public bodies, organisations and institutions dependent thereon or controlled thereby, the Regions, local bodies and providers of public utilities controlled thereby, when replacing their respective fleets of cars, buses and waste collection vehicles, to purchase at least 25% of vehicles powered by CNG, LNG or electric vehicles (Article 18(10));  modification of the Italian Highway Code on regulation of dedicated parking and stopping areas (Article 17 (1));  providing for an agreement ensuring implementation of consistent positions in terms of parking regulations, access to inner city areas, measures for incentivising and harmonising interventions and common objectives on national territory in relation to infrastructure networks for charging and refuelling of vehicles powered by electricity (Article 17 (2));  measures aimed at encouraging the installation of infrastructure for alternative fuels at new and renovated fuel distribution outlets (Article 18);  a national map of points accessible to the public for the supply or recharging of alternative fuels, electricity or hydrogen for road transport vehicles, available on the INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 188   thanks to information gatthe framework of the PNIRE (Article 8(5)). The Decree-Law of 18 April 2019 sets out the methods and time frames for implementing the single platform. In this regard the Ministerial Decree which establishes the methods for implementing the single platform and the first steps towards implementing the PNIRE is being finalised. The single platform will provide the minimum information needed to better assess recharging prices charged by operators. To this end a Ministerial Decree on the comparability of prices for recharging electric vehicles is being drawn up.   In summary, Italian Legislative Decree No 257/2016 provides for an increase of:  charging points (public and private) for electric vehicles from the current 2,900, approximately, up to at least 6,500 in 2020;  sales points supplying CNG from the current number of around 1,100 to around 2,400 in 2030;  sales points supplying LNG from the current number of a few dozen to around 800 in 2030.  To incentivise wider use of electric vehicles, the introduction of pricing instruments in favour of electricity is being considered, such as, for example, waiving the payment of system charges for the withdrawal of electricity for the purpose of charging vehicles.    Modal shift in the field of transport of persons The intention is to launch a program for promotion of alternative mobility which puts in place instruments for encouraging:  development of mobility for cyclists through cycle paths;  promotion of shared mobility (bike, car and motorbike sharing with low or zero emissions);  integration between sustainable mobility services (for example, parking structures for bicycles or car and bike sharing services close to public transport stops) and interchange parking;  promotion of smart working tools;  promotion of car-pooling, including by creating public or private platforms to match demand and supply, with an assessment of the feasibility of calculating and recording the savings underlying such activities;  development of ITS (traffic management, infomobility, smart roads). Italy will cooperate with the EU bodies to study the review of the car ownership tax based on actual annual use of the vehicle, with mechanisms to safeguard the most vulnerable groups and obligatory use. Through the Budget Laws for 2016 and 2017, the national system of cycle paths has been funded with national resources at a total of 372 million from 2016 to 2024. Up to now, the resources have been allocated for the design of the seven routes in respect of which the protocol agreements have been signed. These include, for example:    The VEnTO cycle route that links Venice and Turin, passing through numerous historic INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 189   cities, such as Mantua and Ferrara, and big cities such as Milan;  of Italy and finishing in Sicily, in Palermo, and in Sardinia in Cagliari.  the Apulian aqueduct and the Magna Graecia cycle routes;  the Tyrrhenian and the Adriatic cycle routes. The Italian government is also trialling smart road projects in Turin and Modena, the aim of which is to create road infrastructure equipped with platforms for traffic observation, monitoring and forecasting with a link between digital infrastructures and new generation vehicles. Several measures have already been launched, such as for example the call for tender from the Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea Protection aimed at urban areas, for creating cycle paths and sharing mobility (15 million allocated for 2018). Within the draft budget of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, the Budget Law for 2019 provided for a fund for intercity cycle routes, with an a million for 2019.  The Budget Law for 2020 establishes, within the same draft budget, a fund for the development of urban  million for each of the years 2022, 2023 and 2024. The fund covers 50% of the total cost of the work necessary to build new city cycle paths created by municipalities and groups of municipalities.  Lastly, the feasibility of extending the White Certificates system to promote shared forms of transport (car sharing and car-pooling) will be assessed.   SUMP: Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans For all metropolitan cities, bodies covering extensive areas, municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants and for cities with high levels of PM10 and/or nitrogen dioxide pollution (also with a population of fewer than 100,000 inhabitants), it will be mandatory to prepare a SUMP (no longer linked to mere provision of funding) by 2021, providing also that municipalities with a population of more than 50,000 inhabitants, using simplified guidelines, will have to prepare a SUMP as a mandatory requirement for access to funding by 2025.  The SUMPs make it necessary to harmonise existing measures and interventions within the framework of the replacement of the current LPT, sustainable mobility and the optimisation of the management of the movement of goods and people. Furthermore, in their urban plans the municipalities should include an energy plan that identifies a target quota of renewable energy that can be produced on site, as well as the tools needed to reach that objective. For car-pooling in particular, in order to maximise the potential for energy savings, the promotion of digital platforms for mapping supply and demand will be assessed. The platforms could be used to manage the service and to record savings made, with potential issuance of energy efficiency certificates that can be traded and used to buy public transport tickets. Italy will cooperate with the EU bodies to study the review of the car ownership tax based on actual annual use of the vehicle with mechanisms to safeguard the most vulnerable groups and obligatory use.   Summary of measures INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 190   Italy, as described in the preceding sections, proposes to achieve energy savings, calculated on the basis of the provisions set out in Article 7 paragraph 1 of the EED, by means of different key mechanisms, already activated or to be activated at national level. The table below shows a summary outline of the main elements of the mechanisms described. Table 28: Summary of measures for meeting the targets set under Article 7 of the EED and the main sectors involved  Type of measure Name of measure Sector  Energy poverty Residential  Tertiary  Industry  Transport  Obligation scheme White certificates      Alternative measures Tax reductions (bonus casa + Ecobonus)      Conto Termico      National Energy Efficiency Fund      Industry 4.0      PREPAC      Cohesion policies      Information and training plan      Replacement of public transport fleet      Modal shift in goods transport      The figure below shows the cumulative savings targets for each of the mechanisms proposed. Based on a confirmed minimum end-use energy saving target of 51.4 Mtoe, compared with 50.98 Mtoe calculated on the basis of the average consumption of end-use energy for 2016-2018, initial estimates of the impact of the mechanisms proposed indicate a cumulative saving of 57.44 Mtoe. Using the annual results provided by the monitoring tools already in place for 2014-2020, it will be possible to react in good time wherever a progression in savings that is not sufficient to achieve the targets is recorded and to propose appropriate adjustments where there are gaps between targets and results.   Figure 40  Outline of energy savings achieved (Mtoe of end-use energy) INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 191     The following histogram shows an indicative assessment of the savings on a sectoral level that are expected to be achieved in 2030 following the implementation of the measures described, in relation to the sector energy efficiency target set out in section 2.2.  Figure 41: Summary of expected savings in 2030, by sector (Mtoe of end-use energy)  ii. Long-term renovation strategy to support the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private12, including policies, measures and actions to stimulate cost-effective deep renovation and policies and actions to                                                             12 In accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 192   target the worst performing segments of the national building stock, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU  In order to make promotion of energy efficiency in the civil sector consistent with the targets and effective in relation to the goal by periodically evaluating the progress made, a long-term strategy will be prepared for renovation of building stock that provides intermediate and final targets, in accordance with the provisions of Directive (EU) 2018/844 on energy performance in buildings. Specifically, the strategy will be published upon transposition of the aforesaid Directive, expected by 10 March 2020. This section details the first guidelines in terms of targets for 2030 and for the subsequent decades, and some elements relating to promotional measures which will form the basis of the aforesaid strategy. It is estimated that, due to the measures currently in force (in particular tax deductions, White Certificates and the Conto Termico, already described in section 3.2.1, and via the central government programme to upgrade the energy efficiency of buildings (PREPAC)), by 2030 it will be possible to attain an annual energy saving from building restoration of 5.7 Mtoe, of which 3.3 Mtoe comes from the residential sector and 2.4 Mtoe from the tertiary sector (public and private). Considering a technical average lifespan of twenty years for the measures, the aim is to reach in 2040 and 2050 an indicative annual savings target of 11.4 Mtoe, with 6.6 Mtoe in the housing sector and 4.8 Mtoe in the tertiary sector. The energy savings potential in the civil sector remains broad, however, and often achievable via efficiency measures with sustainable return times. Nevertheless, numerous barriers - different in the sectors of application - and in some cases, return times that are too long - prevent these savings from being fully realised. Efforts to reach these energy saving targets are thus focused also on overcoming these barriers, streamlining and reinforcing instruments and actions dedicated to each segment and sector. Specifically, the following measures are planned:  the reinforcement of minimum and regulatory standards;  the introduction of measures to improve the quality of energy performance certificates (EPCs) and ways of promoting the purchase of residences in a high energy class;  promoting the use of demand-response technology, ICT systems and home automation which permit the monitoring and control of building performance;  improving tests for verification of compliance with regulations and standards;  improving integration among rules for energy efficiency and renewable sources in buildings;  evaluating the possibility of introducing energy efficiency obligations in the event of renovations, where justified in terms of the cost-benefit ratio, and introducing new limits on the use of cooling installations;  promoting synergies with renewable sources in the form of self-consumed energy, as highlighted in the public consultation. Particular attention will be paid to updating and integrating of promotional instruments, for which, as already described in section 3.2.1, there is a plan to implement actions to increase efficiency in terms of costs for the beneficiaries and for the national system and to encourage deep renovation. Schemes for promoting measures in buildings used by public bodies will also be improved, as these must provide an example and guidance to the entire business sector. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 193   Fundamental factors for the success of the measures mentioned are, additionally, simplification of administrative procedures, controls and enforcement of the measures implemented, the strengthening and enhancing of the ESCo model, measures for communication and to raise awareness, improvement of the monitoring systems and recording of results, and support for research and innovation. Assessment will be made of the potential systemisation, at national level, of all the weather and climate data held for various reasons by public and/or research bodies and by data survey and certification campaigns on an ongoing basis, with the aim of building a solid database for implementing dynamic building simulation and energy certification models. Additionally, measures to improve the quality of energy performance certificates (EPCs) and ways of promoting the purchase of residences in a high energy class will be introduced, including for promoting the market for buildings with increased standards of energy efficiency. An important contribution to energy efficiency, in addition to that described above, will lastly come from improving minimum efficiency standards for buildings and from the improvement of mandatory provisions in relation to integration of renewable energy sources in buildings. The strategy will set out indicative milestones for 2030, 2040 and 2050, coordinated with the Energy and Climate Plan and with the long-term strategy for decarbonisation by 2050; in this context the Italian strategy envisages ambitious emission reduction scenarios, in line with EU guidelines.  Lastly, consideration will be given to revising the ways in which costs linked to individual heat extraction in multi-apartment buildings are distributed, in order to better encourage the adoption of energy upgrading measures for the entire building.  iii. Description of policies and measures to promote energy services in the public sector and measures to remove regulatory and non-regulatory barriers that impede the uptake of energy performance contracting and other energy efficiency service models13 Article 14(4) of Italian Legislative Decree 102/2014, transposing the EED, provided for the improvement of the EPC contractual model - already provided by Italian Legislative Decree 192/2005, transposing the EPBD - by means of the minimum elements that must feature in energy performance contracts agreed with the public sector, listed in Annex 8 of that same  The proposed model is aimed at public bodies, to facilitate for the latter the signing of contracts to promote energy efficiency in buildings occupied by them; it is designed to encourage the involvement of private operators (ESCos, credit institutions, etc.) in order to generate economies of scale, and to be clear and transparent about the results to be achieved, while complying with both contracting procedures in accordance with current legislation and with new provisions on energy efficiency in buildings. However, several criteria and barriers to dissemination of energy performance contracts have been identified, which are expected to be overcome in the short-term. In fact, the EPC contractual model is currently an atypical kind of contract in the Italian legal framework.                                                             13 In accordance with Article 18 of Directive 2012/27/EU INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 194   This atypical nature, linked to its being a multi-service contract (works, services and supplies),creates regulatory uncertainty about its legal classification which, in the absence of legislative characterisation, opens itself up to multiple interpretations which in fact do not encourage the creation of a single category of contract. Currently, the EPC for buildings may be issued both through the procedures provided for procurements, or through the patent granting procedure (PPP), and whether in one form and the other, the legislative uncertainty is such as to limit its prevalence. Therefore, in order to promote a more widespread use of the EPC, eliminating the current barriers, the plan is to introduce into the Italian Code of Public Contracts (Legislative Decree 50/2016 as amended and supplemented), the definition of the EPC for buildings as a special contract, and a new type of PPP contract for EPCs for buildings which sets out the specific details. In addition to the aforesaid, considering the potential to reduce consumption by public bodies and the example that the public system should provide, the inclusion of mandatory savings clauses in energy contracts entered into by public bodies will be established. Additionally, as regards the legal obligations relating to energy efficiency, sanction and reward systems will be set up for the managers/officials responsible for building management. It is also considered appropriate to strengthen several key enablers, which are fundamental for boosting private investments for the purpose of reaching the energy efficiency targets:  structuring and monitoring the process for the qualification of workers in the sector, with particular reference to ESCos;  simplifying the authorisation process for access to incentive schemes;  improving control activities in relation to standards and regulations.  ensuring that environmental laws are implemented correctly within that body, as well as promoting work towards improving energy efficiency.  iv. Other planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030 as well as other objectives referred to in point 2.2 (for example measures to promote the exemplary role of public buildings and energy-efficient public procurement, measures to promote energy audits and energy management systems14, consumer information and training measures15, and other measures to promote energy efficiency16)    Energy audits and energy management systems Article 8 of Italian Legislative Decree 102/2014, paragraphs 1 and 3, identifies as parties obligated to carry out a periodic energy audit, from 2015, large companies (paragraph 1) and                                                             14 In accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2012/27/EU 15 In accordance with Articles 12 and 17 of Directive 2012/27/EU 16 In accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2012/27/EU  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 195   companies with high energy consumption, so-(paragraph 3). To date, 15,460 audits relating to 8,686 companies have been submitted to the ENEA. This number is destined to increase following the actions from the Ministry of Economic Development in terms of verification, monitoring and forwarding into the same database the audits of the SMEs that participate in regional tenders. The table below shows the breakdown by sector: around 45% of the audits have been carried out in the manufacturing sector and a further 10% in trade, which includes consumption by the large-scale retailers.  Table 29 - Energy audits carried out within the meaning of Article 8 of Italian Legislative Decree 102/2014  [Source; ENEA].

The following table thus shows the potential of investments and savings, according to the different periods of economic payback. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 196   Table 30 - audits carried out within the meaning of Article 8 of Italian Legislative Decree 102/2014 for the payback time of the investment; cumulative values [Source: ENEA].          The high number of audits carried out will continue to grow thanks to the Ministry of SMEs or the adoption of energy management systems which conform to the ISO 50001 standards. The Regions, in turn, have made available up to a further 15 million annually for public cofinancing which in total covers 50% of the costs of carrying out the energy audit. In the period 2021-2030, the plan is to carry out the energy audit preparation programme in large companies and in energy-intensive companies, extending it also to energy-intensive companies in the gas sector and correlating the benefit perceived by the energy-intensive companies with carrying out energy efficiency measures as part of their own production process, as also emerged from the public consultation. It is however considered important to update provisions in order to increase the effectiveness of the instrument, focusing the audit on companies and on sites with the greatest energy savings potential. It will also be expedient to complement this instrument with a scheme to promote energy management systems which conform to ISO 50001 standards, in order to realise savings identified in the audits themselves. Activities to promote energy efficiency in SMEs will also be carried out, renewing the cofinancing initiatives for energy audits and energy management systems, for example creating links with support instruments present at a national and local level, supporting energand laying the groundwork for promotion of voluntary agreements between companies which have as their target the promotion of energy efficiency. Lastly, in order to increase awareness among companies in terms of their own energy consumption and to improve awareness in relation to implementing measures to reduce need, the provisions relating to rational use and energy conservation will be updated, evaluating in particular the energy balance of the company. This instrument will make it possible to increase energy awareness among management in the business sector, making policy making activities more effective.   Mandatory integration of renewables in new or renovated buildings The subject, which intersects with the issues of efficiency and renewable sources, is discussed in the sections of this chapter dedicated to renewable energy and heat sources.   Heating and cooling Payback time (years) Interventions Investments  Savings (toe)  3 8,364  646,335,323 779,560  5 14,193  1,631,881,852 1,168,814  10 21,923  2,657,662,287 1,414,719   20 25,698  3,341,674,298 1,501,881  30 26,284  3,449,551,432 1,509,606 Savings potential (Mtoe) 0 0.5 1 1.5 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 197   In the heating and cooling sector, provisions relating to air conditioning installations will be updated, with the specific intention of gradually replacing installations with high emissions (including diesel boilers and non-efficient biomass installations) with low-emission, highly efficient technology. The measures will therefore be reinforced to ensure compliance with regulations and standards, increasing monitoring activity of the hours of operation for heating installations in order to verify that there are no anomalies in respect of the limits of use. The introduction of new limits on the use of cooling installations will then be assessed, through the establishing of constraints (e.g. days of use, hours, minimum temperature) to be imposed in relation to the relevant climate zone. In this regard, the development of district heating and district cooling will also be encouraged, in order to exploit the residual economic potential highlighted in chapter 2. To this end, instruments will be put in place to update the facilitation framework in the sector. For example, this has already been provided by an implementing provision of Italian Law 172/2017, which establishes subsidies for cogeneration installations which lead to increased heat production capacity aimed at maintaining or reaching an efficient district heating system set-up within the meaning of Italian Legislative Decree No 102 of 4 July 2014, and which is combined with an extension of the network in terms of increasing transport capacity. Lastly it will be fundamental to increase awareness and the active role of consumers, using, for example, home automation, network digitalisation and smart metering, the promotion of which will be assessed using appropriate tools. The implementation of the provisions already provided for by Italian Legislative Decree No 102/2014, in relation to systems for metering and billing of energy consumption in the housing sector, will be completed and if necessary improved, in order to provide accurate and timely information to the consumer about their own energy consumption, a necessary condition for promoting correct, or in any case more efficient, behaviour. To this end, the best use will be made of increasing digital connectivity (ultra-wideband technology) and the development of applications for remote control of buildings, also encouraging a different role for electricity and gas sellers, who will be able to develop commercial proposals aimed not solely at the sale of the commodity, but also at the offer of services to manage consumption.  Public lighting As regards public bodies, the intention is to build an energy efficiency programme, starting first with public lighting. In this sector, the programme will provide a set of measures, targeted at local public bodies, aimed at accelerating the ongoing process for replacement of light sources and the installation of consumption monitoring systems, alongside more efficient reprogramming of hours of use. In this connection, the Budget Law for 2018 established that public bodies are obliged to redevelop public lighting systems by 31 December 2023, guaranteeing a reduction in electricity consumption of at least 50% in relation to the average consumption 2015-2016. The companies, involved in development of measures, may take advantage of the subsidies supplied from the revolving Fund for supporting companies and investment in research, where 300 million have been allocated for the granting of subsidised loans.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 198    Cooperation between central government and local authorities in terms of energy efficiency A specific model of governance will be adopted, without prejudice to the central role of the State, which promotes active contribution by all central government authorities, the Regions and the municipalities, to reaching the national energy efficiency targets, through:  the continuous improvement of energy efficiency instruments implemented nationally and locally, reorganising, for example, energy efficiency measures in order to allow for better coordination and to avoid measures overlapping or clashing (the POR FESR, FNEE, Conto Termico);  the monitoring, enhancing and support of initiatives provided on a central and local level and the results obtained. A particularly useful instrument in this sense was the aforementioned burden sharing of the renewables target, expressed as a proportion of consumption, so as to also encourage regional and local energy efficiency incentives. The new Monitoring Body will occupy itself more explicitly with energy efficiency.  Energy efficiency measures under the Budget Law for 2020 and the Decree-Law on Tax for 2020 The Budget Law for  million per year, for investment in public works for increasing energy efficiency, including public lighting, energy saving in publicly owned buildings and public housing, and the installation of energy plants fuelled by renewable sources. The subsidies can also be used by the municipalities for projects in the areas of sustainable local development, sustainable mobility, upgrading and safety assurance in schools, public buildings and municipal property, and removing architectural barriers. Decree-Law No 124 of 2019, converted into Law No 157 of 19 December 2019 (the Decree-Law on Tax for 2020), establishes a fund with an allocation  million for each year from 2020 to 2029, with spending authorisation and relative financial cover also provided for 2030, for the energy restructuring and upgrading of former psychiatric hospital buildings. The Budget Law for 2020 establishes in the statement of estimates of the Ministry of the Interior a fund for investment by  million for each year from 2025 to 2034. The fund will be used to boost investments in sustainable infrastructure development and improve energy efficiency in Italy. The focus will be on public building expenditure (including maintenance and safety and energy efficiency), maintenance of the road network, hydrogeological instability, prevention of seismic risk and promotion of cultural and environmental heritage.  In addition, a change has been introduced to the provisions of Law No 145 of 30 December 2018 (the Budget Law for 2019) which assigns the municipalities allocations of:   million for 2021;  million for 2022;   million for each year from 2023 to 2025;   million for 2026;   million for each year from 2027 to 2031;   million for each of the years 2032 and 2033;  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 199    million for 2034. This funding can be used for improving safety and energy efficiency in the buildings owned by the municipality, with precedence given to school buildings. Through a change to the Budget Law for 2019, for 2021-2034 the non-autonomous Regions have been assigned allocations for investments in public works for safety and energy efficiency improvements on buildings and land. The funding is also intended for road improvements, safety improvements and the development of public transport systems to reduce environmental pollution, for urban regeneration and conversion to renewable energy sources, for social infrastructure and for environmental reclamation of polluted sites. These allocations amount to:   million for each of the years 2021 and 2022;  million for each year from 2023 to 2025;   million for 2026;  million for each of the years from 2027 to 2032;   million for 2033;   million for 2034.  To facilitate these investments, the Budget Law for 2020 assigns the local authorities allocations, subject to cost reporting, to cover the definitive planning and execution of measures to ensure the safety of areas at hydrogeological risk, to improve safety and energy efficiency in schools, public buildings and municipal heritage and to ensure the safety of roads  million  million  million  million for each of the years from 2023 to 2034. Furthermore, to finance public works in the areas of road safety assurance and extraordinary maintenance and energy efficiency of schools in the  million for each of the years 2020 and 2021 and of  million for each of the years from 2022 to 2034 is authorised.  In addition, it has been established that the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research draw up a national plan of measures to improve energy efficiency in publicly owned school buildings which already meet all the necessary structural safety requirements, identified on the basis of criteria which take into account energy consumption, estimates of energy savings and management cost reduction for the local authorities that own or manage them, as well as the existing student population and the size of the buildings. The resources allocated total  million million a year for 2022 and 2023; implementation is supported by the European Investment Bank, also via the creation of the Energy Service Company (ESCo) Decree-Law No 124 of 2019, converted into Law No 157 of 19 December 2019 (Law on Tax for 2020), changes the way the resources that the taxpayer devolves to the State under the reference in particular to the share directed towards the restructuring, improvement, safety assurance, earthquake-proofing and energy efficiency improvement of publicly owned school buildings. To guarantee a fairer distribution of such special measures throughout the country, starting from the 2019 tax declaration the resources will be allocated in three equal parts to the geographical areas of the North (Piemonte, Valle d'Aosta, Lombardy, Liguria, Trentino-Alto Adige, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Emilia-Romagna), Central Italy and the Islands ((Tuscany, Umbria, The Marche, Lazio, Sicily and Sardinia), and the South (Abruzzo, Molise, Campania, Puglia, Basilicata and Calabria). INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 200   Lastly, the Decree-Law on Tax for 2020 provides for measures to broaden the use of resources assigned to the Regions for local interventions and for the safety of the national rail network. More specifically, the scope of the investments planned for 2021-2033 for the non-autonomous Regions has been widened to include the transport sector and modernisation with a view to reducing environmental pollution and encouraging investment in urban regeneration, conversion to renewable energy sources, social infrastructure and environmental restoration.  v. Where applicable, a description of policies and measures to promote the role of local renewable energy communities in contributing to the implementation of policies and measures in points i, ii, iii and iv  See question 3.2.1.v  vi. Description of measures to develop measures to utilise energy efficiency potentials of gas and electricity infrastructure17 The infrastructure pricing regulation will include the energy efficiency parameter for the purposes of compensating operators.  vii. Regional cooperation in this area, where applicable This will mainly be based on the exchange of best practices with the countries with which Italy has activated the regional cooperation process, focussing on the policies Italy has adopted that have attracted the interest of other countries.  viii. Financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds, in the area at national level In the shared planning of the structural funds intended for Italy for the period 2021-2027, with particular reference to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund currently under discussion, and for the successive period 2028-2034, priority will be given to implementing the INECP, including to facilitate the building of the 2014-2020 partnership agreement.  In line with the other objectives in the planning cycle, particular attention will be paid to the allocation of significant resources at a local and national level for initiatives aimed at decarbonisation of the public and private building stock and at measures for limiting mobility requirement and increase in collective mobility, in particular via rail, in particular the switching of the transport of goods from road to rail. It is in fact recalled that the five EU investment priorities include those aimed at creating a greener Europe free of carbon emissions. Decree-Law No 34 of 30 April 2019 (the Growth Decree-Law) establishes a contribution for  million in 2019 to be drawn from the Development and Cohesion Fund for interventions relating to investment in the field of energy efficiency and sustainable local development. The contribution is assigned to each municipality on the basis of the resident population on 1 January 2018, as follows:                                                               17 In accordance with Article 15, paragraph 2, of Directive 2012/27/EU  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 201    between 5,001 and 10,000;    0,000 to municipalities with a population of between 20,001 and 50,000;  100,000;      The contributions are to be used for public works in the areas of:  c) energy efficiency, including interventions for public lighting, energy saving in publicly owned buildings and public housing, as well as installation of plants for renewable energy production; d) sustainable local development, including interventions in the areas of sustainable mobility, updating and safety assurance in schools, public buildings and municipal heritage and for removing architectural barriers. From 2020, for the projects mentioned above, the Growth Decree-Law authorises the implementation of a multi-year financing programme, the resources of which are divided between municipalities with a population of below 1,000, assigning each one an equal amount. In the  Decrees of 14 May and 10 July 2019, the Ministry of Economic Development set out the size of contribution to each Italian municipality and the methods for implementing the measure (eligible interventions, the contribution that can be granted and the methods for granting it, monitoring of the measure). As for the national financing measures, please refer to the description of the individual measures.
