 and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 161    4.6.i. Current situation of the low-carbon technology sector Research and development in Luxembourg has traditionally focused on the steel, aviation and automotive sectors. In recent years, the Government has made significant efforts to develop further priorities in the areas of information and communication technologies, logistics, health technologies, materials, energy and Clean Technologythe national economic diversification strategy. Luxembourg has made specific advancements in the areas of sustainable building, sustainable mobility and the circular economy. Initiatives in these areas are in line with EU policy and the various directives on issues such as the energy efficiency of buildings, smart transport systems or ecodesign requirements.  Thanks to its steel industry, Luxembourg has a long-standing tradition of materials-based research. Today it is working, among other things, on the development of sustainable building materials. In addition, Luxembourg now has three research teams in the field of solar photovoltaic material research to further develop resource-optimised thin film PV.  In addition, Luxembourg also has innovation clusters that are dedicated to the issues mentioned above. The Luxembourg CleanTech Cluster23 or even the Wood Cluster24 deserve special mention. Public research stakeholders, including the University of Luxembourg, play a key role in this context. The same applies to Luxinnovation, the national agency for promoting innovation and research, which offers personalised consultancy and support for the stakeholders and the government in the areas of research and innovation (access to funding opportunities, finding partners, business creation, etc.), thereby playing an important role in this area in terms of the European networks.                                                               23 https://www.luxinnovation.lu/cluster/luxembourg-cleantech-cluster/ 24 https://www.luxinnovation.lu/cluster/luxembourg-wood-cluster/  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 162   4.6.ii. Current level of public and, where available, private research and innovation spending on low-carbon technologies, current number of patents, and current number of researchers The key public research stakeholders in the field of low-carbon technologies are the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology and the University of Luxembourg. Their total expenditure on research and  million. Both institutions currently employ about 160 researchers in this field and together they hold 22 patents or patent families that are assigned to the field.  4.6.iii.

Description of energy subsidies, including for fossil fuels Luxembourg has well-established public funding instruments to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy. These are explained in more detail in Section 3.1.1.iii. This also includes the feed-in tariffs for the production of electricity from renewable sources (see Section 3.1.2.i).  As explained in Section 3.1.3.iv above, the Luxembourg Government has commissioned an analysis of the possible impact of direct and indirect subsidies and tax advantages on sustainable development. The scope of this study also includes tax breaks in the energy and transport sectors. The results of the ongoing study will be used as a basis for any adjustments.
