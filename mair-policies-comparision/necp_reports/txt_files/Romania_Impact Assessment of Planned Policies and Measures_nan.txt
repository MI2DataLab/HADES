The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         5. Impact assessment of planned policies and measures80 The integration of the modelling results for the two macroeconomic scenarios assessed (modelling scenario in the context of existing WEM measures and modelling scenario in the context of planned WAM measures) reflects aspects pertaining to the Romanian economy, where the need for expedited development on the economic, political and social level must be decarbonisation, energy efficiency, enhanced energy security, completion of the common energy market and increase in competitiveness by developing the research and innovation se in the competitiveness of the Romanian economy, the increase in the quality of life and the concern for the environment are  The modelling scenario in the context of the existing WEM measures and the modelling scenario in the context of the planned WAM measures are set out in part 2 of Annex I attached to this Plan. The description of the methodology used for the WAM scenario modelling is set out  From this viewpoint, part 2 of Annex I lists a series of entry parameters and modelling results for the scenario based on existing measures and the scenario which considers the planned policies and measures described in Section 3.   5.1.  Impacts of planned policies and measures described in section 3 on energy system and GHG emissions and removals, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures (as described in section 4) i. Projections of the development of the energy system and GHG emissions and removals as well as, where relevant of emissions of air pollutants in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/2284 under the planned policies and measures at least until ten years after the period covered by the plan (including for the last year of the period covered by the plan), including relevant Union policies and measures Gross electricity generation Having regard to the above context, the comparison between the two modelling types in the gross electricity generation chapter indicates similar upward trajectories even if, in the WAM scenario, the increase is weighted at a 1.1 % CAGR projected for 2020-2030. The gross electricity generation pertaining to the two scenarios is listed below:                                                 80 Planned policies and measures are options under discussion and having a realistic chance of being adopted and implemented after the date of submission of the national plan. The resulting projections under section 5.1.i shall therefore include not only implemented and adopted policies and measures (projections with existing policies and measures), but also planned policies and measures.

Moreover, compared to the WEM scenario, the energy mix will undergo the following changes:   the production from nuclear energy features a negative correction (the commissioning of the third nuclear reactor towards the end of 2030);  the drop in the generation of electricity from solid fuels (negative correction by 10.15 % compared to WEM for 2030), considering the increased costs to ensure compliance with the environmental requirements (carbon emissions and other air pollutants);  increase in production from photovoltaic sources (increase by 130 % compared to WEM for 2030) and from onshore wind sources (60.7 % compared to WEM for 2030) features a significant positive correction which partially offsets the curtailment of production from conventional resources (coal in particular). Energy consumption The economic growth projected for Romania is necessarily reflected in the final energy demand, which features a positive correction of almost 8.55 % in the WAM scenario compared to the WEM scenario for 2030, taking into account the energy efficiency and competitiveness increase measures based on research and innovation.  The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Chart 47  Final energy consumption - WAM vs WEM [ktoe]  Source: Deloitte calculation based on the information submitted by the INECP Interinstitutional Working Gr  As regards final energy consumption, the two scenarios are differentiated by (WAM vs WEM):  the increase in energy consumption in the transport sector, with a 15.67 % correction for 2030;  the increase in energy consumption in the industrial sector (14.59 %) and in the tertiary sector (24.66 %) for 2030;  the decrease in energy consumption in the residential sector by 7.84 % in 2030 due to the additional energy efficiency measures.  As regards the final energy mix consumption for 2030, the increase in final energy consumption (compared to WEM, a positive correction of 8.55 %) will be mainly generated by an increase in electricity consumption (positive correction of 15.75 % in the WAM scenario compared to WEM). The final energy mix consumption for 2030 is detailed below: Chart 48  Final energy consumption by energy source - WAM vs WEM  2030 [ktoe]  Source: Deloitte calculation based on the information submitted by the INECP Interinstitutional   The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         RO EN Combustibili solizi  Solid fuels   Crude oil and petroleum products  Gaze naturale Natural gas Electricitate Electricity  Heat Forme de energie  Renewable energy forms  Renewable energy consumption the achievement of the European decarbonisation, energy efficiency, energy security, internal market and competitiveness targets included in the EU programmatic documents.  The comparison between the two modelling types in the specific area of renewable energy reveals the following results:  a 30.7 % global share in renewable resources is reached in 2030 (compared to the 24 % target in 2020) following the projected additional policies and measures;  the upward movement of the share of renewable energy used in the transport sector, which increases from 11.2 % (the WEM scenario - 2030) to 14.2 % (the WAM scenario - 2030), is noticeable in the context of additional policies and measures, which aim at transport electrification and second generation biofuels;  as regards the RES share in heating and cooling, a 4.2 % increase is also recorded (WAM vs WEM  2030) as a result of applying additional measures for the installation of heat pumps and solar panels, and of integrating other renewable energy sources in the production of heat for district heating systems;  for the RES share in electricity, having regard to the additional measures and policies, a 4.5 % increase in the WAM scenario has been noticed, compared to the WEM for 2030.   Air pollutants and air quality Directive (EU) 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2016 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants, amending Directive 2003/35/EC and repealing Directive 2001/81/EC (hereafter the new NEC Directive) entered into force on 31 December 2016 and was transposed by Law No 293/2018 on the reduction of national emissions of certain air pollutants.  Law No 293/2018 provides for the development of the national air pollutant control programme (NAPCP), an obligation being imposed on the central public environmental protection authority to submit the first NAPCP to the European Commission by 1 April 2019. In order to prepare the NAPCP, the Ministry of the Environment, Waters and Forestry submitted a project financing application form under the Operational Programme Administrative Capacity 2014-2020 (OPAC IP14/2019), which was under evaluation by MA OPAC on the date when the INECP was prepared. The assessment of the interactions with the air quality and air emissions policy would be inconsistent to a certain extent because the figures reported by the Ministry of the The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Environment, Waters and Forestry in March 201981 on air pollutants, in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/2284, are determined on the basis of the existing and currently planned policies at the level of knowledge of 2018-2019, whereas the projections for GHG emissions are reported on the basis of the calculations made two to three years ago under assumptions that are different from the INECP. Moreover, the RES target of 30.7 % from the revised version of the plan mainly rests on the assumption of a decrease in the share of coal-based electricity generation in the gross electricity generation and such assumption is not indicated in the abovementioned reports. Since the abovementioned reports are not harmonised with the INECP and in the absence of a sufficiently developed version of the NAPCP, this INECP cannot include a consistent assessment of the interactions with the air quality and air emissions policy, with the necessary information on air pollutants projected in the planned policies and measures. The following reports will envisage harmonisation with the INECP and the abovementioned assessment is to be included in the future plan revisions. When the INECP was prepared, the Forestry Reference Level (FRL) and the National Forestry Accounting Plan (NFAP) were under development, the reporting deadline for the final documents being 31 December 2019. The updating of the GHG emissions/removals in the LULUCF sector, which is part of the National Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (INEGES), with an impact on the determination of FRL and of GHG emissions/removals projections, was also under preparation. The completion deadline for Biannual Report No 4 is 31 December and the remaining reports are to follow their normal course in 2020, starting with 15 January, when the INEGES data is reported to the Commission and the European Environment Agency. When the INECP was prepared, there were no sufficiently advanced draft versions of the indicated documents/reports to extract the necessary data.  ii.

In this respect, the development of specific educational packages at all levels is mentioned: secondary schools and public and dual system vocational schools, schools.82 Beyond the focus of these initiatives on the energy field, the general macroeconomic elements ascertain the beneficial effect of implementing the WAM model on certain relevant elements:  although the falling trend in the population of Romania is maintained, it is slightly slowed down by the implementation of the planned model, with a population count of 18.4 million reached in 2030 (compared to 18 million in the WEM scenario);  the gross domestic product escalates to a significant extent, having a relative value of almost 28 % in the WAM modelling compared to the WEM for 2030;  the gross added value has leaped dramatically (by approximately 30 %) in 2030 in the WAM scenario compared to WEM. with the exception of constructions (a projected decrease of approximately 5 % compared to the WEM scenario in 2030), increases are projected for each of the component sectors, namely by 35.7 % for the tertiary sector (services + agriculture), by 11.5 % for the energy sector and by 32.4 % for the industrial sector compared to the WEM scenario in 2030;  the social dimension of the macroeconomic increase is also reflected in the number and size of households, but particularly in their available income, which would account for a 34 % increase under a WAM modelling versus the WEM modelling in 2030. Even if these indicators are normally reflected in increases and benefits also generated in other areas of the social and economic environment (health, environment, employment, education, competence level etc.), no sufficient elements are currently available to draw up an impact assessment.  Aspects related to just transition The coal mining activity in Romania is concentrated in two subregions. i.e. Valea Jiului and Rovinari/Turceni, which are located in Hunedoara and Gorj counties. Carbon mining is also                                                  82 The Energy Strategy of Romania for 2019-2030, with outlook to 2050 The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         90 % of the labour in the mining sector is employed in the two counties, i.e. Hunedoara and Gorj, and the total number of jobs directly dependent on coal mining and production of coal-based energy amounts to 18 600, with other 10 000 jobs indirectly dependent on coal. The power plants in Hunedoara and Gorj emit approximately 90 % of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from coal-based plants or approximately 30 % from the GHG emissions in Romania from mining and the manufacturing industry. If mining and the use of fossil fuels are ceased, these jobs are likely to be endangered. Moreover, both counties have industrial facilities with high carbon emissions, which raises additional challenges to the decarbonisation objective because these companies are foreseen to undergo restructuring procedures before 2030, which is likely to have a negative impact on the employment rate. This preliminary assessment would reveal that the intervention of the Just Transition Mechanism is justified particularly in these geographical areas. The intervention of the Just Transition Mechanism will also be necessary in other counties with mining activities, such as Vâlcea and Dolj. Moreover, the Just Transition Mechanism need also to consider the counties with no mining activity, but where coal- In order to address the challenges of the energy transition, investment priorities have been identified in order to reduce the social and economic costs entailed by the transition. The key actions of the Just Transition Fund could aim at:  investments in the regeneration and decontamination of sites, rehabilitation of lands and redefining of projects;  investments in the implementation of technologies and the infrastructure required to supply clean energy at affordable prices, the reduction of GHG emissions, energy efficiency and renewable energy sources;  investments in SMEs, including start-ups, supporting economic diversification and reconversion;  83;  investments in the area of research and innovation and fostering of state-of-the-art technologies;  development of worker  assistance to job seekers;  technical assistance. Significant job losses are projected for the abovementioned counties and the establishment and development of SMEs is likely to be unable to offset these losses. Exceptionally and only where required to implement territorial transition plans, support may be considered for investments in large enterprises, particularly for energy complex electricity generation facilities.  Moreover, industrial sites in these counties, where activities are carried out among those listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/97/EC, have a considerable number of employees, and their activity is endangered by the high GHG emission rate. Support may be considered for investments aimed at reducing GHG emissions, provided that they lead to significant reductions (far below the relevant reference values used for free allocation under Directive 2003/87/EC) and that they are compatible with the European Green Deal.                                                 83 Enterprises active in supporting newly-established companies by financial and/or technical services.

These counties account for approximately 35 % of the GHG emissions in Romania, which originate in the mining and manufacturing industries.  Since it has been projected that the identified sectors will be subjected to energy transition changes, the intervention of the JTF is also justified in these geographical areas to support their reconversion.  5.3.  Overview of investment needs i. Existing investment flows and forward investment assumptions with regard to the planned policies and measures The investment flow that is relevant for the WEM scenario modelling undergoes a positive correction under the measures and policies projected for the WAM scenario. The projections indicate a significant increase in investments by 56.8 % in the period 2021-2030 in the WAM scenario (total investment value of approximately EUR 150 billion for 20212030 - WAM), compared to the WEM scenario.  A more detailed account of the prognosis categories reveals relevant specificities:  The chapter of investments required to meet the demand remains relatively constant (as a percentage in the total investments) in both scenarios ranging between 80 % and 90 %. It actually reflects the projected economic growth that will foster energy demand in all relevant fields (industrial, residential, tertiary, transport etc.).  Under these conditions, the increase in investments required to meet the demand is very relevant for the industrial sector (384.5 %) and the tertiary sector (169.5 %) in the period 2021-2030.  The investment demand from the bidding zone for electricity grids appears to be significantly high in the WAM scenario compared to the WEM (i.e. by 98 %) in the period 2021-2030.  The characteristics of an assessment of the investment needs actually reflect the economic growth assumptions presented and mentioned in Chapter 5.2, directly influencing the existing projects, in the sense of extending them, and new projects that become a necessity (elaborated in Chapter 4). The investments in the period 2021-2030 (cumulative values), which are needed to achieve the objectives proposed in the context of the future policies and measures (WAM scenario), are presented in the chart below. The energy sector alone (production, transmission, distribution of electricity) thus requires total investments of approximately EUR 22.6 billion in the period 2021-2030.

In the framework of the new 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework84: 1. Structural Funds: European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF) The new MFF will have a thematic concentration, of which priority objective (PO) 2: A greener carbon free Europe and PO 3: A more connected Europe are the most closely linked to the investment demand under the INECP.  PO 2 is the most relevant for the energy sector. This objective promotes a greener low-carbon Europe by promoting non-polluting and fair energy transition, green investments, the                                                 84 When the INECP was prepared, the allocations for the new 2021-2027 MFF were still under negotiation. The INECP sets out guidelines regarding the amounts funded for the 2021-2027 MFF and they are likely to be amended as soon as a final political agreement has been reached. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         circular economy, adaptation to climate change and risk prevention and management. The ERDF/CF specific objectives under this PO are:  to promote energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gases;  to promote renewable energy generation;  to develop smart energy systems, grids and storage outside the TEN-E;  to prevent and to address the risks related to climate change and the natural risks (floods, drought, forest fires, landslides, earthquakes) according to the national priorities set and in the framework of the cross-border and transnational coordination and cooperation. PO 2 is the most relevant for the environment sector. The ERDF/CF aim at the following specific objectives for this sector:  to promote adaptation to the effects of climate change, to prevent risks and to strengthen resilience to disasters;  to promote transition to a circular economy. PO 3 is the most relevant for the transport sector. This PO will support investments aimed at:  developing a sustainable, secure and intermodal TEN-T network adapted to the effects of climate change;  developing and strengthening national, regional and local sustainable, flexible and intermodal mobility, including improvement of access to the TEN-T network and cross-border mobility;  developing rail transport as a priority and achieving its intermodal integration with other modes of transport;  insourcing external costs for all modes of transport. The operational programmes (OP) proposed, under which the budget allocated to Romania for the period 2021-2027 will be administered and which are aligned with the investment needs described in the INECP, are: the Operational Programme Sustainable Development, the Operational Programme Smart Growth and Digitalisation, the Regional Operational Programmes (which will be implemented regionally) and the Just Transition Operational Programme. Below are the elements of the main operational programmes, noting that they were at the stage of proposal when the INECP was prepared and they are likely to undergo changes thereafter:    The Operational Programme Sustainable Development The total financial allocation for this OP is EUR 5 782.571 million, of which: EUR 3 310 million from the ERDF, EUR 737.800 million from the CF and EUR 1 734.771 million from the State budget.

InvestEU The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         The InvestEU Programme of the new MFF provides for a guarantee of EUR 38 billion from the State budget to mobilise capital and to achieve an estimated investment target of EUR 650 billion in the period 2021-2027. This instrument will be developed through the implementation partners, the main partner being the group of the European Investment Bank (EIB). The project promotors will have access to grants in the form of financial products such as debts or participation in the capital, as liseligible investments, the following such scopes being most closely linked to the INECP:  Sustainable infrastructure o This scope concerns the development of the energy system, the development of sustainable transport infrastructures, innovative equipment and technologies, environmental and resource protection, and development of the digital infrastructure connectivity. Eligible investments will be, among others: o production, supply and use of clean, sustainable and secure energy from renewable resources and other similar low-carbon or zero emission energy sources; o energy efficiency and energy savings; o development and modernisation of the sustainable energy infrastructure in energy transmission and distribution, storage, smart grids; o development of innovative low-carbon or zero emissions district heating and cogeneration systems; o production and supply of synthetic fuels from renewable energy or carbon neutral sources; o the infrastructure for carbon dioxide capturing and storage systems; o the infrastructure for alternative fuels: electricity, hydrogen, and liquefied or compressed natural gas mixed with bio-methane (> 50 %) and other low-carbon or zero emissions technologies; o the projects aimed at combating or adapting to climate change.  Research, innovation and digitalisation This scope, for which a guarantee of EUR 11.25 billion is proposed, aims at nurturing digital transformation of enterprises, markets and Member States. The aim is to achieve a scientific, technological, economic and societal impact by strengthening the scientific and technological base of the EU, with the end purpose of implementing the strategic priorities of the EU and of providing support for the modernisation of innovative companies and the placement of technologies on the market.  Small and medium-sized enterprises This scope, with a guarantee of EUR 11.25 billion, aims at promoting the global competitiveness of SMEs within the EU at any stage of their development.    Social investments This scope, with a guarantee of EUR 4 billion, aims at: reducing inequalities, enhancing inclusiveness, social enterprises and social economy, social inclusion, results, and supporting just transition to a low-carbon economy. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Account is taken of the possibility of combining funding under the InvestEU Programme with establishment of a specific scheme under the InvestEU to support investments for just transition, in particular for projects in the regions for which the Commission approved a regional transition plan). 3. Just Transition Fund (JTF)  In accordance with the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Just Transition Fund, the budget resources for the JTF should be EUR 7.5 billion (considering the 2018 prices), with the possibility of increasing this threshold thereafter, where applicable. The proposal will be included in the negotiation of the following MFF and is estimated to be integrated in a global agreement regarding the following MFF. The JTF will focus on the economic diversification of the territories impacted the most by the climate transition and on the retraining and active inclusion of workers and job seekers within those territories.  The allocation proposal for Romania is EUR 757 million and is contingent upon the approval by the European Commission of the regional transition plans referred to in the Proposal for a Regulation.  Funding sources outside the 2021-2027 MFF. 4. Modernisation Fund (MF) 2 % of the total quantity of certificates for the period 2021-2030 will be auctioned in order to establish the MF in accordance with Article 10(d) of the EU ETS Directive85. A share of 11.98 % will be allocated to Romania. Investments in the following fields, which were defined as a priority in the ETS Directive, will be funded:  production and use of electricity from renewable resources;  improvement of energy efficiency (including in transport, buildings, agriculture and waste), with the exception of solid fossil fuel-based energy production;  energy storage;  modernisation of energy grids, including pipes from the urban district heating systems, of electricity transmission grids, increase in interconnections among EU Member States;  just transition in mining regions, in particular with the purpose of supporting re-education, development and re-employment of human resources in the respective regions.   These priority objectives will receive at least 70 % of the available funds and can be funded up to 100 % of the eligible costs. The projects within these scopes, which are not considered a priority, will be funded up to a maximum of 30 % of the available funds and can be funded up to 70 % of the eligible costs.  EIB will be a member of the Investment Committee, will ascertain the eligibility of projects and will ensure the monetisation of certificates and asset management.                                                 85 Directive (EU) 2018/410 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2018 amending Directive 2003/87/EC to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments, and Decision (EU) 2015/1814 The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         5. Loans from the European Investment Bank In accordance with the objectives of the new European Commission, including that concerning the EIB turning into the EU Bank for climate/environment, supporting projects and investments for combating climate change, the EIB priorities are:  investments in energy efficiency, taking into account the EU target of 32.5 % by 2030, in particular for residential buildings, the launching of a new energy efficiency facility being foreseen - the European Initiative for Building Renovation, which will also concern the energy efficiency of SMEs;  decarbonisation of the energy supply, considering the target committed to at EU level of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 % compared to the level in 1990 (in this respect, EIB will undertake to support the integration of renewable energy projects and good regional cooperation);  supporting investments in innovative technologies and new types of energy infrastructure;  the security of the energy infrastructure (EIB will also support projects of common interest that do not concern the use of fossil fuels, among others, beyond 2022). According to the lending policy in the field of energy, as adopted in November 2019, EIB will no longer finance investments in fossil fuels from 2022 onwards, including gas, with the exception of those with emissions of 250 g of CO2/KWh or less. Moreover, EIB will establish an Energy Transition Package for Member States and most affected regions, focusing its financing and consulting activity on a national level to support investment projects fostering energy transition, including in the context of the INECP. EIB will also cooperate with the European Commission to support the Just Transition Mechanism through a loan facility for the public sector with the purpose of supporting regions facing difficulties in their transition to a climate neutral economy according to the Communication from the Commission regarding the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan [COM(2020) 21 final]. EIB will finance up to 75 % (by way of exception from the 50 %) of the eligible costs for investment projects in Member States benefitting from the Modernisation Fund, which meet its new lending policy. 6. The State budget  Where proposals are made to prepare draft legislative acts/measures/policies the application of which entails a decrease in revenues or an increase in the expenditure approved under the budget, the legislators must prepare a financial form in accordance with Law No 69/2010 on the fiscal-budget responsibility, as subsequently amended and supplemented. The State budget will also supplement the allocation from the Structural Funds under the future 2021-2027 Operational Programmes. ii. Sector or market risk factors or barriers in the national or regional context An initial analysis that takes into account the risk factors with a potential impact on and relevant probability for the implementation of the projected policies and measures has identified categories of elements classified as strategic risks, market and financial risks and operational risks. A non-exhaustive list of these risks includes: Strategic risks  the Macroeconomy class - natural development of the economic cycle, modification of merit orders in investments;  the Governance class - regular electoral cycles, stable vs fluid public policies; The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          the Reputation class - public opinion, regional and/or EU policies and action lines. Market and financial risks  the Environment class - new national legislation and rules, new European legislation and rules;  the Financial class - increase in implementation costs, increase in financing costs;  the Supply Chain class - local or regional disruptions on the supply chain and/or the outsourced structure. Operational risks  the Legal Responsibility class - external commitments, internal commitments;  the Nature class - natural disasters, climate change;  the Human Factor class - man-made events and relevant impact, (physical, cyber etc.) security;  the Quality/Operation class - new or emerging technology, national and/or regional technological integration. iii. Analysis of additional public finance support or resources to fill identified gaps identified under point ii The above list of risk factors does not include a detailed quantitative analysis of the abovementioned factors and barriers.  Therefore, the probability and/or impact control options are currently defined strictly on a qualitative basis according to the existing good practices: Strategic risks  the Macroeconomy class - avoiding extremes in the modelling and consideration of median impact;  the Governance class - promoting political consensus to reach the agreed targets, which brings predictability, stability and transparency to the legislative framework;  the Reputation class - communication, engagement, negotiation and openness. Market and financial risks  the Environment class - engagement, diplomacy, commitment;  the Financial class - flexibility, adaptability, innovation;  the Supply Chain class - controlled redundancy, engagement.  Operational risks  the Legal Responsibility class - monitoring, early warning, consistency;  the Nature class - monitoring, resilient solutions, continuity plans;  the Human Factor class - sound and resilient solutions, with an optimum level of redundancy;  the Quality/Operation class - pragmatism, flexibility, engagement. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         5.4.  Impacts of planned policies and measures described in section 3 on other Member States and regional cooperation at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures i. Impacts on the energy system in neighbouring and other Member States in the region to the extent possible The level of interconnectivity of the national electricity transmission grid is foreseen to accelerate (see Chapter 4.5.1). This factor involves both internal investments for capacity increase and specific investments for transmission interconnections. As a logical consequence, it will also be possible to develop national projects with a regional impact, with further possibility to turn them into projects of common interest. They are supported by the EU and become clusters (Chapter 4.5.1) with an energy security operational impact and a commercial impact related to the single energy market. An updated list of these projects comprises:  The Black Sea Corridor Cluster, with direct impact on the Romanian and Bulgarian energy systems  The Mid Continental East Corridor Cluster, with direct impact on the energy system in Romania, Serbia, Montenegro and Italy The electricity transmission corridors also include regional natural gas transmission initiatives. These pipelines have an operational, commercial and especially strategic impact, providing Romania and other neighbouring countries with a high level of energy security:  the BRHA corridor transits Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Austria, impacting directly the energy systems in these Member States;  the Southern Transmission Corridor, for which the transmission system operator intends to access EU funds and which would bring the gas extracted from the Black Sea to the BRHA pipeline, thus impacting the abovementioned countries;  -priority axis 8 and which plans to secure the transmission capacity from/towards the Republic of Moldova;    included in the NSI East priority corridor, impacting the energy system in Romania and Ukraine;  the interconnection of the national natural gas transmission system in Romania with the natural gas transmission system in Serbia, enabling energy security, the development of the energy infrastructure through diversification of sources and energy transmission routes, the strengthening of solidarity among Member States and the efficient operation of the energy market;  the interconnection of the national natural gas transmission system with the natural gas -Siret route, which entails an increase in the interconnectedness of the national natural gas transmission network with the European transmission network. ii. Impacts on energy prices, utilities and energy market integration Having regard to the modelling characteristics of the WAM scenario (sustained economic growth, increase in electricity consumption and, implicitly, in the demand for electricity generation), the investment flow pertaining to the power plants and electricity grids will be significantly higher than that estimated in the WEM scenario, generating an average electricity price (prior to taxation) of EUR 126/MWh, compared to EUR 108/MWh (in the WEM scenario). The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Chart 50 - Impact of projected additional measures on the average electricity price before taxation [EUR 13/MWh]  Source: WEM - PRIMES 2016 Scenario prepared for the Ministry of the Economy, Energy and the Business Environment, WAM - Deloitte Calculations based on the information submitted by  RO EN - WEM  Final average electricity price before taxation - WEM   înainte de taxe - WAM Final average electricity price before taxation - WAM  Note: The final electricity price is an average of the final price to household and industrial consumers, includes all the fees relating to the system services (e.g. transmission, distribution) and other costs (e.g. green certificates) and does not include the VAT and excise duty    iii. Where relevant, impacts on regional cooperation The Ministry of Energy in Bulgaria submitted a letter to the Ministry of the Economy, Energy and the Business Environment in Romania with questions regarding the possibilities of regional cooperation in the Energy Union in the context of the INECP projects. In this respect, the representatives of the Ministry of the Economy, Energy and the Business Environment in Romania replied on 19 December 2019.  As regards the regional cooperation opportunities between Romania and Bulgaria, the only efficient form of multilateral regional cooperation in South-Eastern Europe at government level is CESEC. There are a series of ongoing initiatives for various projects, such as the PCI joint projects (BRUA, electricity interconnections) or LIP 15 projects, however there is no other format similar to that of the Baltic Council or the Pentalateral Energy Forum.  There is high potential for medium- and long-term bilateral cooperation in the Energy Working Group, however this format could be improved and developed into a form that is more similar to those in Western or Central European countries. The issues both countries are faced with are similar this is why similar solutions may be considered. If such cooperation will become operational and lucrative, it could be the core of regional cooperation, engaging both EU Member States and the Energy Community. The promotion of national interests as a priority over regional ones is still a significant barrier to the strengthening of regional cooperation. Other barriers are raised by: The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          the differences between the national regulations, even if they are in accordance with the EU law;  the absence of PCI joint projects in fields other than interconnections or the internal market (such as renewable sources or energy efficiency). The integration of third countries (candidate countries for Serbia) in the regional cooperation plans could be beneficial if joint projects are to be identified. The issue of non-harmonised law will continue to be an obstacle even if the countries in the Energy Community have undertaken to implement the Clean Energy Package.
