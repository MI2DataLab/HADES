3.5. The legislative framework and the measures implemented by France to promote an innovation policy for decarbonised energy nationally and within Europe  The energy problem falls within a complex landscape that must address several major challenges: guaranteeing and securing access to energy for populations and organisations at an affordable, competitive cost, avoiding fuel poverty, participating in mitigating climate change and adaptation to such change, protecting human health and the environment, and offering a sustainable energy mix.   To meet these challenges, France has made a firm political commitment, through the implementation of a range of key legislative, regulatory and strategic tools, both to guiding technological and societal choices and to supporting the research and development (R&D) effort necessary to ensure a continuous improvement in existing pathways and the emergence of new pathways.  3.5.1. The national regulatory framework  3.5.1.1. The Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth  The aim of the Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth (LTECV) adopted in 2015 is to enable France to contribute more effectively to preventing climate disruption and to protecting the environment, and to at a competitive cost.  To provide a framework for joint action by citizens, companies, territories and the Government, the law sets medium- and long-term targets for reducing GHG emissions, reducing energy consumption, energy performance and the share of renewable energies.  The LTECV is also intended to promote sustainable economic growth and the creation of sustainable jobs that cannot be relocated.  The LTECV therefore constitutes the foundation on which the policy of innovation for ecological and energy transition can be built. The law also provides for the drafting of the above-mentioned National Energy Research Strategy (SNRE).  3.5.1.2. The Climate Plan  Accelerating action to prevent climate change in France and internationally   133    In keeping with the LTECV, the Government presented the Climate Plan in 2017. This document is intended to project France into the post-carbon world, reducing its dependence on fossil energies and mobilising ecosystems in terms of their capacity to store carbon and to provide protection from the consequences of climate change. The Climate Plan set an objective of carbon neutrality by 2050 and intends to be the marker for mobilisation by the French Government and all stakeholders.  The fight against climate change, driven by the Climate Plan, requires substantial economic changes. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a growing world requires innovation in means of production, in particular energy, in order to separate economic performance from emissions. In that context, the Climate Plan reiterates the absolute need to rely on research and innovation, along with investment in new technologies.  It provides, inter alia, as follows:   : France is reinforcing henceforth its mechanisms for attracting talent and for scientific cooperation in key areas to combat climate change. It is therefore putting in place a programme to attract experienced high-quality researchers, along with chairs for excellence for young researchers and a selected programme for doctoral students. As an illustration, since its launch on 1 June 2017 by President Macron, the Make Our Planet Great Again initiative has welcomed several hundred top-level applications for long-term research projects in France.   Making the Paris stock exchange the international hub for green finance: Paris, which has quality experience applied during COP21, aims to become the capital of green and responsible finance. France must promote green and responsible finance labels and must be at the centre of discussions considering climate-related risks in international financial regulations (Article 173 of the Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth). It is therefore the first country to ask investors to publish information about the impact of their activities on the climate, encouraging them to invest in the green economy rather than in fossil energies.  3.5.1.3. Implementation of the French strategy for energy and climate  The Multiannual Energy Plan and the National Low-Carbon Strategy  Achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 in French territory will require changes to the energy system to ensure that the energies consumed within France no longer release greenhouse gases. In taking action, the Government relies on:   The National Low-Carbon Strategy (SNBC), which describes the roadmap to 2050 for France for the implementation of its climate change mitigation policy, and the measures that make it possible to achieve carbon neutrality, including in innovation.   The Multiannual Energy Plan (MEP) to 2028, which sets the priorities for action by the public powers in relation to energy in order to ensure a successful transition towards a more effective and more simple energy system that is more diversified and therefore more resilient, with a focus on innovation.  3.5.1.4. The Law on Energy and Climate  The Law on Energy and Climate (LEC), promulgated on 9 November 2019, amends the targets that France has set itself and the tools required to verify that it is on the right track. It also puts in place specific measures designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  First, this text enshrines the concept of ecological and climatic emergency in the law. To respond to this emergency, it introduces into the law the notion of achieving carbon neutrality for France by 2050. It then creates new tools for the management, governance and assessment of our climate policy that will make it possible to better understand whether the country is following the right path. One of the key recognised figures in the climate sphere, and w(from 2023) additional carbon budgets for the French carbon footprint and international transport  134    enabling the determination of targets and tools for monitoring of these two central indicators. It introduces a five-encourage democratic debate on these targets.   Lastly, concrete measures are introduced. France is committed to ending coal-based electricity generation, through the introduction of a cap on the operational life of coal-fired power stations from 1 January 2022, at a level that will lead to a shutdown in their use. It has also committed to preventing thermal sieves, setting a target for the renovation of the buildings concerned by 2028.    3.5.1.5. The Mobility Law  The aim of the Mobility Law (LOM) adopted in December 2019 is to:  - invest more in existing infrastructures to enable improvements in everyday transport services (maintenance of existing rail networks, desaturation of major rail hubs): Government financial support for these infrastructures, which are essential in encouraging a switch from the use of cars to trains, is increasing significantly;  - provide everyone everywhere with alternative solutions to individual car use;  - develop innovation and new mobility solutions for the benefit of everyone;  - reduce the environmental footprint of transport services;  - adapt the regulations governing road, maritime, river and rail transport.  The LOM is the first legal text to enshrine the target of full decarbonisation of land-based transport by 2050. An immediate trajectory has been identified to achieve this, in accordance with European targets, the Climate Plan and the National Low-Carbon Strategy:  - development of low-emission vehicles according to the European targets for reducing CO2 emissions for 2030 (see above);  - end of the sale of new light vehicles that use fossil fuels by 2040.    To follow this trajectory, binding progressive targets have been set for the annual replacement of vehicle fleets owned or used by public sectors, integrating an increasing minimum quota of low-emission vehicles.  To support vehicle energy transition, the development of recharging facilities for electrical vehicles is being encouraged: mandatory installation in car parks with more than 10 spaces in new or renovated -occupied buildings, rate of coverage of the connection cost by the tariff for the use of public electricity networks (TURPE) increased from 40% to a maximum of 75%.  To encourage citizens to adapt the transport modes to their movements, the LOM promotes shared, ecofriendly transport modes: wording encouraging the use of shared, active mobility options or public transport in car ads; possibility for local authorities to subsidise carpooling solutions and to be able to reserve traffic lanes around city axes for carpooling and low-emission vehicles; implementation of the bike plan to triple its modal share by 2024 (from 3% to 9%), in particular by creating a national bike fun Local authorities will be provided with monitoring tools to enable the roll-out of low-emission zones and zones where entry is forbidden for the most polluting vehicles.    3.5.1.6. The Finance Law for 2020   135    This law has enabled a partial reduction in tax expenditures that adversely affect the climate:  it has the reduced rate on non-road diesel within three years (excluding agriculture and rail and river transportation). A certain number of support measures are planned for the sectors most affected. Regarding fuels for the aviation sector, discussions must be held within Europe and internationally, taking into account existing instruments such as the aviation ETS. However, an increase on the solidarity tax on airline tickets has also been introduced by the 2020 Finance Law to contribute to funding sustainable transport infrastructures.  This law also provides for an end to Government export guarantees granted for operations associated with coal exploration, mining and production and for coal-based energy generation, and for certain operations associated with hydrocarbon exploration, mining and production (projects using methods prohibited within French territory, projects to produce liquid hydrocarbons that involve routine flaring operations).  Lastly, it should be noted that this law has made it possible to initiate the green budget approach, which will be consolidated in the next finance law, and provides a clear assessment of budget programming in terms of environmental targets (broader than climate).     3.5.1.7. Implementation of major Government policy objectives  thematic plans and roadmaps  The major policy objectives laid down in the various legislative texts are implemented in a variety of ways, and in particular in the form of thematic plans or roadmaps stipulating the measures necessary to ensure a successful ecological and energy transition. Thus since 2017, France has published the following:  The biodiversity plan  The aim of this biodiversity plan is to implement the target of reducing net biodiversity loss to zero. To achieve this, the plan is based around six strategic areas for which numerous innovation requirements have been identified, in particular in terms of biodiversity, ecological engineering and biomimetics, and the reinforcement of presence in urban spaces.  The Roadmap for the Circular Economy  The transition towards a circular economy is a key part of ecological and inclusive transition. The Roadmap for the Circular Economy has set ambitious targets, which will require increased research and innovation efforts:   reduce consumption of resources linked to French consumption: reduce consumption of resources in terms of GDP by 30% by 2030 compared to 2010;   reduce quantities of non-hazardous waste disposed of in landfills by 50% by 2025 compared to 2010;  move towards 100% recycled plastics in 2025.  This roadmap lays down 50 measures, with innovation playing a full role. In particular, these measures cover the development of solutions to support the circular economy by incorporating more recycled raw materials in manufacturing and biowaste recovery.  Generally speaking, the objective is to mobilise the scientific community using a multidisciplinary approach, especially by launching calls for projects funded by ADEME and by encouraging the filing of European projects to bring about essential technological innovations in the deployment of the circular economy and mobilise experts across all sectors (urban planning, development, management, sociology, design, fashion, communication, economics, etc.).   Innovation linked to the implementation of the Building Energy Renovation Plan   136    In national terms, the building sector represents close to 45% of final energy consumption and 25% of greenhouse gas emissions: its contribution to transforming our development model for energy saving is crucial and was included in a Government plan in 2018.  The issue of the energy renovation of existing buildings remains a major challenge that must find a way to marry the substantial requirements in terms of the quantity of homes to be renovated with the level of quality required of the works performed and the need to control costs. Current and future transformations of the economic fabric have few recent equivalents. Their success is based primarily on the ability to modernise the entire building sector by supporting and disseminating innovations, enabling simpler, less costly and more effective renovation works.  The requirements demonstrated therefore assume the use of the most environmentally high-performance products and support for the emergence of innovative sectors that could enable large-scale production of those products. Support for innovation will focus primarily on:   the development of eco-materials sectors (bio-based materials, use of wood resources, etc.);   the development of innovative business plans for energy renovation that make it possible to address this coming challenge;   the spread and use of digital tools across the entire sector;   the development of capabilities for measuring and managing energy efficiency that enable a better understanding of the building stock and associated consumption;   active management services for buildings and groups of buildings.  Deployment of H2 technologies through support for research and innovation  The Hydrogen Plan announced by the Government in July 2018 shows the potential of this energy vector for various uses, with a desire to focus as a priority on the decarbonisation of existing uses.   The sustainable competitiveness of the various sectors will be achieved through the emergence of strong R&D players working on two levels.    The acceleration of the industrial development of hydrogen-based technologies by supporting research and the transfer of technologies resulting from research, for which support actions such as demonstrators of the Investments for the Future Programme (PIA), in particular equity, are valuable.   The implementation of disruptions in accordance with international roadmaps in order to reduce component costs and dependence on critical materials, and to work on their substitution. This element, ssets, could be covered by dedicated ongoing programming by the National Research Agency (ANR).    3.5.2 European cooperation actions implemented by France   3.5.2.1. A national research and innovation strategy consistent with the targets set by the SET-Plan  Active French involvement in the SET-Plan since its inception   Since the launch of the Energy Union by EC President Juncker in 2008, the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan) has played an enhanced role in the programming of Societal  Starting from the premise whereby companies provide 70% of total investments in research and innovation in the area of energy technologies, Members States 20% and the European Union 10% (source JRC:  137    COM(2013)253), the Member States have set a target through the introduction of the SET-Plan to maximise the impact of national, private and European resources by strengthening joint projects and coordination of national R&I programmes and budgets for energy technologies.  Through Government, academic and industrial stakeholders, France has participated actively in all actions undertaken as part of the SET-Plan, namely the creation of the integrated roadmap in 20132014; the drafting in 20152016 of 10 declarations of intent defining the targets to be achieved in terms of costs and performance of new technologies; and lastly, the drafting of 14 action plans summarising the initiatives to be implemented to enable the achievement of the targets set by the declarations of intent.   France has also coordinated the activities of the working groups responsible for drafting the battery action plans for static or mobility options and nuclear safety.  In this general context, France has been able to drive its vision of the actions to be undertaken to ensure energy transition within the wider European context.  National guidelines for research and innovation in line with the recommendations of the SET-Plan action plans  In general terms, the French and European targets in relation to the fight against climate change and the related required energy transition are in agreement.  This therefore means that there is a consistent overall vision of the resources to be implemented and, more specifically in relation to research and innovation, the recommendations contained in the 14 SET-Plan action plans are essentially shared at national level. To illustrate this fact, the plans covering photovoltaic energy and batteries are used as examples below.  The SET-Plan photovoltaic action plan:  This action plan describes the technological and non-technological research and innovation activities to be implemented to rebuild EU leadership in the high-performance photovoltaic technologies sector and the integration of those technologies into the EU energy system, proposing competitive, sustainable solutions for the European electricity market. To meet these targets, the following challenges should be addressed:  1. developing technologies (silicon and films) and new concepts to increase the PV efficiency compared to 2015 by at least 20% by 2020 and 35% by 2030;  2. reducing the costs of technologies compared to 2015 by at least 20% by 2020 and 50% by 2030;  3. increasing the quality, environmental impact and life cycle of the proposed technologies;  4. enabling the construction of zero-emission buildings by integrating PV technologies (buildingintegrated photovoltaics, BIPV) directly into the infrastructure design;  5. developing GW-competitive PV module production lines.  PV action plan:  The MEP published in November 2018 stipulates a very ambitious schedule for the deployment of PV solutions to 2028, increasing from the 8.3 GW installed in 2018 to 20.6 GW in 2023 and then around 40 GW in 2028.  To achieve this massive deployment, France believes that there is a need to support research and innovation in this area, and the strategic themes proposed in the SET-Plan action plan discussed above are fully integrated into this national approach.  lack of competition vis-à-vis its Asian competitors. In this regard, research and innovation have a major role to play in order to increase the competitiveness of French and European products.    138    An initial lever for action is to reduce the production costs of these products, in particular by improving industrial production methods (more automation, time saved in manufacturing processes) or through savings on the cost of raw materials (savings on the quantities of Si and In required). Another lever for action is to increase the quality and durability of the products by extending system life cycles and improving recyclability levels.   Lastly, it is also appropriate to continue research and development efforts aimed at improving the performance of cells and modules and, more upstream, exploring disruptive concepts, such as perovskites, which could become the technologies of tomorrow.    France has a dynamic ecosystem of laboratories and innovative companies that is able to meet these challenges. In particular, the works of the IPVF (thin layer) and INES2 (silicon) Energy Transition Institutes could prove  The Batteries and Storage action plan:  This action plan is intended to cover batteries, a key technology for applications involving electric mobility and fixed energy storage. It is therefore crucial for the European industry to ultimately control the entire value chain, namely design, development, manufacture, application and recycling of future generations of batteries, while becoming competitive in the global market.    The recommendations presented in the action plan have been developed in the context of the research and innovation component of the European Battery Alliance. Three broad spheres of action to be addressed by 2030 have been identified:  1. Materials/Chemistry/Design and Recycling;  2. Production;  3. Applications and Integration.    The working group for application of the action plan is chaired by France and has identified the following priority areas for implementation:  1. advanced materials for batteries  2. eco-efficient production  3. quick-charge batteries  4. battery second life  5. recycling  6. application and integration.   To develop a structure that could potentially meet the major challenges associated with energy storage, France support of the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation, in conjunction with the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), research bodies and industrial players, and is a research and technology transfer network dedicated to the various energy storage systems: rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors and alternative technologies intended for a variety of uses. Furthermore, a series of tools to support research actions associated with energy storage has been introduced, covering TRL 1 to 8, through funding taken primarily  139    from the Investments for the Future Programme, and the related actions are therefore implemented by the ANR and ADEME.  3.5.2.2. Participation by France in the ERA-NET Cofund  The ERA-NETs are European Framework Programme instruments in the energy sector that assist in developing partnerships between the members of the SET-Plan to fund common research and innovation priorities that are included in action plans.  A dozen or so ERA-NET Cofunds on the theme of energy resulting from discussions undertaken as part of the SET-Plan have been initiated since the launch of Horizon 2020. In particular, France is involved in  SMARTGRID+, SOLAR ERANET, GEOTHERMICA, OCEAN, EnSGPlusRegSys and SOLAR COFUND  2.  These programmes are implemented nationally by ADEME and the ANR, and the funding is provided by the Investments for the Future Programme or budgets allocated to research by the two operators.  dback on the use of European cooperation vectors such as ERA-NET Cofunds is positive. This has enabled public-private cooperation and the deployment of pilot lines for the production of energy system components that strongly promote interactions between academic research and applied and preindustrial research.   Furthermore, the multilateral nature of these actions represents a valuable opportunity for dialogue among the various national funding agencies. It contributes to reinforcing cooperation between Member States in facing the challenges of energy transition in a context involving the closer alignment of the various energy transition policies within the EU.  3.5.2.3. Strengthened a bilateral Franco-German cooperation to promote the development of innovative solutions   The French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation, through the ANR, and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) launched a bilateral call for projects in 2018 with funding e and distribution (expected to close in January 2019).  This call for projects is intended to support the development of innovative, efficient and sustainable solutions for energy storage and distribution.   It falls within a context of increased cooperation between France and Germany in the energy sphere. The purpose of this partnership is to stimulate innovation in France and Germany to contribute to the introduction of a sustainable energy system in Europe by 2050.   The call will support collaborative projects bringing together French and German partners, where the upstream research activities (technological readiness level (TRL) between 1 and 5) are aimed at developing economically, ecologically and socially efficient solutions for energy storage and distribution in France, Germany and Europe. This mechanism is intended for both research bodies and companies.   The projects expected must relate to one of the two principal themes: 1. Conversion and storage of energy from renewable sources; 2. Smart energy networks (for transport and distribution). The themes covered may contribute to achieving the targets stated in the SET-Plan batteries and storage action plan.  3.5.2.4. Opening of the Investments for the Future Programme to joint actions to undertake the actions defined in the SET-Plan  To meet the targets defined in the action plans approved in the SET-Plan, France is suggesting the development and continuation of joint research projects with other countries covered by the SET-Plan through its Investments for the Future Programme (PIA).   140    The aim of the PIA is to prepare France for the challenges of tomorrow (competitiveness, environment, energy, health, etc.) and to increase its growth potential by investing in higher education and training, research, industry and SMEs, sustainable development and digitisation. The Investments for the Future Programme is intended to support projects that promote innovation and job creation in sectors with significant potential for  the Investments for the Future Programme is managed by the Secretary-General for Investment (SGPI). It is supported by several operators, including ADEME, one of the major players in innovation for energy and ecological transition in France.  To support and manage these projects in the energy sphere, ADEME is offering support for project drivers, in particular in the form of State aid subject to the European regulations on competition. These are awarded through calls for projects and include the following:    State aid in the form of repayable advances;    subsidies, reserved primarily for research bodies.   In the energy sector, the French authorities have decided to open calls to collaboration projects by French stakeholders with countries that are members of the SET-Plan and beyond, to international cooperation. A non-French company may benefit from these investment mechanisms to obtain funding for its innovative projects on the condition that the demonstrators or projects are located in France and directly benefit the French economy and labour market. Furthermore, the PIA also enables specific operators such as ADEME or BPI France to make equity investments where applicable, for example for innovative industrial solutions.  This opportunity was presented by France to the SET-Plan steering committee, and has been the subject of regular information updates for European bodies by the French Ministries responsible for research and energy.    3.5.3 - The principal sources of funding for energy research and innovation  3.5.3.1. The Investments for the Future Programme  Projects implemented by ADEME  Alongside the funding of public research bodies, the Government supports R&D actions in the energy sphere implemented by ADEME, BPI France and the Caisse des Depôts et Consignations (CDC), and by the ANR (energy transition institutions, generic calls for projects).   Between 2010 and 2017, ADEME implemented two actions for the first two sections of tdivided among four broad aspects:   production of renewable energies, energy storage and smart electricity networks;   energy efficiency in buildings, industry and agriculture and bio-based chemistry;   circular economy and waste;   transport (including all its components) and mobility.  Various funding tools were provided, such as calls for projects for demonstrators, SME initiatives and equity interventions, enabling the funding, through 85 calls for projects, of 745 projects for a total grant amount of  Continuing on from PIA 1&2, ADEME has implemented several actions as part of the third section of the PIA    million in State aid (the CDC is also an operator, with separate loans for the regional component). For  141        te aid.  3.5.3.2. Incentive actions intended to stimulate research and innovation associated with renewable energies  Energy Transition Institutes  Energy Transition Institutes (ITE) are public-private platforms that aim to create campuses of excellence to bring together academic research, major groups and SMEs on issues specific to energy transition, to foster innovation by bringing together public R&D efforts and industrial strategies. The ITE thus target the industrial development of a complete sector, from technological innovation to demonstrator and industrial prototype.   As part of the Investments for the Future Programme (PIA), the ANR monitors these dozen or so structures, which were awarded labels in 2011 and 2012 in the following domains:   green chemistry and agro-based materials;   renewable marine energies;   solar energies;   geothermal energy;   smart electricity grids;   energy efficiency;   sustainable building;   decarbonised vehicles and mobility.  This programme is currently allocated a total budget of aactivities.    3.5.3.3. European research funding  The Framework Programme (MESRI)  representing 7,400 Europea-  - - - 9.5%). However, these French players have a very significant success rate (18%), just behind Germany (18.7%) but ahead of the United Kingdom (14.9%), Spain (13.8%) and Italy (11.9%).  3.5.3.4. The NER 300 Fund  a tool designed for the pre-commercial demonstration of decarbonised technological solutions  The European demonstration fund New Entrant Reserve 300 (NER 300) is a funding programme for demonstration projects in the European Union that are innovative and commercial in scale, and focused on the themes of CO2 capture and storage and renewable energies. The fund was created in 2009 as part of the climateenergy package and adopted during the French Presidency of the European Union.    142    It has been allocated 300 million emission quotas from the new entrant reserve, the sale of which have  The NER 300 fund therefore appears to be a valuable tool for funding projects with high TRLs, providing an opportunity for new technologies in the energy sector to achieve the level of readiness necessary for market entry.  In this context, two French projects have been recognised and are currently being implemented:    the Vertimed/PGL floating wind farm project made up of three wind turbines installed in the Mediterranean Sea, the purpose of which is to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of the proposed technological solution;   the GEOSTRAS geothermal energy project, which is designed to demonstrate the feasibility of generating renewable electricity and heat using a deep geothermal source and developing an innovative underground heat exchanger.  The Innovation Fund, the successor to the NER 300 fund for the 20212030 period, must take over to continue the funding of innovative pre-commercial renewable energy projects. There is also an extension to its scope planned to include industrial processes that demonstrate a reduction in GHG emissions compared to benchmark solutions.
