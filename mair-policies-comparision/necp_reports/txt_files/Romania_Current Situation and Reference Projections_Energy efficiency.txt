4.3.  Dimension energy efficiency i. Current primary and final energy consumption in the economy and per sector (including industry, residential, service and transport) The chart below shows the historical trend in primary and final energy consumption in the period 2005-2017, including final consumption per sector This trend shows, first of all, a 10 % decrease in the primary energy consumption and only 3 % decrease in final energy consumption, which indicates an increase in the energy intensity.  The residential sector recorded the highest share in total final energy consumption in almost all the analysis years (with a few exceptions). As a trend, this final consumption has not recorded major changes. The second source of final consumption is the industrial sector. In this sector, final energy consumption recorded a downward trend and it is the main determinant of the reduction in the total final energy consumption. The tertiary sector also includes, in this case, consumption from agriculture.

In this period, no major changes were recorded in consumption of renewable energy and electricity, although they were on a slightly upward trend.

Current potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling60 The potential for applying high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling is presented in the Report on the assessment of the national potential for application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling prepared by the Ministry of Public Works, Development and Administration and the Ministry of the Economy, Energy and the Business Environment in December 2015. According to this report, this potential is assessed for the urban environment where the ratio between the built area and the total area is 0.3. This indicator is expected to increase with the increase in the housing area per residential unit.  The main components of the potential are:                                                 60 In accordance with Article 14(1) of Directive 2012/27/EU The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          reconnection to SACET;  extension of SACET to new buildings. The total efficient heating/cooling potential was estimated in 2015 to 86.4 PJ, of which 70.8 PJ from reconnection and 43.2 PJ achieved.

Projections considering existing energy efficiency policies, measures and programmes as described in point 1.2.(ii) for primary and final energy consumption for each sector at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)61 The consumption projections in Romania, taking into account the existing measures62, assume an increase in the primary and final energy consumption following the economic growth. However, a decrease in the energy intensity is projected because the rise in primary consumption is steeper than that of the final consumption. As regards the sectoral trends, consumption of energy in transport is expected to have the most significant rise following an increase in the number of passenger cars/1 000 inhabitants (as also described in Section 4.1.ii). Final energy consumption will also increase in the residential sector, however less than in transport.                                                 61 This reference business as usual projection shall be the basis for the 2030 final and primary energy consumption target which is described in 2.3 and conversion factors. 62 Presented in Section 1.2 ii.

A slight increase in the final consumption of natural gas will also be recorded following the exploitation of deposits in the Black Sea. Consumption of crude oil and oil products, and of solid fuels, is expected to fall by the end of the analysis period.
