4.6. Dimension Research, innovation and competitiveness  i. Current situation of the hypocarbon sector and, as far as possible, its position in the world market (this analysis should be conducted on a Union or international level) Portugal has made considerable effort to apply low-carbon technologies to its energy mix, more specifically in relation to European commitments. Of note are areas such as environmental sustainability, renewable energies and energy efficiency. Investment in infrastructure, particularly to reinforce energy interconnections, plays a vital role in supply security, promoting integration into new energy markets and promoting cooperation between countries, allowing resources to be shared. In the last decade, aware of the need to meet the challenges created by climate change and reduce its dependency on fossil fuels, Portugal has followed a policy to promote renewable energies under EU commitments, focusing on hydro, wind, biomass, solar and geothermal power. This focus has allowed the country to position itself near the top of the ranking for energy production from renewable sources. This transitional process required a change in the energy production model where it became vital to develop policies and measures to support the generation of decentralised renewable energy. Strategies have been established for research, innovation and competitiveness so as to facilitate investment in low-carbon technologies and smart networks, allowing cooperation to be promoted among market players, maximising trans-national competition and supporting the setting up of innovative energy services companies. This focus drives the development of the national economy, having created an entirely new industrial and corporate segment, generating employment, promoting regional development, stimulating the export of goods and services, driving regional and innovation which attracts international investment and stimulates the internationalisation of national companies. It has also allowed external energy dependency to be significantly reduced. In relation to research and innovation, of note is the implementation of international groups as part of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) in areas of low-carbon technology with a view to applying clean technologies at lower costs. These technologies include ocean energy, geothermal energy, solar energy focusing on concentrated solar power (CSP), energy efficiency in industry and buildings, energy systems, smart communities and solutions with focus on consumers, biofuels and bioenergy. The underlying vision is also -level strategy where brainstorming among stakeholders has been promoted is areas such as energy efficiency, bioengineering and hydrogen to meet the different challenges facing society. Inter-institutional cooperation has also been promoted and networks have been established in technologies for renewable energy, energy storage, energy efficiency and also in the fields of hydrogen and biomethane. However, to achieve greater success, greater effort will be necessary on a technological level in solar and wave energy and in the development of a comprehensive portfolio of renewable technologies with good cost effectiveness. It will be necessary to go beyond the technologies which have already  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4. Current Policy Situation and Existing Measures and Projections 152   attained maturity and use resources to support more innovative technologies allowing substantial savings in costs and in terms of GHG emissions.   ii. Current level of public and private research and innovation spending on low-carbon-technologies, current number of patents, and current number of researchers In Portugal, investment in Research and Development (R&D) in recent years has fluctuated. In 2018, total investment recovered the value for 2012, 1.38% of GDP. Also, in overall terms, the following figure shows investment levels by sector during the 2012-2017 period, as was as the objective for 2010, as a percentage of GDP, demonstrating the importance of effort by companies and higher education institutions in total investment in research and innovation.

In industry, the Power and Network component represented 57% of RP, Levies and Taxes represented 25% and VAT 19%.   Key PT EN Doméstico (Banda DC)  Indústria (Banda I3)    iv. Description of energy subsidies, including fossil fuels Although there are several direct and indirect taxes on energy, of particular note are taxes on oil and energy products, which are highlighted for this reason in this analysis. Tax on petroleum and energy products (ISP) Nationally, tax on oil and energy products and electricity is governed by the Code of Special Consumer Taxes (CIEC), approved by Decree number 73/2010 of 21 June 2010, which transposed Council Directive 2008/118/EC (ISP). The following oil and energy products are subject to tax:                                                            47 Private for-Profit Institutions  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4.

CIEC further sets out the products which benefit from total or partial exemption and the products taxed at a reduced rate. In addition to the exemptions provided for in the General Part of CIEC, applicable under Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing are set out in Article 6 of CIEC, other exemptions and reduced rate taxation are provided for. Add-on to CO2 emissions  48 -on to ISP), which applies to the sectors not covered by EU ETS. This add-on, which was included in CIEC, through the addendum of a new Article 92-A, seeks to promote a low-carbon economy to fight climate change and reduce external energy dependency. For this purpose, in addition to the rate applicable under ISP, the following products are also subject to the add-on resulting from the application of a tax in accordance with add-ons representing the emission factor of each product, provided that they are subject to ISP and not exempt:  Petrol;  Oil and coloured and marked oil;  Diesel (includes road diesel, coloured and marked diesel and heating diesel);  LPG (methane and petroleum gases) used as a fuel or propellant;  Natural gas used as a fuel or propellant;  Fuel Oil;  Petroleum coke;  Coal and coke. Exemption of a specific product from ISP automatically means that it will not be subject to add-ons relating to CO2 emissions (Art. 92-A(4)). In accordance with the calculation formula currently in force as set out in Article 92-A(2) of CIEC, the rate to be applied in each year (n), to which the add-on factor will be applied provided for in Article 92-A(1), is calculated in the preceding year (n-1) as the arithmetic mean of the price resulting from GHG emissions licence auctions, held under EU ETS, from 1 October of year n-2 and 30 September of year n-1. Add-on factors, the evolution in the carbon tax (CO2 reference price) and the add-on values by type of fuel are shown in the following table.                                                                   48 Law No 82-D/2014 of 31 December 2014  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4.

An analysis of tax expenditure by heading shows that exemptions for the production of electricity have the greatest weighting, with 40%, followed by exemptions conferred to installations covered by EU ETS and by the Energy Intensive Consumption Management System (SGCIE), with 21%. Exemptions given to agricultural diesel also have an important weighting at 21%.

This figure represented an increase of 4.3% over 2017, as compared to the variation of 6.4% seen for total tax income and social contributions. From 2017 to 2018, the tax on oil and energy products lost importance in relation to taxes with environmental relevance (fell from 69.2% to 67.3%). In contrast, the car circulation tax gained importance now standing at 12.3% of all taxes with environmental relevance, as did other taxes on energy which include GHG emissions licences, which increased 111.2%.

In the same year, the weighting of taxes with environmental relevance in GDP in Portugal (2.6%) was greater than the UE28 average (2.4%).                                                            50  through taxation of products and services, the tax base for which may have a negative impact on the environment. As such, all taxes on such taxation bases are taxes with environmental relevance  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4. Current Policy Situation and Existing Measures and Projections 160   Included in these taxes are taxes on energy, transport, pollution and taxes on resources. However, of note is the significance of three taxes: the tax on oil and energy products, the vehicle tax and the car circulation tax, which in 2018 constituted 90% of taxes with environmental relevance. In 2017, the last year for which information is available, levies with environmental relevance51, stood at 1.484 billion euros (0.8% of GDP), an increase of 4.7% over figures for 2016. This is mainly a reflection of the increase in levies on health security and sanitation (+5.3%), waste management (+130.5%) and on the management of the recycling system for glass, paper, plastic, metal and wood (+29.8%). By category, in 2018, taxes on energy represented 72.1% of total tax income with environmental relevance. Tax on transport had weighting of 27.2%. Tax on resources and on pollution were of minimal weighting in the structure of taxes with environmental relevance (0.4% and 0.3%, respectively).                                                            51 A levy differs from a tax in that authorities use the income earned to establish some type of regulatory function (such as verifying the competences or qualifications of the entities involved or establishing management systems in different areas which tend, through their activity, to cause negative impacts on society).
