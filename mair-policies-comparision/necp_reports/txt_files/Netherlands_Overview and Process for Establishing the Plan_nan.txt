  1 Overview and procedure for establishing the plan This is the final version of the Dutch Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030 (NECP). The NECP contains the main priorities of the climate and energy policy for the next 10 years. The contents are largely determined by the Climate Agreement, established in June 2019 involving over a hundred social (public and private) parties1. This agreement contains a package of measures, which are actively supported by as many contributing parties as possible and with which the political CO2 reduction target of 49% will be achieved by 2030. To supplement the (new, national) measures in the Climate Agreement, the NECP also contains (i) policy arising from European obligations, (ii) ongoing policy and (iii) policy announced in the Coalition Agreement, but which is not part of the Climate Agreement. The recommendations of the European Commission related to the draft NECP have been incorporated in this final version2. The NECP contains parts taken from the Climate Plan, which will be presented to Parliament simultaneously. The figures in the final version of the NECP are based on the Climate and Energy Report (KEV) 2019 by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL)3. The Climate Act stipulates that the KEV must be published annually. For 2020 and 2030, the KEV 2019 provides an insight into the targets for renewable energy, energy savings and CO2 reductions. A large part of the Climate Agreement could not yet be incorporated in the KEV 2019. Therefore, the Climate Agreement memorandum supplements the KEV 2019 in indicating the impact of the Climate Agreement on the capacity to achieve a 49% CO2 reduction by 2030. 1.1 Summary i. Political, economic and social context Summary of the political and policy context The Netherlands aims to make a substantial contribution to the Paris Agreement and therefore the government is taking measures that contribute to a 49 % reduction in greenhouse gases in 2030, compared with 1990. In Europe the Netherlands advocates a 55 % reduction in emissions by 2030. One of the agreements in the 2017 Coalition Agreement was the announcement of a Climate Agreement, which would, following the Energy Agreement concluded in 2013, enable us to take the next step towards a climate-neutral society and a reliable, affordable, secure and low CO2 energy supply by 2050. It has also been agreed that the broad lines of the agreements in the field of climate and energy in the Coalition Agreement will be anchored in a Climate Act (see section 1.2 ii). Lastly, the Coalition Agreement states that, as part of the climate challenge, agreements in the government-wide programme for the circular economy and the transition agendas in the Raw Materials Agreement will be implemented. The Senate approved the Climate Act on 28 May 2019. This Act enshrines in law the (long-term) objectives of the climate policy for 2030 and 2050. The Climate Act stipulates that a Climate Plan is to be compiled every five years. This Climate Plan contains the main priorities of the climate policy to be implemented for the next 10 years. Thus the Climate Act connects the                                                  1 https://www.klimaatakkoord.nl/ and Letter to Parliament on the Proposal for a Climate Agreement, Parliamentary document 32 813, no. 342 2 See Appendix 2 3 https://www.pbl.nl/publicaties/klimaat-en-energieverkenning-2019 and Parliamentary document 32 813 no. 400 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    long-term goals with medium and short-term policy. The Act also stipulates that every year - on the fourth Thursday of October - the Climate and Energy Report (KEV) and the climate memorandum are to be submitted to the House of Representatives.  In addition to creating this legal framework, the period starting 23 February 2018 was dedicated to a broad social dialogue about the Climate Agreement. The Climate Agreement was presented on 28 June 2019. The government opted for an inclusive approach by involving many organisations and businesses in developing the Climate Agreement. This became apparent in the five sectoral climate round table discussions and the overarching climate debate. The government has asked fellow governments, businesses, nature and environmental organisations, trade unions and other social parties, to respond to the following question: How can the Netherlands reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by almost half (49%) by 2030 compared with 1990? Therefore, it concerns national agreements to which the parties also want to adhere. The Climate Agreement contains agreements on the measures required to achieve a 49% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and that prepare us for the challenge up to 2050. The Agreement contains measures the government itself is taking or actively facilitating. It also includes the agreements between parties in which the government does not have an active role. Both are important in order to achieve the common goal. The long-term perspective of the Climate Agreement makes a gradual transition possible, prevents shock effects and ensures we can seize economic opportunities. The Climate Agreement forms the basis of the NECP. Summary of the economic and social context With over 17 million inhabitants the Netherlands is a densely populated country and has a growing economy. In 2018, the Dutch economy grew by 2.6%. Moreover, the Netherlands is one of the most competitive economies in the world. This has, for example, earned it sixth place in the Global Competitiveness Report 2019.4 We are also one of the most innovative countries, occupying fourth place in the Global Innovation Index5. Climate and sustainability receive a lot of attention in both the political and social debate. There has been a climate court case between the Urgenda Foundation and the Staat der Nederlanden (State of the Netherlands), on which the court of appeal ruled in October 2018. The court ruled that the Netherlands must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% by 2020 compared with 1990 levels. In society, attention for climate is growing as a result of the many sustainability initiatives launched by citizens, businesses, NGOs and authorities, and due to media attention. Multiple climate marches and protests have been organised too, in a number of cities, in which many citizens participated. Despite the positive attitude towards increased sustainability, in some areas of the Netherlands there is also opposition to the emergence of, for example, wind farms. This shows a division in society: some people are calling for more ambitious climate policy, while others warn of rising costs and change occurring too quickly. Besides the climate ambition the earthquake issue in Groningen is also decisive with regard to climate and energy policy. The earthquake issue has led to the decision to halt the extraction of gas from the Groningen field, for the safety of residents (see section 1.2 i).6 ii. The European Energy Union The effects of global warming are visible worldwide and to everyone. Significant steps are required to limit global warming and the impact of climate change. Therefore the transition to a CO2-neutral economy is a major priority. In the Paris Agreement governments agreed to limit the average global warming to well below 2°C, pursuing efforts to                                                  4 https://worldcompetitiveness.imd.org/rankings/wcy 5 https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/home 6 Letter to Parliament on Gas Extraction in Groningen, 29 March 2018, Parliamentary document 33 529, no. 457   100% - 15% - 49% 1990 2017 2030 2050 CO2-equivalents I CO2 N2O F-gases limit it to below 1.5°C. On behalf of Member States the European Union made firm commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030, compared with 1990. The Netherlands supports this commitment, but at the same time finds that it is not sufficient in limiting the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C. Therefore the Netherlands is raising the bar higher than the commitment made by the European Union: The Netherlands is taking national measures that prepare us for a greenhouse gas reduction of 49% by 2030, compared with 1990. In Europe we advocate a more ambitious emissions reduction. The Netherlands is aiming to be climate neutral by 2050 and to increase the European contribution of 40% by 2030, to a 55% reduction by 2030. If a more stringent target proves unfeasible in the EU the Netherlands will strive to make more ambitious agreements with like-minded European countries. As described in the last paragraph, the national strategy for achieving the long-term reduction targets is established in the Climate Agreement. Due to the integrated character of the Climate Agreement, it addresses the five dimensions of the Energy Union (decarbonisation, energy efficiency, energy security, internal energy market and research and innovation). These are subdivided into five sectors, which are: electricity, industry, mobility, agriculture and land use, the built-up environment, and into a number of cross-sectoral areas, which are electrification, hydrogen, biomass, innovation, the labour market and education, finance, civic participation, spatial integration and the regional energy strategy (RES). iii. National CO2 target The greenhouse gas emission target of 49% by 2030 compared with 1990, proposed in the Coalition Agreement, means a reduction of approximately 49 Mton of CO2 equivalents by 2030 compared with an unchanged policy. This includes the effects of the circular economy policy. The following (long-term) objectives for 2030 and 2050 arise from the Climate Act:  In 2050, the Netherlands must have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 95% compared with 1990;  An intermediate target of a 49% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions has been established for 2030; and  Another target stipulates that electricity generation must be 100% CO2 neutral by 2050. Emissions 1990, 2017 and targets 2030-2050  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    For the discussions about the Climate Agreement indicative, CO2 reduction challenges for the five sectors comprising industry, mobility, the built-up environment, electricity, agriculture and land use were formulated, based on national cost-effectiveness.7 Based on a cost-effective greenhouse gas emissions reduction package of 49% by 2030, the anticipated contributions that the Netherlands will make to the targets applicable to renewable energy and energy savings are respectively at least 27% and a maximum of 1,950 petajoules in primary energy consumption. In relation to measures announced later and that are not included in the KEV 2019, the contribution to the European target for renewable energy could be higher than 27%. This means the Netherlands will provide an adequate contribution to the European targets for renewable energy (32%) and energy savings (32.5%).8 With regard to the interconnection target, the Netherlands already far exceeds the European target of 15% by 2030.9 1.2 Overview of the current policy context i. Energy system and policy context Energy system In this section we address the main characteristics of energy management in the Netherlands. Chapter 4 contains a more detailed explanation. Greenhouse gas emissions As a result of the Climate Plan, the government is aiming for a 49% CO2 reduction by 2030 compared with 1990. In the calculation of the draft Climate Agreement in early 2019, the PBL found that the instruments proposed for the implementation could produce a reduction in emissions amounting to between 31 and 52 Mton compared with the base path in the National Energy Report (NEV) 2017. The PBL concluded that while the desired target of a 48.7 Mton emissions reduction falls within this bandwidth, it will probably not be achieved. In response to the calculation, parts of the draft Climate Agreement were adjusted to produce the Climate Agreement that was presented to the House of Representatives on 28 June 2019, and is included in this Climate Plan. Simultaneously with the Climate and Energy Report 2019 (KEV - successor to the NEV), the PBL has issued a memorandum that provides insight into how the adjustments in the Climate Agreement compared to the draft Climate Agreement translate into the target range compared to an updated base path in the KEV 2019. PBL concludes in the memorandum that the package of policy instruments in the Climate Agreement could potentially lead to greater emission reductions than the package in the draft agreement, but that it is unlikely that the 2030 climate target of a 49% reduction compared with 1990 will be achieved with this package. Current insights into expected developments as described in KEV 2019 are less favourable from the perspective of greenhouse gas reduction than the expectation based on the NEV from 2017. Energy savings The Netherlands has opted to make its contribution to the European objective for energy savings based on primary energy consumption in 2030. In this regard, the Netherlands aims to achieve primary energy consumption of 1,950 petajoules by 2030 (excluding use for non-energy purposes). This contribution translates into an expected final energy consumption of 1,837 petajoules by 2030. According to the European Commission this is a reasonable contribution by the Netherlands. As a result the Netherlands is expected to meet the indicative national contribution to the European target (see Chapter 2.2). The mandatory energy savings for the Netherlands during the period 2021 up to and including 2030, in accordance with Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive, is expected to amount to 925 petajoules. The Dutch contributions will be achieved by implementing the package of policy measures in the Climate Agreement, such as the district-oriented approach in the built-up environment, the CO2 tax in industry and the expansion of the SDE+ (see chapter 3.2).                                                  7 https://www.pbl.nl/publicaties/nationale-kosten-klimaat-en-energietransitie-in-2030-update-2018 8 Parliamentary document 21 501-33-700 9 Parliamentary document 21 501-20-968   Renewable energy With regard to the EU target for renewable energy of 32%, the European Commission has indicated that it deems a contribution of 26% by the Netherlands to be reasonable. The Netherlands is demonstrating its ambition and is focusing on achieving a 27% share of renewable energy by 2030. The KEV 2019 forecast is that by 2030, the Netherlands will achieve a 25% share of renewable energy (bandwidth 21%-26%). However, the KEV 2019 does not yet include all measures that contribute to this goal, such as one of the planned offshore wind farms, making heat generation more sustainable and a number of measures in the Climate Agreement that lead to energy savings. Based on the mid-term estimate of 24.9% in the KEV 2019, the PBL estimates that the share of renewable energy in 2030, including the measures of the Climate Agreement, will amount to 30% - 32%. As a result, the 27% contribution will be achieved. The energy mix is gradually changing Consumption of natural gas will decrease due to continued reduction of the use of natural gas in (primarily decentralised) production of electricity through cogeneration and reduced demand for natural gas for the heating of buildings. Although the opening of three new coal-fired power plants and low coal prices have led to an increase in coal consumption in recent years, the closure of five coal-fired power plants that has taken place in recent years will result in coal consumption being lower than in 2017 by 2020. The contribution of renewable sources is expected to increase significantly in the years to come, primarily due to the growth of renewable electricity production (see Section 4.2.2). For the time being, crude oil will maintain its dominant position as a fuel in transport and as a raw material in the chemical industry. Consumption of crude oil will remain roughly the same, at the level of 2005. It is expected that, in the years to come, crude oil will overtake natural gas as the principal energy carrier in the energy mix. Without new investments, the closure of the nuclear power plant in Borssele in 2033 will bring an end to the contribution of nuclear energy to the energy mix. Energy market Lots of parties operate in the Dutch energy market and it has strong links abroad. With regard to the supply of gas and electricity these are, on the one hand, producers and suppliers that operate on the market, and grid operators on the other. The Netherlands has implemented a division of the energy companies, in which the grid operators must be independent and financially robust. The high-voltage grids (electricity) and high pressure grids (gas) each have one grid operator, respectively TenneT and GTS. There are multiple parties involved in the distribution networks, each of which operates in a particular region. Gas extraction in Groningen In March 2018, a decision was taken by the government to end gas extraction in the Groningen field, to ensure the safety of Groningen's inhabitants. This involves major steps, due, among other things, to the construction of an extra nitrogen plant and the intended conversion of the nine largest industrial users. As of 2022, it is expected that only a limited volume will be needed from the Groningen field. This will be reduced to zero over the course of the following years. In the meantime, additional measures have been developed, which this year will already ensure an additional decrease in gas extraction in Groningen by 4.1 billion Nm³ (compared with GTS' estimate of 31 January 2019) to a total of 11.8 billion Nm³ for the current 2019/2020 gas year, assuming an average year in terms of temperature. This brings the extraction below the level recommended by the Dutch State Supervision of Mines of 12 billion Nm³. Gas extraction in Groningen is expected to be zero from mid-2022 onwards10. Developments in other countries related to the energy supply in the Netherlands Developments in neighbouring countries have a major impact on those in the Netherlands. In recent years, the Netherlands was, on balance, an importer of electricity. Greenhouse gas emissions from generating the imported electricity were discharged abroad. It is expected that imports and exports will increase in the period leading up to 2050, due to the strong growth in production capacity based on wind and solar energy. The import balance in the period leading up to 2030 is expected to increase significantly. Fluctuations in electricity generated from solar and wind energy can be absorbed due to the increase in connection with foreign countries.                                                  10 Letter to Parliament on Gas Extraction in Groningen in 2019-2020, Parliamentary document 33 529, no. 678 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030     Policy context In 2018, the Dutch economy grew by 2.6%. That was the second highest growth after 2007. In 2018, growth relied heavily on consumption and investments in fixed assets. For the first time in years, household consumption grew almost as fast as gross domestic product (GDP). This is partly due to the fact that the real disposable income of households grew at approximately the same rate as GDP. The business sector achieved record profits once more in 2018. 2018 was another record year on the labour market. The boom in 2017 continued in 2018 and reached a peak in August. The Netherlands is one of the most competitive economies in the world. The Netherlands occupies sixth place in the IMD's World Competitiveness Yearbook11 and sixth place in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report.12 The Netherlands' strengths include its macroeconomic policy, the relatively low government debt and its infrastructure. The Netherlands is also one of the most innovative countries, occupying fourth place in the Global Innovation Index13. The Netherlands is a densely populated country. It is home to 17,282,163 inhabitants (24 September 2019) and the density is 513 pop/km². Statistics Netherlands expects the population to increase to 18 million in 2029 due to both a birth surplus and immigration. After 2037, the population will only grow as a result of immigration.14 In recent decades, quality of life in the Netherlands has improved in many respects.15 The air and water are cleaner, there is a wide range of safe and cheap food, the energy efficiency of new homes and appliances is better and the structure of the road network has improved and is now safer. At the same time, persistent challenges still exist. Excessively high greenhouse gas emissions cause climate change; livestock farming is reaching its ecological and social limits; biodiversity is under serious pressure; the consumption of raw materials produces high environmental pressure; and the differences between and within regions and groups of people are increasing, such as accessibility to the housing market and the number of years people can expect to live in good health. In May 2019, the Council of State ruled the Nitrogen Action Programme (PAS) invalid. The PAS permitted activities that release nitrogen (such as agriculture, housing and road construction, or industry), as long as measures were taken that provided for a future reduction in nitrogen deposition. The government is working on a new approach to nitrogen. The public debate is highly focused on climate policy. For example, the Urgenda Foundation filed a climate case against the State of the Netherlands and the latter was instructed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the Netherlands by at least 25% by 2020 compared with 1990 levels. On 24 June 2015, the court ruled in favour of the Urgenda Foundation and the Court of Appeal upheld the ruling on 9 October 2018. The State has appealed; the ruling by the Supreme Court is expected on 20 December 2019. The KEV 2019 indicates that the expected emission reduction by 2020 compared to 1990 is expected to be 23%. To implement the Urgenda judgement, a 25% CO2 reduction must be achieved by 2020. In June and November 2019, the government announced additional measures. These additional measures allow a quick start in the reduction of CO2 in the short term, while the measures also contribute to an effective transition in the longer term.16 Attention in society for climate change, increased sustainability and the circular economy is growing as a result of the many sustainability initiatives launched by citizens, businesses, NGOs and authorities. The media also devotes considerable attention to these themes. Moreover, a number of climate marches and protests have been organised in various cities in the Netherlands that are consistent with the broader global movement of climate action. A study among citizens shows that, although increased sustainability is relatively low on their agenda, the majority of them hold a positive view when it comes to making the energy supply more sustainable. However, they estimate the share                                                  11 https://www.imd.org/wcc/world-competitiveness-center-rankings/world-competitiveness-ranking-2018/. 12 https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitveness-report-2018. 13 https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/Home. 14 https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2018/51/prognose-18-miljoen-inwoners-in-2029 15 Read more in Balans van de Leefomgeving: http://themasites.pbl.nl/balansvandeleefomgeving/wp-content/uploads/pbl-2018-balans-van-de-leefomgeving-2018-3160.pdf. 16 Letter to Parliament on the Implementation of the Urgenda judgement, 28 June 2019, 32 813 no. 341   of renewable energy to be higher than it is in reality and also believe the government (central and local authorities) should play a major role in the climate and energy transition.17 Despite the positive attitude towards increased sustainability, in certain parts of the Netherlands there is opposition to the emergence of projects including infrastructure, solar farms and wind farms. This is because some local residents consider that these types of projects encroach on their living environment. The spatial integration of the climate and energy transition is a difficult one. ii. Description of current polices and measures Current policies The current energy and climate policy is anchored in the 2017 Coalition Agreement, the Climate Act, the recently published Climate Agreement and the 2013 Energy Agreement. Below is a brief description of the major building blocks of the energy and climate policy. In addition, the draft national environmental vision (NOVI), which provides frameworks for the spatial development of measures, is discussed. Coalition Agreement "Confidence in the Future" On 26 October 2017, the Rutte III Cabinet (VVD, CDA, D66, ChristenUnie) was sworn in. Political basic principles are outlined in the Coalition Agreement "Confidence in the Future", published on 26 October 2017.18 The Netherlands is resolved to make a substantial contribution to the Paris Agreement and therefore we are taking measures that prepare us for a 49% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, in which the effects of the circular economy policy will also be included. As the State Secretary for Infrastructure and Water Management underlined in the Cabinet's response to the transition agenda's circular economy, the transition to a circular economy could make a significant contribution to fulfilling the requirement related to the Climate Agreement.19 In Europe, the Netherlands advocates a 55 % reduction in emissions by 2030. If a more stringent target proves unfeasible in the EU, the Netherlands will strive to make more ambitious agreements with like-minded European countries than the country allocation designated by the EU; but without this resulting in high emissions elsewhere. At the national level in the Coalition Agreement, it was agreed that there would be a Climate Agreement. It was also agreed that the climate and energy policy objectives would be anchored in a Climate Act, to provide certainty about the long-term goals. Several measures in the Coalition Agreement include the greening of the tax system, closing down coal-powered plants by 2030 at the latest, recycling raw materials in industry, increasing parcels for offshore wind energy, making new homes natural gas-free and existing homes more sustainable, and replacing the duty of connection to gas by a right to heating and the pursuit of 100% zero emissions for newly sold cars as of 2030. The Coalition Agreement served as the basis for the development of the Climate Agreement. In addition to the required 49% reduction and agreements related to ending coal-powered electricity generation and the CO2 minimum price (see section 1.1.iii)), the Coalition Agreement also states that agreements in the state-wide programme for the circular economy and the transition agendas in the Raw Materials Agreement will be implemented as part of the climate challenge.20 Climate Act The Senate approved the Climate Act on 28 May. This Act legally enshrines the (long-term) objectives of the climate policy for 2030 and 2050.  In 2050, the Netherlands must have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 95% compared with 1990;  An intermediate target of a 49% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions has been established for 2030; and  Another target stipulates that electricity generation must be 100% CO2 neutral by 2050.                                                  17 Motivaction, Publieksmonitor Energie, 2017 18 Confidence in the future, Coalition Agreement 2017 - 2021, VVD, CDA, D66 and ChristenUnie. 19 Parliamentary document 32 852, no. 59. 20 Letter to Parliament on the Government Strategy for Climate Policy, 23 February 2018, Parliamentary document 32 813, no. 163. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030     In addition, the law stipulates that a Climate Plan is to be compiled every five years. The Climate Plan outlines the main priorities of the climate policy to be implemented over the next 10 years. This corresponds to the approach established in the NECP. The Climate Act connects the long-term goals with medium and short-term policy. The law also stipulates that every year - on the fourth Thursday of October - the Climate and Energy Report (KEV) and the climate memorandum are submitted to the House of Representatives. The annual Climate Memorandum reports the progress of the policy in the Climate Plan. This ensures the House is informed about the progress made in climate policy. This monitoring system is consistent with that of the NECP. Climate Agreement The starting shot was given for the Climate Agreement on 23 February 2018 and it was published on 28 June 2019. The Climate Agreement contains agreements on the measures required to achieve a 49% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and that prepare us for the challenge up to 2050. It thus has a more distant horizon than the Energy Agreement. The long-term perspective of the Climate Agreement makes a gradual transition possible, prevents shock effects and ensures we can seize economic opportunities. The government predefined the political frameworks with which the Climate Agreement must comply: the reduction target of 49% must be achieved in a way that is feasible and affordable for everyone. This means that we reduce the burden on the household purse as much as possible and that we ensure a fair distribution of burdens between households and businesses, taking into account the level playing field for our business community. We take the time available to us in the run up to 2030 and 2050 and opt for the most cost-effective and future-proof approach. At the same time we work towards an appealing business climate in which we encourage business to invest in sustainable, innovative activities in the Netherlands. After all, an ambitious climate policy can offer opportunities for our economy, our prosperity and our sustainable earning power. The 49% greenhouse gas reduction target by 2030 proposed in the Coalition Agreement means a reduction of approximately 49 Mton of CO2. This past year, over a hundred parties have worked on a coherent package of proposals with which the CO2 reduction target can be achieved by 2030. On 21 December 2018, this resulted in a draft Climate Agreement21 and the publication of the Climate Agreement on 28 June 201922. Businesses and social organisations developed measures in sectoral platforms in the fields of electricity, mobility, agriculture and land use, industry and the built-up environment with which the reduction target can be achieved. They did so under the leadership of five independent chairs of the sectoral platforms, the chairs of the two task groups and the chair of the Climate Council. This result would not have been possible without the efforts and commitment of all parties involved. The Agreement contains measures the government itself is taking or actively facilitating. It also includes the agreements between parties in which the government does not have an active role. Both are important in order to achieve the common goal. The Energy Agreement for sustainable growth The Energy Agreement for sustainable growth was concluded in September 2013 and runs until 2023. In the Energy Agreement over 40 organisations (including the government, employers, trade unions, nature and environmental organisations, social organisations and financial institutions) established their shared ambitions for sustainable growth, and made specific agreements to achieve these ambitions. In this context parties will strive to achieve the following objectives:23  A saving on final energy consumption of on average 1.5% a year.  Energy savings of 100 petajoules in the Netherlands' final energy consumption as of 2020 compared with 2012.  An increase in the share of renewable energy generation (over 4 % in 2013) to 14 % in 2020.                                                  21 Parliamentary document 32 813, no. 263 22 Parliamentary document 32 813, no. 342 23 Energy Agreement for Sustainable Growth, SER (Social and Economic Council), September 2013;    A further increase of this share to 16% in 2023.  At least 15,000 full-time jobs, a large number to be created over the next few years. In 2016, the Energy Agreement intensification package was agreed by the Guarantee Committee. Moreover in 2018, the 2018 Implementation Agenda was agreed, which contains a response from the Energy Agreement parties regarding the outcomes of NEV 2017 and a number of focal points for implementing the Energy Agreement over the coming year.24 The Implementation Agenda 2018 also refers to the Climate Agreement. Implementing the agreements in the Energy Agreement must result in an affordable and clean energy supply, employment and opportunities for the Netherlands on the clean technology market. With the Energy Agreement the Netherlands has taken an irreversible step towards the energy transition. This will result in a substantial increase in the share of renewable energy and energy savings. The Climate Agreement (see above) builds on the results of the Energy Agreement and focuses on the period up to 2030 and beyond. The required continuity is adequately guaranteed if the goals of the Energy Agreement for 2020 and 2023 are fully integrated in the implementation and safeguarding of the Climate Agreement. Top sectors Top sectors are fields in which the Dutch business community and research centres excel worldwide: agriculture and food, chemical industry, creative industries, energy, high tech systems and materials, life science and health, logistics, horticulture and starting materials and water and maritime The business community, universities, research centres and the government work together on knowledge and innovation to further strengthen this position. Within each top sector the parties have joined forces in Top Consortia for Knowledge and Innovation (TKIs). The TKIs have established research agendas and goals for the coming years. The Top Sector Energy (TSE) is the driving force behind innovations necessary for the transition to an affordable, reliable and renewable energy system. The TSE helps businesses, knowledge institutions, authorities and social organisations to work together on the energy system of the future. The TSE also stimulates new initiatives that accelerate the transition towards renewable energy. This allows the TSE to create new activities and us to boost our international competitiveness. In July 2018, the government outlined the new approach to the top sectors policy.25 The focus is on the economic opportunities offered by social challenges, including the energy transition and sustainability. Newcomers are expressly invited to participate. Draft national environmental vision (Nationale Omgevingsvisie - NOVI) The government adopts the assessment principles and spatial elaboration of the climate and energy transition from the draft NOVI as a framework for policy implementation. The draft NOVI is characterised by a preference for offshore wind energy. Energy generated offshore will come ashore at a limited number of sites. Where possible, energy-intensive industry will be concentrated at these sites. This avoids the unnecessary transportation of energy inland and the corresponding new infrastructure and spatial consumption. A combination of functions takes precedence over single functions; the characteristics and identity of a region is key and any deviations are prevented. These principles help in taking decentralised spatial policy decisions so that balanced space can be provided for the climate and energy transition. The draft NOVI stipulates a preference for offshore wind energy, but it is also necessary to integrate renewable energy generation on land. To this end the draft NOVI addresses the Principal Energy Structure Programme and provides direction for the Regional Energy Strategies (RES). With regard to the construction of the vital energy infrastructure, the draft NOVI indicates that it will be carried out in a climate-proof manner and must be flood-proof. In the Principal Energy Structure Programme, the quality of the environment and cost reduction play a major role. This national programme will be aligned with the National Programme for Regional Energy Strategies(NP RES).                                                  24 Parliamentary document 30 196, no. 559. 25 Letter to Parliament "Towards mission-driven innovation policy with impact", 13 July 2018, Parliamentary document 33 009, no. 63. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    Directions provided to the RESes include the preference for large-scale clustering of renewable energy generation, to prevent fragmentation over the landscape and to use space as efficiently as possible. The option for an alternative heat facility for the heat transition in the built-up environment relies on many aspects, including spatial ones. This is why heat grids must be examined in detail and explicitly weighed against other options. Large-scale clustering (which reduces spatial transfer and contributes to cost reduction) and a preferential order for solar PV (with the first preference for solar PV on roofs and façades and, in the last resort, in rural areas). The option for an alternative heat facility for the heat transition in the built-up environment relies on many aspects, including spatial ones. This is why heat grids must be examined in detail and explicitly weighed against other options. Collaboration with other authorities Launch of the Inter-administrative Programme The climate and energy transition is not only a matter for the government and the State. Translation of national targets in the Climate Act into their practical implementation often takes place at the regional or local level. Typical issues that occur at the regional or local level are, for example, spatial integration of renewable energy options, and the storage of and infrastructure for heat and electricity. The responsibilities of all levels of government come together particularly at the interface of energy policy and spatial policy. In the Spatial Planning Act (WRO) and in the future Environment and Planning Act municipalities and provinces bear primary responsibility for spatial policy and the development of the physical environment. Municipalities take care of the public space and bear front line responsibility for weighing up interests in use of the scarce space. Provinces play an important role in connecting and directing the challenges in the physical environment when there are supralocal and regional interests. Central government formulates the long-term policy goals and the desired coherence between the goals, thus bearing responsibility for considerations at the strategic level. In February 2018, central government and local and regional authorities signed the Inter-administrative Programme26, which includes Climate and Energy, as well as the circular economy and climate adaptation. Central government and local and regional authorities agreed to jointly commit to climate mitigation (central government and local and regional authorities will jointly strive to achieve the target of a 49% reduction in CO2 by 2030); climate adaptation (the Netherlands is to be climate-proof and water-resilient by 2050); and a circular economy (the Netherlands will be a circular entity by 2050). The joint ambition of the authorities is to achieve substantive results related to these three themes, supported by all the authorities. Substantive agreements in which the business community and social parties also bear responsibility will be included in the Climate Agreement. Regional Energy Strategies (RES) One component of the Inter-administrative Programme is the agreement on a multi-annual programmatic national approach with nationwide integral Regional Energy Strategies (RES), combined with regional circular economy strategies. In many cases, the region is the right level of scale for linking the energy transition challenge with other challenges in the physical environment, and thus comparatively weighing up the various interests. Aligning the supply and demand of electricity and heat, and the spatial weighting of renewable energy and heat generation cannot be tackled on a single administrative level. The RES offers a new instrument in which municipalities, provinces and water boards work together at the regional level and assess renewable electricity generation, the heat transition in the built-up environment and the related storage and infrastructure needed. They do this together with grid operators, businesses and social parties. The focus is on the successful generation of 35 TWh of renewable energy on land by 2030 and developing a Regional Heat Structure. In line with the assessment principles in the draft NOVI, the RES also includes preferred pathways. The RES is established by the municipal councils, provincial states and the water boards' general administrative bodies. Elected representatives and day-to-day administrators are usually involved from the beginning of the RES process. However, the way in which this happens may vary from one region to the next. Therefore, the RES does not lead to changes in existing government tasks and competences. The outcomes of the RES process are established by the respective, responsible bodies of municipalities, provinces and water boards, in the municipal and provincial Environmental Vision, Environmental Plan and Environmental Regulation and Water Board                                                  26 Programmastart IBP (Launch of the Inter-administrative Programme), 14 February 2018   Regulation. This means that assessments performed at the regional level are anchored in existing structures and instruments.  The implementation of the RES is supported by the Inter-administrative National Programme for Regional Energy Strategies (NP RES). The NP RES has five commissioning parties: the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, the Association of Provinces of the Netherlands, the Association of Dutch Municipalities and the Union of Water Boards. The NP RES provides a platform for learning and coordination, and supports the regions in achieving the target and developing a robust and socially supported process to this effect. In view of this, parties such as grid operators and the participation coalition are also actively involved27.  Mobility: MIRT (The Dutch Multi-Year Programme for Infrastructure, Spatial Planning and Transport) Inter-administrative consultation on mobility takes place in the Administrative Consultations for the Dutch Multi-Year Programme for Infrastructure, Spatial Planning and Transport. iii. Key aspects of cross-border relevance The Netherlands is aiming to be climate neutral by 2050 and to increase the European contribution of 40% by 2030, to a 55% reduction by 2030. The Netherlands aims to make ambitious agreements with all European countries to jointly develop policy instruments and practical measures and thus achieve a higher climate target within the lead group. The Netherlands is working with other Member States to achieve a coordinated phasing out of coal, to make the EU budget Paris-proof, far-reaching carbon pricing in addition to ETS, the roll-out of renewable energy and faster growth in the share of electric cars. As well as the joint development of CCU/CCS ("Carbon Capture and Utilisation/Carbon Capture and Storage") and green hydrogen. In this endeavour, collaboration within the leading group of like-minded European countries is crucial. The Netherlands supports the plans for the new Commission to come up with an integral package of measures: the Green Deal. The Green Deal covers relevant sectors such as transport, energy and agriculture, and presents ambitious plans for cross-sectoral strategies, such as the commitment to the circular economy, biodiversity and hydrogen. In this regard the Netherlands considers it important that industry and funding are linked to the plans for the Green Deal. The Netherlands supports the call on the Commission by many Member States to produce a second plan of action and a long-term strategy for the circular economy with quantitative targets that also contribute to achieving the climate goals. By joining forces with neighbouring countries we can prevent any leakage effects of the greenhouse gas reductions and major competitive disadvantages to the Dutch economy. The regional alignment of strategies is also important for supply security. European directives that establish CO2 norms for vehicles (cars, delivery vans and trucks) are extremely important for reducing CO2 emissions from new vehicles. The Netherlands is working closely with like-minded Member States on this matter to ensure strict EU norms. The same applies to strict EU norms for mobile machinery not intended for road use (e.g. excavators, cranes and marine engines). With regard to implementation of the EU directive on laying infrastructure for alternative fuels, the Netherlands has set up an informal collaboration partnership with Germany, in which ten European Member States are participating. The Netherlands is also working in the Benelux context on rolling out alternative fuels for mobility. Furthermore, there are joint efforts with neighbouring countries to enable electric driving and electric cars to cross borders. These efforts relate to the standardisation of protocols and charging infrastructure. The coalition for each theme may differ, depending on the joint challenges and interests in neighbouring countries. This will build on existing cooperation partnerships in the field of energy, industry and climate (such as the Pentalateral Energy Forum and the North Seas Energy Forum), and cooperation in agriculture, mobility, the circular economy and the built-up environment will be sought with like-minded countries in these areas. iv. Administrative structure of national energy and climate policy Since October 2017, climate and energy policy has fallen under a single ministry, i.e. the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (EZK). The responsibility of the EZK includes implementation of the Energy Agreement,                                                  27 The Participation Coalition, a national collaboration partnership involving Energie Samen, HIER opgewekt, de Natuur en Milieufederaties, LSA bewoners and Buurkracht, will ensure that all parties involved at the regional level have participated in shaping the RESes. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    implementation of the Climate Agreement, and drafting the Climate Plan and NECP. The Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations is responsible for policy to increase the sustainability of the built-up environment. The Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality is responsible for the targets with regard to agriculture and land use and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management for mobility, the circular economy and climate adaptation. Consultation and alignment between the ministries concerned is necessary and therefore takes place on a regular basis. Local and regional authorities are responsible for developing measures in the physical environment, spatial policy and for achieving nature-related objectives. They also play a leading role in the Regional Energy Strategies (RES): regional developments primarily for the challenges related to generating electricity onshore (locations and grids) and the heat transition in the built-up environment. They serve as the link with the regional circular economy strategies in the IBP and translate them into provincial and municipal environmental visions, environmental regulations and environmental plans. Governments play an important role, but the success of the transition ultimately depends on the joint efforts of many parties in society. In the Coalition Agreement, the government has focused on climate policy with the broadest possible support. Over 100 parties participated in debates on the Climate Agreement. Each of these parties will interpret the agreements made on the basis of their particular responsibility. As part of the Climate Agreement it was agreed that in relation to the implementation of agreements per sector, (regular) implementation meetings will take place, in which the progress of agreements will be discussed based on sectoral implementation programmes. The implementation meetings fall under the responsibility of the relevant sectoral ministers at the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (EZK), the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations (BZK), the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management (I&W) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV).28 In addition to the implementation meetings, the (coordinating) minister from the EZK will organise progress meetings, during which overall progress will be discussed on a regular basis. The Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) is one of the most important independent advisers to the government in the field of the quality of life, the environment, climate and energy. Every year, the PBL publishes the Climate and Energy Report (KEV). The KEV, which is the successor of the former National Energy Report (NEV) provides an overview of emissions achieved and an estimate of greenhouse gas emissions in the Netherlands broken down into sectors. The KEV also provides insight into the developments and measures that had an impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The KEV is sent to both chambers of the States General by 1 November at the latest. The Climate Act requires the government to periodically account for achieving the targets established in the Act. The government sends the Climate Memorandum to both chambers of the States General at the same time as the KEV. The Climate Memorandum contains: a. The overall picture of the achievement of the climate policy as included in the Climate Plan; b. A presentation per ministry of the main aspects of the achievements of climate policy; c. A presentation of the impact on the departmental budgets of climate policy; d. The financial impact on households, businesses and governments of significant developments in climate policy that deviate from the Climate Plan; e. The way in which the Climate and Energy Report is involved in the next review or evaluation of the progress made by the Climate Plan, and f. insofar as it is relevant, the progress report of the implementation of the Climate Plan. In order to effectively monitor policy progress a Climate Policy Progress Monitor has been developed. The monitor appears annually with the Climate Memorandum and examines policy progress on four levels: 1. Implementation of agreements or measures; 2. Changes in the preconditions for the transition; 3. Change in (attitude and) behaviour; 4. Policy results. Systematically developing the monitor in this way enables early detection of any bottlenecks.                                                  28 The implementation programmes per sector will be appended to the final Climate Plan.   The Climate Policy Progress Monitor ties in as much as possible with existing monitoring instruments within the different sectors, and will appear annually as of 2020. Insights from the Climate Policy Progress Monitor will be used to adjust policy in the meantime, along with insights into CO2 target achievement in the KEV. The Council of State provides an annual review of the Climate Memorandum. In the review the Council of State primarily focuses on administrative aspects of the policy, such as the relationship between central government and other authorities, the feasibility and enforceability of measures and their financial consequences. The national guarantee cycle is aligned with the NECP cycle in accordance with the Climate Act. 1.3 Stakeholder consultation and involvement Broad social involvement in formulating policy: Climate Agreement The government is striving for the broadest possible support for the transition to a low CO2 society and the policy required to achieve it. Therefore, the Coalition Agreement focuses on broad social agreement as the basis for the policy approach. The Climate Agreement established on 28 June is the successor to the Energy Agreement. Over a hundred stakeholders participated in discussions about the Climate Agreement, organised in five sectoral platforms and three task forces in the fields of finance, innovation and labour market and education. They included organisations and businesses that can make a specific contribution to the transition within sectors, from the environmental movement to businesses and sectoral organisations. The five sectoral platforms were presided over by independent chairs who regularly convened in a Climate Council that monitored coordination and cohesion with regard to cross-cutting themes such as the labour market & education, spatial integration, finance and innovation. Citizens were asked to make a contribution to the Climate Agreement. They were able to submit plans, ideas, suggestions and questions online. A Climate Council delegation also toured the country. At the end of May and beginning of June 2018, meetings were organised at five locations, during which citizens could participate. In October, the Climate Council organised a meeting in each province to engage in dialogue about subjects that are broadly mentioned in the Climate Agreement. The Dutch Citizen Participation and Government Policy Platform (NPBO) organised a series of meetings. At the end of August 2019, an online public consultation was launched to give the public the opportunity to respond to the draft versions of the NECP, the Climate Plan and the Long-term Strategy. Individual citizens and professional organisations had the chance to present their response to the plans by means of open questions over a period of six weeks. A list of public reactions and the way in which they were incorporated in the Climate Plan and the NECP was recently published.29 Participation and the involvement of citizens in the implementation The broad and active involvement of citizens is vital for the success of the transition and must also be afforded a major role in implementing policy. This constituted an important part of the debates on the Climate Agreement, which resulted in a focus on participation in the context of the RES, the district-oriented approach and renewable energy generation. This commitment is summarised below. Another focal point is the way in which central government would like to use the insights of the SCP, which monitors the citizen's perspective of the energy transition, so that it can be enhanced with the citizen's perspective. Lastly, the broad public approach is described, which was launched in September 2019 to create awareness among citizens of their personal role in the transition and encourage them to take steps. Participation in the Regional Energy Strategies When developing the RES, governments elaborate regionally-supported decisions with grid operators and social stakeholders, related to generating renewable electricity, the heat transition in the built-up environment and the required storage and energy infrastructure. These decisions are translated into areas, projects and the implementation and execution of the projects concerned.                                                  29 The report was published on www.internetconsultatie.nl. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    In each region the broad lines of the process to develop a RES are established using an administrative initiation document (project initiation documentation or similar). It sets out the objective and the method of democratic and spatial safeguarding. The process must lead to an energy strategy that elaborates the specific areas sought that are suitable for power generated by the sun, wind, soil or water, taking into account spatial quality and social support. Process participation in the development of the RES leads to better quality substantiated choices and decisions that contribute to successful implementation. Citizens are also involved in reflecting on the RES. At the regional level municipalities, water boards and provinces ensure effective and timely provision of information to citizens and develop local facilities to enable citizens to reflect on strategy formation more effectively. It is the region's responsibility to determine the necessary facilitation. Depending on the regional circumstances it could involve access to knowledge, independent process guidance, financial support or something else. The form of facilitation chosen is established in the initiation document cited above. When implementing the RES, regional governments must adhere to the agreements set out in the Climate Agreement related to citizen participation in the district-oriented approach and project participation in renewable energy generation. Participation in the district-oriented approach Municipalities assume the directive role in the transition to gas-free districts. In a diligent process they will have to weigh up the best solution per district, if houses are no longer heated using a traditional central heating boiler. The solution may differ per district. All practical examples to date show that this process is more successful the more citizens act collectively and with the authorities (including local authorities). When choosing a suitable form of participation - information provision, allowing citizens to have a say, consultation or co-production - it is important to be aware of the district's socio-cultural profile. Various district profiles are being developed and assessed in testing grounds of the Inter-administrative Programme for Gas-free Districts. It is a joint programme involving the Ministries of BZK and EZK and the umbrella organisations of municipalities (VNG), provinces (IPO) and water boards (UvW). A knowledge and educational programme forms part of the Gas-free Districts Programme and aims to boost the directive role of municipalities and bundle the learning experiences of municipalities and other stakeholders. The testing grounds are used, for example, to assess participation principles. In association with the VNG and other stakeholders, central government is compiling a guide to participation, partly based on the experiences acquired in the gas-free districts testing grounds.29 Participation in renewable energy generation Participation and acceptance are vital for the spatial integration and exploitation of energy projects, including ones on a large-scale. Agreements have been made on this matter at the Electricity sectoral platform related to the Climate Agreement. Authorities bear primary responsibility for communication regarding the benefit and necessity of the transition. Participation guides are compiled as part of the Green Deal, Participation of the Environment in Renewable Energy Projects (process participation during project development) and the national RES programme (process participation during the RES). They provide developers, authorities and funding agencies with guidelines for adopting a participative approach. These guidelines can be used to explicitly afford the desired working method for participation a place in sectoral codes of conduct and spatial frameworks such as environmental visions, environmental plans and project decisions. The initiator of an energy project runs through a process to arrive at a desirable and feasible form of participation. The competent authority verifies that market parties and the environment engage in dialogue on this matter. Agreements made with the environment are established in an environment agreement. It forms the basis for a project plan, which describes how participation will be optimally addressed within the project. To ensure that the projects for developing and operating renewable energy on land in the energy transition succeed, in areas with possibilities and ambitions for renewable generation, the environment and market parties will work together in their development, construction and operation. This translates into a balanced distribution of ownership in an area where the aim is to have 50% ownership of generation locally (citizens and businesses). The ownership ratio target is a general   target for 2030. Locally there is scope to deviate from this for local project-related reasons. This also takes into account the special position of the water boards that are both a local developer and decentralised authority tasked with making their operational processes more sustainable.  Better view of the citizen's perspective In the debates on the Climate Agreement it was found that there is currently insufficient knowledge of how citizens feel about this issue. In 2018, the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP) launched the Sustainable Societies programme. With this programme the SCP provides a socio-cultural perspective on the transitions that should result in a sustainable society. The research programme focuses on the relationship between the citizen (individual or collective) and the authorities in the context of these transitions, on processes of the inclusion and exclusion of Dutch people (both individually and in groups) during and as a result of these transitions and on the consequences of these transitions on the quality of life. The SCP will use this programme to map out the citizen's perspective. Doing this periodically will mean that substantiated statements can be made about developments over the years. The aim is to monitor the sustainability transition from the citizen's perspective by assigning the SCP a permanent role in the guarantee cycle to promote progress of the Climate Agreement (in association with the progress monitor). Based on periodic reports by the SCP, the development of support and citizen participation can be monitored as the Climate Agreement progresses. Insights acquired by the SCP regarding the citizen's perspective can be used to improve the quality and implementation of the Climate Agreement and adjust its implementation where necessary. Communication: a broad public approach In September 2019, central government initiated a broad public approach to create awareness among citizens of their personal role in the transition and encourage them to change their behaviour. The broad public approach consists of two elements: a public campaign and a network approach. The public campaign appeals to the citizen via targeted communication at times to which he or she is most receptive to it. The umbrella campaign links all efforts being developed in this field by central government, private and public stakeholders. Within this overarching theme, sub-campaigns, which highlight certain matters pertaining to the Climate Agreement, are developed and implemented under the responsibility of the departments. Besides a mass media component the public campaign is characterised by an approach in which citizens are continuously offered an action perspective so they can make a contribution at a time that is most convenient for them. In the network approach central government and stakeholders (public/private parties) develop specific, appealing options through which citizens can contribute. i. Consultation and alignment with other Member States Dutch energy and climate policy is regularly shared with other Member States through various consultative bodies. The Netherlands participates in, for example, the Pentalateral Energy Forum, the North Seas Energy Forum, the Green Growth Group and the Climate Adaptation working group of the Climate Change Committee. The NECP is coordinated through the Pentalateral Energy Forum and the North Seas Energy Forum. The Pentalateral Energy Forum was co-founded by the Netherlands in 2005, first with the Benelux, France and Germany as the initial members, and Austria and Switzerland at a later date. The Benelux provides the secretariat and the presidency rotates. The ministers provide political direction for the regional partnership of the Penta countries, with a particular focus on market coupling, security of supply and improving the flexibility of services. The ministers convene once every two years. The Penta region is the largest EU market and participating countries have identified a new role for the Pentalateral Energy Forum with regard to the coordination of the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plans. To this end, a political declaration was signed in the margins of the Energy Council in February 2019. In the declaration, the countries state that the Pentalateral Forum will focus on greater regional cooperation in the context of the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plans. Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, France, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden and Norway signed the North Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    Seas Declaration with the Netherlands and the European Commission, on the development of offshore wind energy and improvements to the grid. These countries will be involved in elaborating a package of specific measures to achieve additional CO2 reductions, since any additional efforts must also be consistent with the other ambitions that have been jointly formulated with these countries. The agreements of the North Seas Energy Forum are summarised in a section of the NECP (1.4 ii).  The Green Growth Group (GGG) consists of 16 EU Member States (AT, BE, DE, DK, EE, ES, FI, FR, IE, IT, LU, NL, PT, SE, SI and UK) and Norway, which collaborate on strengthening EU climate ambitions. In the Climate Adaptation working group (part of the CC Committee), EU Member States and the Commission collaborate on implementing the EU Climate Adaptation Strategy. The evaluation of this strategy will be published at the end of 2018. In addition, the Netherlands is working with a group of like-minded countries, which regularly meet in the margins of the Environmental Councils, on increasing the EU's climate targets. Bilateral consultation also takes place with neighbouring countries. This includes issues such as phasing out (low-calorific) natural gas, phasing out coal, measures for reducing greenhouse gases, the introduction of a minimum CO2 price and the effects of capacity market mechanisms. ii. Iterative process with the European Commission Consultation with the European Commission takes place in the regular Technical NECP Working Groups, the NECP online platform and the Energy and Climate Council Working Groups. There is also bilateral consultation with staff from DG ENER and DG CLIMA. In June 2019, the Commission presented recommendations based on the draft NECP30. The Netherlands processed these recommendations in this final version of the NECP31. 1.4 Regional cooperation in preparing the plan i. Elements subject to joint or coordinated planning involving other Member States In June 2018, Belgium, along with the Benelux Secretariat, organised a dialogue consultation to discuss how we would be jointly drafting our NECPs, and the elements subject to coordination, in the Pentalateral context (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland). In February 2019, this resulted in a political declaration signed during the Energy Council. In the declaration, the countries state that the Pentalateral Forum will focus on greater regional cooperation in the context of the NECPs. The English text of this declaration is included under 1.4.ii. The Netherlands will address the elaboration of the political declaration and enhanced regional collaboration with regard to the NECPs in the Pentalateral context during the Dutch Presidency of the Benelux (and of Penta) in 2020. It was agreed with the countries involved in the North Seas Energy Forum that a joint North Seas paragraph would be added to the NECP. This English text is also included under 1.4.ii. In addition the Ministry of EZK organised a consultation for neighbouring countries in September, to which all Member States plus Norway, Switzerland and Iceland were invited. During the consultation, colleagues from the other Member States were informed about the Dutch Climate Agreement that forms the basis of the Netherlands' NECP. A significant part of the consultation concerned the debate on the components of cross-border importance in the Dutch Climate Agreement, including joint innovation projects, phasing out coal and the CO2 tax.                                                  30 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/governance-energy-union/national-energy-climate-plans 31 See Appendix 2   ii. Explanation about the way in which the results of regional cooperation are incorporated in the plan. NECPs and regional cooperation - common penta chapter for NECPs 32 Introduction The Pentalateral Energy Forum is a voluntary regional cooperation, since 2005, between Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and, since 2011, Austria, counting for more than one third of EU population and covering more than 40% of the electricity generation in the EU. Switzerland joined as a permanent observer in 2011 and contributes actively to the technical work and decision shaping. In close cooperation with the European Commission (on invitation), the Pentalateral Energy Forum enhances the cooperation between all relevant parties in order to create a regional electricity market as an intermediate step towards one common European electricity market. The cooperation is led by the Ministers responsible for energy policy, who meet on a regular basis. The follow-up of the activities is ensured by the Penta Coordinators' and the Penta NECP Committee under the direction of the respective Directors General of the Pentalateral countries. The work programme is carried out by Transmission System Operators (TSOs), ministries, regulatory authorities (NRAs), the European Commission and market parties who meet on a regular basis in 3 Support Groups. The major success over the past 15 years is that Penta countries have evolved from a purely national policy perspective on energy markets to the adoption of a regional approach. Concrete regional milestones are put in place in several dimensions which remain relevant today: Internal electricity market/market integration The Penta Support Group 1 (SG1) focuses on the coupling of the electricity markets in the region. The SG1 fostered the flow-based market coupling (FBMC) of the day-ahead markets as an objective, and in May 2015 the FBMC was officially launched in the Penta region, as first of its kind in the European Union. Since then, the FBMC has been continuously improved to further increase its welfare gains and serves now as the basis for a fully EU entrenched FBMC for the day-ahead markets. Moreover, in order to increase the available transmission capacity for cross-border trade on the intraday market, the SG1 fostered a coordinated intraday capacity calculation process after day-ahead flow-based market coupling for all borders in the region which has been implemented in March 2016 as a first step of the coupling of European intraday markets. The Support Group has been a privileged witness of the drastic change in the electricity landscape and the governance of the electricity markets. Whereas in 2005 electricity operators still worked rather separately, the group has actively stimulated over the years the cooperation between stakeholders, which contributed e.g. to the regional grouping of TSOs in their associations, the merger of Power Exchanges or TSOs, and the emergence of new regional actors (TSCNet, Coreso, former CASC-CWE, SSC). With a view to the new implementation plans that have to be prepared according to the Clean Energy Package, Penta countries will closely coordinate and explore joint action. Internal electricity market/flexibility The Support Group 3 (SG 3) focuses on flexibility issues in the region. The work in the SG3 has until now been concentrated on balancing, intraday and the role of demand side response as three major fields for regional cooperation to improve the flexibility of our electricity markets. Various technical background papers have been delivered summing up the main barriers and obstacles towards an enhanced use of flexibility in the Penta region. The participation of SG3 has been open to traditional participants                                                  32 As this joint paragraph was drafted by the countries involved in the Pentalateral Energy Forum this text is in English. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    (NRAs/TSOs) as well as other stakeholders like Distribution System Operators (DSOs), large consumer organizations and renewable producers. Regarding balancing, assessments of current approaches and an exchange on good practices have been taken place within the Penta forum. In addition, Penta is playing an important role in the implementation process of the European Union Guidelines on Electricity Balancing. Regarding Demand Side Response (DSR) a separate expert group has worked on a report describing the actual situation in the Penta region with a focus on the rules and responsibilities of new market players in each country of the region. Regarding the further cooperation of Penta countries on hydrogen, a workshop has taken place, in order to define possible cooperation topics on this issue. Security of supply The 1st regional generation adequacy assessment (GAA) performed by the Penta TSOs and published in March 2015 constituted an important milestone. The methodology for the assessment used a probabilistic and chronological approach with an hourly resolution for the years 2015/2016 and 2020/2021 which represented a significant improvement in comparison to the existing deterministic approaches. Furthermore, the Penta TSOs used a common regional dataset based on the same scenarios and assumptions, such as a regional-wide temperature-sensitive load model and harmonised probabilistic hydrological data. The governments of the Penta countries are convinced that these dimensions remain relevant. Next to a continuation on the above-mentioned areas, Penta countries will in the upcoming years use the Pentalateral Energy Forum to work on the following priorities: Decarbonisation of the electricity sector Common vision on decarbonised electricity in Penta by 2050 Penta countries will exchange their visions for a decarbonised electricity system by 2050 (with intermediate steps for 2030 and 2040) as part of a highly energy efficient and highly renewables-based energy system, a stepwise phasing out of fossil generated power and by an efficient end-use of electricity. As a first step a comparison of national scenarios on how the electricity system 2050 could look like will be performed as well as the identification of common and diverging aspects across the scenarios and how security of supply would be guaranteed in these scenarios. This will create the basis for a common understanding of the expectations and challenges for building a future electricity system. Start cross-border cooperation on renewable electricity Penta countries will work on voluntary basis towards developing a menu of common concepts covering different levels of cooperation, including exploring the possibilities for opening of national tendering schemes/cross- border tendering, common tenders for those Penta-countries which are interested and making increased use of the EU enabling framework for renewable energy and the existing cooperation mechanisms, such as joint projects and statistical transfers ("cluster menu") for those Penta-countries which are interested. The Penta countries also support the ongoing work of the European Commission and the Member States on developing a European Union Renewables Financing Mechanism.  Integration of electro-mobility options and services without regional restrictions Penta countries will contribute to increasing the share of renewable energy in transport by promoting electro- mobility (including fuel cell options). They facilitate the integration/implementation of electro-mobility options and services without restrictions within the Penta region, by identifying and if needed removing barriers for the cross-border deployment of electro-mobility and charging services and by assuring interoperability.   Explore the options for carbon pricing and their cross-border impact on electricity prices Penta countries that plan or consider to introduce a carbon price will on a voluntary basis exchange views on policy approaches for the introduction of a carbon price, its advantages and disadvantages in terms of CO2 reduction, security of supply, price developments and a level playing field of their industries. Internal electricity market Market integration Penta countries will further improve the monitoring of FBMC with a view to increase cross-border trade and social welfare and to optimize consumer benefit. Penta countries will make the monitoring more innovative, in view of translating it into the key common indicators to assess the evolution towards a fully decarbonized Pentalateral electricity market in 2050. Penta countries will work together in the swift implementation of the Clean Energy Package and possible cross-border impacts for the energy market (e.g. further development and improvement of redispatch cooperation in the Penta-region). Flexibility Penta countries will focus on the impact of the implementation of flexibility options such as the role of demand side management, PtX and hydrogen, the role of storage, electric mobility and analyse concrete electricity related barriers for sector coupling. Regarding the potential future role of increasingly renewables based hydrogen as an energy carrier in their energy system, Penta countries will examine possible common approaches for guarantees of origin, cross- border infrastructure, the respective role of TSOs and DSOs and standards for hydrogen blending, as well as exchange information and best practices on support schemes for hydrogen and innovation projects and the future role of hydrogen in general.  Penta countries will continuously improve the Pentalateral Generation Adequacy Assessment by taking into account improved weather data, the latest figures and targets from the NECPs of Penta countries when determining the future energy mixes and some other sensitivity analysis. The third assessment is currently being elaborated by the Penta TSOs for the horizons 2021 and 2025 taking into account regional (based on national) storylines, improved Flow Based calculations and Demand Side Flexibility sensitivities. In the frame of the Clean Energy Package (CEP), and more specifically in the context of regional cooperation and the risk preparedness regulation, discussions have been started with ENTSO-E, the Commission and other stakeholders to define rules for the cooperation between Member States in view of identifying potential regional crisis scenarios and of preventing, preparing for and handling electricity crises in a spirit of solidarity and transparency and in full regard for the requirements of a competitive internal market for electricity. Penta countries will work together to develop concrete regional measures in crisis situations. Financing Instruments for the energy transition The Pentalateral Energy Forum will start to exchange on possible regional approaches to increase energy efficiency and the roll out of renewables for example by looking together with financial institutions such as EIB for joint approaches to reduce risks in both sectors and hence facilitate the achievement of Penta members' objectives.   Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    Joint chapter for the North Seas Energy Cooperation 33 The Netherlands is part of the wider North Seas region, which has a large renewable energy potential. The European Commission has estimated that offshore wind from the North Seas can cover up to 12 pct. of the electric power consumption in the EU by 2030. Offshore wind generation and grid infrastructure projects may have cross-border effects on energy prices, security of supply and the environment, including availability of marine space as well as the pace of innovation. The North Seas countries therefore have great benefits to gain from cooperation. The North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC) is a voluntary, bottom up, market-oriented, regional cooperation initiative established in 2016, which seeks to create synergies and to avoid incompatibilities between national policies and to share knowledge on international best practices and foster joint strategies where possible and beneficial. The aim is to coordinate and facilitate further cost-effective deployment of offshore renewable energy, in particular wind, ensuring a sustainable, secure and affordable energy supply in the North Seas countries through increased and better coordinated offshore wind deployment as well as potential joint projects or cluster projects. The NSEC focuses on a step-by-step approach with the perspective of further integration and increased efficiency of wholesale electricity markets in the longer term, while contributing to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, in average wholesale price spreads and enhancing security supply in the region. The North Seas Energy Cooperation consists of 10 countries with participation from the European Commission: Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Regional cooperation As regards to preparing this plan, the Netherlands made use of the NSEC, in which experts in the support groups shared information and experiences on specific aspects, for example on barriers and best practices of national offshore wind development and in particular on aggregation of national renewable energy trajectories for offshore wind until 2030 and market integration. The Netherlands furthermore consulted on its National Energy and Climate Plan in the area of planned offshore wind deployment until 2030 and related grid planning aspects with the other North Seas countries. The support groups under the cooperation focus on the following subjects: Support group 1: Maritime Spatial Planning and environmental assessment Support group 2: Development and regulation of offshore grids and other offshore infrastructure Support group 3: Support framework and finance for offshore wind projects Support group 4: Standards, technical rules and regulations in the offshore wind sector Maritime Spatial Planning and environmental assessment Within the North Seas Energy Cooperation, the Netherlands contribute to the work on establishing common environmental impact assessment methodology. In order to reach our energy and climate targets within the EU, there is a need to better understand the possible ecological limits of large scale wind development in the North Seas. Further work is needed on maritime spatial planning and environmental assessment to be able to utilise the potential of the North Seas. To increase knowledge and support the deployment of offshore wind in the North Seas, the North Seas countries will continue to cooperate closely on maritime spatial planning, environmental research, cumulative impact assessment of wind farms between responsible authorities for energy, maritime spatial planning and environment. Offshore Grids and other Offshore Infrastructure                                                  33 As this joint paragraph was drafted by the countries involved in the North Seas Energy Forum this text is in English.   The NSEC serves as a platform to jointly work on concepts for potential joint wind offshore projects and for coordinated electricity infrastructure including transmission infrastructure. The Netherlands works together with the other North Seas Energy Cooperation countries on the possibilities for concrete cooperation projects. Besides joint offshore wind projects that would be connected to and supported by several Member States, this includes the work on possible "hybrid" solutions that would use cross-border solutions for connecting offshore wind farms to the grid and seek synergies with interconnection capacity between countries, and on the corresponding market arrangements. The Netherlands is therefore contributing to the development of possibilities for cooperation on hybrid projects and identifying and addressing possible legal, regulatory and commercial barriers. By coordinating on increased interconnection among the countries in the NSEC, an increasing amount of excess production of energy could flow across borders to meet demand in a well-functioning internal energy market. The NSEC has identified a list of potential areas and projects in the region, where joint projects could be particularly beneficial. These include: (1) IJmuiden Ver offshore wind farm to UK, (2) CGS IJmuiden Ver - Norfolk, (3) COBRA Cable, (4) DE offshore wind farm connected to NL and (5) North Seas Wind Power Hub. The NSEC is working on developing concrete concepts for the implementation of selected projects from the above list. The NSEC will continue to work on the actions plans for the specific hybrid projects which can also be taken further at a national and regional level. Furthermore, the cooperation will continue to work as a forum to reflect on how to deal with the uncertainties about the regulatory treatment of hybrid projects at EU and national level and as a forum to discuss options for addressing these issues. Support Framework and Finance of Offshore Wind Projects As regards to measures, the Netherlands benefits from the NSEC in several ways. The work in the NSEC provides a platform for exchange of best practice regarding the design of support schemes and to develop and work on new concepts tackling new challenges concerning support for offshore wind as well as to develop possible options for future joint offshore wind projects. The Netherlands works in the NSEC to coordinate the timing of tenders, to exchange best practices on the design for offshore wind support schemes and to identify, where possible, common principles as well as possible options for alignment of support. As regards to coordination of tenders, the Netherlands regularly shares information regarding its national tender schedule with the other NSEC countries with the aim of identifying possible overlaps in time and enabling the most continuous tender pipeline across the North Seas region to ensure that tender processes maximize competition and deliver most value for money to consumers. The Netherlands is ready to take into account, amongst other criteria and where possible, this overview of tender schedules in its future tender planning to avoid unnecessary bottlenecks and to provide a steady capacity pipeline to involved stakeholders without stop and go cycles. The Netherlands shares and discusses in the NSEC the estimated national offshore renewable trajectory, information on its national offshore deployment plans and best practices in the design of offshore wind tenders. At the Ministerial meeting in Esbjerg on the 20th of June 2019, North Seas countries agreed to work together to achieve an indicative aggregated installed offshore wind capacity of Member States of the NSEC of at least 70 GW by 2030 based on national planning. The indicative contribution of the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    Netherlands to this aggregate capacity in 2030 is 11 GW (see also section 2.1.2). In order to reflect the dynamics of offshore wind deployment in the region, this aggregate planned capacity of at least 70 GW for 2030 can be translated into an overall trajectory with indicative milestones for the region of approximately 25 GW in 2020 and 54 GW in 2025. In the NSEC, the Netherlands also contributes to the work of analysing and developing options for further mobilisation of investment capital for joint projects, for instance through EU funds such as European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) as well as institutional investors. Such future joint projects could be cross-border projects for renewable energy in accordance with the CEF proposal. Harmonisation of rules, regulation and technical standards The North Seas Energy Cooperation is working on aligning standards and technical requirements that could contribute to further reducing costs of offshore wind deployment. The focus is on aligning rules, regulation and technical standards within five identified areas. These include: (1) Aviation, marking and lights, (2) Health and safety, (3) Certification of regulatory requirements, (4) Park layout and site investigation and (5) Approaches to research. The NSEC works to develop proposals and recommendations for implementation in close cooperation with industry. The aim of those recommendations is to achieve cost reductions whilst at the same time be achievable. The cooperation will continue to work on aligning standards and technical requirements as well as exchange of best practices to reduce unnecessary regulation and costs for the industry.
