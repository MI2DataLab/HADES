Trends in current GHG emissions and removals in the EU ETS, effort sharing and LULUCF sectors and different energy sectors  As one of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Czech Republic is obliged to prepare and regularly update national inventory and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals. In addition, membership in the European Union includes additional requirements for the Czech Republic, such as fulfilling the obligations specified in Article 7 of EU Regulation No 525/2013. The National Inventory Report below outlines greenhouse gas emissions for the period 19902016. The inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and removals was prepared in accordance with the methodological guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: IPCC 2006 Guidelines (IPCC 2006). According to the latest available inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and removals, the Czech reenhouse gas emissions in 19902016 decreased by 34.69 %, including the LULUCF sectors129  and 35.24 % excluding the LULUCF sectors. The energy sector accounts for the largest share (81 %) of total emissions, of which 96 % is related to the combustion of fuels. Table 64, Table 65 and Chart 49 show the development of greenhouse gas emissions and removals in this period, broken down by individual greenhouse gases and IPCC sectors130.

However, the Czech Republic should, with a large margin, meet its target for non-ETS sectors by 2020, which allows for a maximum emission increase from these sectors of 9 % compared to 2005.                                                            131  Only removals above the benchmark level of -4 868 kt CO2 eq. can be accounted -11-9-7-5-3-1199019911992199319941995199619971998199920002001200220032004200520062007200820092010201120122013201420152016Emissions [Mt CO2eq.]NIR 2018NIR 2017 -195-  Table 69: Verified emissions from stationary installations in the EU ETS (million tonnes of CO2 eq.)  2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Emissions (EU ETS) 82.45 83.62 87.83 80.40 73.78 75.58 74.19 69.32 67.71 66.70 66.63 67.52 Source: EUTL Chart 51: Verified emissions from stationary installations in the EU ETS  Source: EUTL Table 70: Emissions in non-ETS sectors in 20052016 (million tonnes of CO2 eq.)  2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Emissions (non-ETS) 61.48  62.14 59.54 62.5 60.94 61.11 60.78 62.69 61.46 57.62 61.28 62.82 Source: EUROSTAT, CHMI 82,4583,6287,8380,4073,7875,5874,1969,3267,7166,7066,6367,520102030405060708090100200520062007200820092010201120122013201420152016million tonnes of CO2 eq. -196-  Chart 52: Emissions in non-ETS sectors in 20052016  Source: EUROSTAT, CHMI ii. Projections of sectoral developments with existing national and Union policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)  The projections of greenhouse gas emissions are based on the latest available inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and removals as described in Chapter 4.2.1 (i). Emission projections contain two scenarios (WEM  assumes the effects of current policies and measures on the development of greenhouse gas emissions, WAM  assumes the effect of planned policies and measures on the development of greenhouse gas emissions). Emission projections are created separately for each of the sectors (1. Energy, 2. Industrial processes and product use, 3. Agriculture, 4. LULUCF, 5. Waste) with a specific emphasis on key emission sources (sources that have a significant impact on total emissions of the country with respect to absolute emission values, taking into account the observed emission trend and taking into account the level of uncertainty for the given source). Projection of greenhouse gas emissions from sector 1. Energy is based on data provided by the MIT. In particular, this data includes energy and heat production outlooks and final consumption outlooks by sector (industry, transport, services, households, agriculture and others) are particularly high. The MESSAGE model was used to create greenhouse gas projections132, which is used for medium-term to long-term energy planning, for climate change policy analysis and developing national or regional scenarios. Projection of greenhouse gas emissions from sector 2. Industrial processes and product use are based on the outlooks for production of selected products such as cement, lime, iron, steel, etc., provided by the MIT, and on the outlooks prepared by industry experts (especially for fluorinated greenhouse gases). The actual projections of greenhouse gas emissions are based on the methodology used in the inventory of emissions and greenhouse gas removals, which is in line with the IPCC Guideline 2006. For                                                            132  Model for Energy Supply Strategy Alternatives and their General Environmental Impacts 61,4862,1459,5462,5060,9461,1160,7862,6961,4657,6261,2862,82010203040506070200520062007200820092010201120122013201420152016million tonnes of CO2 eq. -197-  projections of fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions used in refrigeration and air conditioning technology, the country-specific Phoenix model was used. Projection of greenhouse gas emissions from sector 3. Agriculture is based on the Strategy of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic with a view to 2030 updated by the Minister of agriculture and rural development. Significant inputs into the projections are data on livestock population trends, volume of nitrogen from fertilisers applied to agricultural land and the annual harvest of agricultural crops. The projections of greenhouse gas emissions are based on the methodology used in the inventory of emissions and greenhouse gas removals, which is in line with the IPCC Guideline 2006. When making projections of greenhouse gas emissions from sector 4. LULUCF, there is a specific focus on forest land category, which is a key category in the LULUCF sector, but also in the whole national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and removals. In relation to the LULUCF sector and carbon neutrality, it should be emphasised that in the coming years the role of forestry in the Czech Republic will change in terms of CO2 sinks due to extraordinary logging related to the elimination of bark beetle calamity. For these reasons, it is likely that the category of the managed forest land will temporarily show CO2 emissions. For this reason, forestry-related projections are prepared using the EFISCEN model133. The EFISCEN model is one of the most frequently used models for various tasks associated with the projections of forest resource developments in Europe. The projections of greenhouse gas emissions for the other LULUCF categories are based on the correlation of the estimated 2016 emissions with the corresponding areas for the predicted years. Projection of greenhouse gas emissions from sector 5. Waste is based on the data provided in the Waste Management Plan of the Czech Republic, which contains waste management outlooks by 2024. The projections after 2024 were extrapolated based on trend and expert estimates. The actual projections of greenhouse gas emissions are based on the methodology used in the inventory of emissions and greenhouse gas removals, which is in line with the IPCC Guideline 2006. Chart 53 and Table 71 show the results of projections of total greenhouse gas emissions for the WEM and WAM scenarios. In the short term until 2020, greenhouse gas emissions are projected to increase compared to the current state, and from 2025 global emissions will start to decrease gradually for both scenarios. In both scenarios, there is an approximately 24 % decrease in total greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 compared to the current state. The greenhouse gas emission projections under the WAM scenario are only slightly more unfavourable (see Table 71) than under the WEM scenario. The difference is due to emission projections from the LULUCF sector, where the WAM scenario envisages changes in the age structure and species composition of the forest (for more detailed description, see below).                                                            133  European Forest Information Scenario Model  -198-  Chart 53: The results of the projections of total greenhouse gas emissions for WEM and WAM scenarios (including LULUCF)  Source: CHMI Table 71: The results of the projections of total greenhouse gas emissions for WEM and WAM scenarios (including LULUCF) [Mt CO2 eq.]  Historical emissions GHG emission projection  2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 WEM 139.45 133.57 121.09 126.83 112.85 108.22 97.84 91.59 WAM 139.45 133.57 121.09 127.18 113.12 108.71 97.78 92.29 Source: CHMI Table 72: Outcomes of GHG emission projections outside EU-ETS for WEM and WAM scenario [Mt CO2 eq.]  Historical emissions GHG emission projection  2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 WEM 64.54 57.99 54.44 63.20 58.34 53.96 49.70 45.72 WAM 64.54 57.99 54.44 64.10 56.87 52.83 47.91 44.61 Source: CHMI Table 73 presents the results of projections of total greenhouse gas emissions by type of gas.

The most significant decrease in total greenhouse gas emissions compared to the current situation (approximately 32 %) is foreseen for sector 1. Energy. The projections are based on the data provided by the MIT. For sector 1. Energy, projections WEM and WAM scenarios were prepared. Unlike the WEM scenario, the WAM scenario envisages additional measures in transport. However, given the share of transport in total emissions from the energy sector, the differences between the WEM and the WAM scenarios are not significant. Given that the MIT prediction until 2040 of the production of selected products does not anticipate a downward trend in industrial production, greenhouse gas emissions from sector 2. Industrial processes and product use are decreasing slowly. The reduction in emissions is mainly due to the legislation on the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases, which requires manufacturers/importers/exporters to gradually shift to alternative refrigerants. For sector 3. According to the projections, agriculture can be expected to see an increasing trend in greenhouse gas emissions, especially for the manure management category and for the enteric fermentation category. The increase in emissions is due to the expected increase in livestock population, which is based on the data from the Ministry of Agriculture. The projections prepared for sector 4. LULUCF show the expected gradual loss of CO2 removal capacity until 2040. The emission projections for sector 4. LULUCF include changes in age structure (WEM) and age structure and species composition (WAM  more diverse Czech forests with a significantly higher share of deciduous trees). Although until 2040, the WAM scenario appears to be slightly more negative in terms of emission sinks (removals), it should lead to more stable and resilient forests better  -200-  adapted to changing environmental conditions  improving safety and sustainability of forest production.  For sector 5. According to the projections for waste, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions can be expected in both scenarios. The reduction of emissions is more pronounced for the WAM scenario, which is based on stricter coefficients for the recovery of landfill gas.

This central strategy document on air protection meets the requirements for the elaboration of national air pollution control programmes imposed on Member States by Directive (EU) 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2016 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants, amending Directive 2003/35/EC and repealing Directive 2001/81/EC. This Directive also sets national emission reduction commitment The update of the National Emission Reduction Programme was prepared in parallel with the National Energy and Climate Plan of the Czech Republic. The update of the National Emission Reduction Programme of the Czech Republic adopted the Draft National Plan, its structure and parameters as an input assumption for the calculation of emission projections of selected air pollutants. The calculated projections indicated that by 2020 the Czech Republic would meet all set national emission reduction commitments, and that by 2025 it would not fulfil its national ammonia reduction commitment without additional measures. In 2030, given the current situation, the Czech Republic will have difficulty meeting its national emission reduction commitments for all specified air pollutants except sulphur dioxide. In view of the emission projections, additional emission reduction measures have been identified in the National Emission Reduction Programme Update in order to meet the national emission reduction  -203-  commitments set out in the above Directive by the specified dates. One of the new measures, measure requires an additional savings of at least 5 kt of NOx emissions in 2030 compared to the NERP-WM emission scenario, a scenario that already included the original Draft National Plan of the Czech Republic as amended by the Government of the Czech Republic in January 2019. Among the ways of fulfilling this commitment, measure BB12 envisages, in particular, greater use of non-combustible renewable energy sources or heat recover from industry, fuel change or increased energy efficiency. The public energy sector is particularly important in relation to air in terms of NOx emissions, in which it accounts for about 26 %. Overall, in terms of secondary particulate matter precursors, it accounts for 22 % of emissions, making it the second largest emitter of these emissions in the Czech Republic, just behind the local household heating sector (41 %).  The NERP Update also assessed the contribution of foreign sources to air pollution in the Czech Republic. According to the results of modelling by advanced chemical model, the contribution of foreign sources in the Czech Republic may range from 30 to 50 % of the annual average for PM10 suspended particulate concentrations and 40 to 60 % of the annual average PM2.5 particle concentration (evaluated collectively for both primary and secondary particles) In particular, increasing the share of non-combustible renewable energy sources, increasing energy efficiency, reducing energy intensity and increasing heat recovery can be considered favourable interventions in this area with a positive impact on air quality. Furthermore, from the point of view of SO2 emissions, there is a positive substitution of fossil fuels (primarily coal) by other energy sources, however, the prepared emission projection shows compliance with emission reduction targets for SO2 with significant margin for all analysed years (2020, 2025, 2030). The issue of maintaining and improving air quality is problematic in the sector of heat production in sources with a rated thermal input of up to 300 kW, i.e. the local heating sector of households, where the national plan assumes a significant contribution to meeting the set target of heat production from renewable sources. Increased use of biomass is associated with emissions of air pollutants, which must be compensated by technological replacement of sources and improvement of the quality of service of sources, which are ensured by the requirement for the operation of boilers of at least 3rd and higher class (according to EN 303-5) and from 2022 by subsidies to support the exchange of sources (currently focused on boilers, after 2022 in accordance with measure DA1 of the NERP Update also on heaters) and measures to raise the awareness of the operators of sources about the correct way of heating (measure DB11).  The road transport sector accounts for about 32 % of total nitrogen oxide emissions and is the most important source of these emissions to air. With regard to national emission reduction commitments, it is necessary to achieve an additional savings of at least 5 kt of NOx emissions in 2030 compared to the scenario with measures (the WM scenario includes existing legislation and other already established measures). This can be achieved by a higher fleet renewal rate and a wider deployment of alternative fuel vehicles, both for cars and trucks and for public transport (electromobility and hydrogen mobility), but it is necessary to look for an emission-free way to produce these fuels instead of producing them from fossil sources. There is also significant potential for shifting transport from road to rail, targeted by measure AB23 of NERP Update. The different options for meeting the set share of renewable sources in transport do not differ significantly from the point of view of the total amount of transport emissions; a higher proportion of electricity leads to a positive effect of displacement of emissions from traffic-burdened localities and thus to a reduction of the impact on air quality. Increasing the share of natural gas / biogas at the expense of conventional fuels (petrol and diesel) also has some positive impact on reducing emissions.   -204-  Overall, the National Emission Reduction Programme update defines 6 new priority measures to reduce emissions of selected air pollutants and 14 support measures. The measures are focused on the sectors: public energy; heat generation; residential combustion in households, transport and agriculture.  Together, these measures represent the NERPWaM 2019 scenario. Its effect is expressed in the table below, which offers a comparison with the evolution of emissions under the NERPWM scenario, i.e. a scenario that has taken into account all existing effective or valid measures and which corresponds to the original draft National Plan.

In 2016, the share of renewable energy in the energy sector was 13.61 %. Renewable sources used in the production of electricity relative to the total share constitute approximately 3 %. Chart 59 shows the evolution of the share of renewable energy sources in gross final consumption in the transport sector in 20042016 by fuels. Renewable energy consumption in 2016 accounted for 6.42 % of total gross final consumption in the transport sector. The share of renewable energy sources in transport accounts for only about 1.3 % in the overall share. Chart 60 then shows the evolution of the share of renewable energy sources in the heating and cooling sector by fuels, which accounts for the largest share of approximately 10 % in the total share. The share of renewable sources in the heating and cooling sector is also the highest in comparison to other sectors; in 2016 it accounted for 19.87 %. 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%BEBGCZDKDEEEIEELESFRHRITCYLVLTLUHUMTNLATPLPTROSISKFISEUKShare in 2016Target share for 2020 -207-  Chart 57:   Source: RES share based on EUROSTAT methodology (MIT, CZSO) Chart 58: RES share in gross final consumption in the electricity sector  Source: RES share based on EUROSTAT methodology (MIT, CZSO) 6,83%7,07%7,38%7,96%8,62%9,92%10,48%12,05%12,77%13,85%14,98%14,99%14,98%0%2%4%6%8%10%12%14%16%18%20%2004200520062007200820092010201120122013201420152016ElectricityTransportHeating and cooling0%2%4%6%8%10%12%14%16%01002003004005006007008009002004200520062007200820092010201120122013201420152016ktoeBiomassHydropower plantsBiodegradable component of MSWBiogas stationsWind power plantsPhotovoltaic systemsShare -208-  Chart 59: RES share in gross final consumption in the transport sector  Source: RES share based on EUROSTAT methodology (MIT, CZSO) Chart 60: RES share in gross final consumption in the heating and cooling sector  Source: RES share based on EUROSTAT methodology (MIT, CZSO) 0%1%2%3%4%5%6%7%8%0501001502002503003504004502004200520062007200820092010201120122013201420152016ktoeBiodieselBioethanolElectricity from RES (treated)Share0%3%5%8%10%13%15%18%20%23%05001.0001.5002.0002.5003.0002004200520062007200820092010201120122013201420152016ktoeBiomassBiodegradable component of MSWBiogas stationsHeat pumpsSolar thermal collectorsShare -209-  ii. Indicative projections of development with existing policies for the year 2030 (with an outlook to the year 2040) Estimated RES considering the implementation of existing policies The estimated developments in the implementation of the policies and measures outlined in Chapter 3.1.2 is shown in Chapter 2.1.2. The proposed policies are designed to meet the target, so the estimated development considering the implementation of existing and forthcoming policies is the same as the one in Chapter 2.1.2. Chart 61 shows the expected development of the RES share by sector, based on the policies outlined in the relevant section of this document. In this respect, there is a relatively extensive supporting detailed estimate of the development of individual renewable energy sources by 2030 (this material is only available in Czech). By 2040, according to the approved State Energy Policy, renewable sources should account for 17-22 % of primary energy sources and 1825 % of gross electricity production. Chart 61: Estimation of RES share by 2030 by individual sectors  Source: Prepared by MIT for the purposes of the National Plan Estimated development of gas from renewables Given the intermittent nature of solar and wind power plants, gaseous fuels can play an important role, partly because of their technological possibilities for countering imbalances in the electricity system and because of the possibility of converting electricity into gaseous fuels. This creates the potential to significantly enhance the stability of the whole system, for example thanks to the fact that gaseous fuels can be stored and transported more easily and cheaper, and they can help make the use of renewables more efficient. In this way, it is possible to maximise the benefits of the existing energy infrastructure for the most efficient transition to a low-emission economy combining natural gas with decarbonised 10,48%12,05%12,77%13,85%14,99%14,99%14,89%15,01%16,50%16,98%17,67%18,17%18,73%19,32%19,92%20,61%21,21%22,00%0%5%10%15%20%25%201020112012201320142015201620172018201920202021202220232024202520262027202820292030ElectricityTransportHeating and cooling -210-  and renewable gases. Given a higher share of electricity production from intermittent renewable sources, gases from renewables can play an important role. The development of gases from renewables depends on several factors. The key issue will be a certain degree of public support for the production of renewable gases. The operation of some of the existing biogas plants (from which biomethane can subsequently be produced) could be discontinued by 2030. Therefore, the future setting of financial and institutional support for the development of gas production from renewables will be crucial (see Chapter 3.1.2.2). This includes, inter alia, both the transformation of existing biogas stations to biomethane production, and construction of new biomethane stations including their connection to the gas system. In addition to biogas and biomethane plants, there are hydrogen production technologies as well as bioLPG production technologies. These technologies are already known, but the operation of these plants is currently unprofitable due to high operating costs.  Gas from RES can play an important role as early as 20212030 and beyond, not only in electricity generation but also in the transport, heating and cooling sectors. Currently, there are approximately 400 biogas stations in the Czech Republic, more than 100 municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants with sludge gas production and almost 70 landfill gas production plants. Biogas stations135 account for approximately 1.5 % of the current approximately 15 % RES share in final energy consumption (see section 2.1.2). The overwhelming majority of biogas stations produce heat and electricity in cogeneration. In the Czech Republic, biomethane is currently being produced and injected into the gas network in a single facility (Rapotín biogas station). In connection with, inter alia, the objective of the RES share in the transport sector, measures are prepared (see section 3.1.2), which should partially motivate the transformation of part of existing biogas stations to biomethane stations or the creation of new biomethane stations in 20212030. This conversion should take place primarily at biogas stations with lower useful heat utilisation and near high-pressure gas pipelines, which should also have a positive impact on increasing the use of primary energy sources. The following chart shows the expected biogas production by existing, converted and new biogas production.

The existing gas system is expected to be used for the transport of biomethane to the place of consumption, taking into account the distance of existing biogas stations from the gas system, as to be realistically connectable. The Czech biomethane from agricultural raw materials is expected to be consumed mainly in the heating and cooling sectors. Chart 64: Expected biomethane production by source  Source: Prepared by MIT for the purposes of the National Plan The table below shows the expected final biogas consumption by sector. The reason for the decline in final consumption in the electricity sector, which is due to the projected conversion of part of the plants, is described in more detail above. It is expecwill be consumed in the transport sector (the table shows consumption without considering the multipliers).

Chapter 2.1.2 part (v) provides information on the expected consumption of biogas, or biomethane, as part of the sold heat. The above is only a summary of a fairly comprehensive analysis that is published in the supporting  Another gas that can be described as renewable when produced from renewable energy sources is hydrogen, which is currently mainly used in industrial production. Hydrogen produced from natural gas by pyrolysis or steam reformation in combination with carbon capture technologies is considered decarbonised gas and caHowever, the potential for using hydrogen in the context of a low-carbon economy is much broader. In particular in the gas sector, the possible injection of hydrogen into the gas infrastructure is being discussed in order to create a mixture that will be further transported to end consumers. However, hydrogen and natural gas have different chemical and physical properties, which results in some parts of the gas infrastructure not being fully prepared for transporting a gas with higher than current hydrogen content. Therefore, the expansion of hydrogen (and other gases from renewables) is subject to research into the behaviour of hydrogen in the infrastructure and the adaptation of the infrastructure needed for storage, transport, distribution and final consumption; this includes potential analysis of the extent to which this infrastructure will need to be modified. The regulatory and legislative frameworks will need to be adapted to further develop hydrogen
