3.2.  Dimension Energy efficiency Planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030 as well as other objectives referred to in point 2.2 in the Energy Union Regulation, including planned measures and instruments (also of a financial The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         nature) to promote the energy performance of buildings, in particular with regard to the following: i. Energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative policy measures under Articles 7a and 7b of Directive 2012/27/EU and to be prepared in accordance with Annex II Under Article 7(10) of Directive (EU) 2018/2002, Member States may achieve the required cumulative end-use energy savings by:  establishing an energy efficiency obligation scheme;  adopting alternative policy measures or  a combination of these. The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP IV) revealed that the introduction of an obligations scheme under Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU for Romania is not optimal because it does not comply with the requirements to enable the application of such scheme, more specifically compliance with the requirements of certification of achieved energy savings and the economic justification of the requirements. This is the reason why, in order to comply with in order to achieve the target under Article 7b.  In order to support Member States in this respect, the European Commission proposes, in its Recommendation C(2019) 6621 final, potential alternative policy measures that may be taken into account in order to meet the obligations in Directive (EU) 2018/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 amending Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, which Romania will consider. These measures and policies are detailed below and also presented in Annex III. ii. Long-term renovation strategy to support the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private37, including policies, measures and actions to stimulate cost-effective deep renovation and policies and actions to target the worst performing segments of the national building stock, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU, as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/844 The relevant policies and measures considered by Romania are described below and ordered by their interaction with other dimensions of the Plan: main vector in the trans-sectoral impact, secondary effect of measures pertaining to other dimensions and to the dimension concerned. Trans-sectoral policies and measures 1) Energy efficiency - main dimension Residential and tertiary sector The draft Long-term Renovation Strategy (LTRS), which is a binding requirement stipulated in the Directive on the energy performance of buildings, contributes to the achievement of the targets committed to by Romania in this Plan. Although the main benefits indicated in the strategy concern the energy efficiency dimension, the measures indicated therein also impacts other dimensions (Decarbonisation - renewable energy and GHG emissions and removals).                                                 37 In accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         The LTRS thus proposes a series of measures to turn the existing stock of buildings into an energy efficient low-carbon stock:  making an inventory of the stock of residential buildings and assessing the energy efficiency improvement potential, priority being given to buildings with the highest improvement potential and with the largest number of beneficiaries, in order to generate the highest impact;  creating, maintaining and updating a database listing the buildings in the national stock, with details pertaining to the type, renovation and modernisation work performed throughout the useful life, to the safety and structural integrity, energy consumption etc.;  thermally insulating the stock of buildings in the public administration sector, the residential blocks and single-family residences, educational establishments, public hospitals and commercial buildings;  implementing solutions to provide for the required heat comfort, at the same time using renewable energy sources (ventilation solutions, heat recovery units, heat pumps etc.) where the cost-benefit ratio is optimal;  supporting and developing prosumers;  training and upskilling programmes for key professions and matters in the renovation and rehabilitation of buildings (e.g. energy auditors) and introducing certification with regular renewal;  supporting and fostering research and development projects and demonstration projects related to new technologies and techniques of extended renovation;  introducing and applying restrictions to the sale or rental of buildings in the lower energy performance categories;  establishing performance standards for the renovation of envelope elements of buildings and of HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) systems.  According to the scenario recommended in the draft LTRS - Scenario 2, the main benefit regarding the energy efficiency dimension by 2030 will be the achievement of equivalent savings of 0.83 Mtoe. Moreover, in the decarbonisation dimension - GHG emissions and removals by reducing consumption of energy in the residential and tertiary sector (governmental buildings, public buildings, office buildings), the contribution to reduction of GHG emissions (effects cumulated in the period 2021-2030) amounts to 2.34 million tonnes of CO2.  The draft LTRS involves, in addition to renovation of buildings in order to increase energy efficiency, the adoption of RES technologies, such as installation of heat solar panels, photovoltaic panels and heat pumps, which will support the achievement of the RES-E and RES-H&C targets for 2030, ensuring the increase by over 0.2 Mtoe in the production of energy from renewable sources.   2) Energy efficiency - secondary dimension Energy efficiency in the residential and tertiary sectors is also influenced by other two main measures under the internal energy market dimension (see point 3.4.1):  Digitalisation of the Romanian energy system: smart monitoring systems (SMS) play contribution to the identification and prioritisation of their needs for implementation of energy efficiency measures. SMS also enable to significantly reduce commercial losses in distribution networks.  Implementation of the demand-response measures: this measure entails the implementation of dynamic prices (price increase concomitantly with demand increase and vice versa). The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         load peak hours towards no-load hours and/or reducing consumption at peak hours (without the concomitant increase of consumption at no-load hours). iii. Description of policy and measures to promote energy services in the public sector and measures to remove regulatory and non-regulatory barriers that impede the uptake of energy performance contracting and other energy efficiency service models38 In May 2018, the Energy Efficiency department (DEE) of ANRE initiated the consultation process at the working group level (GL ESCO) in order to disseminate certain aspects regarding the clarification of the legislative framework required for the operation of ESCO type companies in Romania by identifying the main legislative/administrative barriers to the application of the energy performance contract (EPC) in the public sector and establishing certain legal solutions to remove them39.  The barriers identified in the implementation of EPC, which have been debated by GL ESCO, were the following:  The legislative framework, including the public procurement rules  Low and fluctuating energy prices  Difficulty in accessing funding  Technical risks perceived as high risks  Overall mistrust based on the absence of standardisation (e.g. non-standardized measurements and checks)  Market and partnership related issues  Considering the international experience with the successful implementation of energy performance contracting, with public lighting as a priority, the high energy saving potential (>40 %) and the fact that the contributions of Administrative Territorial Units (ATUs) are not always necessary or they are low (<10 %), WG decided the initial approach to the EPC model for the rehabilitation of the public lighting systems and, based on the experience gained, the model energy performance contracting is to be extrapolated to public buildings. iv. Other planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030 as well as other objectives referred to in point 2.2 (for example measures to promote the exemplary role of public buildings and energy-efficient public procurement, measures to promote energy audits and energy management systems40, consumer information and training measures41, and other measures to promote energy efficiency42) The relevant policies and measures considered by Romania are described below and ordered by their interaction with other dimensions of the Plan: main vector in the trans-sectoral impact, secondary effect of measures pertaining to other dimensions and to the dimension concerned.  Trans-sectoral policies and measures 1) Energy efficiency - main dimension                                                 38 In accordance with Article 18 of Directive 2012/27/EU 39 Second National Round Table for funding energy efficiency in Romania (June 2019) 40 In accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2012/27/EU 41 In accordance with Articles 12 and 17 of Directive 2012/27/EU 42 In accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2012/27/EU The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         The industry sector The industrial sector is complex, including large energy consumer industries with high energy intensity (the metallurgical, construction materials, chemical industries), and small energy consumer industries, but with high energy intensities (food, beverages, tobacco, wood processing, paper manufacturing and paper products industries etc.). Having regard to the significant share in energy consumption by the industrial sector and to the wear and tear of used equipment, this sector has a significant potential of applying energy efficiency measures in the period 2021-2030. A series of large industrial consumers in Romania will continue to invest until 2024 in energy efficiency measures by virtue of their obligations following the energy audits conducted under Government Decision No 495/201443.  An increase in the share of energy from renewable sources is envisaged for the Decarbonisation - renewable energy dimension with the development of electricity production facilities by industrial consumers. Moreover, the reduction in energy consumption in the industrial sector will contribute to a reduction in the GHG emissions under the Decarbonisation - emissions and removals dimension. Transport sector  Against the background of previous effects, the main measures regarding energy efficiency increase in transport remain:   Against the background of previous effects, the main measures regarding energy efficiency increase in transport remain    Renewing the national vehicle stock by replacing the old passenger cars with high emission levels and high specific consumption rates national vehicle stock by providing grants in the form of a discarding bonus to purchase new less polluting motor vehicles in exchange for delivery of used motor vehicles for discarding purposes. The programme has undergone various changes to this date and the most significant -tickets of RON 45 000 are granted under this programme for the purchase of a new electric vehicle and RON 20 000 for the purchase of a new electrical hybrid vehicle with external supply source.  Developing and promoting alternative mobility This measure considers fostering alternative forms of transport (cycling, car-pooling, car-sharing etc.) by urban planning and developing an adequate cycling infrastructure (bicycle tracks, special compartments for bicycles in the underground and in trains etc.) and extending the pedestrian walkways, especially in large conurbations. These two main energy efficiency measures in the transport sector also bring about considerable benefits to the Decarbonisation - GHG emissions and removals dimension. A significant reduction in GHG emissions is achieved by developing and promoting alternative                                                 43 Establishing a State aid scheme for exempting certain categories of final consumers from the application of Law No 220/2008 establishing a system to promote production of energy from renewable sources The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         mobility methods (mopeds and bicycles, scooters etc.) and by maintaining a vehicle stock with modern vehicles. Motor vehicles should be equipped with efficient engines (complying with the Euro 6 emissions standard) or hybrid propulsion, electrical or natural gas-fired (CNG/LNG) vehicles. In addition, the possibility of prohibiting registration of motor vehicles under the Euro 3 and Euro 4 emissions standards would contribute to an improvement in air quality. 2) Energy efficiency - secondary dimension The industry sector Energy efficiency in the industrial sector is also influenced by other main policies and measures under other dimensions:  Implementing the best available technologies (BAT) in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to increase energy efficiency in the industrial sector The best available techniques will be adopted in the industrial sector in order to reduce energy intensity and the level of emissions concomitantly in the industrial sectors regulated by the EU ETS (see point 3.1.1. GHG Emissions and Removals)  The promotion of transition to circular economy (recycling) contributes to achieving the energy efficiency target by reducing consumption of energy used in the industry in the processing of raw materials (see point 3.1.1. GHG Emissions and Removals)  The Decarbonisation Plan proposed by CE Oltenia entails energy efficiency improvement works to units that will remain in operation until 2030 by upgrading the automated distributed control system, the mills and the coal dust preparation system and by improving the performances of the steam turbine (see 3.3.i. Energy Security Dimension)  Adopting advanced technologies in the energy sector In order to maximise the effects, the implementation of the storage solutions will be completed by the quantification of smart meters, thus contributing to optimised energy consumption (see point 3.5.i. Research, innovation and competitiveness) Transport sector  Energy efficiency in the transport sector is also influenced by the promotion of electromobility in road transport (light vehicles and urban public transport), which has a significant impact in the sense of an increase in energy efficiency, considering the lower consumption of energy with electric vehicles, this measure being also described under the Decarbonisation - GHG Emissions and Removals dimension. (see point 3.1.1 GHG Emissions and Removals) Reduction in the energy poverty rate and protection of vulnerable consumer In order to establish prioritisation to generate the maximum benefits, considering the limited time and resources (reduction in final consumption, with a positive impact on energy costs), the policy regulating and defining the vulnerable consumer and its funding method, which is the main policy under the Internal Energy Market dimension, also plays a significant role in the achievement of energy efficiency. (see point 3.4.4 Internal Energy Market) Other policies/measures pertaining to the dimension Other policies and measures proposed for each sector in the economy, which will contribute to the achievement of the energy efficiency target, are listed below:  Increasing public information and awareness of the impact of climate change and of energy efficiency, and adapting to them by introducing courses in the educational curricula, which are designed to ensure the understanding of climate change, energy savings and related activities The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          Combining the outlooks of NGOs and of other government and private entities regarding the future of progress in energy efficiency, with focus on the visible policies and measures, increasing the importance of the individual role in the transition in the energy sector, including the role of government leaders and leaders of private organisations, and the role of individual consumers  Providing more reliable and more transparent measurements on energy savings, together with asset labelling mechanisms, so as to further contribute to the increase in the energy efficiency funding rate  Strengthening efforts to increase the sustainable crediting branch, enabling bank offers, including mortgage loans, for energy efficiency  Preparing regulations to consider the improvement in the flexibility of energy efficiency measures (flexefficiency)  The industry sector The following measures are also provided for in the industrial sector to achieve the energy efficiency target:  Measures to incentivise relevant economic operators conducting energy audits and implementing the resulting measures, which maintain and improve an energy management system (EnMS) in accordance with the SR EN ISO 50001 standard   Minimum performance standards and regulations for industrial processes, where they are lacking  Digitalisation of industrial processes for large energy consumers  The transport sector The measures for energy efficiency increase in transport will count:  Developing the alternative fuels infrastructure  Projects for upgrading railways  Developing sustainable and climate change resilient, smart, secure and intermodal TEN-T rail transport networks   Developing smart digital systems for road and rail traffic management as well as for urban transport management  Upgrading ports and locks, improving the safety of waterborne transport by purchasing multifunctional technical ships and specific equipment  Optimising and reducing energy consumption in transport by supporting the development of multimodal transport (including TEN-T), national inland waterways and ports  Increasing the public transport usage rate by optimising public means of transport (buses, trolleybuses, tramways) and the necessary infrastructure for their good operation  Purchasing energy efficient electrical metro trains, with the possibility of recovering energy on braking (e.g. Metrorex plans to purchase 77 electrical metro trains in the period 2021-2030)  The modernisation of electrical locomotives of 5 100 kW by using alternative current transmission will enable to use electrical regenerative braking (on braking, the locomotive enters the generator mode with injection of the electricity thus generated into the National Energy System) Tertiary sector   Using energy efficiency criteria on public procurement  Energy-auditing programme for SMEs The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          Introducing digital platforms or performing systems to monitor, to assess and to control energy consumption, in particular for non-residential buildings Reduction in the energy poverty rate and protection of vulnerable consumer  Developing public heat insulation programmes for buildings in communities affected by energy poverty in order to reduce energy losses and heat costs  Training and education programmes, including energy advisory programmes Also see point 3.4.4. v. Where applicable, a description of policies and measures to promote the role of local renewable energy communities in contributing to the implementation of policies and measures in points i, ii, iii and iv Currently not applicable. vi. Description of measures to develop measures to utilise energy efficiency potentials of gas and electricity infrastructure44  Reducing losses in the electricity distribution networks  Smart medium and low voltage energy distribution systems (including smart networks and ICT systems) and related storage. vii. Regional cooperation in this area, where applicable ANRE has participated as a co-beneficiary in the ENSMOV project (Enhancing the Implementation and Monitoring and Verification practices of Energy Saving Policies under Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive - https: //ensmov.eu/) and another competent institution is to join the 14 European organisations under this project. The project is funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 Programme and seeks to provide support to Member States and stakeholders for the implementation of energy efficiency policies. More specifically, in the following three years, it will help Member States monitor, revise, improve and implement the energy efficiency policies by developing the existing resources (projects), with focus on the practical and strategic aspects arising from Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED). The project is coordinated by the Institute For European Energy And Climate Policy (IEECP) and will be implemented in the period June 2019-May 2022 (36 months). The main objectives of the ENSMOV project are:  to facilitate and to extend knowledge and experience exchange among Member States (MS) for the implementation of the policies provided for by Article 7 of EED;  to develop a series of resources and instruments adapted for the implementation of Article 7 of EED in order to respond to the specific needs of Member States;  to assist the national authorities in the implementation of internal monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems in order to ensure sound data and information which enables to (re)design policies towards 2030.                                                 44 In accordance with Article 15(2) of Directive 2012/27/EU The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         viii. Financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds, in the area at national level The National Energy Efficiency Fund is planned to be created as a single publicly administered fund for financing investments in energy efficiency improvement measures, this measure and good practice also being adopted in other European countries. Moreover, the need to centralise the various financing mechanisms for energy efficiency measures has also been identified in the Long-term Renovation Strategy by the consultants of the World Bank. The centralisation of the public financing mechanisms for energy efficiency investments in a single mechanism will simplify, facilitate and speed up the fund accessing process, will enable better tracking of the implementation of funded projects and will facilitate the assessment of the effects produced through scale savings to be achieved.  It will be supplied with private funds, structural funds and possibly funds from the State budget. Moreover, financing from funds obtained under the GHG emissions taxation mechanisms will also be envisaged. As regards the supply of this fund, see Chapter 5.3.i. (point 6  State Budget). The possibility of promoting financing instruments that ensure a counter-guarantee for the loans or subsidisation of interests in loans granted to legal and natural persons supporting energy efficiency measures (Green Mortgages/Green Loans) is also under consideration. The granted loans could thus target mainly investments in energy efficiency, the technologies producing energy from renewable sources, and the implementation of measures protecting the environment. The puhouses, as certified by the Romanian Council for Green Buildings (Consiliul Român pentru  - RoGBC) are also targeted. Such investments will bring benefits such as: significant savings by lower costs paid for energy and repairs; high quality of buildings, high its value for a longer time compared to a non-certified home; a preferential interest compared to the standard real estate loan. In order to fund energy efficiency projects, the financing sources detailed in point 5.3.i will be considered. 3.3.  Dimension energy security45 i.
