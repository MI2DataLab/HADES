3.1. Dimension Decarbonisation  3.1.1. GHG emissions and removals  i. Policies and measures to achieve the target set under Regulation [ESR] as referred in sub-chapter 2.1.1 and policies and measures to comply with Regulation [LULUCF], covering all key sectors  As mentioned in section 1.1.3, one of the strategic targets of NECP is to outline a pathway to reduce national emissions of GHG in order to achieve the target of carbon neutrality by 2050 and to promote the mainstreaming of mitigation aims in sector policies. The scenarios analysed under RCN2050 confirmed the potential to reduce GHG emissions in all sectors of the national economy. Also identified are the viability and good cost effectiveness of energy efficiency options and penetration of renewable energies, thus contributing to compliance with climate policy objectives. Modelling demonstrated cost-effective trajectories and guidelines for sector policies - action strategies - contributing to objectives for GHG emission reduction, renewable energies and energy efficiency. To decarbonise the economy and achieve the targets that have been set at a national level to reduce GHG emissions by 2020 (-18% to -23%, as compared to 2005) and by 2030 (-45% to -55%, as compared to 2005), it is necessary to act in all sectors of activity, namely, energy, residential and services sectors, industry, transport and mobility, waste and wastewater, agriculture and forestry and other land uses. It is also necessary to act in a transversal manner to promote green taxation, develop a more circular economy and ensure the sustainability of the territory and cities. Public administration also plays an important role in leading the way toward decarbonisation, while the role of research and innovation is equally essential. AIM Target which Portugal seeks to achieve and which determines the strategy to be implemented for this purpose ACTION STRATEGY Main policy objective associated with the national axes/objectives assumed for the 2030 horizon MEASURE  Specific action which contributes directly to achieving the established targets and objectives 54 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3. Policies and measures planned   Decarbonising the national economy is a transversal objective, toward which the different targets that have been set out all contribute, namely, the targets concerning energy efficiency, renewables, mobility and transport, agriculture and forestry and industry.  ACTION STRATEGY 1.1 PROMOTING THE DECARBONISATION OF THE ELECTRICITY GENERATION SECTOR DESCRIPTION Promote the sector-generated electricity in mainland Portugal and promote the phasing out of electricity generation from fuel oil and diesel in the Autonomous Regions. SECTOR(S) Energy, Buildings ACTION MEASURES To promote the decarbonisation of the electricity generation sector, the following measures are planned, in addition to the action measures set out in Target 3  REINFORCE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND REDUCE ENERGY DEPENDENCE:   1.1.1. Cease coal-based electricity generation  The gradual reduction in the use of fossil fuels to produce electricity, particularly coal, is essential to guarantee an energy transition and a carbon neutral society. Thus, in 2016 Portugal committed to stop producing electricity from coal by 2030 at the latest, and is a member of the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA), a global alliance of national and sub-national governments, companies and organisations working to promote the transition from coal-generated energy. This transition is opportune and necessary to meet the international commitments established by the Paris Agreement.  With this goal in mind, and considering factors that strongly discourage generating electricity from coal, such as the rise in the price of CO2 emission licences, the end of ISP exemptions and higher prices for coal, as well as studies to ensure the security of supplies that have been prepared, the thermal power plant in Pego is scheduled to be closed in 2021 and the thermal power plant in Sines will be closed in 2023. The necessary technical assessments will be carried out which take into consideration the evolution of the electricity network and electricity-generating facilities to assess the impact and identify possible mitigation measures for the NES.  To ensure fair transition, this process will be monitored by a multidisciplinary group created for the purpose, with representatives from the energy, environmental, economy, employment and other relevant sectors. It will assess energy issues (e.g. security of supplies), local matters (e.g. local development), social issues (e.g. employment, retraining) and environmental questions. A study will be prepared to ascertain the need for professional retraining for workers. [Expected date: 2019-2023]   1.1.2. Assess the conversion of coal-fired power plants to renewable sources  Alternative solutions may be introduced to mitigate the effects of the closure of these two coal-fired power plants, such as recycling and reusing the equipment of these power plants to produce electricity from renewable sources.    Two possibilities will be studied and assessed to recycle and reuse this equipment: (i) installation of thermoelectric solar capacity with storage to produce renewable steam, to substitute coal, which can directly feed the existing turbines in the power plants; (ii) direct use of green hydrogen as a fuel to substitute coal to feed the power plants. [Expected date: 2020-2021]   1.1.3. Promote the phasing out of electricity generation from fuel oil and diesel in the Autonomous Regions  The autonomous regions have implemented an energy policy aligned with national and international guidelines and commitments in this regard, being equally committed to decarbonising the economy and electricity generation. This is reflected in the promotion of sources of renewable energy with a view to reducing GHG emissions and imports of fossil fuels. 55 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3. Policies and measures planned    In the case of the electricity sector, decarbonisation requires substituting the thermal power plants that use fuel oil or diesel with renewable energy, complemented by solutions that ensure the security and quality of the supply.

SECTOR(S) Energy; Industry ACTION MEASURES The following action measures are planned to implement the ETS system, in addition to its implementation at a national level:   1.2.1. Promote a strategy to exclude installations under the ETS 2021-2025 system  Establish a procedure at a national level for the possible exclusion of facilities emitting less than 25 000 tCO2eq from the ETS system provided that they are subject to measures that enable an equivalent reduction of emissions, and possibly exclude facilities emitting less than 2 500 tCO2eq (without being subject to equivalent measures). [Expected date: 2020]   1.2.2. Establish the legislative framework for a mechanism for indirect cost compensation in ETS  Establish rules concerning state aid for ETS, adopting special and temporary measures in favour of sectors and sub-sectors exposed to a significant risk of fugitive carbon, meeting the costs related with GHG emissions that are reflected in the price of electricity.

Improve the energy and water efficiency of buildings and reduce energy needs, including energy incorporated into the construction itself, and promote the use of renewable sources of energy. [Expected date: 2020-2030]  1.3.3. Promote the electrification of buildings accompanied by an increased use of renewables The electrification of final consumption has been identified as one of the most important factors for decarbonising the economy as it is associated with the growing incorporation of renewable sources for generation. Thus, new buildings must favour adopting renewable sources of energy, promoting the substitution of fossil fuels in buildings.

The remuneration of ecosystem services aims to promote the biodiversity of territories, reflecting a transformation in the way land is used. This is a shift from a model of short-term profitability to a model were returns require a long-term frame but ensure greater value and promote the resilience of the land.  This type of mechanism will continue to be promoted, as it aims to compensate contributions that are not valued by the market, including contributing toward preventing erosion, carbon sequestration, regulating the water cycle, conservation of biodiversity, reduction in susceptibility to fire and improving the quality of the landscape.

Renewable energy  Portugal aims to transition from fossil fuels to new forms of energy production and consumption, moving toward renewable potential, part of which has yet to be explored, as in the case of solar energy, while simultaneously adopting more stringent consumption patterns and focusing on new and emerging clean technologies. i. Policies and measures to achieve the national contribution to the binding EU-level 2030 target for renewable energy sources  ACTION STRATEGY 3.1. ACCELERATE THE PRODUCTION OF ENERGY FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES, WITH GREATER FOCUS ON RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES DESCRIPTION The contribution of endogenous renewable sources of energy to generate electricity has been developed significantly over the generated wealth, employment and economic development. However, Portugal has vast potential to produce clean energy from renewable resources, which have mostly yet to be explored, particularly in relation to solar power. It is thus important to reinforce and review current mechanisms to promote renewables so as to ensure compliance with the goals for 2030. Achieving 80% of renewable sources of energy in the electricity sector requires doubling the installed renewable capacity in the 2021-2030 horizon. SECTOR(S) Energy; Industry ACTION MEASURES To accelerate the production of energy from renewable energy sources, the following action measures are planned:  3.1.1 Promote the development of new renewable capacity, namely by implementing a system of auctions to allocate injection capacity in the electricity network In a scenario of a high demand for production licences and a shortage of network reception capacity, auctions are the best way of responding to this demand and accelerating investments in new capacity, giving priority to projects with lower costs and greater guarantees for execution. This enables a better coordination of the process of issuing licences and investments in new network capacity. This logic of implementing a system of auctions offers a set of advantages, namely: (i) limiting the risk of investors (ii) economic efficiency, (iii) achieving energy policy objectives.  compliance with the goals set out in NECP and without an onerous burden on consumers. The frequency, number of auctions to be held each year, the format and the technology or technologies that are the subject of each auction will be defined annually, considering the objectives of the evolution of the installed capacity to comply with the goals set out in NECP and the evolution of transmission and distribution networks. 68 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3. Policies and measures planned   The auction(s) will be announced with sufficient notice to ensure greater predictability for potential bidders.  In addition to attributing a reserve through auctions, new licences to generate electricity from renewable sources will also be  issued in the following ways: (i) if there is network capacity, by issuing reservations of network injection capacity, issued by the operator of the public service electricity network (PSEN);  or  (ii)  by means of an agreement between the applicant and the PSEN whereby the applicant assumes the financial burden of building or reinforcing the network as necessary to receive the energy produced by the electricity generator. [Expected date: 2019-2030]  The implementation of such systems provides greater flexibility and better use of resources since it allows complementarity between forms of energy and, consequently, the possibility of minimising production costs. Moreover, it makes it possible to maximise network connection capacity by reinforcing capacity without additional investments in the network. A suitable legal framework will be created to develop and implement this type of solution, along with technical criteria applicable for such systems, which will provide the necessary impetus to implement these solutions. [Expected date: 2019-2020]   3.1.3. Promote increased wind power generation, namely through new equipment and repowering  Portugal also has great potential in relation to wind energy. It is important to provide the necessary conditions for existing wind farms to become more competitive.  New equipment is a rational path that should not continue to be wasted. The new capacity will be installed in existing power plants, where the essence of the environmental impact has already been identified and where it is possible to use surplus network capacity.  In terms of repowering, just like new equipment, the sites of power plants with environmental impact have already been identified. It will also play an important role, since it makes it possible to provide current wind farms with more efficient equipment as they reach the end of their useful life. It is necessary to create favourable conditions and a regulatory framework to implement this solution. [Expected date: 2019- 2021]  3.1.4. Promote renewable cogeneration and gradually reduce incentives for fossil fuel cogeneration  Cogeneration plays a very important role in energy efficiency and reducing GHG emissions, as it is one of the most efficient solutions for generating energy (electricity, heating and cooling). Moreover, the fact that cogeneration facilities are close to energy consumption points is also reflected in lower losses and a lesser need to invest in infrastructure. It is thus important to promote the implementation of the cogeneration system based on renewable sources of energy as well as to convert existing plants from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy, making use of endogenous resources. [Expected date: 2020-2025]   3.1.5. Promote oceanic renewable energies  Oceanic renewable energy has the potential to ensure the development of competitive industries in Portugal, which export high value added products and services to an increasingly global market, thus promoting the development of a value chain. Portugal has significant potential for oceanic renewable energies that are worth exploring and also has the potential to create a new export chain for these new energy technologies. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   3.1.6. Promote the production of electricity from geothermal sources  The Autonomous Region of the Azores has vast geothermal resources with high enthalpy used to generate electricity. It will continue to develop this resource to achieve the maximum productivity possible with available resources. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   3.1.7.

PROMOTE THE DISSEMINATION OF DISTRIBUTED PRODUCTION AND SELF-GENERATION OF ENERGY AND ENERGY COMMUNITIES DESCRIPTION Promote the dissemination of distributed production, i.e. production at the same site as consumption or very close to it. This reduces costs related to transmission and distribution networks, reduces losses and optimises production of electricity solutions. SECTOR(S) Energy; Residential; Industry; Services; Agriculture ACTION MEASURES The following action measures are planned to promote greater dissemination of distributed production and energy self-generation and energy communities:  3.2.1. Promote distributed production and self-generation of energy from renewable sources, removing obstacles for their dissemination There is a need to provide incentives for the distributed production of energy, particularly in relation to local production of electricity using solar energy. This will play a fundamental role in reinforcing consumers as active agents and promoting energy communities. It will have an impact on the need to reinforce networks and the centralised production of energy while simultaneously promoting the emergence of new markets and technological solutions. [Expected date: 2019-2030]   3.2.2. Promote the creation and development of energy communities  Energy communities will play a fundamental role in promoting social innovation, capacity-building among citizens in relation to the energy sector and its problems and local social and economic development. They will also simultaneously contribute significantly toward mitigating the problem of energy poverty.  After Decree-Law No 162/2019 of 25 October 2019 was published, which set out the legal framework for renewable energy communities, partially transposing Directive 2018/2001, to implement this legal framework energy communities must be promoted along with a programme to disseminate information and support the creation of such communities. This seeks to reduce information asymmetries and support municipalities and citizens while developing energy communities. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   3.2.3. Promote programmes to support the establishment of energy communities in partnership with municipalities  This measure aims to provide support both technically as well as with regard to obtaining funding, to establish projects for energy communities at a municipal level. This support will be provided through public entities qualified for the purpose in partnership with local partners. Energy communities are expected to be established in the short-term, with special emphasis on municipalities in interior regions and those that have a greater proportion of consumers living in energy poverty.

Policies and measures planned    ACTION MEASURES The following action measures are planned to optimise and simplify the licensing process associated with renewable energy power plants:   3.4.1. Revise and optimise the current legal framework governing the organisation and functioning of the national electricity system  Among other relevant aspects, revising the current legal framework governing the organisation and functioning of the national electricity system aims to introduce improvements and simplify the system for issuing licences to produce energy and promote competitive procedures as a means of managing the shortage of reception capacity in the PSEN. This will ensure that allocating network injection capacity will benefit consumers.  Considering the complexity of the current legislative framework for this sector, it is equally important to carry out a general revision to simplify and clarify this framework and to reduce the number of laws, contributing toward greater clarity and efficiency while implementing new projects. [Expected date: 2019  2021]   3.4.2. Implement a One-Stop-Shop for licensing  Implementing a one-stop-shop will make it possible to streamline licensing procedures for energy production projects, reduce licensing time frames and provide straightforward information to promoters and citizens. The central figure for implementing -actively manage the licensing process; (iii) disseminate information on the process to interested parties; (iv) identify, manage and mitigate the risks associated with the process; (v) ensure interoperability with other existing licensing platforms (e.g. One-Stop-Shop Environmental Licensing).  An electronic platform will be created to support the one-stop-shop for licensing, which will facilitate licensing procedures and the respective information. This platform will bring together and provide simple and practical information on the licensing process for projects to generate electricity, including information on the evolution of the process. This will promote closer interaction between market agents and the institutions involved in the licensing process, contributing toward reducing costs.

FOSTER THE IMPROVED USE OF BIOMASS FOR ENERGY PURPOSES DESCRIPTION Considering the importance of the forestry sector and the associated value chain for the national economy, as well as the problem and economic and social dimension of rural fires it is essential to implement energy use solutions that make it possible to manage rural spaces by removing combustible content, along with developing and improving forestry planning and management systems. This is feasible using a solution or set of solutions that make it possible to justify and generate a return from such interventions, creating a veritable business model that is locally implanted and managed, associated with the creation of a national market for biomass or, at least, self-sustaining regional markets. SECTOR(S) Energy; Forestry; Agriculture ACTION MEASURES To foster the improved use of biomass for energy purposes, the following action measures are planned:   3.7.1. Promote biomass-based energy generation on a local scale  Promote and support the installation of smaller-sized, decentralised thermal power plants, which do not place great pressure in terms of the availability of biomass and the energy system, promoting the substitution of fossil fuels and decarbonising consumption in various sectors. This solution can be combined with other solutions with variable dimensions and using other kinds of combustible raw materials, but always with the triple objective of contributing toward reducing the combustible material in forestry spaces, using energy efficient solutions and minimising the burden on the National Electricity System.  This action will be developed on the basis of the results of a study on establishing a network of small power plants to make use of biomass. This study will be developed over a set of phases, which will involve various actors from the local and central state administration, research centres and private parties interested in contributing towards solving this problem. The final objective is to develop and launch concrete projects, with a minimum of four concept projects.

PROMOTE INFORMATION FOR CONSUMERS AND COMPANIES, CONTRIBUTING TOWARD BETTER ENERGY LITERACY AND SIMPLIFYING INTERACTION WITH THE MARKET DESCRIPTION The energy sector and climate issues are complex and often communicate in a language that is not understood by everyone. As a result, citizens are often unaware of the available options. This is why it is important to promote energy literacy for consumers by means of more transparent information and greater dissemination of knowledge on energy and climate. This will enable citizens to make more informed choices and promote more and better information for consumers, contributing toward transparency and competition in the energy market. A more informed consumer represents better, more efficient and sustainable choices and a consumer at the centre of decision making is a more active consumer in energy transition, and one that is available to participate in the structural changes required to meet this challenge.  SECTOR(S) Civil society; Companies ACTION MEASURES The following action measures are planned to promote information for consumers and companies, contributing toward a better energy literacy and simplifying interaction with the market:   8.4.1. Promote more and better local services for consumers  Electronic services and platforms do not reach all consumers, particularly those who are more vulnerable and those who have (citizens bureau) and similar structures. [Expected date: 2020-2030]  8.4.2. Promote the simplification and uniformity of energy bills by defining the minimum requirements in terms of content and structure A clearer and simpler energy bill contributes significantly toward improving consumer understanding of the price structure of various energy products, enabling consumers to adopt more efficient behaviour to reduce their energy bill. [Expected date: 2019-2030]   8.4.3. Support and develop new platforms to promote energy literacy  Disseminate the current platforms and promote the appearance of new and better platforms that use new information technology to take significant steps in terms of communicating with the public, maximising the growing awareness and desire of citizens to use new technologies. Examples of such platforms include the Information Centre for Energy (CINERGIA)  and the Energy Observatory. [Expected date: 2020-2030] 76 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3.

Policies and measures to achieve other national targets  These elements have been identified, when relevant, in the respective chapters and sub-chapters.   iii. Policies and measures to achieve low emission mobility (including electrification of transport)  The path toward energy transition and carbon neutrality undoubtedly involves the transport sector, aiming to completely decarbonise the road and railway sectors in the medium and long-term. Improving efficiency while using resources also encompasses mobility. To this end, it is necessary to encourage shared means of transport and the use of less polluting vehicles. It is also essential to make public transport more attractive, offering comfort, quality, speed and integrated and easy access, favouring intermodal connections and, whenever possible, in conjunction with soft transport measures.77 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3. Policies and measures planned    ACTION STRATEGY 5.1. PROMOTE MODAL TRANSFERS FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT DESCRIPTION Making public transport more attractive and favouring modal transfers will make it possible to reduce urban congestion and achieve more efficient and clean mobility, affording greater comfort, speed and quality of life with lesser energy consumption. The objective is to provide citizens with a more comfortable, high-quality public transport service that is quicker and offers easy access, thus contributing toward fomenting social cohesion and maximising accessibility for all citizens. The aim is to promote modal transfers by improving supply and access to public transport; reducing dependence on individual forms of transport for everyday journeys. SECTOR(S) Transport ACTION MEASURES The following action measures are planned to promote modal transfers:   5.1.1. Tariff Reduction Support Programme  Promote and maintain the tariff reduction support programme (PART), contributing toward reducing costs associated with collective public transport, thus increasing its accessibility. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   5.1.2. Expand public transport networks and equipment throughout Portugal  Promote the extension of the high-capacity collective public transport network and maintain the dynamic of continuing to expand these systems. Of note among the scheduled projects is the expansion of the metro systems in Lisbon and Porto. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   5.1.3. Actions to promote multimodal intercity public transport  Improve the quality of service, tariff integration, intermodal transfers and information for the public, with a view to increasing the share of public transport among different modes of transport. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   5.1.4. Implementation of an integrated information and ticketing system  Implement integrated information and ticketing solutions in the Autonomous Region of Madeira for public transport and complementary services, based on new real-time information technologies and electronic forms of payment, specifically adapted for the resident population, young people and tourists.

STIMULATE THE ENERGY TRANSITION OF THE TRANSPORT SECTOR DESCRIPTION Achieving the decarbonisation of the transport sector is crucial to achieving the energy and climate targets for the 2030 and 2050 horizons, as Portugal has defined a goal of 20% of energy share from renewable sources of energy in the transport sector as early as the next decade. The aim is to ensure effective energy transition and energy efficiency gains in all transport sectors, guaranteeing the use of clean energies, such as electricity, advanced biofuels and hydrogen. SECTOR(S) Transport; Energy 78 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3. Policies and measures planned   ACTION MEASURES To stimulate energy transition in the transport sector, the following action measures are planned:   5.2.1. Renew bus fleets  The fleet of buses circulating in Portugal has an estimated average age of 16 years old, contributing significantly toward increased GHG emissions and, more particularly, the degradation of air quality in urban areas. It is thus important to continue to encourage the renovation of fleets by co-on to electricity and hydrogen. [Expected date: 2020-2030]  Pursuant to Regulation (EC) 1370/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 on public passenger transport services by rail and by road, all collective passenger public transport services in national territory must be associated with a contract to provide concessions for services issued by transport authorities to operators. It is important for the contracting process to include environmental performance criteria for the vehicle fleet, in keeping with Community guidelines, particularly Directive (EU) 2019/1161 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019, amending Directive 2009/33/EC on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles, which sets out minimum targets for each Member State with regard to public contracting for a percentage of non-polluting light and passenger vehicles. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   5.2.3. Improve passenger rail transport  Improve the frequency and quality of passenger rail services to increase the use of this means of transport in place of individual transport, by investing in new rolling stock. [Expected date: 2020- 2030   5.2.4. Renew the passenger ferry fleet  The passenger ferry fleet operating in Portugal is relatively old. It is thus important to encourage the use of ships and vessels powered by clean alternative fuels for transport and other maritime activities, with emphasis on the electrification of short distance fluvial passenger transport. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   5.2.5. Promote the use of renewable sources of energy in transport fleets  By revising the Regulations for Managing Energy Consumption in the Transport Sector, include benefits for using renewable fuels in fleets, thus encouraging companies to incorporate renewable sources of energy into their fleets. [Expected date: 2020-2030]  Hydrogen has the potential to play a very important role in decarbonising railway transport, as an alternative to the electrification of lines, avoiding costs and reducing the environmental impact of such operations. To this end, it is important to study the potential for converting diesel equipment to hydrogen on a national scale, followed by the implementation of a pilot-project. [Expected date: 2020-2025]   5.2.7. Revise the Transport Energy Efficiency Regulations  The Transport Sector Energy Consumption Management Regulations (RGCEST) are used in the transport sector. These regulations aim to improve energy efficiency in the transport sector and apply to both transport companies as well as companies that have their own energy intensive fleets, and establish goals to progressively reduce specific energy consumption. Considering the role and dimension of the sector, there is clear opportunity to create new requirements and goals for transport companies and companies that have their own energy intensive fleets. This will ensure the harmonisation of different legal instruments in force as well as update and promote the use of legislation for energy consumption in the sector. [Expected date: 2020-2021]  5.2.8. Introduce cleaner forms of energy for the ferry between Madeira and Porto Santo  Renovate the passenger and vehicle ferry between Madeira and Porto Santo, introducing cleaner and more efficient forms of energy.

PROMOTE AND SUPPORT ELECTRIC MOBILITY DESCRIPTION Electric mobility is a decisive factor to ensure the gradual substitution of fossil fuels in road transport with renewable electricity, contributing to GHG emissions reduction. It is therefore important to promote and support electric mobility, by encouraging the introduction of electric vehicles and reinforcing the charging infrastructure. SECTOR(S) Transport; Services ACTION MEASURES To promote and support electric mobility, the following action measures are planned:   5.3.1. Establish a new model for electric mobility  Portugal has an innovative model to manage the electric vehicle charging network, which has significant benefits for consumers. The network has complete interoperability among different electric power retailers thus increasing the efficiency and availability of the charging network. This model is already implemented for part of the network, namely, for fast charging outlets, and it is essential to expand this to the entire public access active network. [Expected date: 2020-2025]   5.3.2. Foment efficient electric mobility in Madeira and Porto Santo  Renew the public transport fleets, taxi fleet, logistics services fleets and other transport fleets, as well as private vehicles, promoting transition to efficient electric mobility though financial and tax incentives, among other measures.  In Porto Santo, incentives are being offered as part of the Sustainable Porto Santo  Smart Fossil Free Island initiative to acquire electric vehicles, offered by the Regional Government. This scheme will later be extended to the island of Madeira. [Expected date: 2019-2030]  5.3.3. Maintain and promote incentives to acquire 100% electric light vehicles, as well as the existing framework of tax incentives Since 2015 Portugal has had a number of highly competitive incentives for acquiring electric vehicles, with an acquisition subsidy of EUR 2 250, as well as tax exemptions for vehicles, supplementary taxation on vehicles and road tax. Provided that the cost of acquiring an electric vehicle is significantly higher than a comparable traditional combustion vehicle, it is necessary to guarantee and even expand the existing framework of incentives. [Expected date: 2020-2025]   5.3.4. Promote electric vehicles for urban micro-logistics  Urban micro-vehicles, quadricycles and e-bikes. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   5.3.5. Promote two-wheel electric vehicles  Despite the considerable potential to convert two-wheel vehicles into electric vehicles, the market for electric two-wheel vehicles is still nascent. It is thus important to promote the use of this segment of electric vehicles, financially or through positive discrimination measures. [Expected date: 2020-2025]   5.3.6. Promote the development of the public access charging network  The public access charging network must keep pace with the scale of the stock of electric vehicles in circulation in Portugal. Considering that sales of electric vehicles have increased exponentially between 2016 and 2019, it is important to ensure that the charging network expands to maintain the ratio between vehicles and charging points.  80 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3. Policies and measures planned    Among the initiatives to reinforce the charging network the following aspects are worthy of note: (i) adopting criteria to make it compulsory to install charging points, namely in residential and commercial areas; (ii) make it compulsory to install charging points for electric vehicles in public access infrastructure [Expected date: 2020- 2025]   5.3.7. Promote the implementation of charging points for electric vehicles in private buildings  Create the technical and regulatory conditions, as well as suitable incentives, to expand the electric vehicle charging network in private buildings. [Expected date: 2020-2025]   5.3.8. Promote the smart charging of electric vehicles with bidirectional energy flows  Create the legal framework for the smart charging of electric vehicles and the use of features that allow bidirectional energy flows with system seto contribute toward the security of the electricity supply system and increase the penetration of renewable sources of energy on such remote islands. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   5.3.9. Promote the charging of electric buses  Create a charging network for electric buses, for night charging and complementary charging at terminals or parking areas, involving public transport and tourism services. This will help decarbonise the transport sector, minimise the impact on the electricity network and increase the penetration of renewable energy sources on the remote islands.

PROMOTE VEHICLE SHARING SERVICES DESCRIPTION In addition to promoting public transport, it is also important to encourage other formats of urban mobility, which make it possible to reduce the pressure on road traffic and reduce GHG emissions, promoting well-being and quality of life. Promote vehicle sharing services with focus on electric mobility and active mobility. SECTOR(S) Transport; Services ACTION MEASURES To promote vehicle sharing services, the following action measures are planned:   5.4.1. Promote shared mobility initiatives such as car sharing, bike sharing and carpooling   mpass cars, bicycles, motorcycles and, most recently, scooters. The use of these shared vehicle systems results in reduced environmental impact and high energy efficiency, as well as a reduction in occupation of public space. [Expected date: 2020-2025]  5.4.2. Promote the adoption of tools to support mobility management and information technologies and systems to support mobility and communication The incorporation of new technologies and smart systems in managing mobility are essential tools to increase logistical efficiency, energy efficiency and environmental efficiency. Furthermore, in our current information society, the process of choosing a mode of transport is greatly conditioned by the availability of real-time information on the conditions of different transport options by integrating smart transport systems and passenger communication systems. [Expected date: 2020-2030] 81 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3. Policies and measures planned        The concept of mobility as a service consists of providing a service that makes it possible to get from Point A to Point B using the mode of transport that best suits the needs of the passenger and the characteristics of the intended journey. As an alternative to acquiring and owning a vehicle, a single mode of transport, mobility as a service makes it possible to use multiple modes of transport and choose that which that is most efficient for the respective journey.

PROMOTE THE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF ALTERNATIVE RENEWABLE FUELS DESCRIPTION Clean alternative fuels, particularly advanced biofuels and hydrogen, are an alternative and complementary solution to electric mobility for the 2030 and 2040 horizon, particularly for the heavy goods long haul freight road transport sector, passenger heavy transport, sea cargo sector and aviation sector, to ensure energy transition in these sectors. In the case of advanced biofuels, Portugal also has a significant biofuels industry and the necessary infrastructure. SECTOR(S) Transport; Energy; Industry; Waste; Agriculture ACTION MEASURES The following action measures are planned to promote the production and consumption of alternative renewable fuels:   5.5.1. Promote the production of advanced biofuels, using national endogenous resources  The national production of advanced biofuels will be achieved by using residual biomass or biomass with negligible economic value, the use of waste such as used cooking oils and other alternative endogenous resources.  The National Plan to Promote Bio-Refineries, approved by Council of Ministers Resolution No 163/2017 will be revised and implemented. This plan aims to reinforce the national use of renewable energy sources by the sustainable use of biomass as an alternative source of energy to fossil fuels, promoting the production of a variety of products, including advanced biofuels and the appearance of new value chains around biomass, in a bio-economy and a circular economy. [Expected date: 2020-2030]  To a large extent, this entails transposing the new Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) during 2020 and defining targets to incorporate advanced biofuels for the 2021-2030 decade. The process of transposing RED II must consider guaranteeing the exception to the 1.7% limit for raw materials set out in Part B of Annex IX. [Expected date: 2020-2021]   5.5.2. Phase-out conventional biofuels  Pursuant to the new Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) the share of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from food crops for human or animal consumption with a high risk of indirectly changing land use must gradually decrease until it reaches 0% by 31 December 2030. To achieve this goal, the necessary changes must be promoted to comply with this rule, promoting the use of advanced biofuels to substitute them. [Expected date: 2021-2030]   5.5.3. Promote richer mixes of bioenergy  82 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3. Policies and measures planned    Assess current legislation in relation to the quality of fuels, promoting the incorporation of greater percentages of biofuels, particularly with regard to professional diesel.

PROMOTE ALTERNATIVE FUEL SUPPLY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CLEAN FUELS DESCRIPTION The transport sector is a priority for defining the policies and measures aimed at promoting the decarbonisation of the economy and society, with significant potential for improvement in terms of diversification of sources of energy and energy efficiency. SECTOR(S) Transport; Energy; Waste ACTION MEASURES To promote alternative fuel supply infrastructure for clean fuels, the following action measures are planned:  5.6.1. Promote the installation of supply points for 100% renewable liquid and gaseous fuels for public transport and municipal service fleets The national strategy has included incorporating biofuels into conventional fuels, within the limits of their technical specifications and using the existing infrastructure for these conventional fuels. Focusing on local solutions to use advanced biofuels, biomethane and hydrogen and other renewable fuels, both in a pure state as well as at high concentrations in fossil fuels will include promoting the installation of 100% renewable liquid and gaseous fuels supply points for public transport and municipal service fleets. Preference will be given to locations close to the plants producing these renewable alternatives and projects associated with the use of residual biomass or biomass of little economic value. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   5.6.2. Promote and support the installation of green hydrogen supply points  considerable flexibility of use. It can even be used as a way of storing electricity produced from renewable sources. Using this synergy with the electricity generation system, this alternative fuel could play an important role in the decarbonisation of the transport sector, where the penetration of renewable energy is a challenge. Thus, it is essential to develop infrastructure to supply hydrogen in order to promote its consumption.  This network will be installed in phases, starting with pilot projects and trials, mainly associated with public transport fleets and logistics distribution, evolving into a network that ensures significant territorial coverage and enables the gradual penetration of hydrogen-powered mobility. [Expected date: 2020-2030]  5.6.3. Promote the development of an infrastructure to supply renewable sources of energy to ships in ports -nal use. This will make it possible to improve the air quality at these sites as well as contribute toward reducing GHG emissions, if the electricity is produced from renewable sources. [Expected date: 2020-2030] 83 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3. Policies and measures planned     5.6.4. Revise the National Action Framework to create infrastructure for alternative fuels  Directive 2014/94/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure established a common framework of measures and minimum requirements to install the said infrastructure at a European level. Member States were required to prepare national action frameworks with targets and goals to develop this infrastructure. Portugal approved its National Action Framework to deploy alternative fuels infrastructure by means of Council of Ministers Resolution No 88/2017, which needs to be updated in light of the targets set out in this plan and in RCN 2050.

PROMOTE ACTIVE MOBILITY AND MORE EFFICIENT BEHAVIOUR DESCRIPTION Promoting active mobility in place of individual motorised transport is a growing trend in developed societies, due to the excellent cost-benefit relationship and enormous advantages it offers in fundamental areas for the quality of life  even for people who are not (yet) engaging in active mobility. Promoting the use of bicycles, in particular, must be contemplated in an objective, systematic, transversal and ambitious manner. The progressive availability of e-bicycles makes it possible to expand and generalise the benefits derived from adopting active mobility in society and there are strong reasons to adopt new forms of mobility and improve the use of the transport system. Measures will thus be implemented to promote active mobility and more efficient behaviour, increasing the modal share of bicycle and pedestrian journeys. SECTOR(S) Transport; Cities  ACTION MEASURES To promote active mobility and more efficient behaviour, the following action measures are planned:   5.7.1. Implement the National Strategy for Active Mobility 2020-2030  Portugal has enormous potential for active mobility, which must be used and promoted for the common good. However, to achieve levels of success comparable to other European countries, it is essential to be creative and innovative while implementing policies, adapting international best practices to national and local contexts.  In 2030, any person in Portugal will be able to choose to walk or cycle for commutes. To achieve this aim, it will be necessary to mobilise a large number of different agents for this national project, which can contribute toward developing an active society, which values, supports and celebrates all forms of pedestrian and bicycle mobility: on road and off road, for everyday trips, recreational activities and sports. To ensure greater efficiency and effectiveness while using available resources, it is important to establish a result-oriented action plan centred on end users (pedestrians and cyclists) to maximise the return on investment.  The objectives of the National Strategy for Active Mobility (Estratégia Nacional para a Mobilidade Ativa - ENMA) are: (i) increase the modal share of bicycle journeys in Portugal; (ii) increase the modal share of bicycle journeys in cities; (iii) increase the active modal share (bicycle and pedestrian) in Portugal; (iv) increase the total extension of cycle tracks; (v) reduction of road accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   5.7.2. Cycle Portugal Programme 2030  The Cycle Portugal Programme 2030 is an incentive to expand infrastructure dedicated to the use of bicycles as a mode of transport that can play a relevant role as a sustainable solution to respond to many of the mobility needs of the urban population, both in the two large metropolitan areas in mainland Portugal as well as in suburbs and cities. 84 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3. Policies and measures planned    This programme envisages the construction of 1 000 km of cycle tracks by 2030 ensuring the expansion and upgrading of cycle and pedestrian networks, improving their connectivity. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   5.7.3. Increase incentives for active mobility  Maintain and increase the incentives to promote active mobility, bicycles and other light vehicles, namely, electric versions. [Expected date: 2020-2030]  5.7.4. Promote the use of bicycles and other active modes with a view to increasing the share of soft modes of transport Promote the adoption of behaviour favouring active modes, particularly the use of bicycles. This will entail an integrated marketing and communications effort  including continuous and consistent awareness campaigns, events and activities that have an impact and education promoting active modes of transport and road behaviour  oriented to encourage a profound shift in attitudes. [Expected date: 2020-2030]  5.7.5. Promote the use of bicycles by changing the mobility behaviour in school and/or university age segments of the population Education for an active and sustainable road mobility will be taught from pre-school level and continued over subsequent levels, encouraging the shared and responsible use of public space. Resources, initiatives and communications campaigns will be developed and promoted for groups with different needs and expectations, where there is significant potential to increase the use of active mobility, such as, for example, among students. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   5.7.6. Create a network of complementary equipment to support active mobility  Provide suitable parking for bicycles at all relevant points (safe, well-located and in sufficient quantity). Bicycle transport must tend to be practical and accessible, on rail transport, river transport and, in some situations, road transport, e.g. in the case of intercity and urban journeys. [Expected date: 2020-2025]   5.7.7. Improve pedestrian infrastructure  Implement measures that facilitate pedestrian traffic in consolidated urban areas, facilitating the safe circulation of pedestrians and reducing bottlenecks resulting from difficult terrain and limited space in some urban streets, in the Autonomous Region of Madeira.

National policies, timelines and measures envisaged to gradually eliminate energy subsidies, particularly for fossil fuels  To ensure that taxation is an instrument for the transition to carbon neutrality, in 2018 Portugal created a Working Group25 to analyse taxation impacting energy. The task of this group was to identify and study incentives that were detrimental to the environment and propose their gradual elimination, as well as to frame proposals to revitalise the carbon tax, considering the possible impact on the economic sectors affected in decarbonising the economy. A phased process of eliminating the exemptions associated with the use of coal to produce electricity is described below.                                                               25 Official Order No 2835/2018, published in the Official Journal, 2nd series, No 56 of 20 March 2018  Elimination of exemptions for the use of coal to produce electricity The National Budget for 2018 (Art. 251) sets out the phased elimination of the exemptions for the Petrol and Energy Products Tax (Imposto sobre Produtos Petrolíferos e Energéticos - ISP) applicable to coal and coal coke used for cogeneration and to produce electricity. Thus, in 2018 coal and coal coke (classified as codes NC2701, 2702 and 2704) used to produce electricity and heat are now subject to a tax corresponding to 10% of the ISP rate and 10% of the add-on rate for CO2 emissions (carbon tax). These rates are to be amended on 1 January every year in the following manner: (i) 25% in 2019; (ii) 50% in 2020; (iii) 75% in 2021; (iv) 100% in 2022. The revenue obtained from this gradual elimination of the ISP exemption and add-ons for CO2 emissions is split, with 50% being allocated to the National Electricity System (NES) to reduce the tariff deficit for the electricity sector affecting the Fund for the Systemic Sustainability of the Energy Sector and 50% being allocated to the Environmental Fund to be used for decarbonisation projects. An adjustment was introduced for 2019, which makes it possible to reflect the price of carbon that plants have already paid  86 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3. Policies and measures planned   An analysis of tax expenditure for ISP identified that in 2017 around EUR 441 M was associated with tax incentives for fossil fuels. In the context of the Energy Taxation Directive, there are optional exemptions, such as the case of those for energy intensive industries. It is important to note that even though this Directive sets out that Member States should exempt fossil fuels used to produce electricity it also establishes that they can be taxed for environmental policy reasons. Portugal thus intends to continue to eliminate subsidies that are detrimental to the environment, reinforcing the use of the carbon tax and promoting greater taxation for the use of resources and, as is the case today, the revenues obtained thus will be recycled for decarbonisation and fair transition.   ACTION STRATEGY 1.7. IMPLEMENT GREEN TAXATION DESCRIPTION Contribute toward encouraging more sustainable patterns of production and consumption; promote a reduction in GHG emissions; foster more sustainable behaviours; promote eco-innovation and efficiency in the use of resources; foment entrepreneurialism and the creation of employment; reduce external energy dependence; the efficient implementation of international goals and targets and a diversification of revenue sources.  SECTOR(S) Energy; Industry; Mobility and Transport; Services ACTION MEASURES To implement green taxation, the following action measures are planned:   1.7.1. Taxation to decarbonise the energy sector  Revitalise the carbon tax  a tax on carbon in sectors that are not covered by ETS, with a rate indexed to the price of carbon in the sectors encompassed by ETS. Gradually eliminate the incentives that are detrimental to the environment, namely subsidies for fossil fuels, including revising tax benefits and other incentives associated with the use of fossil fuels. [Expected date: 2020-2025]   1.7.2. Taxation to decarbonise the transport sector and promote sustainable mobility  Incentives for electric mobility through measures impacting Personal Income Tax (IRS), Corporation Tax (IRC), VAT, Vehicle Tax (ISV), supplementary taxation on vehicles or subsidies for purchasing new electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids. Revise the ISV and Road Tax (IUC) to reinforce positive discrimination for vehicles with better environmental performance, maintaining taxation based on CO2 emissions. Study potential incentives for bio-energy mobility, differentiating bio-energy from fossil fuels, promoting the use of richer bio-energy blends. [Expected date: 2020-2025]   1.7.3. Taxation to decarbonise the residential and services sectors  Introduce tax incentives for energy efficiency and introducing energy from renewable sources and a more favourable tax system for buildings used to produce renewable energy (e.g. create tax incentives, such as reducing property tax (IMI) for buildings that use virtually no energy (NZEB)). [Expected date: 2020-2025]   1.7.4 Taxation to promote low-carbon products and services  Create tax incentives for low-carbon products and services, namely, those that are certified or incorporate recycled material.
