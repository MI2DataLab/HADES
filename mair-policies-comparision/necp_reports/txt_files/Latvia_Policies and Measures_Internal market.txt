4.10. Energy security, internal energy market 132  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 In Latvia, there are no restrictions on transport energy market players or any restrictions on the ability of fuel suppliers to operate in Latvia. The transport energy market is diversified in Latvia, because although 100 % of fossil fuel is imported, it comes from several countries, the most active import markets being Russia, Belarus, Finland, Lithuania and Norway. Target status quo in 2030:  The electricity networks of the Baltic States are synchronised with the European networks ensuring secure and sustainable electricity supply through a total of at least 5 European interconnections  A regional natural gas market has been established between the Baltic States and Finland, including completion of cross-border natural gas interconnections, providing diversified and secure natural gas supply routes and suppliers Benefits to society and economy:  Energy security and energy independence from third countries  The consumer has control over energy consumption and costs thanks to smart meters   Users are interested and informed about usable efficient technologies, control their consumption of energy sources (electricity). Users avail themselves of the most state-of-the-art   energy supply solutions and market products, and smart meters are used in energy accounting and consumption management to maximise market benefits.  New entrants  aggregators  can effectively engage in the electricity market  eived by all those who are entitled to it (160,000 instead of 80,000) and targeted measures are being taken to substantially reduce energy poverty. Main challenges 1)  energy dependency on third countries and completely undiversified natural gas supplies As things stand, the electricity system of the Baltic States is managed from third countries, which increases energy dependency on third countries and impacts on security issues, makes it difficult to exchange information with European TSOs, and limits opportunities to ensure coordinated action (e.g. regarding electrical power line outages) between the Baltic States and the rest of Europe. Internal electricity trading by Russia and Belarus, and by s other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, along with fluctuations and failures of their power system modes technically affect and strain the electrical transmission network of the Baltic states by limiting their ability to fully implement the EU legal framework in the electricity market, particularly in relation to the calculation and planning of capacity, overload management and network balancing. The Baltic States still depend on one dominant supplier of natural gas, which prevents energy independence and security of energy supply.  3) undeveloped interconnection infrastructure and capacities among the Baltic States The developed electricity and gas transmission interconnections between Lithuania and Poland, Lithuania and Sweden, and Estonia and Finland do not provide full security of supply unless internal Baltic interconnections are developed at the same time, which would allow for increased transmission capacity. Latvia currently has an incoming interconnection with 133  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 Estonia and an outgoing interconnection with Lithuania, which might create problems, given coming in from Belarus. 3) Failure to solve a range of energy poverty problems electricity costs, which is due to a non-automated support system. At the same time, in order to reduce energy poverty, the population receives support only for electricity used, while the support for the provision of thermal energy is sufficiently addressed by municipalities within the scope of their capabilities. However, the principle of energy poverty is based directly on the inability of people to keep their homes warm enough, so the reduction of energy poverty is more related to thermal energy consumption. Main action line (action line 6) Energy security, reducing energy dependency, full integration of energy markets, modernisation of infrastructure Key actions and activities 1) Ensuring energy security and complete integration of the energy market, to reduce energy dependency (measures 6.1, 6.2) Energy security can be improved and energy dependency can be reduced by ensuring:  In the gas sector  the involvement of alternative suppliers of natural gas in the market where natural gas is supplied from as many countries as possible (EU countries or third countries), both via the natural gas transmission network and using alternative means of supply;  In the electricity sector  more diversified types of energy sources used in electricity generation and electricity generation technologies, focusing on zero-emission technologies, while respecting the principle of technological neutrality of RES while ensuring continuous functioning of interconnections;  In the transport energy sector  reducing the need to use imported fossil fuels by electrifying transport and diversifying the fossil fuel types used as much as possible. There are currently no restrictions on the deployment and use of any RE technology in the territory of Latvia, but conditions are included and must be taken into account when developing transport infrastructure when creating a wind park205. Completed and forthcoming measures to develop and modernise the electricity infrastructure provide an opportunity for the inclusion of new RE capacities where no prioritisation of capacity inclusion has been defined. Although internal energy markets are integrated in Latvia, Latvia will implement further energy market integration measures:  by establishing a regional Baltic and Finnish gas market with a single gas balancing zone and a common gas transmission tariff. In order to ensure safety of gas supply and to increase gas flows, it is important to increase the capacity of the Latvia-Lithuania gas interconnection and                                                        205 Cabinet Regulation No 240 of 30 April 2013 on general rules for the planning, use of and building on land 134  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00  by implementing the synchronisation of the Baltic StatesEuropean network, including the reinforcement of existing interconnections and the development of new interconnections, inter alia by reconstructing and modernising existing high-voltage substations and electricity distribution points within Latvia and constructing new power lines and installing the equipment necessary for safe and stable synchronisation of the Baltic States.  By evaluating the possibility of further liberalising the heating market and introducing conditions for receiving a permission for installation of new capacities or new installations having evaluated the saturation of generating capacities in the specific territory and taking into account market functionality. 2) Modernising various aspects of infrastructure (measures 6.1, 6.2) During the period covered by the Plan, the following infrastructure modernisation projects will be carried out:  modernisation of the gas heating fuel/motor fuel infrastructure and improvement of energy efficiency, including evaluating the possibilities of adapting the natural gas infrastructure to hydrogen and other gaseous fuels, as well as drafting an action plan for the development of hydrogen infrastructure and market conditions, where applicable;  modernisation of the electricity infrastructure and improvement of energy efficiency for the provision of a smart, digital-technology-based and efficiently managed distribution network meeting the needs of customers;    complete replacement of electricity meters with smart meters, which in turn will allow new entrants  aggregators206, who will provide energy optimisation services, to operate on the market. 3) Developing solutions for reducing energy poverty (measure 6.3) One possible solution for reducing energy poverty is to develop an effective and optimal regulatory framework for partial support for the energy supply costs of protected users, which would mean that a system of protected user information would be established within the framework of the State budget, which would automatically identify individuals who meet the criteria of protected users (families), thus ensuring that the protected user service is received by the maximum number of protected users, as well as ensuring that any electricity trader can supply the protected user service.                                                       206 An aggregator is a market operator that combines the power not consumed by several clients or the electricity produced for selling, procurements, auctions, or any regulated electricity market. In the case of an independent aggregator (one not linked to any electricity trader or other market player), the final consumer has to conclude two contracts  a supply the aggregator has direct access to the power and equipment of the consumer and, in case it is necessary for the market, the aggregator reduces the consumption of the user in a controlled manner to enter the market with the electricity that has not been consumed. A separate settlement mechanism governs how and whether the aggregator provides compensation to the trader for electricity savings or surplus electricity of the final consumer that is managed by the aggregator. An aggregator attached to a trader performs its function by using control mechanisms to earmark a specific amount of electricity savings for the final consumer defined by the trader. Thus the trader is aware of the electricity reserve it can use in case it is necessary for balancing the market situation or in the event of high electricity prices. The final consumer concludes only one contract  with the trader. An aggregator can merge the reduction/increase of electricity consumption and the reduction/increase of electricity production or combine the electricity acquired during both processes. 135  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 Similarly, the condition for reducing energy poverty is included as a criterion in the measures for improving the energy performance of buildings and for improving the energy efficiency of DH, LH and individual heating.  If implementation of such measures reduce the level of energy poverty amongst the population, of the population, they should be particularly well received. Si207, as well 208 project (within Horizon2020). The solutions developed under these projects will be included in the update of the Plan in 2023. Regional cooperation By definition, the regional natural gas market provides for a single entry-exit system of natural gas transmission and a balancing zone without internal commercial interconnection points between the Baltic States and Finland.  In the field of the electricity market, regional cooperation takes place, and will continue to take place, against the backdrop of synchronisation between the electricity networks of the Baltic States and the network of continental Europe.  Regional cooperation will continue in the Regional Gas Market Coordination Group and the implemented within the framework of the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP). In response to the development trends of the electricity market and changes planned in the EU legislation, TSOs of the Baltic States and Finland organised a working group in 2017 with the aim of developing a conceptual offer for establishing a common framework for the market of the Baltic States to introduce demand response services in the balancing market through aggregation. The main task at the moment is to jointly develop a well-functioning legal framework for introducing the demand response service. Related action lines 1) Improving energy performance of buildings (action line 1), because increased energy performance of buildings will reduce energy consumption and thus the energy dependency caused by energy imports as a result of energy demand; 2) Improving energy efficiency and promoting the use of RES technologies in heating and cooling, and industry (action line 2), because the reduction in energy consumption resulting from more efficient DH systems will reduce energy dependency; 3) Promoting the use of negative emission technologies in electricity generation (action line 3), because the development of electricity generation in high-capacity wind parks will reduce energy dependency and reduce electricity imports; 4) Promoting economically justified self-generation, self-consumption of energy and renewable energy communities (action line 4), because the promotion of own-purpose -generation and consumption is not possible without smart meters, which in turn also gives aggregators the possibility of entering the market;                                                       207https://www.em.gov.lv/lv/nozares_politika/valsts_petijumu_programma__energetika_/konkurss__ilgtspejiga_energetikas_infrastruktura_un_tirgus_/ 208http://www.zrea.lv/lv/jaunumi_5/ar_starptautiska_projekta_step_palidzibu_lpiaa_noteiks_energijas_nabadzibas_kriterijus_3030/ 136  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 5) Improving energy efficiency, promoting the use of alternative fuels and RES technologies in transport (action line 5), because the reduction in the consumption of fuel which is currently imported in the main will significantly reduce the Senergy dependency, while the infrastructure modernisation measures taken improve the availability of electricity and gaseous fuels in transport; and RES technologies (action line 11), because the reduction in the use of heating and motor fuel has a positive impact on energy independence due to the impact of the tax review.
