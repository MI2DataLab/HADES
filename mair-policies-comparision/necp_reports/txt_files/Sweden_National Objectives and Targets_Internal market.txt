32 (199) 2.4.1 Electricity interconnectivity  The level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030 in consideration of the electricity interconnection target for 2030 of at least 15%, with a strategy with the level from 2021 onwards defined in close cooperation with affected Member States, taking into account the 2020 interconnection target of 10% and the following indicators of the urgency of action:  1. Price differential in the wholesale market exceeding an indicative threshold of EUR 2/MWh between Member States, regions or bidding zones.  2. Nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30% of peak load  3. Nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30% of installed renewable generation. Sweden has not set a target for interconnection in 2030. However, the Energy Agreement includes an ambition to interconnectivity level was51 2030. Current and future levels are discussed in Section 4.5.  Table 4 shows the annual average prices in the Swedish and neighbouring bidding zones in 2018 and the price differences between the zones. The differences vary from year to year and are highly dependent on the weather, in other words the flow of water for hydroelectric power, the generation of wind power and the demand for heating which varies with the temperature.  Table 4 shows that the following zones could benefit from increased Net Transfer Capacity (NTC): SE3-SE4, SE1-FI, SE3- FI, SE4-LT, SE4-PL and SE4-DE. Some of these have already been identified and are the subject of existing or planned projects. The SouthWest Link (SE3-SE4), 3:e AC to Finland (SE1-F1) and the Hansa Powerbridge (SE4-DE).  However any analysis of potential new or improved connections must include an assessment of the socio-economic benefits in the expected future market situation. The current price may give an indication of the potential demand, but the analysis should be based on the market situation in 1030   Table 4.

Kraftbalansrapporten 2019. 34 (199)  2.4.2 Energy transmission infrastructure  2.4.2.1 Key electricity and gas transmission infrastructure projects, and, where relevant, modernisation projects, that are necessary for the achievement of objectives and targets under the five dimensions of the Energy Union Strategy.  Electricity transmission Svenska kraftnät is a state-owned enterprise which owns the Swedish national grid. It is responsible for maintaining the instantaneous energy system operator by the Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate. The current system development plan52 covers the period up to 2027 and includes grid development projects.   The SouthWest Link project53, which increases Net Transfer Capacity between bidding zones 3 and 4 (see Figure 32 on bidding zones in Section 4.5), is currently in the test phase and is expected to increase capacity by 1 200 MW.   The West Coast Programme comprises several projects to eliminate bottlenecks in this area.   The expected phase-out of nuclear energy in bidding zone 3 and expansion of wind energy in bidding zones 1 and 2, will increase the need for transmission between bidding zones 2 and 3. The NordSyd Programme54 comprises around 50 different projects to increase capacity between bidding zones 2 and 3 by 2040.  Gas transmission The western Swedish natural gas system extends from Trelleborg in the south to Stenungssund in the north and slightly eastwards towards Jönköping. Gas is transported to Sweden through a pipeline from Dragør in Denmark. The Swedish transmission network is owned by Swedgas AB, which is also responsible for balancing the system. A few very large consumers are connected directly to the transmission network.                                                        52 Svenska kraftnät  Systemutvecklingsplan 2018 2027. 53 https://www.svk.se/natutveckling/stamnatsprojekt/sydvastlanken/. 54 https://www.svk.se/natutveckling/stamnatsprojekt/nordsyd/. 35 (199) The LNG55 terminal at the Port of Gothenburg opened in autumn 2018 and will initially supply gas for shipping, industry and road haulage. It will eventually have a total capacity of around 30 000 m3. The Government has decided to reject an application for a concession to build a natural gas pipeline between the LNG terminal and the natural gas transmission network.56  2.4.2.2 Where applicable, main infrastructure projects envisaged other than Projects of Common Interest. There are plans for a third AC line57 between Sweden (SE1) and Finland. There are also plans for a new 700-MW HVDC link58 between Sweden (SE4) and Germany.  One of the Öresund cables from SE4 to DK2 will be replaced in 2020. Some of the other connections to Denmark, and Fennoskan 1 (SE3-FI) are likely to need replacing before 2030.  A new Nordic grid development plan59 was published in August 2019. The report from the four Nordic Transmission System Operators (Energinet, Fingrid, Statnett and Svenska kraftnät) describes the driving forces behind the major changes which the Nordic power system is undergoing and the planned and existing projects designed to meet the challenges these changes present.  2.4.3 Market integration  2.4.3.1 National objectives related to other aspects of the internal energy market such as: increasing system flexibility, in particular through policies and measures related to market-based price formation in compliance with applicable law; market integration and coupling, aiming to increase the tradeable capacity of existing interconnectors, smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment and real-time price signals, including a timeframe for when the objectives should be met. Sweden has no specific national objectives for market integration, but is continuously developing measures and taking part in Nordic cooperation in this field.  To ensure the optimum use of resources and a cost-effective transition to a sustainable energy system, the Nordic Council of Ministers has set up a new                                                       55 LNG = liquefied natural gas. 56 Government decision II:1 at the cabinet meeting of 10 October 2019, ref.

The forum has produced a new vision for the Nordic electricity market which was adopted by the Nordic Council of Ministers at its last meeting in Reykjavik in 201960. The vision is accompanied by a roadmap for action up to 2030, which was drawn up by the electricity market operators61.  The Nordic countries have decided to intensify their cooperation on the Nordic balancing process and have developed a model for the balancing of the Nordic power system in the future  the Nordic Balancing Model (NBM)62. A considerable amount of work will be required over the next few years to finalise the design of the new model, develop the IT systems and implement it. The intention is to implement it gradually so that the whole system is operational by 2023. Important elements and milestones are:   Single price model  15-minute settlement period  Nordic capacity market for aFRR63  Nordic capacity market for mFRR64 Until now balancing has been planned and handled on an hourly basis and any changes within the operating hours. A 15-minute settlement period will enable all parties on the power market to plan their own balance more precisely and allow more efficient use of power resources and the grid.  2.4.3.2 Where applicable, national objectives related to the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met. Sweden has no specific targets for this. However, it has introduced a provision in Chapter 3, Section 16 of the Electricity Act (1997:857) prohibiting grid operators from establishing technical requirements or other conditions which make it more difficult to provide services in the form of changed electricity consumption, unless the condition is justified in the interests of the secure, reliable and efficient operation of the grid.  Another provision (Chapter 5, Section 11 of the Electricity Act) states that, when determining how much the grid operators may charge customers,                                                       60 https://nordicelforum.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Vision-for-the-nordic-electricity-market-EN_2.pdf. 61 https://nordicelforum.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Handlingsplan-for-at-opnå-2030-visionen-FINAL.pdf. 62 http://nordicbalancingmodel.net/. 63 automatic Frequency Restoration Reserves. 64 manual Frequency Restoration Reserves. 37 (199) account must be taken of the extent to which their operations are compatible with or contribute to the efficient use of the grid. This provision is intended to encourage grid operators to make it easier for customers to provide services which allow better demand response, for example by using new technical solutions.  The Smartgrid Forum, a joint enterprise to promote smarter energy use set up in spring 2016 by a Government decision, has developed a strategy for using smart grids to increase the flexibility of the electricity system65. The strategy is described in more detail in Section 3.4.3.  2.4.3.3 Where applicable, national objectives with regard to ensuring that consumers participate in the energy system and benefit from self-generation and new technologies, including smart meters. Sweden has no specific targets for this.  On 1 November 2018, new requirements were introduced in the Ordinance (1999:716) on the Measurement, Calculation and Reporting of Transmitted Electricity (the Measurement Ordinance) which will apply from 2025. The new requirements apply to functions of electricity meters, measuring systems and measuring equipment. Under the new Measurement Ordinance, the grid operator must meet the functional requirements by the start of the 2025 measurement year; the requirements cover the measuring systems and equipment for all consumers of low-voltage electricity.  The functional requirements for measuring systems and measuring equipment   allow electricity consumers to obtain information, such as capacity used, which make it easier for them to save energy and play an active part in the electricity market; and  promote reliable and effective grid operation and make it easier and cheaper to integrate electricity from microgeneration, such as solar electricity.  2.4.3.4 National objectives with regard to ensuring electricity system adequacy, as well as for the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met. Sweden has no national objectives for ensuring electricity system adequacy.  The new regulation66 for cross-border exchanges in electricity includes                                                       65 http://swedishsmartgrid.se/projekt-och-resultat/strategier-for-smarta-elnat/okad-flexibilitet-i-elsystemet/. 66 Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in 38 (199) articles which require Member States to monitor system adequacy continuously. The Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate was given the task of producing proposals for a reliability standard in its 2020 spending authorisations. Member States with adequacy problems must take a number of measures to improve the operation of the market. If these measures prove insufficient, they can introduce a mechanism to conserve capacity (the Swedish capacity reserve counts as such a mechanism) which must be backed up by a reliability standard based on the value of the lost load. The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) must produce European methods for calculating the value of the lost load and reliability standards for system adequacy.  2.4.3.5 Where applicable, national objectives to protect energy consumers and improve the competitiveness of the retail energy sector. The Government is working to give customers more active choice and to increase competitiveness by introducing a system in which suppliers are the key party in the market. This means that customers will mostly have contact with the electricity supplier and the supplier will bill them both for electricity and grid costs. To increase active customer engagement and provide new services, the Government and the authorities have also started work on launching an electricity market hub for centralised management of measurement data, where the stakeholders can obtain and provide information.  The electricity market hub is a central IT system which will manage the exchange of information between electricity market operators.  2.4.4 Energy poverty  2.4.4.1 Where applicable, national objectives with regard to energy poverty, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met. Sweden makes no distinction between energy poverty and poverty in general. As a result, the term energy poverty is not used, and there are no targeted policies to deal with it. The issue is addressed within social policy
