215 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   5. IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF PLANNED POLICIES AND MEASURES By implementing the planned measures and policies of the ambitious NEPN scenario, compared to 2017 Slovenia will achieve a 6% reduction in final energy use by 2030 and a reduction of more than 20% by 2040, while by 2030 it will increase the use of renewables and waste by more than 35 % compared with 2017. The estimated volume of investment for implementation of the NEPN scenario in the period 2021-2030 is over EUR 28 billion, which requires almost EUR 5 billion more investment than in the existing measures scenario; and between EUR 200 million and EUR 250 million annually for the necessary incentives for implementation. The impact and investment assessment is based on the assumptions of the model used and the indicative resource plan presented in the section below. 5.1 Impacts of planned policies and measures on energy systems and emissions The effects of the implementation of the planned additional policies and measures of the NEPN (ambitious scenario with additional measures) scenario, which, in comparison with the existing measures (EM) scenario, achieve the set targets and have significant positive environmental and social impacts, are shown below.  5.1.1 Energy system development projections up to 2040 Implementation of NEPN scenario policies and measures would achieve a gradual reduction of end-use of energy by about 53 TWh or 6% from 2017 by 2030, and by 2040 a reduction of more than 20% (to 45 TWh), as shown in Figure 79. Thus, with the implementation of the additional NEPN measures in transformations up to 2030, primary energy consumption is also significantly reduced: by 2030 to some 71 TWh or by almost 10% compared to 2017 (Figure 80). The indicative area of primary energy consumption in the period 2030-2040 is limited by the curves of two possible directions of development in electricity production, i.e. construction of a new nuclear power plant and the use of synthetic gas. In the first option, primary energy consumption increases to just under 80 TWh by 2040, and in the second option, primary energy consumption is reduced to some 65 TWh by 2040.  216 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 79: Final energy projection for the NEPN scenario and the existing measures scenario  Source: IJS-CEU Key to Figure 79: Final energy consumption [ktoe]  Actual development  With existing measures  NEPN  Figure 80: Primary energy projection for the NEPN scenario and the existing measures scenario  Source: IJS-CEU Key to Figure 80: Primary energy consumption [ktoe]  Actual development  With existing measures  NEPN - nuclear   NEPN - synthetic gas  217 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   The detailed comprehensive energy balance of the NEPN scenario is shown in the Sankey diagram, as illustrated in the figures below for the year 2017 and for the year 2030 following the NEPN; the following trends in primary energy consumption should be noted:  halving of consumption of solid fuels (coal) - consumption reduced by 6 TWh,  reduction of consumption of liquid fuels by 18% or 5 TWh,  increase in use of RES and waste by 25% and 3.3 TWh compared to 2017,  increase of consumption of natural gas by more than 10% (0.9 TWh) and additional consumption of 1 TWh of synthetic gas,  in transformations, electricity production increased by 8% (by 1.2 TWh), district heat production reduced by 11% and the total transformation losses reduced by 21% (4.2 TWh). Figure 83 shows the balance of electricity production by energy product for both the EM and the NEPN scenarios with both development options up to 2040. Up to 2030, renewable electricity production (solar and hydro) contributes to an increase in production, while the decline in coal-fired electricity production is replaced by wood biomass and natural gas (the share of synthetic gas gradually increasing). Similar trends continue until 2040 when production increases significantly with the option of the construction of a new nuclear power plant or more moderately if the synthetic gas development option is adopted.

The indicative total greenhouse gas emissions in 2040 are 8.6 million tCO2eq in the event of the nuclear development scenario and 9 million tCO2eq in the event of the synthetic gas development scenario, representing a decrease of 56 to 58% in relation to 2005 (Table 65).

More detailed analysis and additional measures relating to air pollutant emissions under Directive (EU) 2016/2284 will be included in the programme of air pollution control measures (OP NEC) currently in preparation.  5.1.3 Energy savings Slovenia is already implementing a wide range of measures to achieve 9.0 TWh of final energy savings in the existing measures scenario up to 2030. By implementing the ambitious additional measures of the NEPN scenario, the amount of final energy savings will be increased by almost 7 TWh by 2030, with savings in transport (3.9 TWh), industry (1.4 TWh), and general consumption (1.3 TWh), as shown in Figure 85. In addition to the final energy savings, through the measures of the NEPN scenario in transformations we can achieve energy savings of 2.7 TWh, bringing total primary energy savings of 9.3 TWh by 2030, or reducing primary energy by more than 19% in relation to the projection of the scenario without measures and some 12% compared to the existing measures scenario (Figure 86).

The largest increase is in electricity production (1.9 TWh) and heating and cooling (0.6 TWh), while in transport, RES usage is increased by 0.5 TWh.

The EM scenario proposes the consistent general evolution of economic activity subject to given exogenous assumptions101 of the main drivers and represents a benchmark against which the effects of the planned additional actions of the NEPN scenario in the 2020-2030 period can be compared.  5.2.1 Macro-economic effects of energy and climate scenarios Although the period covered by NEPN is shorter, it is nevertheless necessary to proceed from a broader framework covering the period up to 2050. Based on the targets and taking into account the EU's climate change neutrality target of 2050, endorsed by the European Council of 12 December 2019102, the NEPN scenario envisages for Slovenia a reduction in CO2 emissions of between 90% and 95%, which together with the emission sinks, creates the scenario to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in Slovenia by 2050. The following section describes the macro-economic results of the NEPN scenario. Here we are interested in what changes are brought about by the additional planned energy and climate measures compared to the basic existing measures scenario (EM scenario). It should be noted that the estimates made are not forecasts of the movements of individual macro-economic aggregates in the period under consideration but rather that they assess the changes due to the planned measures if all other conditions remain unchanged and while considering all the complex connections taken into account by the existing version of the energy-environmental dynamic model of the general equilibrium of the Slovenian economy. Additional energy investments increase energy efficiency and thus reduce energy consumption103 per unit of production in each industrial sector or energy in the final consumption of households. Lower energy product costs have a positive effect on increasing demand for labour and reducing unemployment and increasing production. The final effect on relative consumer prices is positive, as they are expected to decline slightly relative to the baseline scenario (by  0.3% by 2030).                                                            100  For this purpose, a dynamic, multi-sector computable Generalised Equilibrium Model (CGE) for Slovenia - GreenMod Slovenia, specifically designed to analyse energy and environmental issues, was established and used, taking into account the quantitative results of a reference energy-ecological model called REES-SLO2. The core of the CGE model database is the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM), which is the most important input system for calculating the CGE model-based solution. With the available data for 2015, it was possible to produce the 2015 SAM matrix based on the supply and consumption table. A particular challenge is the desired level of division of products and activities in the SAM matrix and, of course, its balancing. The complexity of preparing the SAM matrix was greatly increased following the decision to break households down by quintile classes and related data. However, this step makes sense because of the social challenges facing Slovenia at the time of creating a post-industrial and climate-neutral society. 101  Exogenous assumptions in the existing measures scenario are technical progress, projections for domestic production growth, global price growth and projected investments in energy and energy efficiency. However, population growth forecasts are based on Eurostat. Endogenous variables of the model include supply - production and export, demand - intermediate, private, public, investment and export (quantities, sectoral), resources and consumption of material, energy, labour and capital. The model also calculates for each sector the prices of domestic production, exports, imports and changes in primary factor incomes.  102  European Council Conclusions, 12 December 2019. Available at: https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/41768/12- euco-final-conclusions-en.pdf. 103  The energy products in the general equilibrium model are the following products: wood, coal, natural gas, petroleum products, coke, electricity and heat, which are consumed in the production of a particular activity or final consumption of households and the State. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 211   Increased household disposable income is reflected in higher final private consumption (1% in 2020 and 2.2% in 2030) compared to final private consumption in the EM scenario. The positive effects of the additional measures are also reflected in increased savings for both businesses and households while simultaneously reducing the , which increases its income due to increased economic activity. Increased total savings are reflected in higher total gross investment, which may be 3.1% higher in 2020 and 3.8% higher in 2030 than in the EM scenario. Increased economic activity also creates jobs in the Slovenian economy, so that employment in 2021 is 0.7% higher than in the EM scenario and by 2030 1.4% higher. The changed structure of investments also influences change in the structure of production in the Slovenian economy, which will be more important after 2030. Demographic change or population ageing is integrated into the model indirectly through modelling of the labour supply. Increased energy efficiency and therefore lower energy consumption have the effect of increasing the international competitiveness of domestic production and increasing exports (by 0.8% in 2021 in relation to the EM scenario and by 1.2% in 2030) compared to imports (which after 2020 increases by 0.5% over the EM scenario each year up to 2030). The positive effects of the planned additional measures in the NEPN scenario are reflected, lastly, in GDP, which is expected to be 1.8% higher in 2021 compared to the GDP in the EM scenario, and 2.1% by 2030.

Taking into account the planned additional measures in the NEPN scenario, the consumption of energy inputs should be further reduced compared to the EM scenario and thus also energy import dependency. Accordingly, natural gas imports are expected to decline rapidly, especially after 2025, and by 2030 to achieve a reduction of 35% relative to natural gas imports in the EM scenario, in which on account of increased electricity consumption by 2030 it is necessary to build an additional gas-steam power plant. With production estimated as lower than electricity consumption, the NEPN scenario indicates the need for a slight increase in electricity imports after 2025 compared to the EM scenario, and this is reflected in a 7.8% increase in imports in 2030. Imports of petroleum products are projected to decline by over 12% by 2030, as Figure 89 shows.

Key to Figure 89:  Change in imports by energy product in the NEPN scenario compared to the EM scenario (difference in%)  Natural gas  Petroleum products  Electricity  5.2.2 Environmental and social effects of energy and climate scenarios Effects on environmental well-being The largest share of GHG emissions is attributed to CO2 emissions. By 2030, investments in increasing energy efficiency will be key to reducing emissions. However, major changes in the structure of resource use cannot be expected during this period, as some resources are not yet commercially competitive (e.g. synthetic gas) or the changes require major political decisions that have not yet been taken. The fact is that the damage caused by GHG emissions is already reflected in terrestrial ecosystems and extreme weather conditions (droughts, high winds, storms, heavy rainfall, prolonged intense rainfall, floods, melting of both Slovenian glaciers, etc.) and changes in the precipitation regime. Our aim in reducing GHG emissions is to halt these trends. Effects on consumer well-being What will happen to consumer well-being is not entirely dependent on GDP growth. Consumer benefits depend on the use of goods, leisure and, last but not least, environmental benefits. It is determined mainly by the consumption of goods, which in 2021 will be increased by 0.9% in the NEPN scenario and by 2.2% in 2030 in relation to the existing measures scenario. It should be emphasised that if a decision were taken to raise the environmental tax in order to reduce emissions, it would be reasonable to combine this financial instrument with the use of tax revenue to implement energy poverty mitigation measures. This could correct the estimated adverse impact of planned additional measures on household disposable income, especially in the lowest quintile. The real disposable income of households in the 1st quintile class is, in the NEPN scenario, 0.15% higher in 2021 compared to the EM scenario, and lower (- 0.59%) in 2030. In the 2nd quintile, in both observed years, the real disposable income of households, in the NEPN scenario, increases by 0.69% and 0.03% more in comparison to the EM scenario. In the other three quintile classes, real disposable household income in the NEPN scenario is higher than in the EM scenario. From the INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 213   perspective of the fairness of the transition to a climate-neutral society, after 2022 the NEPN scenario is unfavourable for the 20% of households in the lowest-income bracket, and appropriate mitigation measures will need to be taken. This is the households income bracket where energy poverty is already experienced today, especially on account of the difficulty of paying energy bills and living in apartments where the roof is leaking, there are damp walls, foundations or floors, loose window frames or floors. Often the poorest households also lack access to bank credit because they do not have enough regular income and at the same time lack the social knowledge and skills to access support at all.

From the point of view of household consumption, the NEPN scenario is more favourable than the EM scenario, since, in all income quintile classes, real household consumption is higher throughout the whole period than consumption in the EM scenario. However, the increase is greater in the higher quintile classes.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 214   Effects on employment The planned additional measures in the NEPN scenario are expected to be reflected in an estimated increase in employment and decrease in unemployed numbers in relation to the employment/unemployment numbers in the basic existing measures scenario. Thus, in the NEPN scenario, in 2021 employment is expected to be 0.7% higher than in the EM scenario, increasing to 1.4% by 2030. Increased economic activity has the effect of increasing demand for labour and reducing unemployment. We estimate that in each year up to 2030 in the NEPN scenario demand for labour will be higher, compared to the EM scenario, in all economic activities, except for the coal, coke production and refined petroleum, transport, and metal and paper industries.

Effects on health The assessment of the impact on health  is summarised in the draft environmental report (2019)104. Environmental interventions that are foreseen as a result of NEPN implementation and that may have an effect on increasing environmental noise pollution are related to the implementation of construction interventions as part of major projects and to road and rail noise and the noise of newly installed facilities that generate noise. As a general rule, of all facilities using renewable energy sources, special attention in terms of the health impact of noise emissions is needed in the case of wind turbines. Noise is also caused by high-voltage power lines (400 kV) and distribution power stations. Noise reduction, especially in urban areas, is achieved by promoting an increase in the number of electric vehicles. In the context of promoting sustainable mobility, cycling and walking have an associated impact, both reducing ambient air pollution and also having a good effect on health through movement, enhancing endurance and the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. In addition, they contribute to reducing passenger kilometres and carbon footprint. The NEPN envisages measures that will jointly contribute to the reduction of emissions of substances into the air (mainly CO2 and also other pollutants such as SO2, NOX, PE2.5, NH3 and NMVOC). Negative impacts on the air are possible due to the increase in diffuse dust emissions during the construction of infrastructure and energy facilities. The NEPN envisages measures that will, on the other hand, have a positive effect on air quality. These are, in particular, measures related to the                                                            104  Parts based on the draft environmental report, will be revised or updated accordingly, in line with changes to the environmental report, which will be approved by the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning as appropriate. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 215   phasing-out of coal-fired electricity production and, in particular, to changes in the types of energy product used in vehicles and households. Some measures are also envisaged that make for new sources of atmospheric emissions, such as a new gas-steam power plant operating on natural gas or synthetic gas and biomass-fired thermal power plant using modern technology, both of which are more acceptable in terms of air emissions than coal-fired power plants. Important sources for which additional emission reduction measures will need to be implemented are, in particular, combustion of wood in small burners and road transport. An additional reduction in energy consumption is envisaged, which is positively reflected in the reduction of emissions of all pollutants. The NEPN provides for supplementing and upgrading the transmission and distribution electricity grid and speeding up the expansion of dispersed renewable facilities, and this will increase electromagnetic radiation emissions. The expected impact is generated during the operation of high-voltage 110, 220 and 400 kV interconnectors and HV transformer stations and 110, 1-35 kV IC and associated transformer stations. Only direct impacts are generated due to the operation of the infrastructure. Implementation of the NEPN is expected to generate large amounts of construction waste in the construction of transport and energy infrastructure and energy facilities. By shutting down the operation of individual coal units, the amount of ash, slag and gypsum produced during coal burning is reduced. Further generation of waste from existing power plants is expected, including radioactive will be generated due to the increase in electrification of transport and the generation of waste photovoltaic panels after their useful lifetime. The generation of waste from hydro-electric facilities, especially large quantities of sludge, and digestate from biogas plants can be expected. The implementation of the interventions foreseen in the NEPN may affect the quality of drinking water if wind power plants, hydro-electric power plants, gas-steam power plants or other interventions are sited in water protection areas and near water sources intended for own drinking water supply. Effects on drinking water sources can also be caused by changes in the amount and chemical status of groundwater due to interventions foreseen in the NEPN. Implementation of the NEPN measures will have a significant positive impact on improving the quality of living and working in buildings and other positive impacts due to climate change mitigation. Effects on education The NEPN scenario envisages several instruments in the area of training, education, information and energy and climate literacy, to a total value of approximately EUR 17 million per year. This will improve overall energy and climate literacy while the activity of households in terms of improving energy efficiency will be boosted by measures in the area of EEU and RES subsidies. Encouraging around 25% of passive households towards energy efficiency and the introduction of RES will also require additional action on energy poverty since, in addition to knowledge and awareness, the activity or passivity of households is also affected by their wealth situation. Climate content is already actively integrated into education and this will need to be continued and intensified. Measures are envisaged to raise public awareness and literacy regarding the expected impacts of climate change and reduce exposure to climate change impacts, Sloveniasensitivity and vulnerability, adaptation to climate change and increasing resilience. Also, in order to reduce the impact on air quality on account of promoting the energy use of biomass, awareness and education of users will be designed and carried out on the proper use of biomass installations, creation of appropriate conditions for the professional performance of chimney sweeping services and a workshop on sustainable forest management for forest owners.    INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 216   5.3 Overview of investment needs For the implementation of NEPN measures, the estimated total investments for the period 2021 - 2030 are almost EUR 22 billion, which is 22% or almost EUR 4 billion more than in the existing measures scenario. Together with investments in transport infrastructure and sustainable mobility, the total estimated investment volume is over EUR 28 billion. This is only a limited amount of targeted investment, and in order to successfully achieve the energy and climate policy goals, good targeting of all investments in the period up to 2030 will be crucial, with an important limiting factor also on the financial resources side, which will presumably require the selection of investment priorities based on analyses of their effects.  5.3.1 Existing investment flows and future investment assumptions, taking into account planned policies and measures The detailed table of investments for the NEPN is shown in the table below, which shows the estimated required investments for the following main sectors:  households and services,105  industry,106  electricity transmission,  distribution of electricity,107  central supply,108  local supply.109 Estimated investments in buildings (households and services) are shown in full (including new buildings) and separately only the energy part of investments for energy renovation.

Given the high cost, implementation to this extent is difficult to realise, and it is realistic to expect cost reductions in the coming years as a result of new technological solutions. 108  Investments in the central supply sector are intended for the construction of new production facilities on the transmission network. 109  Investments in new facilities for dispersed electricity generation (solar, wind power, etc.) and district heating systems.

The necessary investments in railway infrastructure are crucial, and almost 60% of investments are earmarked for these, which, in accordance with strategic documents already adopted, are already included in the existing measures scenario. The total estimated volume of investment in the transport sector in the period 2020-2030 under the NEPN scenario is EUR 6.6 billion, which is EUR 0.8 billion more than in the existing measures scenario, mainly due to additional investments in sustainable mobility and railways.

The staffing shortage and the additional skills needed to introduce and manage low-carbon technologies are a challenge at all levels of implementation - from ministries, energy companies to end-users of energy. The additional risk also entails the necessary development of new technologies and approaches associated with accelerated investment in research and innovation. The spatial siting of projects and establishment of the necessary legislative framework for the simple and fast transfer of new technologies and market access also represent a great challenge and risk. 5.3.3 Analysis of additional financial support or funding to close the gap The maximum possible amount of private funding will be required to carry out the planned NEPN investments, and gaps in financing will be filled by prioritising the use of available EU funds and financing through EU and national financial instruments. The planned financing model for realising NEPN investments is based on the coordinated use of grants and repayable public funds as well as sources of financing provided by financial institutions and funds. The starting points of the financing model are: INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 219   - non-refundable and refundable funds: cohesion funds, climate fund funding, Eco fund funding, earmarked contribution funds (the renewable electricity generation scheme, the EEU contribution, road tolls, user charges, etc.); - design and creation of financial instruments (repayable funds, guarantees, equity contributions) from cohesion funds and the use of EU budgets (InvestEU Guarantee, European Green Investment Plan (EGDIP), Just Transition Fund (JTF)) or the use of EIB instruments with the necessary participation and the contribution of the State budget to the implementation of financial engineering. The design of the financing model will be coordinated between all stakeholders to create an effective supportive financial environment that will enable quality preparation (including by combining a large number of diffused projects), project management and a high level of combination of different sources of funding. The financial resources necessary to implement the policies and measures of the ambitious NEPN scenario with additional measures are one of the key conditions for successful implementation of the NEPN. The total amount of incentives needed to achieve the RES and EEU targets (excluding transport, additional R&D funding and the distribution network) is almost EUR 2.5 billion for the period 2021-2030, or between EUR 200 and 250 million annually:  in the area of renovation of buildings (households, public and private buildings) just over EUR 0.9 billion,   around EUR 0.4 billion in industry,  in the area of sustainable e-mobility, around EUR 74 million will be needed to replace vehicles (hybrid and electric vehicles and other alternative fuel vehicles),  support for the generation of electricity from RES and CHP around EUR 1.1 billion (of which EUR 0.4 billion for new generating installations). The necessary incentives at the annual level are shown in Figure 91, where there is a noticeable increase in incentives in all sectors and incentives for the RES and CHP support scheme are significantly reduced after 2025 due to the exclusion of old installations from the scheme. Figure 92 shows a summary of the necessary incentives by period.

The available resources from these sources range between EUR 300 million and EUR 350 million annually (Figure 93)111 and represent a total of up to EUR 3.1 billion in the period 2021-2030, which is the main financial source for implementing the planned amount of incentives needed. In addition, the greatest possible amount of cohesion funding will need to be integrated and carefully planned for the next financial period, in particular for the requirements of the sustainable renovation of public buildings, industry incentives, sustainable mobility measures and the mitigation of energy poverty. However, other public funding resources will need to be provided for investment in rail infrastructure and increased funding for research and innovation.                                                            110  The volume of funding is increased as a result of the increase in the EuP contribution and the increased inflow into the climate fund due to higher emission allowance prices, and the contribution to the RES & SPTE-E support scheme will not need to be increased. 111  Increase in the climate fund in 2020 due to the unspent funds from previous years.

The planned volume of fund raising increases gradually after 2020 as the level of the charges approaches the price of ETS coupons and amounts to EUR 1.8 billion in the period 2018-2030, which is an additional potential source of financing for measures, while also offsetting reduced inflows from the budget due to lower energy consumption. In future, the amount of funds raised under ETS coupons will also depend on changes in EU-wide regulation.

The ongoing co-operation in this area, which will be further reinforced through the implementation of the NEPN, is expected to further boost these positive effects. Establishing new energy interconnections with neighbouring countries will allow for greater and more dynamic energy exchanges in the region which will be particularly important for ensuring the stable operation of energy systems with a significantly higher share of unpredictable renewable electricity generation. Joint cooperation in the provision of system services, energy storage and investment in research and innovation will contribute to lower energy system operation costs. 5.4.2 Impacts on energy prices, utilities and energy market integration The implementation of the planned NEPN policies and measures  thanks, in particular, to the necessary additional investment in networks and low carbon technologies and the increasing of some levies, alongside the expected increase in energy prices on the regional market  will contribute to a gradual increase in energy prices for end customers (no significant price increases are expected by 2030 according to current forecasts121) while at the same time reducing the necessary volume of energy consumption, which will substantially mitigate the increase in final energy costs. By consistently enforcing the polluter pays principle and gradually reducing and eliminating environmentally harmful incentives, energy and resource costs will gradually increase over the period, while other business costs will be reduced thanks to alternative more environmentally friendly incentives and measures. The measures implemented will thus increase competitiveness and reduce the vulnerability of businesses to price risks on unpredictable energy markets. The increased volume of renewable electricity production will have a significant impact on the functioning and interconnection of energy markets, where, due to increased fluctuations in unpredictable production, it will be necessary to provide efficient market-based instruments to establish flexibility and necessary new energy services. By converting and storing surplus electricity into gas fuels and heat, we will link the gas, heat and electricity sectors to achieve combined effects and hence lower energy prices. The planned reform of the energy taxation system at European Union level in 2021 will also have a major impact on energy pricing. 5.4.3 Impacts on regional cooperation The implementation of the NEPN policies and measures, as described, offers many opportunities, in particular with regard to reinforcing regional economic cooperation. The successful interlinking and operation of energy markets and the provision of system services can be broadened in particular in the area of the advanced development and integration of networks to manage the increased volume of renewable electricity production and in all other fields of research and innovation. There are great possibilities in terms of the transfer of knowledge and cooperation and interconnection in the area of new energy infrastructure (alternative fuels, energy storage, etc.). Establishing regional co-operation could enable transport infrastructure to be used better and transport flows in the region to be managed significantly better. Freight transport management is particularly relevant here, in particular where steered towards more sustainable modes of transport (rail) in the region and the interlinking of sustainable passenger transport solutions.
