 5. IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF PLANNED POLICIES AND MEASURES58 5.1. Impacts of planned policies and measures described in section 3 on energy system and GHG emissions and removals, including comparison to forecasts based on existing policies and measures (as described in section 4). i. Projections of the development of the energy system and GHG emissions and removals as well as, where relevant of emissions of air pollutants in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/2284 under the planned policies and measures at least until ten years after the period covered by the plan (including for the last year of the period covered by the plan), including relevant Union policies and measures. Effects of planned policies and measures described in Chapter 3 on the energy system and on greenhouse gas emissions and capture, including comparison with projections based on existing policies and measures (as described in Chapter 4.1.1.ii above). The whole of this chapter, by national economy sector, follows on from Chapter 4.1.1.ii (WEM scenario), within the framework of which descriptions of the models, methodologies and implemented PAMs used in the preparation of greenhouse gas emissions projections, including sector descriptions (parameters, activity data, data sources, etc.) are provided. iii-a Description of the scenario with additional measures WAM - The scenario with additional measures (the so-called decarbonisation scenario) is identical to the DCarb2 scenario. When proposing the WAM scenario, the adopted Clean Energy for All Europeans policy package, presented by the European Commission in November 2016, was also taken into account. The PRIMES model scenarios, named the EUCO scenarios, supported the impact assessment of measures and objectives proposed by the European Commission to 2030 and 2050. Other PRIMES model scenarios, called the EUCO scenarios to 2030 and 2050, supported the assessment of measures and objectives set out by the European Commission. The WAM scenario includes ways to achieve different combinations of ambitious energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and emission reduction targets in 2030. The WAM scenario analyses the possibility of achieving the EUs 2050 emission reduction targets (carbon neutrality). The scenario includes Slovakias participation in the EU ETS after 2020 and the intermediate renewable energy sources and energy efficiency targets and the construction of new nuclear power capacities, while maintaining its key role in the production mix. The new governance process limits Member States freedom to adopt national renewable energy sources, energy efficiency and overall greenhouse gas emission reductions targets. There is no freedom as regards non-ETS targets, but the target category specification is at the discretion of the Member State. As a substantial share of emissions that are not part of the EU ETS are not related to energy generation, it is possible to make choices between sectors.  An overview of possible contributions has been prepared using several scenarios quantified for Slovakia using the PRIMES model (Table 71) to shape the possible contributions of the Slovak Republic towards the achievement of the EU 2030 targets. Table 71 Objectives achieved by scenario                                                  58 Planned policies and measures are options under discussion and that have a realistic chance of being adopted and implemented after the date of submission of the national plan. The resulting projections under section 5.1.i shall therefore include not only implemented and adopted policies and measures (projections with existing policies and measures), but also planned policies and measures.

For details, see Chapter 4.1.1.ii. DCarb2 was used under the WAM scenario for national reporting purposes. iii-c Emissions projections in the energy sector (excluding transport) - The energy sector produces greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion and conversion of fossil fuels. The modelling of emission projections was performed based on the results of the new CPS model. The CPS model is still not fully calibrated for the CRF categorisation of greenhouse gas emissions, so the model results had to be adjusted according to the current greenhouse gas emission inventory. The WAM scenario specification depends on the EU scenario design logic, and in particular on the EUCO3059 scenario, which sets the 2030 targets at EU level as follows:  Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% in 2030 and by 80-85% in 2050 compared to 1990;  Reduce CO2 emissions in the EU ETS by 43% in 2030 and by 90% in 2050 compared to 2005, however this is based on the EU ETS carbon trajectories resulting from EU ETS market regulations, including the market stability reserve, as adopted;  Reduce greenhouse gas emissions in non-EU ETS sectors by 30% in 2030 compared to 2005, with country-specific obligations;  Achieve a 27% RES share in gross final energy consumption in 2030;  Energy efficiency expressed as a 30% reduction in primary energy consumption (1 321 Mtoe - excluding non-energy consumption of energy products) in 2030 compared to the 2007 baseline. In addition to the above PAMs, the scenario includes the following national policies:  The earlier decommissioning of solid fuel power plants. The decommissioning of the Vojany and Nováky power plants is anticipated in 2025 and 2023 in that order.  A scheme to promote RES in electricity generation with anticipated RES technologies such as solar, onshore wind turbines and biomass. The scenarios assume 50 MW in the 2021-2025 period, followed an additional 500 MW through auctions.  The continued development of nuclear energy is anticipated based on economic optimality.  Carbon capture and storage is excluded. The development of greenhouse gas emission projections in terms of CO2 equivalent under the decarbonisation scenario with additional measures (WAM-DCarb2) from the energy sector (transport projections are described in more detail in Chapter 4.1.1.iii-f) is shown in Table 72 and Figure 56.

EUCO scenarios include achieving the 2030 energy and climate targets and 27% or 30% energy efficiency targets. www.ec.europa.eu/energy/en/data-analysis/energy-modelling  Total greenhouse gas emissions (in Gg CO2 equiv.)

The anticipated termination of state coal mining subsidies for the mining company HBP, a.s. is anticipated in 2023;   .) in 2017. The emission factors and methodology specified in Chapter 4.1.1.ii-d were used to calculate fugitive methane and CO2 emissions. Table 73 shows the projected volume of coal mining between 2017 and 2040 under the WAM scenario. The possible continuation of domestic coal mining after 2023 will depend on its economic profitability after the end of state subsidies.

The projections of fugitive methane emissions from the extraction, transport and distribution of natural gas and oil in the Slovak Republic were estimated based on the following assumptions:  Oil production in the Slovak Republic is anticipated to cease after 2020;  Natural gas production will only decline slowly. There will be no significant changes to the consumption/distribution of natural gas and oil in Slovakia;  The redirection of natural gas supplies through the Nord Stream pipeline will reduce the amount of gas transported to other countries through pipelines in Slovakia, resulting in a reduction in fugitive CH4 emissions.

CO2 emission projections under the scenario with additional measures in category 1.A.3.b - Road transport were prepared under the DCarb2 scenario (WAM). The calculated projections show a clear downward trend in CO2 and N2O emissions to 2040,  but CH4 emissions increase under the WAM scenario compared to the WEM scenario, the most likely reason being the rising trend in the consumption of natural gas and biogas in road transport and its increasing share in fuel consumption, which has been included under the WAM scenario. The Slovak Republic, like other countries, implements various policies and measures to reduce the transport sector environmental burden. All policies and measures described in Chapter 3 for the transport sector are in line with the prepared low-carbon study of the Slovak Republic. Of these PAMs, only those for which emission reduction potential could be calculated and that relate to the Dcarb2 (WAM) scenario were evaluated and used for the preparation of projections.

Non-road emission projections were calculated in a simpler way using AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modelling. For these projections, only the WEM scenario was prepared, which is identical to the WAM scenario (Chapter 4.1.1.ii). iii-g Emissions projections from the Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) sector - a description of scenarios and methodology is given in Chapter 4.1.1.ii. The IPPU sector emissions projections incorporated in the EU ETS (large industrial enterprises) have been modelled together with projections from the energy sector (DCarb2 scenario), while IPPU sector emission projections that are not incorporated into the EU ETS have been modelled taking into account the trend in added value and the effect of the measures by product category. The trend in greenhouse gas emission projections expressed as CO2 equivalent under the scenario with measures (WAM-DCarb2) from the industrial processes sector, including F-gases, is shown in Table 79 and Figure 62.

Projections of SF6 emissions in category 2.G under the WAM scenario were prepared in accordance with the condition that the use of SF6 gas in new installations is prohibited. Table 79 shows total aggregated data on projections of process gas and F-gas emissions in the industrial processes sector under the WAM scenario. iii-i Emissions projections in the agricultural sector - only one scenario has been prepared in this sector, and this is described in detail in Chapter 4.1.1.ii. Projections of emissions in the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector - projections of emissions and capture in the LULUCF sector were based on the sectoral strategic document of the Rural Development Programme of the Slovak Republic for 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 taking into account the adopted National Forest Programme (NFP) of the Slovak Republic, as well as the NFP Action Plans for 2009-2013 and 2015-2020. The scenario with additional measures (WAM) shows the trend in emissions with afforestation of 23 000 ha of grassland by 2040 and the grassing of 50 000 ha of arable land after 2016. Based on this assumption, the scenario shows an increase in CO2 capture in forests and arable land and a slight decrease in meadows and pastures, as well as increased emissions from populated areas and other land categories.  The measures planned after 2016 are included under the WAM scenario. The PRV (2014-2020) was adopted as the continuation of the previous document, with no new specific measures introduced. The WAM scenario took into account the afforestation of 23 000 ha of agricultural land for the 2020-2040 period. The greenhouse gas emission calculation was based on the methodological procedures and mathematical relationships defined in the IPCC Good Practice Guidelines for 2003 for the LULUCF sector (IPCC GPG LULUCF). The values of the emission and conversion/expansion factors used for the projections are consistent with the 2016 LULUCF GHG emission inventory. They are also published in the National Inventory Report of the Slovak Republic 2018.

The WAM scenario shows the trend in emissions with the afforestation of 23 000 ha of grassland to 2040 and the grassing of 50 000 ha of arable land after 2016. Based on this assumption, the scenario shows an increase in CO2 capture in forests and arable land and a slight  decrease in meadows and pastures, as well as an increase in emissions from populated and other land categories.

These two main emission sources account for over 80% of the sectors estimated emissions. Emissions from composting, waste incineration, industrial waste disposal and industrial waste water treatment are estimated for the preceding 10 years (2007-2017); the constant 2017 value is used throughout the 2018-2040 period only in the case of municipal waste composting. WAM scenario description - Only the WEM scenario has been prepared for the waste water sector. There are no quantified targets available that would enable the definition of alternative scenarios for the 2018-2040 period. The Waste Prevention Programme 2019-2025 evaluates the specific objectives of the previous programmes and concludes that most of these objectives have not been achieved. The new programming document for 2019-2025 therefore defines new quantified targets for municipal waste that have been included under the WAM scenario:  reduce residual municipal waste by 50% compared to the 2016 level by 2025,  reduce biodegradable waste in residual municipal waste by 60% by 2025 at the latest,  reduce landfill rates to 10% of total municipal waste by 2035.  To achieve the above objectives, it was assumed that existing incinerators would continue to increase their operation to achieve full capacity, meaning 285 kt/year (the incinerator 70-80 kt/year and the Bratislava incinerator 135 kt/year). The model anticipated the creation of additional incinerators and a mechanical-biological waste treatment capacity of 560 kt/year.  iii-k International transport emission projections - these emissions are not included in the national balance. The data in Table 82 show that the projected greenhouse gas emissions from these categories make up a negligible share of total emissions, even for the WAM scenario.

Assessment of policy interactions (between existing policies and measures and planned policies and measures within a policy dimension and between existing policies and measures and planned policies and measures of different dimensions) at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, in particular to establish a robust understanding of the impact of energy efficiency/energy savings policies on the sizing of the energy system and to reduce the risk of stranded investment in energy supply The intention of the SR is to minimize the risk of stranded costs in existing energy facilities. For this reason, the completion of unfinished electricity sources and the gradual replacement of polluting sources using fossil fuels through reducing consumption and building RES-based sources remain priorities. In the area of heat supply, the priority is the maximum utilisation of existing district heating systems and their gradual transformation into efficient district heating systems with the possibility of changing the fuel base to RES, taking into account decreasing heat consumption as a result of thermal insulation. To optimize the decision-making and authorisation process, it is therefore necessary to take into account the interactions between the ETS, pricing, taxation and regulatory policies and the requirements for reducing environmental burdens. Aligning individual policies with investment objectives is a challenge for better regulation. Predictability and transparency in the decision-making process play important roles. This process will minimises the possibility of investment being thwarted and costs stranded. iii. Assessment of interactions between existing policies and measures and planned policies and measures, and between those policies and measures and Union climate and energy policy measures The SR is a leader in electricity generation using low-carbon technologies. Nuclear energy accounts for the largest share, contributing not only towards decarbonisation but also towards electricity supply security. The intention of the Slovak Republic is to use existing sources as long as possible, with regard to nuclear safety, and to continue to use such technology. This approach may seem restrictive in terms of meeting the EU RES targets, but will achieve better results in terms of meeting the decarbonisation targets. Natural gas is widely used for heat generation, and the Slovak Republic has one of the highest supply coverage rates. A gradual increase in the proportion of biomethane is in synergy with EU measures. 5.2. Macroeconomic and, as far as possible, the health, environmental, employment and education, skills and social impacts effects, including fair transition aspects (from the perspective of costs and benefits as well as cost-effectiveness), of the planned policies and measures described in Section 3 at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including a comparison with projections based on existing policies and measures  The whole of this chapter, by national economy sector (energy, industry, energy efficiency, transport), follows on from chapter No 4 (WEM scenario), which provides descriptions of the energy and macroeconomic model (CPS, Envisage Slovakia), prepared to allow Slovakia to address EU questions and policies relating to climate change and energy. Essentially, these analytical models differ in coverage and approach. On the other hand, together they represent a powerful tool for assessing climate policies and showing the impact of different policy packages. Both models draw on multiple data sources and are based on information used by the EU to develop scenarios (described in more detail in the introduction to Chapter 4). The macroeconomic model for Slovakia, which complements the energy model, uses the detailed results of the energy system from the CPS model and assesses impacts throughout the economy. It has all the features of a standard general economic equilibrium model but contains additional details on energy, electricity generation and emissions, so is also useful for assessing climate policies. The macroeconomic model is tailored to reflect the specific characteristics of the Slovak economy. Importantly, the demand for energy commodities in households and enterprises is price sensitive and captures the various options for electricity generation. Emissions are explicitly modelled. Various mitigation policies can be analysed using the Slovak-CGE model. Compared to the CPS energy model, the aim of the Slovak-CGE model is to simulate the wider economic effects of a shift towards a low-carbon economy.  5.2.1 Macroeconomic analysis of the WAM scenario  employment Based on the results of the WAM scenario, changes in the structure of the economy will lead to a redistribution of the workforce in various industries. We anticipate that sectors expected to grow (mainly export-oriented industries and capital goods industries) will need additional labour, while sectors expected to decline (mainly consumer goods production industries) will release labour. However, not all workers made redundant will find work in the new growing sectors, which could lead to rising unemployment. Overall, structural economic change in response to decarbonisation policies (Dcarb 2 scenario) appears to be negative in terms of aggregate labour demand. In the short term (partly due to delayed wage adjustments), reduced demand for labour will mainly be reflected in lower employment. In the long run, it will result in downward pressure on wages, especially approaching 2050.  Figures 66 and 67 illustrate these developments.  Figure 66 Total employment by policy scenario, 2015-2050; % change compared to the reference scenario   Key: Scenar WAM WAM scenario Source: Results of the Slovak-CGE model  Wages fall in the long run in parallel with labour market adjustments Figure 67 Real wages by policy scenario, 2015-2050; % change compared to the reference scenario  Key: Scenar WAM WAM scenario Source: Results of the Slovak-CGE model  5.2.2 Macroeconomic analysis of the WAM scenario - impact on GDP  The transition to a low-carbon economy may potentially support GDP growth in the long run, but on the other hand may lead to lower household consumption. Investments in energy efficiency will reduce energy costs and lead to long-term economic productivity gains. These investments need to be funded in the short to medium term. In industry and tertiary sectors, these energy efficiency investments will be passed on to consumers through higher product and service prices. Households will effectively finance the renovation of their buildings through energy savings. Households will also experience electrification costs in the transport sector, but this will not directly reduce consumption  they are expected to gradually replace their internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles with alternative fuel or hybrid vehicles (section 5.3, Table 85). Household consumption will however be affected by the higher product and service prices charged by enterprises to offset the costs of their energy efficiency investments, in particular investments in electricity generation. Based on the results of the WAM scenario, GDP growth is anticipated to rise by around 0.5% to 1.0% in the 2025-2035 period and by 3% to 4% in the 2040-2050 period (Figure 68), and household consumption to decline by 0.7% to 1.02% in the 2025-2035 period, and by 5% to 6% in the 2040-2050 period (Figure 69). Based on Figure 68 below, we can state that the GDP impact is favourable for the Dcarb2 (WAM) scenario in the long run Figure 68 GDP by policy scenario, 2015-2050, as the % change compared to the reference scenario  Source: Results of the Slovak-CGE model  Key: Scenar WAM WAM scenario  Figure 69 Private consumption by policy scenario, 2015-2050, % change compared to the reference scenario   Source: Results of the Slovak-CGE model  Key: Scenar WAM WAM scenario  According to the MEnv SR, reduced demand for fossil fuels will reduce Slovakias import expenditures but, on the other hand, modelling indicates a deterioration in trading conditions. The deteriorated trading conditions will mean that, from a macroeconomic point of view, when exporting, more factor resources will need to be exchanged for a given quantity of imported goods. Consequently, imports will decline while exports rise. The increase in net exports in the context of deteriorated trading conditions will consume GDP gains stemming from productivity improvements (energy efficiency) and contribute towards a decline in private consumption. If Slovakia focuses on investing in decarbonisation, non-energy investments may be squeezed out to some extent. Investments in energy efficiency and in the energy sector are significant - from 0.3% to over 2.0% of GDP in all years. The increasing prices resulting from enterprises offsetting their energy efficiency investment costs will lead to a decrease in Slovakias competitiveness, with a subsequent impact on  profitability. In addition, the decline in household consumption will reduce demand, thereby also impacting profitability. Decreasing profitability will discourage foreign investors from investing in the Slovak economy. Similarly, investments in electricity generation will squeeze out some non-energy investments. As shown in the following Figure 70, net exports will increase by more than needed to merely offset reduced consumption in the long run. Figure 70 Percentage of GDP expenditure by policy scenario, 2015-2050, % change compared to the reference scenario   Key: Sukromma spotreba Private consumption Verejne investicie Public investment Investicie do energetickej efektivnosti Investment into energy efficiency Cisty vyvoz Net exports Verejna spotreba Public consumption Sukromne investicie Private investment Investicie do energetiky Investment into the energy sector Source: Results of the Slovak-CGE model  It is also anticipated that the government will increase taxes or reduce transfers to ensure government budget sustainability during the transition to a low-carbon economy. As a result, the general government budget balance will remain broadly unchanged under all scenarios. Another option for the government would be to finance any shortfall through deficits, but this option was not modelled. In any event, an increase in public debt would ultimately have to be repaid through higher taxation or lower expenditure. The shift to a low-carbon economy will lead to lower revenue collection from indirect taxes (such as VAT) and direct taxes (including social security contributions). Indirect tax revenues will decrease due to the fall in household consumption, while direct tax revenues will decrease due to lower wages. The model does not define what specific change in taxation or the transfer system will be introduced to neutralize the budgetary impact, except that it is (or is almost) a non-distorting instrument (lump sum).

Overview of investment needs i. Existing investment flows and forward investment assumptions with regard to the planned policies and measures Increases in energy efficiency and extensive RES development will lead to higher investment spending as consumers shift to buying higher-efficiency energy products, equipment, appliances and vehicles. According to the following Figure 72, we can state that investment in energy efficiency by households and enterprises will increase rapidly after 2030. Figure 72 Investments in energy efficiency by sector, by policy scenario, 2011 to 2050, in EUR billions   Priemysel Industry Domacnosti Households Sluzby Services Source: E3-Modelling, CPS Technical Report As noted above, the analysis revealed a positive impact on GDP, particularly in the long term, and that the decline in consumption is largely stimulated by emission-mitigation policies outside Slovakia. The GDP formula follows the size of the investments in energy efficiency, where higher energy efficiency investments lead to lower consumption but ultimately to higher overall GDP. This impact is stimulated by crowding out private investment in energy efficiency. Lower private investment will distort the capital in the economy, leading to lower overall production. Household consumption will fall as households reduce consumption to pay energy efficiency investments, in particular building renovation. Investments in energy efficiency will grow. Towards the end of the period, investments in electricity generation will increase as Slovakia will build a new nuclear power plant in the model scenario. Exports will shrink because of the loss of competitiveness as efficiency investment costs are passed on to consumers, and also because of the lower production capacity of the economy due to the reduced capital. Importantly, the macroeconomic impact on Slovakia will not solely be due to its own domestic policies  over half the fall in consumption will be due to decarbonisation policies in the rest of the EU (modelled as a carbon tax in both the ETS and non-ETS sectors). Policies in the rest of the EU will lead to lower imports from Slovakia. For example, only about 50% to 60% of the decline in consumption in Slovakia between 2040 and 2050 will be due to domestic policies (including the pricing of ETS emissions in Slovakia), the balance being due to lower demand from the rest of the EU as a result of the deteriorated trading conditions.

Sector or market risk factors or barriers in the national or regional context It is important for future economic development in this field to develop sector-specific measures, as it is very difficult to develop a successful universal industry or scientific-research policy in a time of specialisation. This is increasingly related, inter alia, to support for scientifically excellent teams and their cooperation with practice and the relevant sectors, support for an educational focus on practice, or streamlining and significantly reducing administrative demands. The high energy intensity of industry as well as the share of industry in the countrys GDP are key challenges for the economic policy in the future in connection with the digital transformation and innovative technologies.  In research and innovation, the problem is a fragmented and in particular undercapitalized production sphere. Expenditure on research and development by enterprises in the Slovak Republic is low. There is only weak collaboration between universities and enterprises on R&D for innovation. Another problem is the lack of motivation for researchers to stay and work in Slovakia. The ambition of the SR in terms of competitiveness is to support investments that increase added value, emphasising business research and innovation. The limiting factor is the low share of public investment outside European structural and investment funds. iii. Analysis of additional public finance support or resources to fill identified gaps identified under point iii) As an EU Member State, Slovakia accepts the strengthening of the strategic approach in the cohesion policy with a view to further developing a coordinated and harmonized implementation of Union funds, which will be implemented based on the so-called general - shared governance, in particular for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund plus (ESF+), the Cohesion Fund, measures financed under shared governance for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF), the Internal Security Fund (ISF) and the Border and Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI), while simplifying and defining five clear cohesion policy objectives for the 2021-2027 period: 1. A smarter Europe - innovative & smart economic transformation; 2. A greener, low-carbon Europe; 3. A more connected Europe - ICT mobility and regional connectivity; 4. A more social Europe - implementation of the European pillar of social rights; 5. A Europe closer to citizens - sustainable and integrated development of urban, rural and coastal areas through local initiatives. This simplification will enable synergies and flexibility between the different components within a given objective and will eliminate the artificial differences between the different policies contributing towards the same objective, while providing a basis for thematic concentration for the ERDF and the ESF+. At the same time, synergies between the various EU instruments will be fostered through a strategic planning process that identifies common objectives and common areas for action under different programmes, such as the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), European Horizon, Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), Digital Europe Programme, Erasmus+, InvestEU Programme and LIFE.  5.4. Impacts of planned policies and measures described in Section 3 on other Member States and regional cooperation at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures i. Impacts on the energy system in neighbouring and other Member States in the region to the extent possible  The interconnections below contribute towards improving energy security and reliable supply in all the states concerned. In particular, bilateral cooperation at the level of the TSOs concerned is under way to support the preparation and implementation of cross-border investment projects in electricity infrastructure. Broader regional cooperation to support cross-border transmission projects and other key electricity  infrastructure projects is currently shown not to be needed. Discussions on future cross-border interconnections are taking place within ENTSO-E in the System Development Committee. As regards the electricity transmission infrastructure, the Slovak Republics priority is to complete the construction of new Slovak-Hungarian cross-SR) - (HU) - SR) and 400 kV R. Sobota (SR) - Sajóivánka (HU)). On the Slovak side, both lines are in the contractor procurement phase, while building permits for both projects have been issued. tion to include the planned 1x400 kV Ladce (SR) - Otrokovice (CZ) interconnection on the list of projects of common interest (PCI). This is an interconnection that would replace the gradually decommissioned 220 kV transmission system (TS) on both sides of the SR/CZ border. This reinforcement also includes a planned increase in the transmission capability of the V404 Varín (SR) - the upcoming renewal work by   Steps are being taken both by the State and the gas companies to secure gas supplies, based on which the Slovak Republic will be better prepared for possible gas supply problems. The Slovak Republic has supported interconnection projects with Poland and Hungary, as well as reverse flow projects from the Czech Republic and Austria.  The pipeline for the Slovakia and Hungary interconnection project was put into standard commercial operation on 1 July 2015 after the successful completion of construction and testing.  The Slovak-Polish gas interconnection project is part of the North-South Gas Corridor and forms an important element in the gas pipeline transit chain that will connect Eastern Europe from the Polish terminal on the island of Krk.  The Eastring gas pipeline project, in the sense of the concept to interconnect Western European markets with the countries of south-eastern Europe in particular, is a solution for strategic goal of maintaining or even increasing the volumes of gas transported through the Slovak transmission network. The implementation of the project would greatly contribute towards increasing the importance of Slovakias role as a crossroads for gas interconnections and its ability to ensure gas transit using reverse flow to the whole region. The gas pipeline, designed to be bi-directional, can therefore be considered a way for new potential suppliers  especially from the Caspian region or the potential so-called Turkish gas hub  to access European markets and increase the level of security through source diversification.  The strategic geographical location of the Slovak Republic and the relatively high transport capacity of the Druzhba pipeline on Slovak territory create realistic conditions for its connection to European transit routes.  The Druzhba-Adria project addresses the issue of oil transport by pipeline from the Russian Federation through Belarus, Ukraine, Slovakia, Hungary and Croatia. In 2015, the expansion of the Adria-Százhalombatta was completed and put into operation. This expansion and reconstruction almost doubled the original transit capacity. This project was included in the original PCI list.   The project for an oil pipeline in the direction of Schwechat is considered a strategic investment, and since 2013 has been considered a strategic corridor and project of common interest at EU level. The implementation of the oil pipeline project will ensure strategic interconnection with oil pipelines in Western Europe. With this step and if reverse pumping from Austria is ensured, oil supplies from non-Russian sources will be possible, thus reducing our dependence on oil from the Russian Federation.  At present, the suitability of routing the above-mentioned pipeline across the Slovak Republic is being analysed. Based on the latest survey, an oil pipeline route of 12.814 km with a connection point at the Slovnaft a.s. refinery was recommended, ending on the Slovak-Austrian border near Kittsee.  ii. Impacts on energy prices, utilities and energy market integration  Binding European Community regulations are the decisive starting point for the regulatory policy. These are reflected into the setting of reasonable energy prices for consumers to maintain transparent and non-discriminatory regulatory principles. Energy prices are anticipated to rise due to higher demand, system costs, deregulation, implementation of European measures, as well as increased environmental protection costs.  The activities of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) towards developing a coordinated governance system for the construction of a functioning single European gas and electricity market from the perspective of energy security and reliability in individual EU Member States, or framework guidelines to serve as a basis for the preparation of network regulations, are also reflected in cooperation with the Regulatory Office for Network Industries (RONI). The cooperation between the national regulator and ACER is also enshrined in the regulatory policy developed by the Regulatory Council (a RONI body), which defines regulatory policy priorities for the relevant regulatory period with the ambition to apply regulatory tools and regulatory methods that ensure the transparent and non-discriminatory performance of activities in network industries, including monitoring mechanisms for compliance with competition rules, compliance with transparency obligations, possible abuse of a dominant market position and, last but not least, consumer rights protection, with an emphasis on the most vulnerable consumer groups.  iii. Where relevant, impacts on regional cooperation  When forecasting future developments, the transmission system operator eustream, a.s. also monitors long-term trends and estimates of gas consumption across the EU. When considering the suitability of projects for implementation, it takes into account the need for secure supplies, not only for the Slovak Republic but also for vulnerable regions such as south-eastern Europe and Ukraine in particular. Another criterion taken into account is the desire to contribute towards the integration of the gas markets in the most efficient way, in particular by using existing infrastructure to the greatest extent possible. One positive example is the implementation of the TRU service, which connects the Austrian and Czech gas markets through the existing Eustream transmission infrastructure. Thanks to this service, the European Unions efforts to integrate markets in a simple and cost-effective way without unnecessary investment are being put into practice.
