87 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3. Policies and measures planned   3.2. Dimension Energy efficiency  Energy efficiency is one of the most important factors in achieving the transition to a carbon neutral economy, while also generating growth, employment and investment opportunities. This is why energy efficiency is not only an opportunity for development and modernisation, but is also viewed as a priority source of energy in the sense that energy that is not produced/consumed is the safest, cleanest and cheapest energy. This vision is in for its energy policy. i. Compulsory energy efficiency schemes and alternative policy measures in accordance with Articles 7- A and 7-B of Directive 2012/27/EU (revised)  ACTION STRATEGY 2.2. PROMOTE MORE EFFICIENT EQUIPMENT DESCRIPTION The objective is to make the current stock of equipment (electric appliances and electronic equipment) more efficient by direct substitution as well as disincentives for purchasing new equipment with significantly lower energy and environmental performance to the best practices in the market. This can be achieved by encouraging a change in behaviour in the acquisition of such equipment and energy consumption. SECTOR(S) Residential, Services ACTION MEASURES To promote more efficient equipment, the following action measures are planned:   2.2.1. Promote the substitution of inefficient electric equipment  Through a specific programme designed for the purpose, promote the substitution of home appliances and other inefficient electric equipment essentially for domestic use, thus reducing the specific consumption of the domestic equipment stock. [Expected date: 2020-2021]  2.2.2. Promote adequate dissemination of information and communication for the new generation of energy labels due to the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 The new generation of labels resulting from the implementation of the new energy labelling system for different types of home appliances, electronics, lighting and climate control will start appearing on products and in stores at the end of 2020 and early 2021, as well as later dates (2025 and 2030), pursuant to the legislation governing each type of product. The scale of the new labels translates into a rescaling of previous labelling. To ensure the success of this new generation of labels it is essential to focus on careful, coherent and effective information and communication for consumers so that they have more knowledge in this regard, contributing toward their energy literacy.

PROMOTE ENERGY AND RESOURCE EFFICIENCY DESCRIPTION Promote energy and resource efficiency in the industrial sector, optimising as far as possible the nexus between energy, water and materials efficiency at the level of manufacturing processes. This will increase the productivity of resources, separate the economic growth from using these resources and increase competitiveness. SECTOR(S) Industry; Energy ACTION MEASURES To promote energy and resource efficiency, the following action measures are planned:   7.2.1. Promote the implementation of more efficient technologies  Optimising engines, pumping systems, ventilation systems and compression systems, combustion systems, heat recovery, industrial cold. Similarly promote efficient lighting. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   7.2.2. Promote highly-efficient cogeneration based on renewable sources of energy  Considering its potential for significant savings of primary energy and its preferential use by industries that are intensive consumers of energy, highly-efficient cogeneration will continue to be promoted. To this end, highly-efficient cogeneration systems and those that use renewable resources will be increased, making it possible to improve the cost of production, thus ensuring that industry is more competitive, while simultaneously contributing toward achieving energy and climate goals. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   7.2.3. Review the Energy Efficiency Regulations for Industry  With respect to the industrial sector, the System to Manage Intensive Consumption of Energy (Sistema de Gestão dos Consumos Intensivos de Energia  SGCIE) is in force, which aims to promote energy efficiency and monitor the energy consumption of these facilities. It is applied to plants that are intensive consumers of energy. Considering the role and size of this sector, there is clear opportunity to create new requirements and goals for the industrial sector.

Long-term strategy for the renewal of the national residential and non-residential building stock, both public as well as private26                                                             26 Including policies, measures and actions to stimulate significant cost-effectiveness and policies and actions to reach the most poorly performing segments of the national building stock, in accordance with Article 2-A of Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings, amended by Directive 2018/844.  90 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3. Policies and measures planned    ACTION STRATEGY 2.1. PROMOTE THE ENERGY RENEWAL OF BUILDING STOCK AND NZEB BUILDINGS DESCRIPTION The objective is to mobilise the necessary efforts to promote energy efficiency by renovating and rehabilitating buildings. Rehabilitating buildings and making them more efficient will make it possible to simultaneously achieve various objectives including reducing energy bills, reducing emissions and improving levels of health and comfort. This is why the energy renovation of buildings must be considered as a priority. SECTOR(S) Residential, Services ACTION MEASURES To promote the effective renewal of the building stock, the following action measures are planned:   2.1.1. Promote a long-term strategy for the renewal of buildings  Develop and implement a long-term strategy that enables the promotion of building renovation, contributing to an increase in energy efficiency of the building stock and changing the paradigm of recent decades, which has focused solely on new construction, contributing in turn to an increase in the quality of the existing building stock, which is increasingly in need of urgent action to raise comfort levels and generate energy efficiency gains. This strategy will include: surveying the national stock of real estate; identifying economically feasible approaches for renovations that are relevant for the different types of buildings; identifying policies and measures to encourage in-depth renovations of buildings; future perspectives for the sector; estimate of energy savings and other possible benefits. A multidisciplinary working group can be created to monitor the implementation of this strategy. [Expected date: 2020]   2.1.2. Update the Buildings Energy Certification System (Sistema de Certificação Energética dos Edifícios  - SCE)  Updating the SCE, with respect to transposing Directive (EU) 2018/844 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018, amending Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings (EPBD), will serve diverse purposes, including recording and monitoring actions implemented in buildings and their technical systems. In this regard, in response to some of the new requirements of the EPBD, the energy certification of buildings is expected to reinforce the integration of diverse information: recording the technical solutions that characterise buildings and opportunities for improvement; providing end users with energy certificates, thus enabling easy access to this document for the diverse contexts in which it is needed; recording maintenance operations and inspections for the technical systems of buildings; records of operations to install, substitute or upgrade technical systems in buildings; recording the energy consumption of large commercial and service buildings; reinforcing interoperability with other public administration systems and platforms.  Updating SCE will also contribute toward improving the information available to consumers, through accessible and transparent advisory resources, preferably digital platforms, such as support counters or platforms that bring together supply and demand for solutions to improve energy efficiency, such as one-stop-shops, the implementation of renovation passports or platforms to register works relating to buildings that have an impact on energy performance. [Expected date: 2020-2021]   2.1.3. Provide a new version of the Energy Certificate  In keeping with the new requirements of the EU directive on the energy efficiency of buildings, the image and role of energy certification for buildings will be reinforced, with the introduction of a new version that is also aligned with the expectations of the target audience. Specifically, as the new energy certificate will be easier for citizens to understand it will provide greater clarity on the characteristics and performance of their buildings, both by means of qualitative assessments  in place of quantitative assessments  as well as by creating references that can be assimilated more easily, such as level of comfort indicators, thus complying with the objectives of an energy efficiency policy for buildings.  The new certificate is likewise the path to follow for any improvements that are implemented as well as the corresponding impact of these improvements. The planning and priority of these measures is in keeping with the strategy to be implemented for rehabilitation. This will firstly involve reducing energy needs and then act with respect to technical systems, including those that use renewable energy.     91 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3. Policies and measures planned     In the context of reinforcing the role of energy certification, this document is expected to: support assessments of the energy performance of buildings and compliance with the applicable requirements at the time of the respective issuance or renewal, in a manner that is adapted to the new European legislative context; help support periodical assessments of the energy performance of large commercial and service buildings, with a view to identifying opportunities for improvement; prior support for consumers in juridical matters and transactions involving buildings, by providing detailed information on energy for improvement in buildings and implementing them; help support access to funding instruments, helping identify the state of the building and improvement needs, and, subsequently, accompanying, monitoring and validating the implementation of measures to improve energy efficiency; help support the conferring of tax benefits, encouraging the implementation of improvements, as well as designing or renovating buildings with a view to achieving a high energy performance. [Expected date: 2020-2021]   2.1.4. Review the Energy Efficiency Regulations for Residential and Service Buildings (public and private)   These regulations aim to promote energy upgrades for public and private residential and service buildings, ensuring greater comfort and quality for their users.  Reviewing these regulations, by transposing the energy performance of buildings Directive, is aimed at the following objectives, among others: (i) promote solutions that are capable of improving the energy performance of buildings, contributing toward reducing energy demand, the need for heating and cooling and to improve the energy performance of buildings; (ii) promote highly efficient alternative systems that safeguard compliance with NZEB requirements; (iii) define requirements in the charging infrastructure for electric mobility; (iv) adapt buildings to integrate smart technologies, such as aut(vi)  promote documentation and records for the installation, substitution or upgrading of technical systems; (vii) ensure greater transparency in methodologies for calculating the energy performance of buildings, by suitably adapting existing standards. [Expected date: 2020-2021]   2.1.5. Promote NZEB buildings  Buildings that have negligible energy needs, known as NZEB, are characterised by having a very high energy performance and having very low or almost no energy needs. They are largely covered by energy from renewable sources, whether produced on site or nearby.  Promoting the implementation of the NZEB concept in new buildings, y consumption and the promotion of energy from renewable sources. Since implementing the NZEB concept will establish a new paradigm, the involvement of the main players from the construction sector will be promoted. It will be necessary to establish measures that encourage these players to adopt this paradigm, along with studies and the dissemination of a portfolio of technical solutions that enable new and existing buildings to gradually achieve the level of NZEB. In the case of existing buildings, guidelines must similarly be established to support rehabilitation projects that advocate monitoring consumption, the implementation of efficient and durable equipment and optimising consumption in a sustainable manner, promoting the understanding and suitability of existing mechanisms in the specific context of these buildings and their potential.

Description of policy and measures to promote energy services in the public sector and measures to remove regulatory and non-regulatory barriers that impede the uptake of energy performance contracting and other energy efficiency service models92 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3. Policies and measures planned    ACTION STRATEGY 1.5. DECARBONISE GOVERNMENT DESCRIPTION Decarbonise public administration in the areas of transport and mobility, buildings and public procurement, leading by example in the implementation of innovative and ambitious policies, providing the public administration with low-carbon mobility options, reducing energy intensity and increasing the efficiency of its transport fleet, promoting a low-carbon building stock and adopting low-carbon requirements for public procurement. SECTOR(S) Mobility and Transport; Energy; Public State Sector  ACTION MEASURES To promote the decarbonisation of government, the following action measures are planned:   1.5.1. Promote the decarbonisation of the building stock of the Central, Local and Regional Public Administration  The Public Administration Energy Efficiency Programme (ECO.AP) will be reviewed to promote the decarbonisation of the stock of state buildings. The ECO.AP review aims to define new goals and targets for this programme, potentially expanding its scope to local and regional public administration. The review will consider the legal framework of the Ministry Interlocutor for the ECO.AP Programme, in the context of the state central administration, and the function of the Local Energy Manager, reformulating the model for implementing Energy Efficiency Management Contracts and promoting funding models that promote economies of scale and reduce the perceived risk associated with energy efficiency investments, the creation of a tax, budgetary and regulatory environment that favours investments in energy efficiency measures by public administration services and bodies, reinforcing mechanisms to monitor and check compliance with the obligations of public administration services and bodies in relation to energy efficiency and energy certification and the inclusion of an emissions reduction aspect as well as the reduction of other resources (e.g. water and paper).  An Energy Efficiency Barometer has been implemented to achieve the objectives set out in the ECO.AP, with a view to characterising, comparing and disseminating the energy performance of different public administration entities. The Barometer plays a central role in the strategy to promote energy efficiency in the public sector, providing detailed information on the structure of the energy consumption of the public sector and helping define policies and measures to promote the efficient use of energy resources in the public sector. This tool will be promoted by developing new functions in the Barometer (upgrading and refining indicators), creating mechanisms to automate energy consumption records for buildings, training and awareness actions and personalised support for the concerned entities. [Expected date: 2020-2023]   1.5.2. Promote the implementation   Solutions to be adopted include promoting the electrification of buildings and an increased use of renewables, by installing thermal solar collectors to heat buildings or high-consumption equipment such as swimming pools, sports facilities, schools and multi-purpose pavilions and the use of more efficient climate control solutions, as well as the installation of solar systems to produce electricity as self-generation. [Expected date: 2020-2030]  1.5.3. Promote ecological public procurement in keeping with the respective National Strategy for Ecological Public Procurement Incorporate low-carbon requirements in the public procurement of energy services and goods, equipment and buildings, the public purchase of vehicles and transport services as well as in roadworks and public procurement of other goods and services. Furthermore, the option to acquire low-carbon services instead of products (servitization) will also be promoted. [Expected date: 2020-2030]   1.5.4. Promote the introduction and use of low-emissions vehicles and sustainable mobility in the state sector  Promoting increasingly sustainable mobility must begin with state institutions, leading by example in adopting innovative and ambitious policies. By creating the obligations to comply with quotas to acquire electric vehicles for the state administration, as well as incentives to introduce electric vehicles in the fleet of state vehicles, as in the example of the ECO.MOB project, it will be possible to achieve high levels of penetration of electric vehicles in the state fleet. It is thus important to prepare a new programme for sustainable mobility for the public administration to provide continuity for the ECO.MOB project and pursue its objectives. 93 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 3. Policies and measures planned    Mobility management will also be promoted, including promoting the use of public transport and initiatives such as car sharing and carpooling, as well as a shift in behaviours, including the development of eco-driving training actions.

PROMOTE ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN PUBLIC LIGHTING DESCRIPTION Public Lighting (PL) is responsible for a significant share of electricity consumption, especially in municipalities, corresponding to a substantial annual financial burden. Furthermore, there is considerable potential for energy savings which must be promoted by municipalities. In this regard, it is essential to promote investments in an efficient and modern PL system, which enables necessary levels of lighting for the safety of pedestrians and vehicles, increases energy savings, enables the introduction of new functions and applications to manage and control consumption and enables Smart Cities. Policies will be implemented that promote the development of efficient and modern PL, promoting energy upgrades to achieve energy savings and ensure suitable lighting, pursuant to standards in force for public streets throughout Portugal.  SECTOR(S) Energy; Municipalities ACTION MEASURES To promote energy efficiency in public lighting, the following action measures are planned:   2.4.1. Define a legal system to upgrade and install Public Lighting infrastructure  Given the need to create and apply suitable technical rules, with a proactive and educational attitude, and to aid the work of planners and installers of PL infrastructure, it is important to create and publish a technical manual that covers, as a minimum, the main concepts of lighting technology and criteria for PL projects (including providing calculation tools) based on the EN13201 standard. It is equally important to review, in coordination with APA, the definition of criteria set out in the national strategy for ecological public procurement in the context of public lighting. [Expected date: 2020-2021]   2.4.2. Introduce a Public Lighting Consumption Management system   In coordination with the other measures and to meet the targets set out in Art. 7 of Directive (EU) 2018/2002, which are compulsory, it is important to create a system to manage the energy consumption of public lighting (Sistema de Gestão dos Consumos da Iluminação Pública  SGCIP). This will be instituted to promote energy efficiency and to monitor the energy consumption of the national public lighting infrastructure. It is equally important to promote the installation of smart systems to measure consumption. SGCIP will address the requirement to prepare and report records for existing public lighting and an Energy Upgrade Plan for public lighting for the 2030 horizon as well as an annual report on energy savings achieved by the entities responsible for managing this infrastructure. The purpose of the Energy Upgrade Plan for public lighting is to create conditions to improve the quality of lighting in public streets and spaces while also reducing the respective energy consumption. It also promotes records for existing infrastructure and upgrades according to needs on a case-by-case basis.
