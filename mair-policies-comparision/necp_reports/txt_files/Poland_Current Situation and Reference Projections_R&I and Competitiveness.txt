4.6. Dimension Research, innovation and competitiveness 4.6.1. Current situation of the low-carbon-technologies sector and its position on the global market  In Poland, emission abatement actions are carried out mainly in the energy sector40, which accounts for 42% of national emissions. This is due to the domination of coal in the fuel structure of energy sources and the low efficiency of generation units. As this coal-dominated structure cannot be changed quickly, efforts are primarily focused on developing technologies that increase the efficiency of primary energy conversion in coal-fired power and heat generation units. In addition to gas sources, coal-fired power plants are a necessary system component by guaranteeing a stable operation of the system, especially in view of the increasing share of renewable energy sources that are characterised by unstable operation (wind and photovoltaic power plants). Nuclear power plants may also be used as system sources, but their rate of development is limited. Clean coal technologies 4.6.1.1 High-efficiency coal and lignite-fired power plants The basic way to reduce pollutant emissions in new coal-fired power generation units is to increase generation efficiency and reduce specific pollutant emissions by increasing fresh steam parameters (temperature and pressure). The 900-1,000 MW coal-fired units in Opole and Jaworzno were built using a supercritical parameter technology, where the steam temperature is 580-600°C and the pressure is 260-300 bar. In December 2017, a unit was commissioned at the Kozienice power plant with a capacity of 1,075 MW and an efficiency of 45.6%. Preparations are underway to construct super-supercritical units in which the steam temperature is approx. 620°C, the pressure is 315 bar and the net efficiency is in the range of 43% to 46%. New steel grades are required to reach ultra-supercritical parameters, i.e. the pressure of 350 bar and the steam temperature of approx. 700°C, which enable a power plant to reach a net efficiency above 48%. Such steel grades are currently being developed in global technological centres. The electrical capacity of coal-fired units under construction typically ranges from 850 to 1000 MWe. 4.6.1.2 Integrated gasification combined cycle coal-fired power plants Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants can be an alternative to ultra-supercritical power plants. In these units, the first step is to gasify the fuel and the resulting synthesis gas is used in the gas-steam system. IGCC units can achieve an efficiency of over 50%. Only demonstration plants are currently in operation in Europe (Vresova  400 MW, Czech Republic; Schwarze Pumpe  200 MWt, Germany; Buggenum  250 MW, Netherlands and Puertollano  350 MW, Spain). Also outside Europe, IGCC technology is still at the demonstration phase. A unit in Mississippi shows why this is the case. The power plant in Kemper County was to be the largest power unit using coal gasification technologies under commercial conditions (582 MW of installed capacity). However, because of economic considerations, a decision was taken in mid-2017 to convert the plant to natural gas combustion. In a situation where easily accessible gas fuel is cheap, there is no pressure to develop new and therefore risky technologies. 4.6.1.3 Coal-fired power plants with CCS and CCUS systems Increasing the efficiency of sources of electricity and heat generation for a low-emission economy is universal, as it reduces the specific emissions of all pollutants. Measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which form part of climate policies, are addressed separately. The technology recommended by the European Commission for the clean use of fossil fuels in power generation involved the use of CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) technologies. However, CCS technologies have proved to be very difficult to apply widely. A greater potential is seen in the development of carbon processing                                             40 Narodowy program rozwoju gospodarki niskoemisyjnej [National programme for the development of low-emission economy], Ministry of Energy, Warsaw 2015.  85  technologies, the use of CO2 in carbochemistry and the production of fuels from carbon, including biofuels. Taking this into account, the development of Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) technology is recommended41. The use of this technology in the combustion of fossil fuels is considered, especially by European Union bodies, as the best  and in the future the only acceptable  form of energy generation from fossil fuels. It is not a foregone conclusion when these technologies will be commercially available, given that the last 10 years have not brought any significant progress, especially in terms of cost reduction. According to the International Energy Agency, the costs of carbon capture range from 20 to 80 USD/t CO2, the costs of transport over 100 km from 1 to 10 USD/t CO2, and the costs of gas injection and injected gas monitoring from 2 to 5 USD /t CO2. Their verification is not possible, as no industrial installation of this type has yet been put into operation. However, the European Union requires that new fossil-g of the technology as soon as it reaches commercial maturity. This is expected to happen in 2030 at the earliest and only if prices of GHG emission allowances reach a minimum level of 50 EUR/t CO2. Despite a wide-ranging research effort, it will be extremely difficult for CCS technologies to become commercially mature. CCS and CCUS research and development are focused on: - technologies for carbon capture from gases from air combustion of primary energy carriers, especially coal. Such systems may be added to existing power plants and included in newly built ones; - pre-combustion carbon capture technologies, where fuels are in the form of synthesis gas or natural gas with the separation of carbon and hydrogen streams. Hydrogen can then be used for electricity generation or as a fuel in fuel cells and the carbon stream is converted to a form suitable for storage or sequestration; - oxy-fuel combustion technologies, in which oxygen is used instead of air in the combustion process. The result is exhaust fumes containing mainly H2O and CO2, which can be easily captured after steam condensation; Carbon capture from air combustion fumes involves the process of chemical absorption of carbon dioxide. This technology is the closest to full commercial maturity. However, in order for this technology to be used in the power industry, it is necessary to increase the efficiency of the currently tested installations by about 50 times42 and to solve several technical problems with the reduction in concentration of other gaseous pollutants (SO2 and NOx). This can significantly increase the cost of CCS installations and affect their cost-effectiveness. Recent evaluations of the profitability of industrial use of CCS technology in power generation are not optimistic43. Pre-combustion carbon capture technologies require prior gasification of solid fuel. The gasification of fossil fuels is a process well known and available on an industrial scale for many years, but not very widely used for energy purposes. IGCC installations require further development to tackle many of the remaining technical problems. The market also lacks high-efficiency hydrogen turbines that would be adapted to the needs of CCS. The technology of combustion in an oxygen-enriched atmosphere consists in the removal of nitrogen from the air using the traditional air separation technology. The fuel is then burned in a mixture of oxygen and carbon oxide. Such combustion results in exhaust gases consisting mainly of CO2 and water vapour. These flue gases can be thickened to produce a stream of highly concentrated CO2. Combustion in a pure oxygen atmosphere, mixed with CO2, is well understood on a small scale, and there are also many industrial plants with oxygen combustion. However, in cases where coal is the fuel and very large installations are used, such combustion is not yet sufficiently well researched in terms of the required scale of the process. Demonstration facilities which have been set up in several European countries (Italy, the Netherlands, Germany) have not been successful. In Poland, an attempt was made to implement CCS technology as part of the construction of a 858 MW lignite-2 was planned to be injected into storage over a period of 10 years. The capacity of the installation was to correspond to 260 MW of electric                                             41  [New technologies and the future of the energy sector], Prof. dr Science and Technology Centre of Energy. 42 2  [Options for reducing carbon emissions and their impact on effectiveness and costs of energy production from coal], Krz 43  [Polish power industry yesterday and today, a paper presented at the Energy Innovation Congress], Chmielniak, 2017.  86  he project was shown not to be economically viable and it was abandoned. Gas turbine combined cycle power plants Gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) power plants are becoming increasingly important in the Polish power system and are the most typical electricity generation technology based on gaseous fuels. High efficiency of such units, currently exceeding 61%, is achieved by combining two cycles: an open-cycle gas turbine system and a closed-cycle steam system. In the former cycle, natural gas is burned in a gas turbine which drives an electricity generator. Exhaust fumes entering the gas section cools down from the temperature of 1600°C at the inlet (1700°C behind the combustion chamber) to approx. 500-650°C. They are then directed to a recovery boiler where their energy is used to produce steam, which is the operating medium of the second cycle. The produced steam feeds the steam turbine that drives the electricity generator. This system enables recovering, through the steam cycle, some of the exhaust gas from the gas turbine which is lost in the open gas turbine cycle. Compared to coal-fired units, gas-steam units are characterised by higher efficiency, lower investment and operating costs, a relatively short construction time and low emissions. The main factor affecting the cost of electricity generation in gas-steam units is the cost of fuel, whose share may amount to up to 80% of the total cost of generation, while unit capital expenditures are low (up to EUR 850,000/MW). Given the significant investments in the gas transmission infrastructure, as well as Poland's efforts to diversify its supply sources (e.g. through the Baltic Pipe and LNG Terminal projects), we can expect an increase in the supply of raw material on the Polish market. Cogeneration Cogeneration is a very effective way of increasing the efficiency of primary-to-final energy conversion, while reducing specific emissions of pollutants. For this reason, Poland should be increasing the share of cogeneration in electricity generation, while promoting the development of indigenous technologies in this area. The potential for innovation concerns in particular the development of technologies for electricity and heat cogeneration, as well as district cooling combined with technologies for the production of gaseous and liquid fuels using methods of fermentation or gasification of biomass, or agricultural, animal or municipal waste, sewage, etc., i.e. low or even cost-free raw materials. The expansion of the district heating network combined with the liquidation of individual heat sources should guarantee compliance with Article 7b of the Energy Law, which requires that buildings with a capacity of not less than 50 kW must be connected to the district heating network, unless an energy undertaking has refused to do so due to economic unprofitability. Appropriate mechanisms of financial support for the development of the district heating network may change the economic calculation of network investments and thus contribute to the reduction of pollutant emissions. It is also important to support the development of innovative technologies for generating cooling from district heating (adsorption chillers, installations in buildings) and to put in place appropriate mechanisms for the commercialisation of this solution which, in addition to reducing the load on the power grid on hot days and enabling the operation of cogeneration units in summer, will contribute to improving the economic efficiency of investments in district heating networks. Systemic support for such solutions should cover both heating companies (with regard to the construction of district heating substations) and final customers. The development of a system of investment support for tri-generation technology is important in view of the potential for the generation of cooling from district heat in large district heating systems, the result of which would be to reduce demand for peak capacity of the power system during the summer season and increase the annual utilisation of the capacity of power units operating in cogeneration and tri-generation modes (which would improve their profitability). Methane for energy purposes The following measures are necessary to increase the use of methane for energy purposes: - Identification of existing methane resources that can be recovered for energy purposes.  87  - Large-scale implementation of deposit demethylation technology by increasing the effectiveness of the support system for electricity generation from methane. - Large-scale implementation of the technology of capturing methane from ventilation air and recovering methane by fracking coal-seams prior to extraction. Methane recovery from coal deposits by fracking is in particular a method of choice for companies responsible for the extraction of raw materials. According to PGNiG S.A.'s estimates, between 150 and 200 bcm of natural gas can be extracted from the Upper Silesian Coal Basin. Under the INGA Innovative Gas Industry programme, approx. PLN 60 million will be allocated to innovative technologies in the area of coal demethylation. Biomass Biomass is the most popular source of renewable energy in Poland and is used mainly for heating. No additional carbon dioxide is emitted to the atmosphere during the combustion and co-combustion of biomass, as the volume of carbon dioxide produced is balanced with the volume absorbed by burnt plants at the time of their growth. However, in the short term, biomass combustion causes carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere. For a more sustainable use of biomass for energy purposes it is important to: - abandon co-firing as an inefficient way of generating electricity; - further increase local biomass use and reduce biomass imports; - adopt a new approach to the management of land for biomass production, taking into account the balance of emissions and carbon recovery from green areas. Biogas plants Biogas plants are an important technology in the field of RES. However, due to high investment costs, they require incentives to stimulate their development. The promotion of biogas plants in Poland requires: - removing social barriers to investment in agricultural biogas plants; - organic recycling of biodegradable waste to obtain raw material for energy generation; - promoting the use of micro- and small biogas installations in agriculture and agri-food processing; - using existing water and sewage facilities as municipal biogas plants; - reviewing and adjusting financial instruments for small biogas plants. Germany is currently the largest market for biogas plants. In 2015, a total of over 4 GW of power was installed in fewer than 9,000 units. However, a slowdown in biogas investments is expected due to the high costs of this technology, combined with a slow decline in costs (compared to other renewable technologies). Wind energy The onshore wind energy sector in Poland exhibited the highest rate of development thanks to a favourable support system based on green certificates. The potential of onshore wind energy, as estimated by the International Renewable Energy Agency, is such as to enable, in theory, the installation of up to 15,000 MW of capacity by 2030. Offshore wind energy is a promising area of RES development. Its theoretical potential based on the availability of locations for offshore wind farms, wind conditions and the maximum productivity of offshore wind farms is estimated at 8 GW of installed capacity and 48-56 TWh of energy per year. Taking into account systemic, economic, legal and social conditions as well as realistic investment plans, the market potential of onshore wind energy is estimated at approx. 10 GW of installed capacity by 2030, compared to less than 5 GW installed in 2015. According to data provided by Wind Europe, wind energy is the fastest growing renewable energy sector. In 2000, wind power accounted for only 2.4% (12.9 GW) of the capacity of the European power system. By 2015, this figure increased already to 15.6% (141.6 GW), 0.1% more than the share of hydroelectric power. According to the forecasts of the aforementioned organisation, the installed capacity of onshore wind farms is likely to double by 2030. Photovoltaics  88  Photovoltaics is the second area of significant RES development in Poland after wind power. Photovoltaic panels/modules are the most important element of the system responsible for power generation by home solar power plants. They are built of solar cells made of semiconductors. Their task is to convert solar energy into direct current. A photovoltaic system uses at least a few panels so as to obtain a number sufficient to produce enough current to power electrical devices. Photovoltaic panels are usually installed on rooftops or mounted on posts in the ground. The location must be such as to protect the surface of the panels from factors that may damage or contaminate them in a way that reduces efficiency. Energy storage Apart from adapting the power system to an increased share of unstable RES, it is necessary to develop energy storage technologies44. Electricity storage forms an important element of a market-based approach to balancing energy demand and supply, while ensuring reliability, efficiency and security of electricity supply. As part of the smart grid, it will also complement distributed generation from renewable sources, which is particularly vulnerable to generation instability due to changing weather conditions. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), a global organisation for the preparation and publication of international standards for all electrical, electronic and related technologies., published Electrical Energy Storage  White Paper in December 2011. The document addresses the topic of energy storage, with particular emphasis on available systems and the most popular trends in their application. Currently, pumped-storage power plants account for more than 99% of the world's energy storage. The total capacity of these power plants exceeds 100 GW, while the total capacity of all other energy storage facilities is not higher than 1 GW. Efficiency of energy recovery in such a process is approx. 80%. The response time to changes in demand does not typically exceed one minute. On the minus side, such power plants require the use of two water tanks at significantly different heights, which is usually not viable in lowland areas. Large water reservoirs created by dams at hydroelectric power plants are another type of water-based energy storage. Water can be trapped in the reservoir when the demand is low and released when it is high. The overall effect is then the same as with pumped-storage power plants, except that no energy needs to be spent on pumping. Technically, batteries are the simplest form of energy storage. Batteries enable energy to be stored in an electrochemical form that lends itself easily to recovery. They are a convenient energy store, as charging and discharging does not require any additional infrastructure. Up to 85% of energy input can be recovered. High price and limited service life are, however, the disadvantages. The growing popularity of electric vehicles would enable the application of batteries as dispersed energy stores. during that time, charging it at night when energy is cheap and using it during the day. A car battery can store 20-50 kWh of electricity, which is sufficient to meet 2-5 days of average household demand. Hydrogen systems are a modern form of storage technology. Hydrogen can potentially be used for large-scale energy storage. It can be produced in large quantities from methane and steam by steam reforming or by water electrolysis. The hydrogen obtained in this way is used as a high-energy fuel in combustion engines or fuel cells. Solar thermal collectors In addition to economic benefits, the widespread use of solar collectors has a positive impact on the environment and public health. This is due to the fact that collectors are an economically interesting alternative for households that are not connected to district heating and obtain heat energy from domestic installations fuelled by low-quality coal or burnt waste. The use of solar collectors is developing quite robustly in Poland, although in 2013 fewer collectors were installed (274,000 m2) than a year before (over 300,000 m2). This has been the first instance where the rate of development of the Polish collector market dropped since 2000, i.e. the year when the Institute of Renewable                                             44 Magazynowanie energii elektrycznej [Electrical energy storage], Hajdrowski K., Enea Operator (Energia Elektryczna, issue No 11/2012).  89  Energy commenced to research that market. The development of the collector market has so far been driven by the subsidy programme implemented in 2010-2014 by the National Fund for Environmental Protection and  In the case of households which obtain heat from electricity, the installation of a collector on the building will involve a significant reduction in demand for electricity, which will contribute to improving the security of the power system on a nationwide scale and reducing pollutant emissions. Heat pumps As in the case of solar collectors, the growth of the heat pump market will stimulate the development of modern lines of industries and services in Poland and will contribute to reducing the use of dirty fuels for space heating and hot water production. Wider use of heat pumps and ground source heat exchangers for heating purposes requires: - Monitoring the quality of existing heat pumps. - Raising awareness of the benefits of installing heat pumps and providing information on how to properly operate pumps. - Reviewing the existing legislation on heat pumps in order to create a stable legal framework for the development of this market. - Reviewing support instruments (other than those resulting from the RES Act). - Creating a scientific environment involved in the development of heat pumps. Geothermal energy Poland has good geothermal conditions for the construction and operation of installations providing hot water for heating and for use in, for example, geothermal centres. As much as 80% of the country's territory is covered by 3 geothermal provinces: Central European, Pre-Carpathian and Carpathian. However, geothermal waters can be used only in relation to 40% of the country's territory (extraction is profitable when the temperature reaches 65°C up to a depth of 2 km, the salinity does not exceed 30 g/l and the capacity of the source is adequate). The water in these areas has a temperature of 30-130°C and is found in sedimentary rocks at a depth of 1-10 km. Natural outflows are very rare (the Sudetes  drój). The first Polish --1993. Since 2001, the wells and Zakopane. The cost of building an installation with a capacity of approx. 10 MW, which is sufficient to connect 1,000 single-dwelling houses, totalled PLN 20 million for one of the wells in Podhale. Use of waste Low-carbon transformation will not be possible without using residual waste fractions in low-carbon energy processes in order to supplement the recycling-based system of waste management. Reuse is an economically efficient method of waste management. The use of waste as fuel in waste incineration or co-incineration plants is a way of managing the residual fraction of municipal waste (not suitable for recycling), especially in the context of EU regulations limiting landfilling. However, valuable raw materials should primarily be recovered from waste in order to meet the EU's reuse and recycling targets for municipal and packaging waste and to reduce the use of primary resources, which will contribute to a closed-loop economy. Electromobility Regardless of the low-carbon sources of power generation, it is essential to create an electromobility ecosystem that will comprise vehicle manufacturers and users and the energy sector operators providing electromobility services. This will contribute to reducing emissions from transport, which account for 12% of total greenhouse gas emissions. This requires action on several levels: from awareness-building among potential users through the introduction of a system of benefits for electric vehicle users, the stimulation of development of manufacturers in the electromobility segment and the adoption of regulations conditioning the development of electromobility to the adaptation of power networks to the needs of vehicles. In response to these challenges, the Ministry of Energy has developed the Clean Transport Package consisting of the Electromobility Development Plan (setting out the conditions for the development of electric vehicles), the National Policy Framework for the Development of Alternative Fuel Infrastructure (setting out targets and tools  90  for the development of infrastructure necessary for the use of alternative-fuel vehicles) and the Act establishing the Low-Emission Transport Fund tasked with supporting the development of alternative fuel infrastructure and the creation of a market for alternative-fuel vehicles. Electromobility is treated as a priority in the Clean Transport Package due to the fact that, in addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from combustion vehicles, it can be used for electricity storage. The prerequisite will be the creation of an appropriate infrastructure for charging car batteries and feeding accumulated energy into the power grid. The concentration of public financial resources will be an important tool for the development of electromobility: in addition to the establishment of the Low-Emission Transport Fund, an important role will be played by research programmes of the National Centre for Research and Development (NCBiR) dedicated to electromobility and the creation of a programThe role of the Fund may also be to create future consumers of electric vehicles by launching pilot projects. Nuclear energy Construction of nuclear power plants All countries where nuclear power plants are operated or built recognise nuclear power as an economic and sufficiently safe power generation technology. For the same reasons, other countries are continuing their plans to develop nuclear power in the future. Notwithstanding the above, there are developments in nuclear power plant technology, relating in particular to reactors, aimed at increasing the use of uranium fuel and improving operational safety in order to overcome fears of nuclear power, even those irrational ones. These measures are all the more so justified in view of the fact that nuclear power is a universally accepted direction of development of low-emission energy generation. Development is focused primarily on light water reactors (LWRs), pressurised water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs), which are the most common types of reactors used in nuclear power plants operated and built worldwide (over 80%). Generation III+ LWRs have passive emergency core cooling systems that do not require an external power supply for at least 72 hours after the most severe failure. One of the priority directions for the development of nuclear power technology is to construct units of smaller capacity (below 700 MW) that would offer competitive energy generation costs while complying with all nuclear safety requirements. Modular reactors are a forward-looking solution, offering the option to assemble the required capacity from 150-300 MW modular units. Modular high temperature gas reactors (HTGRs), which can be used not only to produce electricity but also process heat for the chemical industry, are another promising technology. The disposal of low- and intermediate-level waste is controlled worldwide and does not pose a major problem. In Europe, almost all countries operate landfills for such waste. In Poland, the National Landfill Site for highly radioactive waste. For this reason, the construction of a new landfill for low- and intermediate-level waste is expected. A greater problem, albeit one that is also successfully tackled on a global scale, is the storage of spent fuel and highly radioactive waste, especially from spent fuel reprocessing plants. The planned landfill site for high-level waste will be put into operation at a time appropriate to the fuel cycle and fuel post-processing. The supply of reactors and entire nuclear steam generation systems in nuclear power plants is dominated by large companies, which traditionally compete with each other on the global market. They will also compete for nuclear power contracts in Poland. These are first of all: - Framatome, which offers power plants with EPR reactors with a gross capacity of 1,650 MW; - General Electric, which offers, via its subsidiary GE Hitachi, ABWR power plants of 1,350 MW and ESBWR power plants of 1,535 MW; - Korean KHNP, which offers PWR power plants of 1,400 MW. As a member of the European Union, Poland must comply with Community requirements. In the field of nuclear power, these are the provisions of the Euratom Treaty and Euratom normative documents. According to Euroatom requirements, all nuclear installations under construction in the EU must be notified and receive a  91  favourable opinion from the European Commission. Despite the tighter safety requirements, nuclear power plants are competitive in relation to organic fuel sources, especially when the costs of purchasing carbon emission allowances are factored in. The Polish Nuclear Power Programme has been developed and adopted by the government45. This is the first comprehensive document on nuclear power in Poland. The main objective of the Polish Nuclear Power Programme is to implement nuclear power in Poland, which will contribute to ensuring the supply of appropriate volumes of electricity at prices acceptable to the economy and the society, while complying with environmental protection requirements, especially those regarding zero carbon emissions. The overall objective will be implemented through the following specific targets: 1. Establishing and updating the legal framework for the development and operation of nuclear power. 2. Ensuring the highest achievable level of safety of nuclear power plants. 3. Implementing a rational and effective system of radioactive waste and spent fuel management, including the construction of a new landfill site for low- and intermediate-level waste. 4. Developing institutional support for nuclear power. 5. Increasing and maintaining public support for the development of nuclear power by, amongst others, raising public awareness. 6. Strengthening the national system for responding to radiological incidents with respect to nuclear power operation, including strengthening the national radiation monitoring system. 7. Ensuring qualified personnel for the development and operation of nuclear power. 8. Creating a robust, effective scientific and research support for nuclear power. 9. Increasing the innovation and technological advancement of Polish industry. 10. Ensuring conditions for a stable fuel supply to nuclear power plants. 11. Preparing the National Power System (NPS) for the development of nuclear power. 12. Creating stable economic and financial conditions for the development of nuclear power. The Polish Nuclear Power Programme provides an opportunity to develop new technologies through associated research and development projects. Similarly to the UK, such projects have a dual purpose. On the one hand, they respond to future energy needs, and on the other hand, they are aimed at developing indigenous competences, technologies and products. Production and use of tight gas Tight gas, which is locked in low-permeability sandstones, is a promising alternative to conventional coal and natural gas. It can be used to produce electricity and heat with low atmospheric emissions. The Polish Geological Service estimates its deposits in Poland at 1.5-1.9 bcm (based on geological surveys in the regions -Kalisz, Wielkopolska-Silesia and the western part of the Baltic Basin). 4.6.2. Current level of public and private investment in research and innovation in low-carbon technologies, current number of patents and current number of researchers Data on investment in innovation are provided by the International Energy Agency, which periodically publishes data on public spending (defined as funds from state budgets and companies controlled by central government) in the area defined as Research, Development and Demonstration (RD&D) of new energy technologies. Total investment in RD&D is divided into seven main areas: energy efficiency, fossil fuels, renewable energy sources, nuclear power, hydrogen and fuel cells, other power and storage technologies, other cross-cutting energy technologies. This classification is different from the one used by the European Commission in its reporting, which is why the reported spending differs between the two sources even in relation to similarly characterised research areas, such as for example nuclear power.                                             45 Resolution 15/2014 of the Council of Ministers of 28 January 2014 on the multi-annual programme referred to as the Polish Nuclear Power Programme (Polish Monitor [M. P.] of 2014 item 502).  92   Figure 40. Total Research, Development and Demonstration budget in selected countries in 2005, 2010, 2015. Source: IEA miliony euro EUR million Francja France Niemcy Germany Wielka Brytania United Kingdom Polska Poland Japonia Japan USA US The above figure presents public spending on RD&D in selected global economies. No significant changes in innovation investments are observed over 2010-2015. According to the IEA's report, energy innovation budgets in Japan and the USA remained at a similar level in 2013-2015. The distribution of financial resources between RD&D sectors also differs from country to country.  Figure 41.

For example, countries with developed nuclear power allocate a significant share of their RD&D budgets to power (in 2015: 44%  France, 39%  Japan, 33%  Great Britain, 26%  Germany). The US spends only 14.5% of its energy RD&D outlays on nuclear power projects, but since its budget is the largest among the countries compared, it ranks second (after Japan) in the above comparison. At 34%, the fossil fuel sector has a significant share of the RD&D budget s fuel mix. The chart below presents a comparison between the RD&D budgets of the countries that are members of both the EU and the IEA and the outlays incurred by the European Commission, understood as the expenditure from the European Commission's budget for research and development under programmes, grants and projects, such as for example Horizon 2020. The biggest differences can be seen between nuclear power investments. However, this is related to the investment priorities adopted by the European Commission, which puts more emphasis on modern, renewable and sustainable energy sources. National R&D investment46 The Europe 2020 strategy sets out a target for increased R&D investment which is tailored to implementation capacities of the individual Member States. As part of this strategy, Poland is required to allocate 1.7% of its GDP to R&D in 2020. (2010  0.72% of GDP, 2015  1% of GDP)47. The European Union has committed itself to allocating a total of 3% of the GDP for R&D in 2020 compared to 1.93% in 201048. National statistics provide information on total research and development expenditure, without showing specific data for low-carbon technologies or priority areas of the Energy Union. According to the data of Statistics Poland, capital expenditure on Science and Technology totalled PLN 18.06 billion in 2015, an increase of 54.5% compared to 2011. According to Energy R&I financing and patenting trends in the EU, a publication by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) on the monitoring of progress in Member States in the area under consideration, Poland has allocated EUR 88 million to research and innovation, of which as much as EUR 42.6 million has been allocated to investments in integrated energy systems. Renewable energy sources and bioenergy ranked second, with EUR 16.4 million invested in research and innovation. Capital expenditure in both these areas has significantly decreased since 2011 (by 19% and 57%, respectively). In other analysed areas, such as energy efficiency in industry or CCUS, a relatively similar level of capital expenditure has been maintained. In Poland, as elsewhere in the Community, private spending is higher than public spending. The greatest difference between public and private sector investments can be seen in the area of renewable energy sources, were private spending is ten times public spending. The same is true for investment in renewable fuel innovation (private sector spending is three times higher) and energy efficiency technologies in industry (six times higher).                                             46 Nauka i technika w 2015 r. [Science and technology in 2015], Statistics Poland. 47 Research and development activities in Poland, Statistics Poland. 48 Operational Programme Smart Growth 2014-2020  94  According to IEA statistics, Poland allocated EUR 88.2 million to RD&D. This figure is similar to that presented by the JRC, but both of these institutions have different research priorities. For example, according to the IEA, 34% of the funds were invested in fossil fuels, a category that is not monitored by the JRC. According to IEA data, 22% of public spending, i.e. approx. EUR 19 million, has been allocated to innovation in renewable sources. National innovation investments Energy Union priorities According to data of Statistics Poland (GUS), innovation expenditure of Polish industrial enterprises totalled PLN 31.1 billion in 2015, in which large undertakings49 (representing 27.2% of the total number surveyed) had a 93% share. The estimated innovation expenditure of the surveyed service sector enterprises totalled PLN 12.6 billion, in which large enterprises (representing 16.7% of the total number surveyed) had a 93.8% share. Industrial enterprises invested primarily in fixed assets (77.3% of total innovation expenditure), with a majority of funds being allocated to the purchase of technical machines and equipment, means of transport, tools, instruments, movables and fittings (51.2%) and in research and development (PLN 5.1 billion or 16.5% of total innovation expenditure). Services sector enterprises invested primarily in fixed assets (38.5% of total innovation expenditure), and in research and development (PLN 4.1 billion or 32.7% of total innovation expenditure). Innovation spending on research and development in large enterprises in 2015 totalled 16.7% in industry, and 32.1% in the surveyed sections of the services sector (G-U sections) (compared to 19.6% and 24.2%, respectively, in 2014). Enterprises financed their innovation activities in 2015 from their own resources. Innovation spending accounted for 62.0% of all outlays in industrial enterprises and 73.0% in services enterprises. R&D personnel 157,900 persons were employed in research and development (R&D) in Poland in 2015, including 118,500 researchers. Employment in R&D totalled 109,200 full-time equivalents, of which researchers accounted for 82,600 FTE. Research and development intensity, i.e. the share of internal R&D expenditure in the GDP, stood at 1.00% in 2015, an increase from 0.75% in 2011. 6.8 out of 1,000 persons employed in general (in FTE) were employed in R&D in 2015. This figure was almost twice as low as the EU average in 2014 (13.0). In 2014, Poland ranked 23rd among the Union countries in terms of employment in research and development (in FTE) per 1,000 persons employed in general and 22nd in terms of employment of researchers (in FTE) per 1,000 persons employed in general. In 2014, Poland ranked 20th among the EU countries in terms of R&D intensity, which was twice as low for Poland as for the Union as a whole. Patents in Poland 4,815 applications for the protection of an invention were filed with the Patent Office of the Republic of Poland in 2015, an increase of 17.6% compared to the previous year. In 2000-2005, the total number of invention applications ranged from 6,000 to 8,000 per year. Since 2006, there has been a change in the structure of applications compared 2000-2005 in favour of those filed by national applicants. In 2015, national applicants filed 4,676 invention applications with the Patent Office of the Republic of Poland, i.e. 18.7% more than in the previous year. According to the aforementioned Joint Research Centre study, most patents in Poland are filed in the area of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources (40 and 39 respectively in 2013). These two areas were most active in terms of the number of patents in 2008-2013. Innovation in renewable fuels was the third area of patent activity. A total of 146 patents were filed in 2013 in the priority areas of the Energy Union (16 fewer than in 2012 and almost four times more than in 2008). 4.6.3. Current level of energy costs taking into account the international context Given the role that energy plays in production processes and in broadly understood services, energy costs are                                             49 Employing over 49 persons.  95  a key factor in terms of competitiveness. When analysing energy costs, both energy price levels and energy intensity must be taken into account. In 2014, energy purchases accounted for 2.1% of the total value of goods produced in the manufacturing sector. However, this value varies greatly between different sectors of the economy. Since 2010, barring some short periods, wholesale electricity prices in the US have been lower than in Europe. In the first half of 2016, US prices were 35% lower than the EU average. The difference is mainly due to low energy production costs in the US. Over the past few years, low prices of natural gas have led to an increase in the production of electricity from this fuel, partially displacing coal from energy generation. Due to an increasing dependence on gas-based generation, energy prices in the US are more volatile than in Europe. In recent years, the costs of electricity generation have also fallen in the EU, a development that has been driven by reduced demand, falling fossil fuel prices and the gradual penetration of renewable energy into the energy mix. Over the last few years, Japanese wholesale electricity prices have been significantly higher than in the EU. The price difference reached its peak after the Fukushima nuclear accident when cheap nuclear power plants were temporarily replaced by gas-fired ones. However, after 2014, due to falling prices of imported LNG and the restarting of some nuclear reactors, energy generation costs decreased, putting pressure on wholesale electricity prices. By 2016, Japanese wholesale electricity prices returned to pre-Fukushima levels, but remained well above European prices. In the first half of 2016 prices in Japan were almost twice as high as in the EU. Wholesale electricity prices in Poland remained slightly below the European average from the end of 2010 until early 2014. In the first half of 2016, the average European price fell to around 30 EUR/MWh, while wholesale prices in Poland remained relatively stable at around 39 EUR/MWh. This price level was maintained in Poland in 2017, whereas the years 2018 and 2019 brought an increase in electricity prices on the wholesale market.  *Electricity prices for Poland are presented on a quarterly basis Source: Trinomix et altri study (2018); ARE S.A. databases Figure 42.

Wholesale prices of natural gas in selected countries worldwide, 2008-2016. Source: Platts, Thomson Reuters Europa Europe USA US Japonia Japan USD/mmbtu USD/mmbtu The above figure shows wholesale gas prices in three points: United States (Henry Hub), United Kingdom (NBP hub) and Japan (JKM spot price). A clear price divergence occurred between 2010 and 2013. On the other hand, wholesale prices have fallen significantly in all regions since 2014, leading to a convergence of regional price levels. As mentioned earlier, demand for gas in Japan increased after the Fukushima accident, causing LNG prices to rise. However, after 2014, LNG prices fell significantly and prices in Japan decreased by almost 80% between February 2014 and April 2016. Since 2010, with the advent of the shale gas boom, US gas prices have been consistently lower than those in Europe and Asia. Since January 2015, the Henry Hub average monthly price has remained below 3 USD/mmbtu and even temporarily dropped below 2 USD/mmbtu. Gas prices in this hub exceeded 3 USD/mmbtu only in the period of December 2016 to January 2017 and April to May 2017. On the other hand, the fall in the price of oil brought down the production of oil-related gas, which affected the competitiveness of shale gas. European prices have also fallen significantly since 2014 as a result of a combination of several factors: low demand, continued LNG imports and falling oil prices are putting pressure on hub prices. The devaluation of the euro against the US dollar has also contributed to this trend, lowering European prices expressed in US dollars. As a result, the difference between the NBP price and the Henry Hub price fell to an average of 2 USD/mmbtu in the first nine months of 2016. However, both electricity and fossil energy prices vary considerably between EU countries. This is mainly due to differences in production capacities and the availability of fuels for energy needs.  97   Figure 44. Final electricity prices in the industry sector, excluding taxes, in selected countries from 2012 to the first half of 2019 (data according to the IEA) podatkami) Electricity prices in the industrial sector (including taxes) Niemcy Germany Japonia Japan Polska Poland Wielka Brytania United Kingdom USA US Prices for industrial customers (excluding taxes) in Poland and Germany show a high convergence. This is mainly due to the proximity of the two countries and the resultant electricity interconnections which cause interactions between the two markets. Factoring in the tax burden in the above table, the energy price in Germany is also higher than in the UK, while the price for the industrial sector in Poland remains at a similar level (the average tax according to IEA data in the analysed period was less than 5 EUR/MWh). Clear differences can be seen in electricity prices among countries that are not interconnected, such as the US, Germany and Japan. Such comparisons are driven mainly by factors such as the costs of energy carriers and energy transmission. However, the competitiveness of the economy is affected not only by the energy cost alone, but also by energy intensity. Real Unit Energy Cost (RUEC) is an indicator that combines energy cost and energy intensity and measures the amount of money spent on energy needed to obtain 1 unit of value added in the generation sector (excluding refineries). The higher the indicator, the higher the share of energy cost in the overall cost structure of the generation sector in a given country. RUEC is calculated as the ratio of energy costs in current prices (energy input consists of the sum of four product categories (1) coal and lignite, (2) peat, crude oil and natural gas, (3) coke, refinery products and nuclear fuels, (4) electricity, gas, steam and hot water) over value added in constant 2005 prices. This indicator can be interpreted as the product of the actual energy price and energy intensity50.                                             50 RUEC = EC/VAb = EC/(VAs*PVA) = EC/(QE*PVA) * QE/VAs, where: EC - energy cost in current prices, QE - energy input expressed in energy units, VAb - value added in current prices,  98  As a measure of energy costs in the industrial sector, presented as a percentage of added value, RUEC is used for international comparisons in this area. A comparison of real unit energy costs expressed as a percentage of value added in the downstream industry in individual countries of the European Union and a comparison between the EU28, the US, Japan, China and Russia for 2005, 2011 and 2014 are shown in the figure below.

Source: Second Report on the State of the Energy Union, 2017. zmiana: 2005-2014 change: 2005-2014 A series of conclusions and observations can be drawn from this figure. First of all, energy costs increased, in some cases significantly (Luxembourg, Belgium), between 2005 and 2011. Then energy costs (expressed by RUEC) stopped growing and decreased by 6.6% for the Union as a whole in 2011-2014. Nevertheless, the ncreased by 11.5% over 2005-204. In 2014, the lowest energy costs in the downstream industry were recorded in the US, followed by the EU28, Japan, Russia and China. It must be taken into account that the prices of energy carriers paid by industrial customers in the US are lower than in most EU countries, while prices in Japan are in most cases higher than EU prices (Fig. 4.71 and 4.72). A fall in costs for the EU28 can be explained by the decreasing energy intensity of the manufacturing sector (which is linked to However, in 2005-2014, actual unit energy costs fell by 7.9%, placing Poland among the 11 European countries where energy costs fell in the analysed period. The highest energy costs were recorded in Bulgaria, Belgium and Cyprus, which is due to the predominance of energy-intensive industries.

As can be seen in the graphs above, energy carriers in Poland are amongst the lowest priced in Europe. This is mainly due to the nature of fuel demand by the national economy. Most of the Polish power industry uses cheap domestic coal while liquid fuels are not widely used (unlike in, for example, Italy). On the other hand, Figures 62-64 show the ranking of EU countries in terms of electricity prices expressed in EUR/MWh in the second half of 2016 for three categories of industrial customers, differing in their annual consumption levels. These figures illustrate the large variation in energy prices both between countries and between industrial consumers within one country depending on the level of consumption. Electricity prices in  105  Poland are lower than the average EU price for each consumption range. Figure 49.

An increase in prices of all energy carriers has been observed in the last two years. In percentage terms, this increase is as follows: 6.5%  natural gas, 16.6%  steam coal, 28.8%  coking coal, 1.3%  electricity, 11.6%  light heating oil, 7.5%  diesel, 4.9%  petrol and 9.5%  LPG.  108   Figure 52.

Most of the differences resulting from different industrial structures in individual EU countries were eliminated in the calculation of the average EU energy intensity. The rate of improvement in Poland is a result of both greater specialisation in less energy-intensive industries and of improved energy efficiency. In recent years, the rate of improvement of energy intensity has slowed down both in EU countries and in Poland. In 2010-2017, this figure stood at 2.2% in Poland and 2.6% in the EU28.  109   Figure 53. Comparison of energy intensity of the downstream industry in the EU28 and Poland expressed in -2017.

Objectives, policies and measures established at national level to ensure an adequate contribution to the new European approach to research and innovation. In the current conditions of globalised economy, economic growth based on, amongst others, innovation and knowledge is the path leading towards the country's sustainably successful development. Adopted by the Council of Ministers on 14 February 2017, the Strategy for Responsible Development is currently the principal state document in the area of medium and long-term economic policy. The Strategy for Responsible Development aims to coordinate actions in key sectors of the Polish economy and to use the science sector in pursuing strategic objectives. According to the document, innovative technologies are the main mechanism and source of social and economic development, and an increase in expenditure on research and development is the driving force behind the country's economic growth and the innovativeness of the economy. The strategy also refers to the challenges faced by the Polish energy sector, as the technological transformation of this sector may be a factor that will accelerate Poland's economic development. 1. Directions for Energy Innovation Development Responding to the global acceleration of changes in the area of energy, the Ministry of Energy prepared a paper entitled Directions for Energy Innovation Development. Its aim is to stimulate innovation and target actions at key and most productive areas while enhancing indigenous technological and industrial potential. The programme is designed to launch innovative processes in the Polish energy sector through public funding and involvement. It also gives a coherent boost to innovation activity in the private sector. At the same time, it is important to activate leading business operators in the Polish energy sector and increase their commitment, including in financial terms, to research, development and implementation. The Directions for Energy Innovation Development are to increase the coherence and alignment of policy documents at the level of government administration and State agencies in the field of development and innovation policy for the energy sector. This will allow for an effective use of existing resources and achievement  110  of economic and development objectives, while providing an impetus to policy-making based on the most up-to-date assessment of trends and challenges for the sector. Detailed objectives for the development of energy innovation are presented in the figure below.  Figure 54. Objectives for the development of energy innovation.

To meet the above objectives, it is necessary to define the selected areas of action. It is not possible to stimulate the development of all technologies and solutions. For this reason, four main areas of development of energy innovation have been identified through an analysis of the potential of the Polish energy sector and industry,  111  global technology trends and local resources that ensure energy security and underpin the competitiveness of the Polish energy sector. These areas will be adapted as progress is made and external conditions change.  Figure 55. Areas of energy innovation development.

National Action Plan on Energy Efficiency for Poland An updated National Action Plan on Energy Efficiency for Poland is planned to be adopted in early 2018. It states, amongst others, that the objectives will be achieved by making maximum use of existing mechanisms and organisational infrastructure. their plans to the European Commission. Plans are drawn up periodically, every 3 years. The current plan is an update of the document adopted in 2014. It contains an updated description of measures to improve energy efficiency in different sectors of the economy, adopted in connection with the implementation of the 2016 national energy efficiency target, as well as additional measures to achieve the overall energy efficiency target of 20% savings in primary energy consumption in the European Union by 2020. The plan is based on the assumption that policies aimed at increasing the energy efficiency of the economy will be continued and will translate into a reduced energy intensity of the economy. It is also planned that these actions will be based as much as possible on market mechanisms and will rely to a minimum extent on budgetary funding. The objectives will be implemented according to the principle of least cost, i.e. by making maximum use of existing mechanisms and organisational infrastructure and that the national potential will be used to improve energy efficiency. Poland overachieved its national energy efficiency target understood as realising by 2016 final energy savings of at least 9% of the average inland consumption of such energy in 2001-2005. Poland has seen a steady decrease in the energy intensity. The decreasing energy intensity is due to the rate of energy consumption being outpaced by the GDP growth rate. In 2006-2015, the average annual rate of improvement in energy intensity exceeded 3%. When adjusted for climate conditions, the rate was slightly lower. The most important financial instruments supporting energy efficiency investments in Poland include programmes implemented by the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management  as well as funds from the Operational Programme Thermomodernisation and Repairs Fund. 3. National Action Plan on Renewable Energy One of the priorities of least 15% share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption, including at least 10% share of renewable energy in transport. The obligation to adopt the above target results directly from Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. In fulfilment of the obligations set out in the directive, the Council of Ministers adopted on 6 December 2010 the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy (NAP), which was subsequently submitted to the European Commission. The NAP sets national targets for the share of energy from renewable sources consumed in transport, electricity, heating and cooling in 2020. The Act of 20 February 2015 on renewable energy sources (Journal of Laws 2017, item 478, as amended) is currently the basic legal act governing renewable energy sources. The Act implements into Polish law two basic EU directives on RES, namely: - Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC (OJ L 140, 5.6.2009, p. 16, as amended); - Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, amending Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC (OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, p. 1). The basic assumptions of the RES Act are as follows: - increasing energy security and environmental protection through, amongst others, efficient use of renewable  113  energy sources; - rational use of renewable energy sources, having regard to the implementation of a long-term economic development policy, the fulfilment of obligations resulting from international agreements, and the improvement of innovation and competitiveness of the Polish economy; - developing mechanisms and instruments to support the production of electricity, heat/cooling and agricultural biogas in renewable energy installations; - developing an optimal and sustainable supply of electricity, heat/cooling and agricultural biogas from renewable energy installations to final customers; - creating innovative solutions for the production of electricity, heat/cooling and agricultural biogas in renewable energy installations; - creating new jobs as a result of an increase in the number of new renewable energy installations being put into operation; - ensuring the use of by-products and residues from agriculture and the industry using agricultural raw materials for energy purposes. 4. Act on electromobility and alternative fuels The Act of 11 January 2018 on electromobility and alternative fuels implements Directive 2014/94/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure (further Directive 2014/94/EU) into Polish law. The Directive requires Member States to develop alternative fuels infrastructure. States should ensure the deployment of electric vehicle recharging points, CNG and LNG refuelling points, and LNG bunkering points. The Directive also puts Member States under an obligation to adopt technical specifications, harmonised rules for recharging electric vehicles, and rules on consumer information, as provided for by Directive 2014/94/EU. The Act on electromobility and alternative fuels is the first document that comprehensively addresses, from the regulatory viewpoint, the principles of development and operation of alternative fuel infrastructure, in particular the development of networks of electric vehicle charging points and the operation of the charging service. The Act aims to stimulate the development of electromobility and the use of alternative fuels in transport. This will enable Poland to increase its energy security and independence, as well as improving air quality in cities. Moreover, an increased use of alternative fuels in transport will translate into the development of modern technologies on the Polish market. The Act lays down, amongst others, the rules for building core infrastructure for the distribution of alternative fuels in order to ensure favourable conditions for its creation. The expansion of the core network will enable the free movement of vehicles using alternative fuels across the country. In accordance with the National Policy Framework for the Development of Alternative Fuel Infrastructure adopted by the Council of Ministers in March 2017, the core network will comprise 6,400 recharging points and 70 CNG natural gas stations to be located in cities and along key express routes. The rules of operation of this infrastructure and the entities responsible for the construction and management of recharging stations and natural gas stations are also defined. This should enable the creation of a core infrastructure network for alternative fuels, thus contributing to the realisation of the objectives of the Act and of the national framework. The Act also provides for the creation of clean transport zones in cities where entry will be restricted to vehicles powered by alternative fuels, such as electricity, natural gas or hydrogen. This solution is primarily aimed at improving air quality in large cities, where concentrations of pollutants are typically the highest. The Act offers a number of benefits for electric vehicle users. These include the exemption from excise duty on purchase of an electric vehicle (which will bring down the prices), a more favourable rate of depreciation, the right to use bus lanes, free parking in paid parking zones. purpose of powering an electric vehicle, a hybrid vehicle, a zero-emission bus, a motor vehicle other than an electric vehicle, a moped, a bicycle or a bicycle trolley within the meaning of the Act of 20 June 1997  Road Traffic Law. Recharging of electric vehicles is a new type of business activity. Although the recharging service consists in enabling the recharging of vehicles for a fee in a publicly available recharging station, it is not sale of electricity within the meaning of the Energy Law and as such does not require a licence.  114  The Act marks the second stage of transposition of the provisions of Directive 2014/94/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure into Polish law. It was preceded by the adoption of the aforementioned National Policy Framework for the Development of Alternative Fuel Infrastructure, which is a strategic document setting out objectives and instruments to support market and infrastructure development in relation to electricity and natural gas (CNG and LNG) used in road transport and water transport. 5. Polish Nuclear Power Programme The Polish Nuclear Power Programme (  PPEJ) was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 28 January 2014. It envisages the construction of two nuclear power plants with a total installed capacity of 6,000 MW. The main objective of the Polish Nuclear Power Programme is to implement nuclear power in Poland, which will contribute to ensuring the supply of appropriate volumes of electricity at prices acceptable to the economy and the society, while complying with environmental protection requirements. The overall objective will be implemented through the following specific targets: - establishing and updating the legal framework for the development and operation of nuclear power, - ensuring the highest achievable level of safety of nuclear power plants, - implementing a rational and effective system of radioactive waste and spent fuel management, including the construction of a new disposal facility for low- and intermediate-level waste, - developing institutional support for nuclear power, - strengthening the national system for responding to radiological incidents with respect to nuclear power operation, including strengthening the national radiation monitoring system, - ensuring qualified personnel for the development and operation of nuclear power, - creating a robust and effective scientific and research support for nuclear power, - increasing the innovation and technological advancement of Polish industry, - preparing the National Power System (NPS) for the development of nuclear power industry. The document is being updated. 6. The Ministry of Energy's Clean Energy HUB programme Clean Energy HUB is a new initiative of the Ministry of Energy to support the development of the Polish energy sector and thus contribute to the development of new technologies. The aim of the project is to provide comprehensive support for innovative energy technologies and to organise a platform that will contribute to facilitating their uptake by large energy operators in Poland, as well as to their promotion abroad. Initiatives in the fields of electromobility, low-carbon technologies, clean coal technologies, recycled energy, smart urbanisation or renewable energy are eligible for participation in the project. Clean Energy HUB will support the development of the energy sector in Poland by targeting Polish and foreign undertakings which have a direct influence on the energy market, including by adding electric cars to their fleets or using green solutions in business. This is a practical example of what public, business-friendly solutions should look like. The Ministry of Energy focuses on developing innovation, improving the qualifications of entrepreneurs and increasing their chances for development through access to foreign markets and economies of scale. 7. The national plan for increasing the number of low-energy buildings The national plan includes a definition of a low-energy building, reflecting existing conditions and economically justifiable measures to improve the energy performance of buildings. In addition, it outlines government actions taken to promote low-energy buildings, including the design, construction and alteration of buildings in a way that ensures their energy efficiency and increases the use of renewable energy in new and existing buildings, as well as sets out a timetable for achieving the targets. The timetable is set out in the Regulation of the Minister for Infrastructure of 12 April 2002 on the technical conditions to be met by buildings and their siting (Journal of Laws 2015, item 1422, as amended), which implements some of the provisions of Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings. According to that timetable, all new buildings occupied and owned by public authorities are to be nearly zero energy buildings from 1 January 2019 and all new buildings  115  are to be nearly zero energy buildings from 1 January 2021. 8. Legal framework on innovation Financing research and development in the field of innovation is subject to statutory regulation. The Act of 4 November 2016 amending certain acts determining the conditions for innovative activity (Journal of Laws 2016, ards the end of 2016, increased the tax relief to 50%, permanently abolished income tax on the in-kind contribution of intellectual and industrial property, extended the time limit for deducting costs of R&D activity from 3 to 6 years and removed time limitations on the eligibility of inventors to share in the benefits of commercialisation. The first Act on innovation has been in force from the end of 2016. The second Act on innovation, namely the Act amending certain acts in order to improve the legal environment for innovative activity (Journal of Laws 2017, item 2201) was adopted on 9 November 2017. This Act e and Higher Education in cooperation with the Ministry of Development and Finance, the Act is aimed at increasing support for research and development. The Act is in line with the assumptions underlying, amongst others, the Strategy for Responsible Development. It assumes an increase in R&D spending to 1.7% of GDP in 2020 and the establishment of 1,500 start-ups within 7 years. What draws particular attention is the high potential for employment increase in R&D: the employment rate in this sector per 1,000 economically active persons in Poland in 2013 was 5.4 compared to an average of 12.6 for the entire European Union in the same year. The Act introduces a number of tax changes, including increasing the of tax relief for research and development activities to 100%. It also addresses proposals from the scientific community by expanding the scope of activity of special purpose vehicles established by universities and institutes of the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN) and deregulates procedures applicable to the establishment of the Polish Roadmap for Research Infrastructure. The most important assumptions underlying the second Act on innovation include: - increasing the tax relief for research and development activity (R&D) to 100%51 (150% for Research and Development Centres), clarifying and expanding a list of costs eligible for R&D relief (to include assets other than fixed assets and forms of employment other than contract of employment), - enabling undertakings operating in special economic zones (SEZ) to benefit from R&D relief in relation to eligible costs other than costs of operation in a SEZ, - extension of the double taxation exemption of capital companies and limited joint-stock partnerships engaged in R&D activities until 2023, - expanding the scope of activity of special purpose vehicles established by universities and institutes of the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN) to include economic activity, - infrastructure, - providing the Ministry of Science and Higher Education with legal instruments to monitor the career paths of PhD students, - deregulating procedures applicable to the establishment of the Polish Roadmap for Research Infrastructure. The Polish Roadmap for Research Infrastructure defines measures to ensure increased efficiency in energy generation, storage and transmission (including sustainable use of raw materials, alternative and low-carbon technologies, nuclear energy, advanced materials and technologies for energy generation). To this end, dedicated centres are planned to be set up in leading Polish research institutions. This includes the Centre of Clean Coal Technologies (CCTW) at the Central Mining Institute (GIG), the Energy Centre at AGH University of Science and Technology, and the National Energy Laboratory (NLEJ) at the National Centre for Nuclear devoted to the development of high-temperature reactors. Most of these projects are either completed or in progress. 9. National Research Programme (KPB)                                             51 In relation to the amount of tax reliefs under the currently applicable Act.  116  The Act of 30 April 2010 on the principles of financing science introduced (in Article 4) the obligation to establish the National Research Programme. The issues relating to the energy and climate matters broadly understood, which fall within the scope of Dimension 5: Research, innovation and competitiveness, as referred to in the Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the Governance of the Energy Union, are addressed in three strategic directions of scientific research and development, namely: new energy technologies, modern materials technologies, natural environment, agriculture and forestry. These directions form the basis for the National Centre for Research and Development (Narodowe Centrum   NCBiR) to develop strategic research and development programmes. The National Centre for Research and Development is a key State institution responsible for financing research and development in Poland. From the perspective of the Ministry of Energy, the alignment of the innovation policy, in particular in terms of reducing pollutant emissions. Selected NCBiR programmes in the field of energy technologies, the implementation of which is consistent with planned actions for clean energy, are presented below. 9.1. Operational Programme Smart Growth 2014-2020 The programme is approved by the European Commission and wholly financed by the European Regional Development Fund. According to the Partnership Agreement, a total of EUR 8,614,000 is allocated to the programme. The Smart Growth Programme is designed to support research, development of new innovative technologies and activities aimed at improving the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises. Its main objective will be to stimulate the innovativeness of the Polish economy by increasing private spending on R&D and creating demand for innovation and R&D among enterprises. From idea to marketthe conception of unprecedented products, services or technologies through the preparation of prototypes/pilot lines to their commercialisation. The National Centre for Research and Development (NCBiR) plays the main organisational and managerial role in the programme, although contributions from the Polish Agency for Enterprise Development (PARP) or Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego (BGK) are also important. Support under the Smart Growth Programme is available primarily to enterprises (in particular SMEs), scientific entities, consortia of enterprises and scientific entities, and business environment institutions. Projects financed under the programme fall into two groups. The first group are projects that contribute primarily to the development of entities that implement them. This concerns, for example, companies which enter new markets and improve their products by investing in the development and implementation of innovative products or services or by cooperating with R&D entities. The second group consists of projects in the case of which implementing bodies act only as contractors or intermediaries in delivering specific solutions to selected groups of addressees. An example are projects carried out by business environment institutions which provide free or partially subsidised advisory services or by bodies implementing financial instruments, providing support in the form of loans, guarantees or capital instruments. Projects such as Smart Growth are addressed primarily to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups. 27 new competitions were launched under the programme in 2018, with the pool of support totalling PLN 7.44 billion. The largest amount of support was allocated to projects under Axis I: Supporting R&D carried out by enterprises. PLN 3.5 billion was available for allocation through eight competitions. Another 29 competitions are to be launched in 2019. Five competitions with a pool of PLN 1.9 billion are also planned under Axis III: Support for innovation in enterprises. 9.2 (TECHMATSTRATEG) The programme covers five strategic areas stemming directly from the National Research Programme, in line  117  with the priority directions of research currently being carried out in the European Union and worldwide. Energy storage and transmission is one of these areas. The projects implemented under the programme will result in developing and preparing the implementation of new products, techniques and technologies and a whole range of other solutions applicable in the areas covered by the programme. 9.3  The aim of the project is to develop technical and organisational solutions for the design, erection and operation of residential and public buildings, leading to a reduction in their energy intensity and an increase in the use of renewable energy sources in the energy balance of the building. The expected effect of this strategic project will be the development of energy efficiency in the construction sector, as well as a significant reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the at-related research tasks. Each of the tasks is an independent whole, and the outcome of one of them does not affect the outcome of the other. Therefore, the result of the whole project is the sum of the outcomes of individual tasks, which include the assessment of opportunities, effects and threats to the increase of energy efficiency in the construction sector and the development of energy-optimised typical structural, material and installation solutions for buildings that will contribute to the elimination of design solutions resulting in an excessive energy consumption throughout the life cycle of the building. 9.4 Strategic research project 'Technologies to support the development of safe nuclear energy' The project is a response to the call for increasing the country's energy security in the context of nuclear power. Its implementation is closely linked to the plans to build a nuclear power plant in Poland and the EU's climate and energy policy. The strategic project will create links between research carried out by Polish scientific teams and global research and will prepare scientific and technical staff to face the needs of the Polish nuclear industry. Its implementation is intended to contribute to addressing problems related to spent fuel and radioactive waste. Furthermore, the project will enable the regulation of radiological protection, which will translate into increased public approval of nuclear power in Poland. Task/project title: a) Development of high temperature reactors for industrial use. b) Research and development of controlled thermonuclear fusion technologies. c) Basis for securing the fuel needs of Polish nuclear energy. d) Development of techniques and technologies to support the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste. e) Analysis of opportunities and criteria for the participation of Polish industry in the development of nuclear energy. f) Development of methods to ensure nuclear safety and radiological security for current and future nuclear energy needs. g) Analysis of hydrogen generation processes in a nuclear reactor under normal operating and emergency conditions, together with proposals for measures to improve nuclear safety. h) Analysis of the processes involved in the normal operation of nuclear power plant water cycles, together with proposals for measures to improve nuclear safety. i) Development of methods, and performance of, safety analyses in nuclear reactors in the event of heat distortion and severe accidents. j) Development of a method and execution of an exemplary system analysis of the operation of a nuclear unit with a water reactor at partial cogeneration. The value of projects implemented in 2011-2015 totalled approx. PLN 55 million. 9.5. GEKON Programme   The GEKON programme is a joint venture carried out under an agreement between NCBiR and the National finances industrial research and development related national environmental technologies in five thematic areas: - Environmental aspects of unconventional gas production;  118  - Energy efficiency and energy storage; - Protection and rational use of water; - Clean energy generation; - Innovative methods for production of fuels, energy and materials from waste and recycled waste. In 2015, NCBiR carried out substantive and financial supervision over 59 research and development projects selected through competition, as well as continued the procedure for giving decisions on the second competition and signing contracts for the execution and financing of projects selected through the first and second competition. The value of 59 projects monitored in 2015 totalled approx. PLN 279.5 million. 9.6 Blue Gas  Polish Shale Gas Programme  a joint venture between NCBR and ARP S.A. The Blue Gas Programme is a joint venture between NCRD and the Industrial Development Agency (Agencja pilot tests leading to the development and commercialisation of innovative technologies in the area of shale gas extraction in Poland. A total of 21 projects selected for funding under the first and second competition continued to be monitored in 2015. The value of financial and in-kind contributions of entrepreneurs participating in the programme totalled PLN 5.2 million in 2015. According to own estimates of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education (MNiSW), approx. PLN 300-400 million a year has been allocated in recent years (since 2010) to energy and environmental technology projects from the science budget (MNiSW, NCBiR and NCN). These are both large programmes and strategic projects implemented by NCRD, as well as larger initiatives (joint ventures, sector programmes) and smaller projects (research, targeted, development projects, etc.) on topics selected by the applicants. Other institutions coordinating research in low-emission energy in Poland Coordination of work in the area of low-carbon energy is essential to achieve improvements. The following institutions are tasked with coordination in the field of research and development:   an institution equipped with actual tools to implement new energy technologies, especially in the environmental aspect. For optimal use of the Fund's resources in terms of energy and environmental objectives, the Ministry of Energy submits to the Fund its proposals for strategic projects with the greatest environmental impact. Important areas of support are: - replacement of individual heating sources with cogeneration units and their upgrading combined with the expansion of the heating network, which will lead to reducing the emission of pollutants while creating a market for domestic manufacturers of modern boilers; - increased use of waste; - construction of installations for methane production from coal mines; - coal gasification technologies on an industrial scale. Some of the above actions have already been initiated within the framework of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management. However, they require not only continuation, but also a significant extension of their scope and scale. A fast path for the most important groups of projects, selected by the Ministry of Energy, may be a good way to ensure their implementation. The Infrastructure and Environment Operational Programme 2014-2020 includes, amongst others, the following priorities: - decarbonisation of the economy, with an amount of support of EUR 2,151,095,269; - environmental protection, including adaptation to climate change, with a budget of EUR 4,127,263,725; - development of low-emission public transport in cities, with an amount of support of EUR 2,704,921,948.  Low Emissions Transport Fund  it is intended to support, amongst others:  119  - manufacturers of vehicles powered by electricity, as well as those powered by compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG); - research of new technologies related to the use of electricity in transport. 4.6.5. Projection of outlays on emission reduction research Outlays on research and development show a strong upward trend in Poland. Between 2005 and 2015 they increased from approx. 0.5% to approx. 1%. In line with the Strategy for Responsible Development and the Europe 2020 strategy, a further increase in R&D outlays is projected to reach the target of 1.7% of GDP in 2020 as set out in these documents. An assumption is made in the present work that R&D outlays will remain at the level of 1.7% of GDP until 2040. Table 66.
