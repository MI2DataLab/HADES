 and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 54   3. Policies and measures 3.1. Decarbonisation dimension 3.1.1. Greenhouse gas emissions and removals 3.1.1.i. Policies and measures to achieve the target set under Regulation (EU) 2018/842 as referred to in point 2.1.1 and policies and measures to comply with Regulation (EU) 2018/841, covering all key emitting sectors and sectors for the enhancement of removals, with an outlook to the long-term vision and goal to become a low-emission economy and achieving a balance between emissions and removals in accordance with the Paris Agreement Introducing a climate framework law With the aim of climate policy to provide a legal basis in line with the Paris Climate Agreement, the government presented a draft climate law in autumn 2019, in line with the coalition agreement. This draft law is designed to strengthen the framework of national climate policy, in particular to allow for a coordinated and integrated approach between all relevant stakeholders, levels and sectors, and to improve consistency during the implementation. The draft consists of three main parts. The first part establishes an institutional framework for climate policy and sets out the principles and  The draft law sets out the following four principles: the principle of climate justice, the principle of progression, according to which only continual improvements to climate policy are possible, the principle of integrated pollution control, according to which climate policy must not be pursued at the expense of biodiversity, air quality, water or other elements of the environment, and the principle of integrity, according to which climate policy genuinely pursues the objective of ensuring a safe and healthy climate. In addition to national climate targets consistent with the Paris Climate Agreement, the draft introduces sectoral climate targets. This will ensure that there is a shared responsibility. If the annual amount of emissions available in a sector is exceeded, the matter will be referred to the Government Council with a view to establishing an emergency programme to ensure compliance with the climate objectives. A Grand Ducal Regulation sets the respective emission allowances for the sectors for an initial period up to 2030. The target scenario presented in Section 5 provides a template for this. The inter-ministerial committee for the coordination of climate policy provided for in the draft climate framework law will participate in the drafting of the said regulation.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 55   The draft law also establishes three bodies with regard to the governance structure. Firstly, an inter-ministerial committee will be set up to coordinate climate policy. A climate action platform will be established in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, which requires Member States to establish a multi-level dialogue on climate and energy issues. There are also plans for an independent body to deal with the scientific, ethical and societal aspects of climate policy and the associated challenges. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, it also sets out the procedure for adopting and updating the integrated national energy and climate plan, the long-term strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the strategy for adapting to climate change. The second part of the draft law re-enshrines the existing Climate and Energy Fund and adapts it to the current challenges12. The third part transposes Directive (EU) 2018/410 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2018 amending Directive 2003/87/EC to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments, and Decision (EU) 2015/1814.  Climate action, budgetary and social policy The budgeting of the measures included in the integrated national energy and climate plan will be in line with the fiscal path and the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. National measures are given priority because of their co-benefits (air quality, jobs). Climate action is one of the most pressing tasks facing humanity. Accordingly, our national and international climate commitments are also a high priority in terms of budgetary and fiscal policies. They are important investments for the benefit of future generations. Measures with a direct impact on public finances will, like all capital expenditure, be subject to multi-annual budgeting. The Climate Framework Law establishes an inter-ministerial committee to assess the effectiveness of the measures on a regular basis. This will take into account the ministerial powers (compétences ministérielles). To this end, the measures shall be subject to a qualitative assessment of their impact on the national budget in terms of revenue and expenditure and their effectiveness in relation to national targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy efficiency and developing renewable energy. This will also take into account the co-benefits (air quality, jobs). It is therefore quite                                                            12 See the section on financing measures below for further details on this point.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 56   possible that the prioritisation of measures will be adjusted according to their efficiency and that the respective measures will be replaced or supplemented by more efficient measures, if necessary. The climate crisis is also a social crisis: vulnerable people are far more affected by the climate crisis than those in a better position. There is a gap between richer and poorer people, both geographically (North-South divide) and within societies.  The government is aware that it is taking people with it in the fight against climate change. The climate and energy plan will only be accepted if there is fair compensation for the more vulnerable groups in our society. For this reason, the measures of the climate plan will be assessed in terms of social justice and, if necessary, compensation will be provided for affected citizens. This important principle is also in line with the Climate  The measures in the integrated national energy and climate plan that have already been adopted and are set down in a law or Grand Ducal regulation are taken into account in the draft budget for 2020 and in the multi-annual plan. It goes without saying that the new measures in the integrated national energy and climate plan have not yet been reflected in the draft budget for 2020, as this law was already deposited in Parliament on 14 October 2019. Knowing that the implementation of this plan entails expenditure, it is important not to overlook any revenue that could result from carbon pricing.  The tax measures outlined in the plan will be analysed in detail before their final adoption as part of the tax reform negotiations.  Minimum price for CO2   In addition to the emissions trading scheme for industry introduced more than 10 years ago at EU level, carbon pricing  a cost-effective tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions  already plays an important role in many EU Member States. Following this model, Luxembourg will introduce a minimum CO2 price as part of the forthcoming tax reform and continuously adapt it in line with the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement. The target starting price will be the average CO2 price in our neighbouring countries. For 2021, this means a CO2 price of ap2. This amounts, for example, to approximately 5 cents per litre of  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 57   approximately 1.5 cents per litre of diesel fuel. The further implementing provisions for a dynamic CO2 price will be drawn up as part of the preparations for the planned tax reform. This will involve looking into whether a scaling of the CO2 price should be introduced.  The socially fair implementation of the CO2 price will be ensured by using the revenues in a targeted way. These are used in a balanced way () for concrete climate action and targeted social relief via fiscal (e.g. tax credit) and social justice (équité sociale) measures for low-income households.  Climate support measures A successful climate policy requires effective measures to reduce emissions. Although everyone has individual responsibility, climate policy can only be successful if it indicates the direction, creates the necessary framework conditions and thus offers concrete alternatives to all stakeholders. Therefore, enhanced incentive mechanisms will be put in place through improved support schemes, which are explained in more detail in Section 3.1.1.iii.  The PRIMe House support scheme provides investment aid for the energy and sustainable renovation of residential buildings and related, qualified energy advice, for the construction of sustainable residential buildings and for the use of renewable energy (PV installations, solar thermal installations, heat pumps, wood pellet and wood chip heating systems).  In addition to the PRIMe House support scheme, the energy and sustainable renovation of residential buildings is supported by low-interest or  to help low-income households  interest-free loans (climate bank).  Clever fuerenbicycles through direct grants.  The support schemes for improving the protection and sustainable management of forest ecosystems ensure sustainable timber production, improve the condition of forests and help our forests adapt to climate change. In this way, the state, society and forest owners together ensure that we will continue to have stable, healthy, climate-tolerant and species-rich forests in Luxembourg in the future.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 58    In industry and small and medium-sized enterprises, the existing instruments will continue to be used and expanded by the relevant ministries. The voluntary agreement (accord volontaire) and the energy saving obligation (ESO) will be further developed and continue to serve as important cornerstones for future efficiency efforts.   With regard to the efficiency efforts of small and medium-sized enterprises, new instruments such as a de-risking instrument and a transparency platform for audits will be created in order both to overcome the financing hurdles and to improve the overview and identification of energy efficiency measures.   In terms of agriculture, climate action schemes (methane strategy, climate check, etc.) are being drawn up by the relevant ministries.  Social measures Climate change and the health impact of fossil energy supply affect low-income population groups in particular. Climate action therefore also provides a tangible contribution to social justice. However, climate action must also be socially embedded in order to prevent energy poverty. Luxembourg has a comprehensive strategy for tackling poverty in general (minimum wage, social inclusion income (REVIS), etc.). In addition, there is a series of measures in Luxembourg offering targeted help to people affected by energy poverty. The amended laws of 1 August 2007 on the organisation of the electricity market and on the organisation of the natural gas market stipulate that household customers who are unable to pay their electricity or gas bills can receive social assistance from the responsible social welfare office. For its part, the Law of 18 December 2009 on the organisation of social assistance stipulates that, when applying the procedures established in the above-mentioned laws on the organisation of the electricity and natural gas markets, the responsible social welfare office must investigate whether the household customer is able to pay his or her energy bills and is thus entitled to social assistance. Particular attention must be paid to housing in the fight against energy poverty, as rising housing prices have become a major social challenge in Luxembourg. Low-income population groups can often only access poorly maintained rented accommodation in old buildings with low energy standards. The government is therefore targeting the creation of affordable housing. Energy efficiency measures in the housing sector will be designed in a way that simultaneously improves the national energy balance and the living  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 59   conditions of low-income groups. In particular, climate support measures in the housing sector will be improved with the aim of increasing support for low-income households. The Luxembourg Government will also work with all relevant stakeholders to develop innovative programmes, as part of the national long-term renovation strategy to be developed in the coming year, which will create incentives to renovate old housing while providing housing for low-income households.  It should also be mentioned that there is already a programme in place through the cost-of-living allowance can help those in need to face a possible increase in the cost of housing. It should also be pointed out that the current social assistance legislation stipulates that any person who satisfies the conditions for entitlement to social assistance is entitled, under defined conditions, to a minimum provision for domestic energy if he or she is unable to cover the costs of domestic energy. The enormous amount of investment in infrastructure development and the introduction of free public transport from 1 March 2020 are certainly not only transport policy measures, but also clearly social measures.  Strengthening EU law and standards targets. This is why the government will promote an ambitious climate and energy policy framework at EU level. In addition to the EU emissions trading scheme, other important climate action instruments originate at EU level, such as the Regulation on the effort sharing of emission reduction targets among the individual EU Member States, the Regulation on emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, as well as the Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, the Energy Efficiency Directive and the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. Other instruments include ecodesign requirements for appliances and the regulation of CO2 emissions from cars, vans and trucks. Luxembourg will advocate a ban on the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles at EU level as of 2030.  Government to lead by example The government will increasingly play a leading role in the use of renewable energy and the improvement of energy efficiency. It will build on existing programmes and their results, but will also take or develop new initiatives.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 60   Ultra-efficient public buildings  -new and existing buildings to improve sustainability, energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy in public buildings. It will incorporate the principles of the circular economy and the relevant health aspects. This includes the introduction of an obligation to install photovoltaic systems on state-owned buildings, both for new buildings and renovations. This will also be reflected in a ramping up of the existing photovoltaics programme of the Public Buildings Administration. The aim is for all suitable public buildings to be equipped with photovoltaic installations by 2025.  The state-owned buildings should become the most efficient in all of the EU Member States. In order to better assess and improve the environmental performance of existing public buildings, the mandatory use of the Environment Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) will be introduced for the management of buildings in order to minimise the environmental impact of buildings and continuously improve their performance. EU institutions based in Luxembourg can serve as a model here. In addition, the Luxembourg Government is currently developing major housing projects with the respective state and municipal players (SNHBM, Fonds du logement, Fonds Kirchberg, Fonds Belval, 2ese projects provide the basis for a significant part of the expected population growth in these areas to be climate neutral. Luxembourg LED 2025 initiative The government, through its administrations, will completely convert all lighting sources in streets, public places, buildings, stations and monuments from the existing energy-wasting luminaires to energy-efficient LED lighting.  Car fleets  purchase and use of official cars, and more efficient fleet management is to be introduced. By the same token, the share of electric vehicles in the fleet is to be steadily increased.  Sustainable purchasing Public administrations will make greater use of sustainability criteria when purchasing. The framework established by the revision of the legislation on public procurement (Loi du 8 avril 2018  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 61   sur les marchés publics) makes it easier to use other criteria than the price component for the award of contracts. This means that both environmental (life cycle) and social criteria can play a greater role in procurement. Standardisation of tender criteria for different product groups will help to leverage public procurement on the markets.  In this context, digitalisation will also be further promoted in order to minimise the use of paper in the long term. Climate-friendly schools It is particularly important to focus more on schools and their infrastructures, as young people want to experience and learn about climate action in pupils in spring 2019 gathered together many ideas to reduce the ecological footprint of schools. In addition to increasing the use of renewable energy sources (both electricity and heat), sustainable mobility and transport concepts, as well as elements that reduce water consumption, will be taken into account in planning and in major refurbishment works. It is often possible and useful to involve the students themselves in the implementation of their ideas. For example, pupils have already helped to install solar panels on school roofs. In order to make future generations more aware of sustainability issues, the themes of energy efficiency, renewable energy, climate change and sustainability will be integrated into the curriculum.  Further developing the climate pact with the municipalities  Climate Pact 2.0 In order to guide and shape municipal climate and energy policy, Luxembourg has an effective and legally enshrined instrument for climate action in the municipalities (Loi modifiée du 13 septembre 2012 portant création d'un pacte climat avec les communes)  the Climate Pact (see Section 1.2  Overview of current policy situation). In view of an agreement in the coalition agreement 2018-2023, and based on a broad acceptance by the municipalities, the current climate pact, which will expire in 2020, will be continued and pact will evolve over the period 2021-2030 in a targeted way in three areas: strengthening the quantification approach, improving framework conditions for the municipalities and providing greater support for the municipalities in their civic work. On the one hand, based on the measures of the climate pact and in view of the objectives of the integrated national energy and climate plan, more locally relevant quantitative indicators will be integrated into the climate pact and given greater weight in the overall assessment. The development of monitoring and communication tools also plays a role in improving the working framework for municipalities, as does the increased support for municipalities in their civic work.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 62   The overall aim is to anchor Climate Pact 2.0 even more firmly as a key implementation tool for national energy and climate policy at local level.  Mobility Almost two--ETS climate emissions come from fuel sales, with two figures concisely reflecting the atypical situation. Around 70% of the climate emissions from fuel sales come from motor vehicles registered abroad and the share of lorries is close to 60% of the climate emissions from fuel sales. Increasing fossil-fuelled truck traffic is not only a climate and health issue, but also a transport problem for transit countries such as Luxembourg. Tax and excise policies have a significant impact on the  Luxembourg will continue to support schemes at national and European level that reduce lorry traffic (e.g. Eurovignette) and facilitate shifting freight transport to alternative propulsion systems and to rail. In this context, Luxembourg will also promote the development of a sustainable logistics location and support the  the logistics sector (Lean+Green) will be further developed in the future. Integrated spatial planning, traffic avoidance and the consistent development of soft mobility and public transport will reduce the need for individualised car transport. The remaito climate-friendly alternatives (electromobility, hydrogen). This rapid changeover is an essential contribution to achieving the Luxembourg and European climate and energy targets. The measures for electromobility are described in detail in Section 3.1.3.iii. However, the improvement or optimisation of mobility can only be achieved by introducing many different measures.   As part of a long-term national mobility plan, the government adopted the sustainable mobility strategy MoDu 2.0 dality and the strengthening of public transport and active mobility, were retained. The strategic objective for 2025 is to improve the flow of traffic at peak times, with 20% more passengers to be transported than in 2017. The desired modal split on commuting routes should be 46% drivers, 19% passengers, 22% public transport users, 9% pedestrians and 4% cyclists. In addition, the government will set new targets up to 2035 in its MoDu 2.0 development programme during this legislative period.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 63     highlights the progress made since 2017;  contains up-to-date key figures;  sets fixed targets for Horizon 2025;  integrates recent technological advances;  ensures the coherence of new global and national strategies (e.g. Paris Climate Agreement, Third Industrial Revolution, etc.);  develops a strategy for the creation of a mobility toolbox;  is explicitly addressed to four stakeholders: o citizens o the municipalities o employers and educational establishments o the state.  As part of the planning of mobility projects, a long-term cost-benefit analysis will be used, which will take greater account of climate considerations. The MOBIMPACT tool will be used for project planning. A more multimodal approach will also be put in place for the planning of road-building projects. This includes, for example, preference being given to public transport and carpooling in new road-building projects. At company level, a mobility plan or strategy for relocations will be established. It will also raise awareness about increasing the use of public transport and creating car pools in existing establishments and activity zones. In addition, the reorganisation of the RGTR network will also improve the coordination of connections to activity zones. Technical and financial assistance programmes will be made available to municipalities in order to implement concrete measures that reduce the carbon footprint.  New mobility plans for activity zones and new municipal mobility concepts will meet predefined criteria in future and will receive technical and financial support. The new procedures and criteria are intended to promote initiatives that reduce the le, the following criteria could be integrated into the mobility plans and concepts:   removing P&R from urban centres (transnational cooperation),   improving the combination of public transport and passenger cars,   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 64    providing electric company cars. As a tool for traffic management (reducing peak hourly traffic and avoiding traffic caused by people looking for parking spaces) and behavioural management through the availability of parking spaces, a national parking space strategy is being developed, based on the meaningful design, pricing and use of parking spaces. A regulatory framework and new incentives will be created for the development of -as-a- services. The aim is to provide more support for innovative transport solutions through ongoing digitalisation. In addition, existing offers (such as the carpooling project CoPilote) will be reinforced or reinvigorated. The development of a comprehensive mobility app will also be pursued. In order to promote carpoolingwith employers will continue. In addition, carpooling will be granted further benefits, notably on motorways, in order to increase the number of passengers per vehicle. At company level, employees who choose a means of transport other than a car should not be further  cars and thus offers an alternative to the company car. Alternatively, the following measures may form part of or complement the mobility budget:  car sharing of electric vehicles,  financial or administrative support for the creation of car pools within companies or activity zones,  support for the construction of secure bicycle storage facilities within activity zones,  financial aid to companies for the installation of charging points,  offering zero-emission lease cars.  The creation of such a mobility budget will also involve adapting the regulatory framework to encourage a transformation in transport within companies. For example, the use of low-emission and zero-emission vehicles is to be given priority by adjusting the taxation of company vehicles.  Traffic avoidance In order to avoid traffic, a regulatory framework will be established, in consultation with the social partners, to promote teleworking and thus also to create modern and flexible working conditions. To this end, the tax treatment for the use of teleworking by commuters will be adapted and the current labour and health laws will be amended. Following the example of the current discussions  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 65   with Belgium, negotiations will be launched with France and Germany in order to find an appropriate tax treatment that favours teleworking by frontier workers. In addition to promoting teleworking, coworking spaces will also be established in the border area in order to reduce cross-border commuting. Work on the first such structure is due to start at the beginning of 2019 in Esch-Belval, with additional structures to be provided preferably along the A1, A3 and A6 motorway axes and the N31 national road in Rodange.  Consistent development of local public transport  In order to promote public transport, its free use will be introduced on the territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg on 1 March 2020. However, important infrastructure work and projects will also continue to be pursued and implemented. The government sees consistent and continuous investment as an essential precondition for promoting the attractiveness of public transport. Supply, punctuality and quality of service are crucial in encouraging people to change their habits and switch from private cars to public transport. The investments in the railway planned between the largest contract for the procurement of materials in the history of the railway, amounting to ion. The material will be delivered between 2020 and 2023. Tram investments between  As part of the upgrading of the tramway, the existing tram line will be further extended as planned and new tram lines will be created taking into account cost-benefit, coherence with multimodal transport networks, feasibility, etc. In addition, the express tramway project between Luxembourg City and Esch-sur-Alzette will be further developed and integrated into any further road-building project on this line. In order to improve train services, the extension of double or quadruple tracks on existing lines and the extension or modernisation of existing stations (in particular Luxembourg City and Ettelbruck) will continue. In addition, comfort on the trains will be enhanced by providing quiet compartments in 1st class as well as free Wifi, and by increasing capacity on the train routes. In addition to these infrastructural works, the overall aim is to improve communication and the flow of information to customers regarding disruptions on the railway network and train delays or cancellations. Communication and coordination will be improved for customers, especially in the case of cancellations. To further increase comfort for customers, the coordination between the train and bus networks is to be continuously improved and adapted to ensure that bus connections run smoothly even in the event of delays.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 66   In addition to the rail network, further investment is to be made in the bus network, which will be constantly expanded and improved. The current reorganisation of the RGTR network will be systematically continued with the aim of prioritising and optimising the regional bus routes. This includes optimising the bus network on weekends and public holidays and increasing the frequency of bus services in the evening hours. In addition, the reorganisation of the RGTR network will also improve the coordination of connections to activity zones. In addition to organisational adjustments, however, infrastructural improvements, such as the creation of specific bus lanes on motorways or express bus lanes on the main axes, are to be continued. In order to increase comfort for customers, the aim is also to harmonise bus stops and other bus or train lines in terms of connections, as well as providing a minimum level of equipment (bench seat, display boards, etc.). In rural areas in particular, the use of dial-a-bus systems with minibuses will increase, avoiding empty runs outside peak hours and weekends without weakening peak hours capacity.  In addition to the respective projects on the rail and bus networks, the number and capacity of P&R will be increased, especially in the border area. To this end, an appropriate connection to public transport should also be ensured, in particular through the measures mentioned above.  As part of the decarbonisation of the bus sector, a gradual replacement of the traditional RGTR buses by electric buses is also planned. The aim is to analyse the feasibility of the bus routes and build on the experience of the urban bus operator.  A significant part of the reduction in CO2 emissions will also be achieved through the broad promotion of electromobility and the increased use of biofuels. The detailed measures to be taken in this context are set out in 3.1.3.iii. Taking responsibility for aviation and shipping In order to reduce GHG emissions from aviation, the Luxembourg Government supports carbon pricing at European level. In this regard, Luxembourg, together with Belgium and the Netherlands, has put forward a proposal to introduce a Europe-wide kerosene tax. Luxembourg will also increase its support for carbon offsetting measures, for example through the tax deductibility of payments to government-accredited organisations (e.g. myclimate.org). airport operator has signed a declaration of the Airports Council International Europe (ACI Europe) in which it commits itself to reducing CO2 emissions to net zero by 2050. In addition, hybrid electric aircraft are to be tested and a new tax regime introduced. Approach charges with a strong  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 67   comparable to that at neighbouring airports.  The Luxembourg Government is also committed to a Europe-wide solution to improve the climate and environmental compatibility of shipping and has submitted or supported a corresponding proposal at EU level. Improving the energy efficiency and reducing the CO2 intensity of shipping would not only protect the climate but also reduce air pollution from ships, including nitrogen and sulphur oxides (NOx and SOx) and particulate matter (PM), with positive effects on public health and the quality of life of European citizens.  The Luxembourg Government is working towards the adoption, as soon as possible, of binding and effective measures to implement the IMO target  adopted as part of the International Maritime  of a 40% reduction in the carbon intensity of shipping by 2030 compared to 2008 in the EU. To this end, emission reduction commitment under the Paris Agreement and the Commission must assess and report on the progress made towards reducing them, in relation to European climate and environmental objectives and the related international commitments, on an annual basis. The government is open and optimistic about the measures to be announced for the sector by the next Commission.   The taxation of Luxembourg-flagged vessels (registration fee) will be revised along the lines of the   The building sector Measures for sustainable construction and building renovation The building sector (residential and functional buildings) is currently responsible for around 12% of national climate emissions. This important sector needs a mix of standards and norms, in particular for new construction, but also targeted support schemes for energy upgrading of existing buildings. Luxembourg is a global leader in energy standards for new residential buildings, as in 2017 (rather than waiting until 2021 as permitted by the EU Directive) it became the first country to introduce hed in 2012. This courageous policy also explains  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 68   why, despite the increase in population and new buildings, the energy requirement for residential buildings has decreased. This success story now needs to be extended to cover new functional buildings. Like all other EU countries, Luxembourg still has much to do in terms of energy renovation. There has been a lot of renovation in Luxembourg, but not enough energy renovation.  Strategy and measures relating to the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency in the building sector are set out in Chapters 3.1.2. and 3.2. An overview of the financing measures can be found in Chapter 3.1.1 iii. In the building sector, the PRIMe House support scheme for residential buildings merits particular mention.  Alternative forms of housing  The government wants to pursue a conscious policy to promote innovative housing concepts, such as housing for the elderly (intergenerational housing), housing without cars, housing cooperatives or modular housing. Associated information campaigns, support schemes and pilot projects will be carried out. The legal framework must be reviewed and adapted to allow this kind of housing to become established in order to create affordable and high-quality living space:   building and housing cooperatives must be legalised by making the Law on Cooperatives [] more flexible and adapting the legal framework, so that citizens can be provided with cheaper housing.  In addition, Luxembourg needs a legal definition of the terms logements sociaux [social housing] and logements à loyer modéré [affordable housing].  Pacte logement 2.0  The Pacte Logement [housing pact] of 2008 (Loi du 22 octobre 2018 portant sur la promotion de ), which provides municipalities with, among other things, additional financial resources to create new housing and public infrastructure, will come to an end in December 2020. Considering the high demand for affordable housing in Luxembourg, the government has decided to extend and refocus the Pacte Logement. This pact between the government and the municipalities is to be relaunched under the name Pacte logement 2.0 and, on the basis of a wide range of measures, will help the municipalities to achieve important objectives in relation to housing construction and to improve the quality of  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 69   housing available to inhabitants. The focus here is on increasing the supply of housing and the mobilisation of building land, and improving the quality of housing and energy performance in both new housing projects and existing ones. The new Pacte Logement will be in force until around 2030 and its structure will be more diverse. Possible elements include improved advice to municipalities from the Ministry of Housing, providing a housing consultant and promoting various measures focusing on both the quantity and quality of housing. The range of measures for achieving these objectives was drawn up in cooperation with the municipalities. The advice provided to municipalities on implementing larger housing projects is to be improved under Pacte Logement 2.0. to help them strengthen their position as participants in the housing market. This advisory support covers, in particular, the acquisition and development of land, housing construction (independently or in collaboration with the private sector), the sale or letting of land and residential properties, and the management of an inventory of rented buildings. For this purpose, the municipalities will be provided with a professional consultant on housing construction (housing consultant). As a general rule, synergies with the Climate Pact and the Nature Pact will be identified and valorised. Furthermore, the Ministry of Housing will be provided with increased capacity in order to support the municipalities in creating housing developments.   Spatial planning is becoming more important, including in relation to climate change Heat map and solar map Energy investment planning will play a more important role in the climate age. For this reason, the Energy and Spatial Planning Departments within the Ministry for Energy and Spatial Planning are working hand in hand to produce two important maps; a heat map to show where our country can, as a priority, replace housing blocks and entire districts which today run on natural gas or fuel oil with heating networks which use renewable energies or waste heat from industrial plants or data centres. A national solar map will also facilitate the planning of large and smaller solar plants.   Eco-district made in Luxembourg The Luxembourg government is in the process of developing major housing projects with the respective national and municipal bodies (SNHBM, Fonds du logement, Fonds Kirchberg, Fonds CO2part of the expected population growth in these areas to be climate neutral.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 70    Bringing together housing, work and leisure  The best energy is energy that is saved, i.e. that never has to be produced at all. The best mobility is mobility which never takes place. In order to improve planning for the country and its urban areas in a dynamic economic environment, the government, led by the Ministry for Energy and Spatial Planning, is working on a new planning strategy for 2035 (programme directeur). This strategy sets out proposals for where an increased number of residential properties should be built in Luxembourg in the future (e.g. close to existing or new railway stations), what new transport infrastructure is needed and which areas must be off-limits as they are key to maintaining biodiversity. The 2035 Planning Strategy will also include concrete proposals for improving cooperation with our border regions. In order to allow discussion surrounding the drafting of the 2035 Planning Strategy to take account of fundamental issues, an ideas workshop will be organised for Luxembourg in 2050, based ].  Economy The 22 largest industrial CO2 consumers are subject to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. In total, industry was responsible for 50% of electricity consumption and 44% of natural gas consumption in 2018. When combined with the services sector, these figures rise to around 62% and 83%. Consequently, in addition to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, further efforts are needed in relation to the best available technologies, energy efficiency and renewable energies. This will reduce energy costs and thus make a significant contribution to competitiveness. The industrial sector will play an important role in achieving the energy efficiency targets pursued because, due to its high share of overall electricity consumption in Luxembourg (50%), this sector still has a lot of savings potential. Therefore, the government will introduce additional measures (e.g. de-risking, transparency platform for audits, continuing the EEO) to make it easier for those in industry to invest in energy efficiency themselves or via third parties. The government will also proactively participate in EU research projects on zero-carbon steel, zero-carbon cement, zero-carbon glass etc. In Luxembourg, the 2018-2023 coalition agreement provides for the creation of an integrated support instrument for SMEs, which functions supplementary to the Accord volontaire [voluntary agreement] and the de-risking instruments (described under 3.2.1.i) and aims to provide the relevant companies with a support framework for their implementation of energy and climate policies.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 71    Green Jobs and Climate Solutions made in Luxembourg Many studies show that climate protection also leads to net creation of jobs. This applies in particular to countries in which there are now few jobs in coal mines, natural gas fields and on oil rigs. Investment is needed in Luxembourg in solar plants, wind farms, electric charging columns, energy efficiency measures in industry and SMEs, developing heating networks, the circular economy and in particular energy renovation of existing buildings. The government is aware of this, and has introduced initiatives both in basic training and in further training (formation continue).  -The pioneering role in key technologies (zero-energy buildings, electromobility, photovoltaics), the development of energy research and innovation in Luxembourg, and particularly the high level of expertise xembourg with climate protection, and attracting new companies from Europe and around the world.  Important role of the circular economy as a climate protection measure  The circular economy can also help to reduce GHG emissions, beyond the measures described elsewhere. A 2018 study shows that if a circular economy were to be consistently implemented, European emissions from heavy industry could be reduced by up to 50% by 2050.   On the basis of the Circular Economy Study (2014) and the Rifkin process, it is important to define the circular economy in Luxembourg, in order to ensure that all parties from different sectors have the same understanding. This definition is equally important in order to determine and best support the social aspects of a transition to a circular economy. A change to a circular economy can only take place accompanied by a societal shift. Economic concepts which meet this challenge are, for example, the deveissue in relation to developing a circular economy is promoting a regional focus.  A key aspect of the circular economy is resource management, which is strongly defined by waste legislation. Only through continued promotion of cascading use can transition from a linear economy to circular value creation be achieved. It is only possible to establish cascading use if the necessary steps are taken in the design stage to arrange for the further use or the reuse of resources. The current Waste and Resources Management Plan (2018) already  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 72   sets out targets for, among other things, prevention, recycling and different waste categories. Thus, recycling rates for packaging are already set at 70% for the year 2022. A review of the legal basis for waste management will Luxembourg] strategy and a circular economy begun and has been accompanied by public consultations. This strategy aims to transform the current waste management system into an economy with a stronger focus on resource management. In addition to these structural measures, companies in particular require support during the transition. In this context, a material flow analysis will be carried out to identify the flows for which circular and regional value creation appears possible. In addition, continuous adjustments will be made to the business environment to promote circular business models. In addition, the construction sector will be assisted and supported in order to further promote sustainable construction and the circular economy. In this regard, national criteria will be defined and developed for sustainable and circular construction in cooperation with the various operators in the sector, with the aim of creating a database that is also compatible with the BIM working method. In addition, legal and regulatory measures to ensure implementation of sustainable construction in Luxembourg will also be analysed. There will be continued efforts to increase timber construction. Due to its potential for cascading use, the possible regional nature and the reduced climate impact, this building material in particular has potential which should be further exploited. Furthermore, sustainable living and ecology and circular economy ideas within urban neighbourhoods will be supported, for example, by the promotion of sharing economy and urban farming projects.  Lastly, circular value creation will be further promoted in commercial and industrial areas. Important aspects in this context, which also have a direct impact on greenhouse gas emissions, are the efficient use of energy, e.g. the use of waste heat, the use of roof surfaces for solar energy or reducing the need for mobility.  Waste and household water management In the waste sector all measures are listed in the national waste management plan. Additional measures will be introduced with the new waste regulation. In relation to greenhouse gas emissions, the most relevant measures here are those which aim to reduce waste production. In particular, the aim is to reduce food waste by 50% by 2022.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 73   In the household water management sector, Luxembourg will increasingly find itself confronted with the problem of sewage sludge. The size of treatment plants and the amount of sewage sludge produced are increasing with population and economic growth. The government programme anticipates the implementation of a national strategy to propose sustainable solutions for recovery (energy recovery, phosphorus recovery, etc.) or removal of sludge. A study is expected to deliver initial results by the end of 2020. The Strategy for Adapting to Climate Change in Luxembourg (2018-2023) also sets out recommendations for integrating aspects related to climate change into the design of sewerage systems. The recycling of wastewater will be further promoted and the effective use of grey water (e.g. thermal use) will be further developed.  Industrial processes and fluorinated gases Mitigation measures in the field of industrial processes are subject to the EU ETS standards. However, mitigation measures established as part of the national air pollution control programme under European Directive 2284/2016 may lead to an additional reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, in particular in the use of various products such as solvents. Measures in the energy efficiency sector can also lead to additional reductions in industrial processes. Reduction measures for fluorinated gases are set out in European Regulation No 517/2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases. These include both placing on the market and monitoring the use of various fluorinated gases, and reducing the quantity of hydrofluorocarbons placed on the market through allocation of quotas and creation of a register.  Agriculture and forestry Agriculture and forestry are both actors in and affected by climate change. On the one hand, they directly influence the development of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere through release of greenhouse gases and carbon storage. On the other hand, climate change affects agricultural and forestry production conditions. maintain and increase its production and public services in the long term.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 74   The IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land highlights the impacts of climate change observed across the globe on natural terrestrial ecosystems, land degradation and food security. The frequency and intensity of some extreme climate and weather events affecting the land surface has increased. The report illustrates the vulnerability of terrestrial ecosystems and resources and food security to climate change. Climate change is expected to exacerbate the existing challenges facing land systems, posing serious risks to livelihoods and the well-being of the population.  All of the reduction trajectories evaluated in the report, which limit warming to 1.5 °C or to clearly below 2 °C, require land-based mitigation measures and changes in land use which remove CO2 from the atmosphere. The report also shows that there are many land-based mitigation measures which do not compete with land use (such as sustainable agricultural practices and agroforestry) and have potential added benefits. A change in eating habits and reduction of food waste and loss could also reduce pressure on the land, while contributing to the eradication of poverty and improving health and hygiene. However, the report also emphasises that the use of large-scale land-based solutions (such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, and reforestation), if applied on a large scale and in a non-sustainable manner, can increase pressure on the land and food security.  Agriculture In line with the aforementioned IPCC Special Report, a first set of measures has been identified for reducing GHG emissions in agriculture by reducing the use of nitrogen-containing fertilisers, and in some regions even promoting the elimination of nitrogen-containing fertilisers altogether. These measures include agri-Policy (CAP) and incorporate programmes to reduce nitrogen fertilisation on arable land and grassland, but also the non-fertilisation of, for example, flower borders and field margins.  A second set of measures concerns the use of organic manure and mineral nitrogen fertilisers. These are implemented as part of the agri-environmental measures and the NEC Directive and include promoting environmentally friendly techniques for spreading manure, the ban on splash plates from 2025 and the ban on open new slurry or biogas slurry containers, with support available for covering existing open containers. These measures also all lead to a reduction in GHG emissions.  There will be further promotion of biogas as an energy source in the interests of the circular economy. As explained in more detail under 3.1.2.i., organic manure of animal origin should be  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 75   used as a priority in biogas plants, in order to concurrently reduce methane emissions. The coalition agreement provides for the drafting of a strategy to reduce methane emissions. A number of interventions under the agri-environmental measures, the Agricultural Biodiversity Action Plan and the Water Protection Act will lead to extensification of agricultural land use, in particular in sensitive areas, but also by promoting the grazing of dairy cows. Furthermore, the coalition agreement anticipates that at least 20% of agricultural land will be subject to organic cultivation by 2025 (and 100% by 2050), which will contribute to extensification of agricultural use. In addition, greening measures and the landscape conservation premium will also help to reduce GHG emissions. Overall, agriculture should remain land-dependent. Further development of advice and diversification of the consultancy modules on offer, which promote climate-friendly, climate-resilient, environmentally friendly and economical crop and animal production, is another measure which will help to reduce GHG emissions. In this sense, any major agricultural investment project financially supported by the State will in future be subject to an economic, social, ecological and energy-related analysis. Furthermore, sustainability checks will be introduced for agricultural holdings. There is also a need to increase knowledge about climate change and agriculture and to promote innovation through relevant research projects relating to Luxembourgian agriculture. Preventing food waste -food waste] campaign must be continued and intensified in order to prevent waste along the entire food chain. In addition to forestry, the agricultural sector also provides a carbon sink which absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere and is therefore vital to achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement. A research project will draw up the necessary guidelines to specifically encourage the development of humus as a carbon sink. In this area, the existing ban on ploughing permanent grassland in sensitive areas and the promotion of reduced tillage and cover crops should be pointed out. The crop diversification obligation under the agri-environmental measures and greening are other measures which increase carbon sinks. Agroforestry would have a positive impact here.   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 76   Forestry All relevant forestry measures have been listed in the national forestry accounting plan (Regulation (EU) 2018/841). These include, in particular, the protection of existing woodland, sustainable forest management and the designation of semi-natural forests. Based on these already existing measures, a reference value has been established for forests which serves as a basis for accounting rules in the forestry sector. These existing measures will be maintained in order to record zero emissions in the forestry sector.  New subsidies will be introduced in relation to increasing semi-natural and climate-resilient forest management. Reforestation measures and steps to increase the volume of wood in forests will be taken to increase CO2 sinks. Furthermore, increased use of wood products in the construction sector and improved cascading use of wood will prolong the CO2 storage effect.  Taxation measures  Energy and environmental taxes in Luxembourg are low in comparison to Europe and its neighbours. This poses various challenges in relation to climate and energy policies. The government is aware of this, and the coalition agreement accordingly states that the government will develop and implement a predictable and coherent tax policy which will provide adequate responses to the realities and challenges of family, social, economic and environmental policy. As part of the tax reform planned in this regard, energy and resource taxation, including the described minimum CO2 price, will be revised to incorporate the treatment of non-sustainable tax privileges detrimental to the climate. This will also take into account the findings and recommendations of the  environmentally harmful subsidies 13 The social fairness of an energy and resource taxation reform is a prerequisite for its success. The coalition agreement states in this regard that revenue from an increase in energy taxes is to be used to finance the social efforts necessary to create ecological change, which should at the same time be socially just.                                                            13 lopment  in more detail in Chapter 3.1.3.iv.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 77   Fuel taxation The government is aware that Luxembourg can only meet its climate and energy targets if enhanced measures are taken in relation to fuel sales in general and in particular in relation to fuel exports to HGVs. This is because, according to the Paris Agreement and the detailed EU framework legislation, CO2 emissions are recorded where the fuel is sold. The fuel prices for diesel and petrol in Luxembourg are cheap in comparison with neighbouring countries. Price differences with neighbouring countries must thus be gradually reduced in order to reduce fuel exports. In this connection, it will also be necessary to reduce the dependency of public finances on fuel sales and to avoid supporting false price signals which lead to an increase in fossil-fuelled HGV traffic. Revenue that is incompatible with the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement will be relinquished.  It was decided in the coalition agreement to adjust taxation of mineral oil products, in particular fuels, to bring it into line with the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement. An initial increase in excise duties on diesel (+2 euro cents per litre) and petrol (+1 euro cent per litre) was introduced on 1 May 2019.  An inter-ministerial committee (finance, environment, energy, economy) monitors and analyses trends in the sale of fuels and the impact of the new measures proposed by the government. With regard to achieving climate targets, under the coalition agreement the committee will also identify balance and will regularly propose adjustment measures to the government. Care will be taken to reduce the unjustified preference for diesel over petrol in the event of any future increases. In addition to the taxation measures, there are also instruments that could contribute to reducing fuel exports. For example, aspects relevant to climate change must be enshrined in motorway service station licences and, at the same time, police checks on HGVs at motorway exits must be increased, and carried out with greater cooperation from the municipalities, in order to prevent transit fuel traffic placing an increasing burden on our towns and villages.  Vehicle taxation Although the vehicle tax for vehicles in category M1 registered after 1 January 2001 is calculated according to CO2 emissions (according to the EU Conformity Certificate) and fuel type, their current steering effect is low.   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 78   Therefore, the vehicle tax will be revised to take account of the polluter pays principle. The revised vehicle tax will exclusively apply to vehicles which are registered after a date yet to be determined.  The current tax regime for company cars (40% of all new cars sold in Luxembourg) provides an incentive for both employers and employees to purchase and use these cars. Since 1 January 2017, the financial benefits to the employee have been calculated on the basis of CO2 emissions per kilometre and are thus intended to encourage selection of lower-emission vehicles.  The coalition agreement also provides for further revision of the financial benefits of company cars, with the aim of promoting electromobility through this route. In addition, employees who choose a means of transport other than the car should not be further disadvantaged. The introduction of bility or car-sharing services. Taxation of fuel oil and natural gas  Taxation of fuel oil will be gradually increased as part of the aforementioned tax reform, taking into account the described minimum CO2 price, in order to encourage the shift towards renewable, comparatively climate-friendly heating. In order to ensure that this measure is socially just, an attractive support scheme for oil heating exchange will be introduced. In this connection, the competent ministries will analyse the impact of increasing the cost of fuel oil with the public subsidy from the Allocation de vie chère [cost of living allowance] and, if necessary, adjust the effectiveness of this premium, as well as respecting the technical feasibility.   Further taxation measures To promote the circular economy and tackle excessive consumption of resources, the government will consider applying the super-reduced VAT rate of 3% to eligible repair work under European law. The government will also explore opportunities to introduce tax incentives for natural persons investing in sustainable development, climate protection and energy transition. The benefits of such investments will be proportionate to the taxable income and the risks taken by the taxpayer concerned.   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 79   3.1.1.ii. Any regional cooperation in this area  Within the framework of the Pentalateral Energy Forum (DE, FR, BE, NE, LU, AU, CH), Luxembourg will prioritise action in the following areas:  A shared vision for a decarbonised electricity system in western Europe by 2050  initiating cross-border cooperation in the field of renewable energy  integrating electromobility options and services without regional constraints  Exploring options for CO2 pricing and its cross-border impact on electricity prices. These issues have already been further discussed in Chapter 1.4.  3.1.1.iii. Without prejudice to the applicability of State aid rules, financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds, in this area at national level, where applicable Climate and Energy Fund The Climate and Energy Fund ( 2) créant un fonds de financement des mécanismes de Kyoto) on the one hand finances governmental and semi-governmental projects in the areas of climate action and renewable energy at national level and on the other hand is used for international climate financing. The Fund is fed from three sources:  a proportion of the fuel tax (3.5 euro cents per litre of diesel and 2.5 euro cents per litre of petrol, since the increase in excise duties of 1 May 2019 (see Chapter 3.1.1.i.))  40 % of the vehicle tax revenue; and  national auction proceeds from EU emissions trading. The future climate law (see Chapter 3.1.1.i  introduction of a climate law) will again enshrine the Climate and Energy Fund in law and adapt it to current challenges in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. This will lead to adjustments in terms of both expenditure and revenue. The Climate Pact for municipalities is to be funded by the Climate and Energy Fund.   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 80   Environmental fund The environmental fund () is used to support communal projects in the areas of climate action, energy efficiency and renewable energy, as well as the waste sector and nature conservation. It subsidises energy concepts, energy renovations, communal buildings, energy-efficient new construction, renewable heat and power generation (photovoltaic installations, solar thermal installations, heat pumps, biomass heating plants and combined heat and power plants), communal heating networks based on renewable energy and waste heat and converting street lighting to LED technology, among other things. The kinds of project eligible and the associated eligibility criteria are regularly updated and adapted to technical and economic development as well as climate and energy objectives.  PRIMe House housing support scheme The PRIMe House support scheme (logement) offers investment aid for the sustainable energy renovation of residential buildings and corresponding qualified energy consultancy, for the construction of sustainable residential buildings and for the use of renewable energy (photovoltaic installations, solar thermal installations, heat pumps, wood pellet and wood chip heating systems). The support scheme has been extended and reviewed a number of times since 2001. The current programme runs until the end of 2020. Regarding the continuation and further reinforcement of the programme, the following aspects will be the focus of further development:  Checking and, if necessary, adjusting the amounts of support  Integrating additional sustainability criteria, in particular to promote the circular economy  Including criteria to reduce health risks in residential buildings  Developing eligibility criteria for energy efficiency in listed buildings, in coordination with existing support schemes run by the National Sites and Monuments Service.  Further administrative simplification, for example by increasing the digitalisation of the application procedure and optimising quality control (relationship between quality improvement and intensity of controls) An inter-ministerial working group is responsible for monitoring and further developing the support scheme.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 81   In addition to the further development of PRIMe House, the criteria for the Luxembourg sustainability certification for residential buildings (Lëtzebuerger Nohaltegkeets Zertifizéierung  LENOZ) will also be reviewed:   The certification is to be generalised.  A selection of LENOZ criteria is to be progressively introduced as compulsory and promoted, and then gradually phased out from PRIMe House support.  Climate loans for residential buildings In addition to the PRIMe House support scheme, the sustainable energy renovation of residential buildings is supported via low-interest or (for low-income households) interest-free loans (Loi du 23 décembre 2016 ), with the technical requirements being the same as the PRIMe House criteria. There are plans to review and simplify the terms and conditions and application procedure, so that more homeowners can benefit from a climate loan in the future.   As regards increased promotion of electromobility, the tax incentives for electric vehicles in effect until the end of 2018 were replaced by direct subsidies on 1 January 2019 (Règlement grand-ducal du 7 mars 2019 portant  promotion des véhicules routiers à zéro ou à faibles émissions de CO2). -electric vehicles, plug-2/km) and hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles are eligible. The support scheme was continued in 2020. The subsidy for plug-in hybrid vehicles is due to end in 2021.  Subsidy schemes and financial incentives for businesses Under Commission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014 of 17 June 2014 declaring certain categories of aid compatible with the internal market in application of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty, the Luxembourg government can provide direct investment aid in the fields of environmental technologies and innovation for businesses (both SMEs and also larger companies). The Ministry of the Economy is responsible for granting the aid, supported by the innovation and research agency Luxinnovation (Loi du 15 décembre 2017 nt; Loi du 17 mai 2017 ayant pour objet 1) le  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 82    2) les missions de  et modifiant la loi modifiée du 5  In addition, SMEs can also apply for funding through a special government support scheme.  following aspects will be the focus of further development:  Increased promotion of aid schemes by providing companies with better information  Simple and transparent communication of the measurable benefits of support schemes  Simplifying the eligibility conditions, in coordination with national and European law  Accelerating administrative simplification, in particular through increased digitalisation  More resources for the support scheme directed at SMEs  Enhanced efficiency through a combination of support schemes for SMEs and larger companies The existing support schemes will be reviewed. 3.1.2. Renewable energy The Luxembourg government would like to accelerate the push for renewable energy with a target of 25% by 2030, and supports further development through investment aid and subsidies for private individuals and businesses. Wind power, as one of three key technologies for Luxembourg (wind, solar, biomass), surpassed the expectations of the NREAP in 2009 and continues to be financed accordingly. There will be a fresh attempt to instigate widespread use of photovoltaics (recently, development has almost stagnated). For biomass, priority will be given to improving cascading or multiple use (round timber for sawmills for use in furniture and construction, used and residual wood for particleboard plants, waste and scrap wood for cogeneration installations) and sustainability criteria (including procuring wood from the Greater Region in principle or within a radius corresponding to the Greater Region). In addition, new options, such as geothermal energy, will be further explored and promoted. come a proactive player in the energy transition, involving its whole population. In addition to the expansion in Luxembourg, the government will also actively participate in renewable energy development in Europe, through the instruments provided for in the new Directive 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. The following points will be implemented:   In order to increase investment in renewable energy, new incentives will be introduced, such as increasing feed-in tariffs for photovoltaic installations, regular calls for tender for large installations and the removal of current barriers.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 83    In general, Luxembourg will promote the expansion of renewable energy production at European level and will not support new projects based on fossil fuels or the development of fossil fuel power plants. By 2050, 100% of the energy supply in the EU should come from renewable energy sources.  3.1.2.i. Policies and measures to achieve the national contribution to the binding 2030 Union target for renewable energy and trajectories as referred to in Point (a)(2) of Article 4, and, where applicable or available, the elements referred to in Point 2.1.2 of this Annex, including sector- and technology-specific measures. Wind energy A large proportion of renewable energy production in Luxembourg already comes from wind power (installed capacity in 2018: 123 MW from 69 installations). At present, around 10 wind farm projects, some of which have already undergone the strategic environmental assessment and other required impact studies, are in the development and finalisation phase for 2020 and are expected to produce electricity for around 50,000 additional households per year. The existing feed-in payment/market premium will be continued and existing barriers will be removed where possible. The possibility for municipalities and citizens to make a financial contribution will also remain a key development factor. In the past, this has ensured a very high level of acceptance for wind power plants among the population and will continue to do so.  Solar energy and will be developed even further in the coming years. As regards photovoltaics, Luxembourg is currently in 6th place in the European Union in terms of installation capacity per inhabitant, with a total of 6990  Feed-in tariffs The increase in feed-in tariffs in 2019 aims to maximise the use of building roofs (and other sealed/non-agricultural areas) in Luxembourg to fit photovoltaic installations. Attractive feed-in tariffs for small installations up to 10 kW should allow all households to fit their own installation,  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 84   including with a view to later self-consumption. As previously, co-operative installations will be supported separately. Every citizen will have the opportunity to take part in the energy transition. After the introduction of a new category, collective installations in the range of 30 to 500 kW can now benefit from a feed-in tariff. Municipalities will be encouraged to make their roof areas currently in the pipeline. Calls for tender In order to speed up the expansion of photovoltaics in Luxembourg, a call for tender for large awarded to 15 MW capacity on buildings and industrial areas/landfills. The second call for tender over 40 MW took place in autumn 2019 and now provides a specific category for carports, among other things. It also permits installations between 200 and 500 kW.   On the basis of the results and analyses of both these calls for tender, a multiannual plan for calls for tender will subsequently be published in 2020, in which the volumes offered for tender will be successively increased each year in order to achieve the targets in the photovoltaics sector.   Self-consumption The inclusion of self-consumption concepts (in conjunction with energy storage) and energy communities will play a new, specific role in the PV sector. Both concepts, as provided for in Directive 2018/2001, have already been enshrined in a legislative amendment (on the electricity market), allowing accompanying measures and support measures to be implemented quickly.  -200 -consumption will be specifically targeted in the overall photovoltaics approach  attractive tariffs for small installations, special categories for cooperatives for citizen participation, calls for tender for larger and major installations from 200/500 kW  in order to create incentives for SMEs and office buildings. Solar map The coalition agreement (2018-2023) provides for the creation of a national solar map for Luxembourg. Up to now, such a tool has only been available at municipal level in some cases, for example in the capital city. The development of a solar map provides a decision-making tool in  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 85   relation to solar energy and helps to recognise and exploit existing potential in terms of private photovoltaic installations, energy cooperatives and public calls for tender. Furthermore, the map can be used by network operators and administrations to help them optimise the integration of solar installations into the network.  The map, which should be complete by the end of 2020, should facilitate more efficient planning. This tool will take account of the type of roof (flat roof, etc.) and the heights of buildings, so that citizens/company only need to click on their roof in order to obtain an initial assessment of whether it would make sense to install photovoltaics. The map is intended to serve as a planning and management tool for administrations in relation to larger areas (along roads, old industrial or landfill sites, possibly later free agricultural space).  Heat pumps  Heat pumps are stated as the reference technology for new buildings in the improved thermal insulation regulations for residential and service buildings. It is estimated that the use of geothermal energy in connection with heat pumps has an achievable potential of around 180 GWh/a. Heat pumps are a highly versatile technology for using renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies and have proved to be particularly effective heating systems in well-insulated buildings. The government intends to continue to promote and develop this technology by means of financial aid (see Chapter 3.1.1.iii) and an improved information policy (e.g. updated restriction map via Geoportal).  Medium-depth geothermal energy Potential for exploiting medium-depth geothermal energy will be more systematically identified and more consistently taken into account in relevant project areas. The aim is to reduce the existing uncertainties and risks and to promote increased use of geothermal energy in suitable locations.  The main focus here is on the area around Düdelingen and Esch-sur-Alzette.  Biomass In recent years, use of biomass has predominantly been promoted in cogeneration plants. The new Directive 2018/2001 provides sustainability criteria for the use of biomass in large plants (> 20MW). On this  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 86   basis, the Luxembourg Government intends to set stricter requirements in relation to sustainability criteria for new plants in future, and therefore plans to extend the European sustainability criteria for biomass use in cogeneration plants to smaller installations. Plants with a rated electrical output over 10 MW which use biomass or used and residual wood as an energy source must comply with these sustainability criteria in order to receive a feed-in tariff/market premium. In addition, it will also be ensured that the objectives of Directive 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants remain achievable, through the use of suitable technology. The stated objective is for biomass for energy production to be sourced from the Greater Region or within a radius corresponding to the Greater Region. More detailed provisions will be set out when the sustainability criteria are developed. In general, the cascading use principle should become more firmly entrenched in relation to the use of wood. The Luxembourg Government is considering creating its own draft code forestier [forestry code] law also sets out better sustainability criteria for national forestry.  Biogas Biogas continues to be a pioneering energy source (electricity, heat, supply). The framework conditions need to be revised in order to better promote biogas and to better take account of the not insignificant environmental and water protection issues (methane, NH3 emissions, nitrate, phosphorus). Part of the reform will involve adjustments to state aid to better recognise the non-energy related benefits of the sector. The government is setting very clear priorities, including in relation to the circular economy, the recovery of slurry, manure, biowaste and other residues. The biogas strategy is therefore also part of the methane reduction strategy. Currently, only slightly more than 10% of the theoretically available slurry is used for energy purposes (13.6% in 2018). The use of renewable raw materials is restricted. Biogas produced will be fed into the gas network as a priority. To this end, a technical and economic analysis was commissioned to determine the potential of biogas and the implementation of all of the above factors. In view of the scarcity of land in Luxembourg, the 2030 renewable energy targets and the results of the study, the Ministries concerned (energy, environment and agriculture) will work closely together to define the future role of agriculture in energy production and specifically in relation to biogas and photovoltaics.   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 87   Government to lead by example As already mentioned under 3.1.1, Luxem-efficient efficiency and the use of renewable energy in government and government-related buildings. This includes the introduction of an obligation to fit photovoltaic installations on government and government-related buildings, for both new and renovated structures. This should also be reflected in an improvement to the existing photovoltaics scheme run by the Administration des bâtiments publics [Administration for Public Buildings]. The aim is for all suitable public buildings to be equipped with photovoltaic installations by 2025. In addition, better integration of photovoltaic installations and increased use of renewable heat, in particular based on medium-depth geothermal energy, will be promoted in schools and their infrastructures. Army barracks to go green It has already been decided that the infrastructure on the Herrenberg will be extensively renovated 2installed on many rooftops and the heating network will be switched to renewable energy. Many army vehicles will also be examined to see if they can run on electricity or hydrogen. Through smart energy management, the entire area will then be largely self-sufficient in terms of energy. Hydrogen  The production of hydrogen, which is mainly used in industry, is today largely based on fossil fuels, primarily gas and what is known as gas reformation. In order for hydrogen to play its part in decarbonisation, renewable electricity (photovoltaics or wind power). This low-emission or zero-emission hydrogen can be used in many fields, including in industry, in transport or even in energy storage (it is primarily suitable for seasonal storage of renewable energy). There are plans to construct a hydrogen refuelling station. A key factor is the certification and supply of  Committees such as the Pentalateral Energy Forum or Hydrogen Europe also take this position. Luxembourg will contribute to a Europe-wide network of hydrogen refuelling stations. To enable longer  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 88   journeys within Europe, in particular in the trucking and logistics industry, locations along or on the motorways are the most logical. Studies in this regard are currently being prepared. Hydrogen can also play an important role in reducing CO2 emissions, in particular in the steel and cement industries. Companies in Luxembourg specialising in steelworks construction are already active in this field. Looking ahead to 2030, hydrogen can play a crucial role in energy supply and in sector coupling for the electricity, heat and transport sectors, in particular if energy losses in production and conversion through electrolysis are improved and the effectiveness of fuel cells developed for use in transport is increased. Luxembourg intends to work closely with other EU Member States in this area. A hydrogen strategy for Luxembourg is currently being prepared as part of the European Green Deal and a future European hydrogen strategy. The H2 strategy for Luxembourg will analyse potential in the following areas: - How substantial is the current and future demand for hydrogen? - Is it possible to produce renewable hydrogen in Luxembourg, and if so, how much? Alternatively, how can the importation of hydrogen be arranged? This analysis will examine, in particular, potential in the transport, industrial and renewable energy sectors (production  flexibility  storage  recovery). A future hydrogen economy will operate across borders, and it is therefore essential to have discussions at various levels with neighbouring countries and EU Member States. The Ministry of Energy and Spatial Development is currently preparing an initial strategy document for Luxembourg, in close cooperation and frequent discussion with interested parties from the scientific community and from industry.  Innovative funding instruments for renewable energy in renewable energy globally. -risking s. It was the first financial centre in the world to do anything of the kind.   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 89   Luxembourg intends, together with the EIB, to promote a de-risking instrument for long-term renewables power purchase agreements (PPA) at European level as well. This will make green electricity contracts cheaper for industry and for SMEs. During the last legislative period, the Luxembourg Finance Centre became a pioneer in matters of sustainable finance. Luxembourg will continue to be very active in this area, for example by supporting the Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform and the International Climate Finance Accelerator-GCF (Green Climate Fund) and the Network of Financial Centers for Sustainability. Luxembourg also promotes renewable energy through development cooperation. Luxembourg is a member of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and has applied to join the International Solar Alliance (ISA).  Monitoring tool and financial measures for businesses incentives will be reviewed and further developed. The associated strategy and measures for creating a monitoring tool and reviewing financial incentives for companies in relation to renewable energy can be found in Chapters 3.1.1.i. Economy and 3.1.1.iii. Funding measures. PRIMe House support scheme  Strategies and measures relating to the national support scheme PRIMe House and the associated implicitly required use of renewables are set out in Chapter 3.1.1.iii.  3.1.2.ii. Any specific measures for regional cooperation, as well as, optionally, the estimated excess production of energy from renewable sources which could be transferred to other Member States in order to achieve the national contribution and trajectories referred to in point 2.1.2 Cooperation mechanisms (statistical transfers, joint projects, etc.)   Luxembourg also wants to contribute to the development of renewable energy abroad. As stated in Directive 2009/28/EC and in the NREAP, Luxembourg needs to use cooperation mechanisms in order to achieve its 2020 targets. Luxembourg has made various efforts in the past to explore and promote possible methods of cooperating with different countries. In 2017, Luxembourg became the first Member State to enter into two statistical transfer contracts with Lithuania and Estonia. Both agreements include the  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 90   mandatory transfer of minimum quantities and the possibility of carrying over quantitative limits for the period 2018-2020, which is a clear indication of enhanced European cooperation in the field of renewable energy. In this sense, the Luxembourg government intends to continue to rely on cooperation mechanisms in the future. The new Directive 2018/2001/EU continues to build on existing cooperation mechanisms (statistical transfers, joint projects and shared support mechanisms) and also provides for new methods of cooperation: the Union renewable development platform (URDP) and the Union renewable energy financing mechanism. Statistical transfers will continue to play a certain role. The cooperation should, however, also be further developed and involve specific projects. The specific framework for this is the Benelux and/or the North Seas Energy Cooperation, but also the Pentalateral Energy Forum (Germany, France, Benelux, Austria, Switzerland). Luxembourg intends to participate in the Union renewable development platform (URDP) and also has a strong interest in the establishment and functioning of the Union renewable energy financing mechanism enshrined in Article 33 of the European Regulation 2018/1999/EU. The European Commission will establish this financing mechanism by 1 January 2021, to tender support for new renewable energy projects in the Union. It is anticipated that this financing mechanism will support countries in implementing the development of renewable energies towards the EU target and will have the potential to improve investment conditions for renewable energy across the EU. Luxembourg has already made some efforts in the past to launch a joint tender with another country in the renewable energy sector. Due to its complexity, this project did not come to fruition. This is another reason why Luxembourg supports the introduction of this European instrument, which is a move towards a European tendering process, and will actively participate in the first steps towards its implementation.  3.1.2.iii. Specific measures on financial support, where applicable, including Union support and the use of Union funds, for the promotion of the production and use of energy from renewable sources in electricity, heating and cooling, and transport The main support schemes in this area are already listed under 3.1.1.iii. The most important support schemes are mentioned again here:  The PRIMe House support scheme offers investment aid for the use of renewable energy (photovoltaic installations, solar thermal installations, heat pumps, wood pellet and wood chip heating systems). The  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 91   support scheme has been extended and reviewed a number of times since 2001. The current programme runs until the end of 2020.  The environmental fund is used to support communal projects in the areas of climate action, energy efficiency and renewable energy, as well as the waste sector and nature conservation.  Passenger cars, vans, motorcycles and bicycles have been supported through direct subsidies via the  January 2019.  3.1.2.iv. Specific measures to introduce one or more contact points, streamline administrative procedures, provide information and training, and facilitate the uptake of power purchase agreements The ministries and administrations concerned are currently discussing how to set up this contact point.  3.1.2.v. Assessment of the necessity to build new infrastructure for district heating and cooling produced from renewable sources Low-temperature heating networks In order to comply with Article 14 of Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, a study assessing the potential for use of high-efficiency cogeneration was published in 2016. This study assessed the potential of the heating network supply and revealed that a significant proportion of the co-generation potential is already being exploited in the building sector. However, there is still potential to further develop the current situation in the future. Mainly as a result of the high energy standard for buildings (NZEB for residential buildings since 2017), the Luxembourg government expects a high number of potential heating and cooling uses for low-temperature heating networks. These low-temperature networks will in future be supplied predominantly from environmentally friendly sources (deep geothermal energy, heat pumps, waste heat from industry and data centres, solar thermal installations), insofar as this is economically viable. High potential, particularly in the field of geothermal energy, is expected in the south of the country. The opportunities for using medium-depth geothermal energy for heating networks to supply residential areas, schools and sports complexes are currently being studied more closely. In this context, myenergy, in cooperation with the Luxembourg Geological Service and a research institute, is launching a project to improve the data currently available, to more accurately assess the geothermal potential in Luxembourg and to provide scientific support for construction projects currently planned.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 92    Heat map The creation of a web-based heat map will increase transparency on the heat market by means of an integrated analysis and presentation of the relevant data in this connection. The main focus is on illustrating the heat demand and heat supply in the territory of Luxembourg, which can be used to, inter alia, prepare and further develop heat strategies at regional and national level. However, the tool will also be used by the municipalities as part of the Climate Pact, for example to implement energy planning or general accounting within the Climate Pact. However, existing heating networks will also be represented and an assessment of potential energy recovery (i.e. sewage sludge drying) will also be carried out. There are also plans to map the energy sources used to produce heat and the share of heat they produce. Additionally, a hot-spot analysis will make it possible to identify larger renovation areas and possible synergies at industrial level. The economic viability of potential projects for planners and companies will be better assessed using relevant indicators. This is expected to increase energy efficiency for companies, SMEs and in residential areas. These hot-spot analyses will also include an assessment of the use of waste   3.1.2.vi. Any specific measures to promote the use of energy from biomass, especially for new biomass mobilisation, taking into account: The key factors in this area are listed under 3.1.2.i. Specific measures are as follows:  Extending the sustainability criteria to cover installations with a rated electrical output above 10 MW  Sourcing biomass for energy production in principle from the Greater Region or within a radius corresponding to the Greater Region  Cascading use of wood  Creating a sustainability label for Luxembourg.   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 93   3.1.3. Other elements of the dimension 3.1.3.i. Any national policies and measures affecting the EU ETS sector and assessment of the complementarity and impacts on the EU ETS The voluntary agreement with industry (accord volontaire) described under 3.2.i. involves companies which are participating in the EU emissions trading scheme. 3.1.3.ii. Policies and measures to achieve other national targets, where applicable Sustainable funding International solidarity and climate finance  Regarding climate finance, the Paris Climate Agreement calls on developed nations to provide financial resources to support developing countries for both damage mitigation and adaptation purposes.  In recent decades, Luxembourg has provided substantial financial and technical assistance to support climate action in developing countries, focusing on Least Developed Countries (LDCs),  Luxembourg will continue to support developing countries in the fight against climate change: from contribution, current-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). These funds are designated as International Climate Finance (ICF) and are new and in addition to Official Development Assistance (ODA). They are made available through the Climate and Energy Fund, which is supervised by the Minister for the Environment. It is guaranteed that the ICF will be continue to be available in addition to the ODA.  In the run-up to the COP21 Paris Climate Conference in 2015, the government had already from 2014 to 2020.   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 94   A strategy for distributing the Luxembourg ICF, including eligibility criteria, was drawn up in 2017. It is aiming towards a provisional distribution of 40% for mitigation, 40% for adaptation and 20% forestry (REDD+).  Furthermore, the Government Council has endorsed the introduction of a comprehensive approach to governance in the primary partner countries for development cooperation, in order to reinforce cohesion and synergies between development measures and other areas, including the fight against climate change and the development of economic, cultural, political and security relations. As Cape Verde is the country with which Luxembourg has the most diverse and developed relations, this new approach will be implemented there first. Knowing that public investment alone will not be sufficient to reach the target of $100 billion by 2020, it is essential that public investment provide leverage for other sources of funding, including the private sector.  However, investment in new forms of climate financing will be far from sufficient. Trillions of US dollars and euros must be transferred from carbon-intensive investments to low-carbon gas emissions and climate-resil Luxembourg today acts as an important international platform for sustainable finance, which connects investors around the world. In the coalition agreement, the government clearly made sustainable finances a priority for developing the financial centre. The aim is to develop Luxembourg as a centre of expertise in sustainable finance, and to promote and support public-private partnerships in the field of sustainable finance.  The underlying prcentre has found a new direction and diversified. It has adopted green, sustainable finance and is now the European market leader in this field.    In recent years, the government has launched several important climate finance initiatives together with partners from the financial sector:  the LU-EIB Climate Finance Platform, a joint initiative with the European Investment Bank (EIB), has been developed to mobilise investments for climate action projects with the  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 95   combination of a first loss guarantee. It is the first time that the EIB has entered into such a project with a Member State. This kind of initiative is key to reducing the risks (de-risking) of climate investment and to attracting private investors who would otherwise be reluctant to invest.  The International Climate Finance Accelerator, a public-private partnership, provides fund managers with financial and operative support to launch new and innovative climate funds.  The Forestry and Climate Change Fund is a ground-breaking impact fund which aims to demonstrate that sustainable forest management in secondary and degraded tropical forests generates economic, environmental and social value. Thanks to its important financial centre, Luxembourg can create a substantial leverage effect and play an important role in sustainable finance, far out of proportion to its geographical size. This means that Luxembourg acts as a catalyst driving sustainable investment, in particular by matching investors with sustainable investments. The roadmap towards sustainable finance Luxembourg already has a long and successful history in relation to sustainable finance, from microfinance to green bonds. LuxFLAG, a dedicated finance labelling agency, was set up back in the Luxembourg Green Exchange (LGX) was established in 2016. The LGX is the first platform in the are listed in Luxembourg.  Boosted by recent successes in this field, the relevant ministers presented the Luxembourg Sustainable Finance Roadmap (LSFR) in October 2018, together with the United Nations Environment Programme-Finance Initiative. This will further consolidate the leading role played by fact, Luxembourg ranks 4th on the Global Green Finance Index. The aim of the roadmap is to take stock of existing sustainable finance initiatives in Luxembourg, to lay the foundations for a sustainable finance strategy in order to contribute to the 2030 agenda and to achieve the targets set out in the Paris Climate Agreement, and to consolidate the leading   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 96   inable development and to European and international climate initiatives. It is leading the way towards future opportunities and challenges.  The recommendations cover several aspects of the financial centre, such as developing financial products for sustainable finance, developing education and training programmes to meet the needs of the financial sector, or promoting innovation to facilitate financing of sustainable development. In this connection, the government will support the creation of conditions which encourage a further increase in the market share held by sustainable financial products, in order to give  The LSFR recommendations will be supplemented by further analyses in the coming years, in order to produce a customised and feasible action plan. To achieve this, the Luxembourg Sustainable Finance Initiative, a public-private body, will be set up to bring together the relevant parties in the field of sustainable finance and will be led by the relevant ministers.  strategy, based on the key elements of the LSFR. It will also serve as a discussion platform for examining the feasibility and impact of the measures resulting from the LSFR recommendations. Equal opportunities and human rights  Luxembourg is committed to implementing climate change policies which help to promote equal opportunities, empower women and girls, and show respect for human rights.  Luxembourg recognises that climate change has gender-specific effects, and that increasing the participation and leading roles played by women and girls will boost the effectiveness of the fight against climate change and the level of ambition in all areas.  The National Plan for Sustainable Development is the main tool for implementing the 2030 Agenda in  As regards climate finance, in May 2017 Luxembourg presented its strategy for providing resources for ng  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 97   principles, including that funding should meet stringent requirements of environmental integrity, social benefits and gender equality.  At international level, aspects of climate change relating to human rights and to protecting local communities and indigenous peoples will also be taken into account. Luxembourg is actively engaged in promoting and protecting human rights in relation to climate change in various ways:  Establishing (May 2015) an inter-ministerial committee on human rights to improve national coordination and close cooperation with civil society, which is an integral component of the   Supporting the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform (UNFCCC)   Organising round tables and events, as well as encouraging the preparation of reports on human rights in the context of climate change in collaboration with the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In addition, over the past few years Luxembourg has signed all declarations and initiatives specifically focusing on human rights and gender equality in relation to climate change:  Geneva Pledge for Human Rights in Climate Action, COP21  Declaration on Gender Equality and Climate Change, COP24  For all Coalition, UNEA4  Climate Actions that advance Gender equality and Women Empowerment, UNCAS 2019  3.1.3.iii. Policies and measures to achieve low emission mobility (including electrification of transport) E-mobility As explained in Chapter 3.1.1.i, electromobility plays a particularly important role in decarbonising the transport sector in Luxembourg. The government has laid the foundations for supporting this by way of regulatory adjustments, such as supporting the inclusion of empty conduits in new buildings for subsequent  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 98   installation of a charging infrastructure, the regulated construction of a public charging network, and introducing financial support for purchasing electric vehicles.  Luxembourg will prepare a detailed route map in order to boost development of electromobility, and in view of the objective of the corresponding scenario of 49% of cars being electric by 2030 (see Chapter 2.2).  The cross-border element is particularly important in terms of promoting electromobility in Luxembourg, in order to make the switch an attractive prospect for over 200,000 commuters and Luxembourg residents who travel long distances abroad. The government will implement associated initiatives at the level of the Pentalateral Forum (DE, FR, B, NL, LU, AU, CH) and the Greater Region. Active mobility will also make a significant contribution to low-emission mobility. The detailed measures under MoDu 2.0 are described in 3.1.1.i.  Green batteries The government is proactively committed to new legislation on green batteries at EU level. The EU Commission will table a new directive at the start of 2020, which will enshrine in law a future 100% recycling rate for lithium and other materials used in batteries for all batteries used in cars, buses or elsewhere. The standards for the industrial processes which are necessary for producing batteries will also be subject to strict criteria. The EU Commission is also working with Canada, Japan and South Korea on an agreement to develop a sustainable mining initiative, to ensure that raw materials used in the EU come from mining areas with good health and safety conditions.  The EU budget also supports the development of European green battery production. With EU funding, Northvolt has alrewhere electricity comes from 100% renewable energy sources and the sourcing of minerals meets high environmental standards.  Biofuels A comprehensive strategy for the use of sustainable biofuels will be developed to help reduce emissions for conventional transport users. The blending of first-generation biofuels with fossil fuels plays a limited role here due to their less positive CO2-balance. The Luxembourg government will promote the use of second-generation biofuels through mandated blending and cooperation particularly with Benelux partners. The  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 99   government programme stipulated that use of first-generation biofuels is to be limited to no more than 5%, in order to promote the use of second-generation biofuels which are thought to be more sustainable.  EU standards for cars, vans and HGVs Alongside the national initiatives and programmes, the revision of the European legal framework establishing CO2 limit values for passenger vehicles and light commercial vehicles (final compromise with reductions of 37.5% and 31%, respectively, by 2030 compared to 2021) and for heavy goods vehicles (general approach with a reduction of 30% by 2030 compared to 2020) will also contribute significantly to lower-emission mobility. Luxembourg will strive to ensure that this revision stipulates that as of 2030, only fossil-free drive systems will be approved in the EU, for cars and vans at least.  3.1.3.iv. Any national policies, timelines and measures planned to gradually phase out energy subsidies, in particular for fossil fuels  environmentally harmful  The 2018 government programme indicated the intention to analyse the numerous direct and indirect subsidies and tax incentives relating to sustainable development and to finalise the test results of the ongoing study and use them for possible adjustment.  Luxembourg has set itself standards in its own plans (e.g. the National Plan for Sustainable Development) and targets that trigger a review of the existing subsidy policy. Launching such reforms of the framework conditions is necessitated not only by climate change objectives, but also other environmental and social targets. The study focuses on three specific sectors in particular (transport, energy and agriculture) where economic activities play a particular role that can lead to environmental pressures.
