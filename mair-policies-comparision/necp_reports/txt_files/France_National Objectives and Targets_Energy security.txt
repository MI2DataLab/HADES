Primary natural gas consumption reduction target       2017  2023  2028  Primary natural gas consumption (TWh  LHV)  459  401  345  Changes in primary gas consumption / 2012  +3%  -10%  -22%    2.3. Security of supply  Security of supply can be defined as the capacity of an energy system to meet market demand continuously and at a reasonable cost for the foreseeable future, by balancing supply and demand.  Confirmed targets and indicators are available in relation to the security of supply for electricity and gas. The underground storage infrastructures required for security of the gas supply are those that play a key role either by allowing natural gas to be conveyed within the transmission network or by safeguarding the capacity of the gas system to meet demand. Measures have only been taken (as outlined in Section 3) to ensure compliance with the policies in place, as outlined in Section 1.    2.4. Internal energy market  2.4.1. Electricity interconnectivity  The MEP provides for the roll-out of around 10 GW of additional interconnections by 2030, based on the Development Plan for the electricity transmission system. Plans have been made to establish interconnections of this kind with all countries that share borders with France, resulting in interconnectivity of around 26 GW by 2030. The indicators of the urgency of action provided for in Annex 1
