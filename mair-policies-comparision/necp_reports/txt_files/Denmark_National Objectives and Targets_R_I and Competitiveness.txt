        76  2.5 Dimension Research, innovation and competitiveness  (i) National objectives and funding targets for public and, where available, private research and innovation relating to the Energy Union including, if appropriate, a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met The new Danish government wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2030 compared to the 1990 level. To achieve this, new technologies will have to be developed and deployed before 2030.  In June 2018 the Danish Parliament made a Energy Agreement supported by all parties in the Parliament. As part of the agreement, Denmark has committed to spend 580 mill. DKK in 2020 on research, development and demonstration of new energy technologies. This commitment to double its public funding to research and development under Mission Innovation. With the research reserve agreement 2020, the Government and all the political parties has agreed to increase spending to green research, development and demonstration by 1 billion DKK  in 2020 in addition to the spending target in 2020 that follows from the Energy Agreement.  In 2020, 514 mill. DKK will be allocated to the Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP). EUDP supports development and demonstration of new energy technologies, as well as research supporting preparation for development and demonstration. The objective of EUDP is to create growth and jobs, increase the security of energy supply, and contribute to make Denmark independent of fossil fuels by 2050. 83 mill. DKK will be allocated to the energy area in Innovation Fund Denmark in 2020 (cf. the Budget proposal 2020). Furthermore, 629 mill. DKK will be allocated to green research in Innovation Fund Denmark in 2020. These funds cover different themes related to green research, including energy research. Innovation Fund Denmark primarily supports strategic research and development projects. In addition to this the Government funds Research and Innovation in the food sector and in relation to Environmental Technologies through the Green Development and Demonstration Programme (GUDP) and the Environmental Technology Development and Demonstration Programme (MUDP). It is estimated that both progammes allocates 10 mill. DKK to energy and climate related projects. Furthermore, the agreement states that by 2024 Denmark has a spending target of 1 billion DKK on research, development and demonstration of new technologies related to energy and climate.  The Danish parliament has already allocated 90 mill. DKK to research and development in limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector, which is relatively large in Denmark. The 90 mill. DKK will cover the period 2019-2021. The funds will help reach the Danish reduction target in 2030 in the non-ETS sector as well as the goal of reducing greenhouse gasses by 70% by 2030, relative to 1990 levels.  Denmark does not have any funding targets for private research and innovation relating to the energy union.          77  (ii) Where available, national 2050 objectives related to the promotion of clean energy technologies and, where appropriate, national objectives including long-term targets for the deployment of low-carbon technologies, including for decarbonising energy- and carbon-intensive industrial sectors and, where applicable, for related carbon transport and storage infrastructure  Denmark has a long term target of net-zero emission by 2050 at the latest and independence from fossil fuels. Furthermore, Denmark has a target of 55% of energy consumption coming from renewables by 2030 and more than 100% of its electricity consumption coming from renewables by 2030.  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2030, relative to 1990 levels, it is essential that funding is in place for research, development and demonstration as well as deployment of new climate friendly technologies. New solutions will have to be developed in the energy sector, in transportation and aviation as well as in the agricultural sector. Power-to-X is one of the technologies that potentially can contribute to fully decarbonizing the energy sector, transportation and aviation as well as agricultural and industrial sectors. For this reason, research on power-to-X development and upscaling will be supported and developed. As part of a future green mobility plan the Government wants to stop sales of all new diesel and petrol cars as of 2030 and enhance low emissions zones. This requires deployment of new green vehicles in Denmark. As part of the Energy Agreement from 2018 three new off-shore wind farms will be deployed by 2030. Thereby Denmark will make itself increasingly independent from fossil fuels. The large ratio of green energy production will require further research, development and demonstration of technologies to fully integrate and exploit the green energy. In order to accommodate future needs, the Danish Government has established a fund supporting developDKK and it was in December 2019 granted to two Power-to-X-projects. The projects will establish big scale production and storage of green hydrogen. Both projects have an ambition to demonstrate production and consumption of green hydrogen on near market based conditions. (iii) Where applicable, national objectives with regard to competitiveness The global green transition market continues to grow. In order to reach the temperature increase target limit, the international community must invest 90,000 billion DKK in green transition over the next 11 years. This represents a unique opportunity for the Danish business community, which must be exploited. The Government wants Denmark to be known as a nation of green entrepreneurialism.  It is a continuous Danish priority to deliver new green solutions to the fast-growing global market.
