 110  4 CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES  4.1 PROJECTED EVOLUTION OF MAIN EXOGENOUS FACTORS INFLUENCING ENERGY SYSTEM AND GHG EMISSION DEVELOPMENTS  Macroeconomic forecasts (GDP and population growth)  Malta has developed its own methodology and set of assumptions to forecast the macroeconomic indicators as part of the analytical basis of the NECP. These indicators consist of population figures, Gross Domestic Product, sectoral Gross Value Added, household size, number of households and disposable income. This set of national indicators was developed by external consultants and endorsed by the Economic Policy Department within the Ministry for Finance,73 and were consistently used by the various Ministries in all modelling exercises related to the development of the NECP. The same set of macroeconomic parameters feed into both the WEM and WPM scenarios.  economic expansion and associated increase in demand for labour, leading to high net inwards migration. Table 8 below presents projected population figures in 5-year periods until 2040. The projection is based on data published by the National Statistics Office (NSO) and the Ageing population report, with adjustments for net migration and natural increase in population. Although an assumption is made regarding the decreasing growth in population which drops down to 0.6% in 2030,  This naturally translates into an increase in the number of households during the projected period. The source for historical data for household size is Eurostat on the basis of the EU-SILC Survey (Survey for Income and Living Conditions) while the forecasted data is based on the EU Reference Scenario74 for 2016 published by the European Commission. The increased population will inevitably have a major impact on the energy system and future energy demand.  Table 8 - Projected total population and number of households as five-year averages. 5-year period 2016-2020 2021-2025 2026-2030 2031-2035 2036-2040 Total population 478,809 519,286 547,083 562,704 571,232 Number of households 180,003  192,328  210,416  216,425  219,705    Table 9 presents projected GDP growth rates until 2040. An assumption is made that the current trend of high annual economic growth will peak in 2017 at 6.6%, and will start to slow down and stabilize in the future, reaching 3.5% by 2030. Table 10 presents the projected evolution of GDP per capita. The outcome of GDP and population projections reported above leads to an increase in GDP per capita from over 20,000 EUR/p.c in 2017 to almost 30,000 EUR/p.c. by 2030.                                                             73 The classification of GVA projections in the sectors required for the NECP (i.e. agriculture & fishing, industry, and services) was carried out by external consultants using autogressive models where required. 74 EU Reference Scenario 2016: Energy, Transport and GHG Emissions - Trends to 2050.  111  Table 9 - Projected average GDP growth in five-year periods, %. 5-year period 2016-2020 2021-2025 2026-2030 2031-2035 2036-2040 Average GDP growth 5.63% 4.2% 3.70% 3.11% 2.32%  Table 10 - Projections of GDP per capita, EUR 2016 prices. 5-year period 2016-2020 2021-2025 2026-2030 2031-2035 2036-2040 Average GDP per capita 21,190  24,554  28,209  31,961  35,318    Sectorial changes expected to impact the energy system and GHG emissions Residential Sector The main driver of consumption in the residential sector is the growing population, reflected by a higher number of households. The average energy consumption by households is expected to increase by 10% between 2016 and 203075, while a 25% increase is projected in the number of dwellings. The increasing disposable income per household is expected to manifest as further penetration and use of certain devices, such as white appliances and air-to-air heat pumps, creating a general increase in electricity demand on a per household basis.  A gradual electrification of space heating and cooking is also projected, adding to the electricity demand for these end-uses. Indeed, residential consumption of electricity is expected to grow at a faster pace than that for fuels, although given the lack of district heating and cooling networks, LPG use for space heating and cooking is projected to continue to constitute a substantial portion of non-transport fuels (26% in 2016 and 24% in 2030).  Non-Residential Sector annual rate of 10% over a five-year period. Figure 30 illustrates the sectoral distribution of economic activity in 2017, indicating the dominant role played by the services sector, followed by the public sector. These two are expected to remain the most significant sectors in generating GVA, increasing slightly from constituting a combined 86% of GVA in 2017 to 87% in 2030 and 89% in 2040. Total GVA                                                             75 2016 is used as the reference year in this case as 2017 was a year of extremes in temperature, resulting in higher than expected energy consumption. Given that energy consumption was projected assuming average climatic conditions, comparison to 2017 data could not be made.  112  Figure 30 - GVA distribution in 2017, %.   A significant expansion in the economic activity of services and the public sector is thus expected, based on the projected growth in GVA between 2017 and 2040 and with these two sectors retaining their predominant role in GVA generation. This growth in activity will likely lead to an expansion in floor area utilised by such economic activities, as this will be required to support new and enlarged businesses. This additional floor space will also be required to accommodate: (i) the number of employees within these sectors, expected to double between 2017 and 2040; (ii) additional bed spaces in the health care sector, required to cater for an increased population; and (iii) additional bed spaces in elderly care facilities, owing to the proportion of the population aged over 75 growing from 7% in 2017 to 12% by 2040. Based on this assumption of projected economic growth creating an associated growth in the physical terms, the energy consumption required to provide and support such activities is necessarily expected to increase.  Demographic and employment trends were estimated based on trends in age groups established by Eurostat projections, the expected labour participation rate76, and recent trends in employment by economic activity type. They are depicted in Figure 31.                                                             76 Figures are based on policy note issued by the Central Bank of Malta in April 2019 entitled "A cohort approach to project the labour participation rate in Malta."

In 2017, approximately 59% of the gainfully employed in the public and services sectors worked in office-based jobs or educational institutions; this is projected to increase to 64% and 66% by 2030 and 2040, respectively. Given the particular energy consumption profile of such activities, predominanly electricity for space heating and cooling and ICT equipment, electricity demand for such end-uses is expected to create additional load on the electricity grid. Expected investments in data centres housed locally will also add to the demand on the electricity grid, constituting approximately 5% of final electricity consumption by 2030.  Hospitality, while contributing to 7% of the services sector GVA, is a significant consumer of both electricity and fuels (31% of energy consumption in the services sector in 2017) and, based on the projected continued growth in tourist arrivals, this sectoral consumption is expected to increase further during the next decade, although at a slightly slower pace than offices and educational institutions. In 2030, hospitality is projected to contribute to 6% of the sectoral GVA and be responsible for 28% of the sectoral energy consumption. The health care sector, incorporating hospitals, medical institutions and elderly care facilities, is also a heavy consumer of both electricity and fuels. Thus, the projected increase in these services is expected to create an associated growth in electricity and fuel consumption.    The industrial sector contributed towards 9% of the total GVA in 2017 and, on average, is expected to keep the share around 8% over the time horizon until 2040. The physical output from the manufacturing sector is projected to increase in line with results from pan-European models and national projections and the new opportunities expected to arise within this sector, such as the Medical Cannabis Industry which is estimated  by 2028.  Water supply, sewage and waste management in Malta is closely linked with the energy system due wastewater treatment, pumping and distribution. The overall demand for potable water is expected to increase, along with the volume of wastewater requiring treatment; however, the trend of increase in electricity demand for these end-uses shows decoupling from both population and economic  - 100,000 200,000 300,000 400,000 500,000 600,000 700,000201720202025203020352040Projected DemographicsOtherAge 4 - 14Age 15 - 64of which labour supplyAge 75 - 100+ 114  growth, largely as a result of investments in the sector and policies/campaigns to increase resource management efficiency.  Transport Sector The number of road vehicles is projected to continue to increase as a result of population growth and sustained economic development (Figure 32). That being said, the average fuel consumption and emissions per vehicle is projected to decrease slowly at least until 2030, as manufacturers respond to recent EU Regulations which set emission reduction targets on the fleet average of vehicle manufacturers. Meeting such targets is expected require manufacturers to include an increasing share of electric cars in their fleet, a trend expected to be reflected in the stock of newly imported vehicles in Malta. The effect of this development may be somewhat delayed as a signficant portion of newly licensed vehicles tend to be imported second-hand vehicles (56% in 2017). An increasing number of electric vehicles is bound to impinge on the average consumption of electricity although the impact on peaks may be mitigated through effective demand management.  In this context, an advantageous night-time electricity tariff, applicable to EV charging, is being introduced as from 2020.  Figure 32 The projected vehicle fleet profile by type of vehicle (fuel source not indicated), stock.  The projected increase in tourist arrivals is closely linked to the expected consumption of the aviation sector. This, along with increasing disposable income, is also projected to lead to growth in inland navigation, particularly the fuel consumption by leisure boats. These are two sectors which are considered difficuisland-state context. Non-road transport is also expected to register an increase in energy consumption, albeit at a slower rate than road transport.   Global energy trends, international fossil fuel prices, EU ETS carbon price Projected natural gas prices provided by ENTSO-G were used in modelling exercises for the development of the WEM and WPM , while those provided by the European Commission were used in sensitivity analyses. ENTSO-G prices were selected for the NECP WEM and WPM scenarios as these are considered as better representative of specific regional gas prices.  - 50,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 300,000 350,000 400,000 450,000 500,000201720202025203020352040Vehicle Fleet ProfilePassenger carsLight commercial vehiclesHeavy commercial vehicles & FreightMC and Quad&ATV 115  Projections provided by the Commission for EU ETS carbon price were used.

Solar PV  Future cost assumptions for small-scale residential solar photovoltaics 77 are based on the costs for small-scale rooftop solar PV set out in the ASSET (Advanced System Studies for Energy Transition) study on Technology pathways in decarbonisation scenarios, published in July 2018.78 Overnight investment costs and annual fixed operation and maintenance costs reported in EUR/kW are presented in the third row of Table 12 for 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050. In addition, a one-time connection fee was included in the overnight capital costs. The cost of the inverter (EUR/kW), which is assumed to be replaced in year 11, was calculated based on historical data of inverter costs and projected based on trends in overnight costs outlined in Table 13. The technical lifetime of solar PV technology was assumed to be 20 years.  For non-residential PV systems, the overnight investment costs and fixed annual operation and maintenance costs for solar PV with a high potential were selected from the ASSET study. However, given the variance between local (~and projected EU capital costs ( 700/kW in 2020), it was concluded that the ASSET study costs had to be complemented by other sources in order to accurately project the CAPEX of non-residential PV systems in Malta. Furthermore, capital costs in the ASSET database appear to exclude grid connection costs. In Malta, these costs are borne by the PV developer and were thus factored into national estimates of the CAPEX of commercial PV systems. However, grid connection costs are not fixed for systems with a capacity above 30 MW but are dependent on the particularities of the installation site; these costs can be relatively high, running into the hundreds of thousands depending on the site and the size of the installation.  The ASSET study projected costs based on average prices of solar PV in Europe which have, in recent years, been driven down significantly following the introduction of auctions to support utility-scale PV systems and other renewable technologies around Europe. Given that the average size of non-residential PV system in Malta is 12 kWp, ASSET prices are not reflective of local costs.  Therefore, for non-residential PV systems, it was assumed that the ASSET costs did not adequately account for the Balance of Systems components. These were factored into the total PV system costs based on projections published by Fraunhofer ISE (2015) on behalf of Agora Energierwende79. These are                                                            77 The present average size of residential PV systems is 3kWp. 78 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/2018_06_27_technology_pathways_-_finalreportmain2.pdf 79 Fraunhofer ISE (2015): Current and Future Cost of Photovoltaics.

As the report uses 2014 as its base year, it is likely that the recent price evolution of PV systems, as a result of the increase in utility-scale PV, was not captured and therefore the costs are more reflective of small-scale PV systems prevalent in Malta.

Traditionally, utility scale storage was restricted to pumped hydro, but with developments in battery storage, new solutions are becoming available. These can take the form of centralized, distributed or hybrid storage solutions. In light of this, the Energy and Water Agency commissioned the Institute for Sustainable Energy at the University of Malta to carry out a high-level assessment of battery storage solutions based on prevalent technologies.  The assessment delved into their financial feasibility, local availability and potential business models within the local context. The study showed that there are already a number of domestic suppliers of lithium-ion batteries80 with a typical lifetime of 10 years and an average of 6000 cycles, but their costs are rather steep with prices varying between  1500/kWh.  The conclusions of this assessment are being reviewed in view of future support schemes which also earmark EU funding opportunities.                                                              80 Certain local suppliers also stock lead-acid batteries but this study focused primarily on lithium-ion batteries.  117  Floating Offshore Wind Given that the geospatial properties of the Maltese islands preclude the installation of onshore or fixed-foundation offshore wind turbines, a high-level review of projected cost developments of floating offshore wind turbines was performed. The potential of floating offshore wind technology was assessed for the period 2021-2030. However, estimating the total installation costs for this innovative technology is difficult as available data is limited and few such projects have been implemented to date. Indeed, no cost assumptions were available from the ASSET study. In this regard, capital costs for floating offshore technology estimated by a study which explored the potential for floating offshore wind farms in the Mediterranean81 were used as a base to calculate the total installation costs. These are presented in Table 14 taken from the study by Zountouridou et al. (2015).  It must be noted that there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with the deployment of new l windfarm using floating wind turbines, Hywind Scotland, was installed off the coast of Peterhead in Scotland in July 2017, 25m from the shore at a depth of 95-suggested in a review by Zountouridou et al. (2015) indicating the high costs associated with the deployment of new energy technologies.   Table 14 - Low and high capital cost estimation, EUR/kW (Source: Zountouridou et al., 2015).    Low High Fixed-bottom technology 2600 4200 Floating technology 3200 4550  Other Technologies In calculating the projected investment needs for technologies (outlined in section 5.3), a number of assumptions were adopted regarding purchasing costs, average technical lifetime, and, in some cases, annual average load factors. These are presented in Table 15 and Table 16. The assumed technology costs are generally in line with the database provided by the European Commission although, when available, a number of adjustments were made for specific technologies (such as heat pumps) to better capture costs on the Maltese market. These costs assumptions also consider a certain level of efficiency uptake, in line with the projected WEM and WPM scenarios described in the NECP.                                                                81 Zountouridou, E.I., Kiokes, G.C., Chakalis, S., Georgilakis, P.S. and Hatziargyriou, N.D., 2015.

Figure 33 - Total GHG emission trends, 1990-2017   The peak of GHG emissions was recorded in 2012, where such emissions were 51% higher than in 1990. In contrast, the lowest level of emissions was recorded in 2016, wherein total national GHG emissions were around 10% lower than in 1990 (Figure 34). Between 2012 and 2017, there is a difference of more than 62 percentage points when both years are compared to 1990 emissions. The 2017 total national emissions are almost 41% lower than 2012 emissions82. The drop in the total emissions registered from 2012 onwards relates to the energy sector, with the onset of the electricity interconnection with Sicily and the subsequent shift from heavy fuel oil to natural gas in local power generation.                                                             82 Analysis of trends is based on total emissions with LULUCF.

Up until 2012, there are sixteen instances of positive year-to-year changes, i.e. an increase in emissions is recorded from one year to the next, out of a possible twenty-two. Subsequent to 2012, there are three instances of year-to-year negative changes (i.e. emissions decrease for one year to the next), with two instances of a year-to-year increase (2013 to 2014 and 2016 to 2017). The biggest year-to-year change is observed for 2014-2015, with total emissions in 2015 being more than 23% lower than the previous year. The trend in positive versus negative year-to year changes and the relative changes observed correlate with the overall trend for the whole period.

Population has grown steadily over the years83. As observed for the trend in total emissions, GHG emissions per capita also show a general increasing trend from 1990 until 2012; this trend is then reversed after 2012, with GHG emissions per capita increasing, even though population growth continued at a similar rate to previous 2 eq. per capita. The lowest rates of GHG emissions per capita are recorded for 2016 (4.2 tonnes CO2 eq. per capita). A slight increase in 2017 (up to 4.5 tonnes CO2 eq. per capita) was observed and this was due mainly to an increase in the energy production sector.  One can infer that for the latter years, a certain decoupling between GHG emissions trends and population trends of the Maltese Islands, or, in other words, that population statistics alone cannot directly explain the changes in GHG emissions over the whole period under consideration. Indeed, one could consider that greater demand for major emitting activities in Malta, particularly energy (and therefore, energy generation) and mobility (i.e. road transport) as population grew, could explain the increasing emissions at least until 2012, as these activities have been, as will be seen later, the major contributors to overall emissions in absolute terms. However, targeted measures even in one sector or category could have a major impact on overall emissions, despite continued population growth, even more so if that one sector or category has a significant share of total national emissions. This is the case for the period after 2012, when very substantial emission reductions due to major technical                                                            83 Population data from NSO; population data as at end-of-year. -20%-10%0%10%20%30%40%50%60%% change Y on 1990, without LULUCF% change Y on 1990, with LULUCF 123  developments in the electricity generation sector, have counteracted any increase that one may have expected would occur due to continued population growth.  Figure 36  Trend in emissions per capita compared to population growth trend   Emission trends by gas Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions contribute the biggest share of total national emissions (ETS and non-ETS) with the trend mirroring that of total national emissions changes.

The share of CO2 is decreasing, a trend that becomes especially evident in the second half of the time-series. This is due to two main factors: the trend in CO2 absolute emissions, especially the decrease maintained over recent years, and a growth in emissions of HFCs. The latter will be explored in further detail later on in this section.   Figure 38 - Percentage share by gas of total GHG emissions   Carbon dioxide emissions and removals As shown in Figure 39, the majority of CO2 emissions reported by Malta are generated by the energy sector (2016 share: 99.7%) of total national CO2 emissions), with very small amounts estimated for sectors IPPU (0.03%), LULUCF (reporting net emissions, 0.24%) and waste (0.05%). Within the energy sector, the category Energy Industries had a share of 45% of total national CO2 emissions while transport had a share of 39%, in 2017 (Figure 40 - Share of sector/category in total CO2 emissions for ). The increase in emissions seen in 2017 was due to major reliance on local electricity generation as opposed to purchased electricity through interconnection with mainland Europe.  0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%1990199119921993199419951996199719981999200020012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017CO2 (with LULUCF)CH4N2OHFCsPFCsSF6NF3 126  Figure 39 - CO2 emission trends by sector   Figure 40 - Share of sector/category in total CO2 emissions for 2017   Methane emissions The waste and agriculture sectors are two main contributors to total national CH4 emissions (Figure 41), with the share from the waste sector showing an increase over time.

Prior to 2000, equipment for refrigeration and cooling predominantly used CFCs. Consequently, with the placement of equipment of HFCs on the market emissions of this F-gas increased. The rate of growth is identified by the gradient of the trend. All emissions of these gases fall within the sector IPPU. It is worth noting that emissions of HFCs in 2017 accounted for around 99% of total IPPU emissions.

The first sub-trend reflects increased demand for energy, primarily in electricity generation and transport. This is followed by very substantial, and relatively quick, efficiency gains, in emission terms, in electricity generation over the more recent years. This albeit a slight increase in emissions from the electricity generation sector due to the higher share of local generation replacing importation of electricity.  Figure 48 - Emission trends in the energy sector   The very strong influence that the energy sector has always had on national GHG emissions in Malta has already been noted above. This can be further shown when one compares the relative year-to-year change in energy emissions and the change from 1990 emissions when compared to the same assessment for total national GHG emissions.   The majority of emissions from the energy sector can be attributed to CO2, with methane and nitrous oxide emissions together accounting for just above 0.5% of the total energy GHG emissions in 2017.   0.00500.001000.001500.002000.002500.003000.001990199119921993199419951996199719981999200020012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017Emissions (Gg CO2eq.)Emission trends for sector Energy: total and by categoryEnergy IndustriesManufacturing Industries & ConstructionTransportCommercial/InstitutionalResidentialAgriculture/Forestry/FishingNon-Specified (Military)Energy Total 132  Figure 49 - Annual percentage change in Energy sector emissions year to year   Figure 50 - Annual percentage change in Energy sector emissions compared to base year (1990)     -35.0%-30.0%-25.0%-20.0%-15.0%-10.0%-5.0%0.0%5.0%10.0%15.0%20.0%1990199119921993199419951996199719981999200020012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017Year on Year changes in Energy (%)-40.0%-30.0%-20.0%-10.0%0.0%10.0%20.0%30.0%40.0%50.0%1990199119921993199419951996199719981999200020012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017% change from Base year (1990) 133  IPPU sector emissions  The overall profile of IPPU emissions over the 1990-2017 period shows a consistent increase since the turn of the millennium (Figure 51). The major contributors to HFC emissions are activities under category 2F1 Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning, which on its own had a share greater than 98% in 2017 of total IPPU GHG emissions.  Figure 51 - Emissions trends by gas within IPPU sector   Agriculture Sector emissions In general, emissions from the agricultural sector have seen a decrease in emissions over the 1990-2017 period (Figure 52), with emissions in 2017 being 15% lower than 1990 emission levels. The overall share of this sector in total national emissions has not fluctuated much during the period, starting at 3.6% in 1990 and being at 3.0% in 2017.   In the agriculture sector, it is worth noting a more balanced sharing of total sector emissions between the two gases, as opposed to the situation in other sectors (Energy and IPPU), where one GHG has a dominant position as the major contributor to sectoral total emissions. In this sector, both methane and nitrous oxide are important contributors, with only a relatively small difference in their respective share, a situation that has been maintained over the course of the period 1990-2017, with methane emissions being always somewhat higher (CH4: 55%; N2O: 45%; in 2017).   The category with the highest share of estimated emissions in this sector is 3A Enteric Fermentation, followed by 3D Agricultural Soils and 3B Manure Management.  0.0050.00100.00150.00200.00250.00300.00350.001990199119921993199419951996199719981999200020012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017GgCO2 eqIPPU  CO2IPPU  CH4IPPU  N2OIPPU  HFCIPPU  PFCIPPU  SF6 134  Figure 52 - Emission trends by gas within Agriculture sector    Figure 53 - Share by gas in total Agriculture emissions, 2017   LULUCF sector emissions and removals The LULUCF sector consistently shows the lowest share of total national GHG emissions throughout the time-series (0.1% in 1990; 0.2% in 2017).   0.0010.0020.0030.0040.0050.0060.0070.0080.0090.001990199119921993199419951996199719981999200020012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017Emissions (Gg CO2eq.)Emission trends for sector Agriculture: total and by categoryAgriculture TotalEnteric FermentationManure ManagementManaged SoilsCH455%N2O45%CH4N2O 135  Variations in year-to-year emission estimates seem relatively large (Figure 54); however, this should be seen in the context of a sector with very small levels of emissions and year-to-year relative differences can appear to be more significant than they are in absolute terms. Only CO2 emissions are reported for this sector.  Figure 54 - Emission trends in LULUCF sector   Waste sector emissions Before being overtaken by IPPU sector in the later years of the first decade of the millennium, for a long period of time, the waste sector was the second highest contributor to national GHG emissions after energy generation. Over that same period, sectoral emissions from waste showed a consistent increase. In later years, estimated emissions vary substantially, though the general trend is that emissions since 2008 have always been less than the peak reached in 2007.  0.000.501.001.502.002.503.003.504.004.505.001990199119921993199419951996199719981999200020012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017GgCO2eq 136  Figure 55 - Emission trends in Waste sector   The distribution of waste sector emissions between gases sees the predominance of CH4 as the GHG with the largest share of sector emissions, by far surpassing the contributions of N2O and CO2. Emissions from solid waste management account for the largest share of emissions in this sector.  EU ETS  The European Union has established the largest multi-country (to date covering 28 EU Member States, with the participation also of Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and multi-sector emissions trading scheme, covering large, stationary, greenhouse gas-emitting industrial installations (since 2005) and, as from 2012, aviation activities.

These modelled scenarios are based on specific assumptions regarding framework conditions, including demographic and economic activity, technological trends, energy costs/prices and similarly relevant variables, described in Section 4.1. The policies and measures, and combinations thereof, that have been implemented, or will be implemented, at different points in time are modelled as exogeneous variables. The model is sub-divided into a number of sector-specific sub-models having different levels of complexity.  The historic data feeding into the sectoral models to estimate GHG emissions projections is the same as the reported for submission in 2019, i.e. latest historic year of 2017. Two main policy scenarios have been projected, namely  With Exiting Measures Scenario (WEM)implemented after the reference or base year (taken as 2017) and,  With Planned Measures Scenario (WPM) currently implemented and adopted policies and measures as at end 2017, together with other planned policies and measures committed for implementation in the years thereafter.    050000010000001500000200000025000003000000050000010000001500000200000025000002005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017Total electrcity geenerated in Malta (MWh)Total ETS Stat Inst CO2emissions (tonnes CO2)Electricity generated in MaltaTotal CO2 emissions for electricity generated in Malta by EU ETS plants 138  Energy sector projections Figure 56 illustrates the total GHG emissions from the energy sectors, including sectors falling under the EU ETS (i.e. power generation and international aviation) under the WPM scenario.

The GHGs identified as being emitted by this sector are CO2, HFCs and SF6, as reported in the national inventory under the categories: Soda Ash Production and Use, Carbide Production, Use of N2O for Anaesthesia and Consumption of Halocarbons and SF6. Since most of the sectors are relatively minor, projections are solely based on the refrigeration and air-conditioning sector, which covers more than 95% of the whole sector. In view of the climatic conditions experienced in Malta, and the increased purchasing power, the demand for active cooling in the residential and commercial building stock is on the increase. Whilst in the development of the national long-term decarbonisation strategy, policies and measures are being assessed to curb the emissions generated from this sector, namely market-based mechanisms, at present the trend in projected emissions is on the rise as identified in the figure below illustrating With Existing Measures In this iteration of the NECP, the GHG emissions for the IPPU sector under the WPM scenario have not been modelled, since the fluctuations of the European market and beyond which are set to come into play in the coming years should result in emission reductions across the board, however the trajectory of such emissions reductions is difficult to pre-empt at this stage. IPPU emissions are therefore identical under both WEM and WPM.

In animal husbandry for example, the restructuring of the sector to conform to animal welfare, food safety, veterinary and waste management requirements, particularly those arising from EU legislation, will lead directly to a decrease in emissions due to reduced activity or reduction in emissions from the realization of the requirements already mentioned.   A model was developed over 2017 to estimate the projections of activity data from which methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture waste and managed soils are calculated. The activity data consisted of the number of animal heads including cattle, swine, sheep, goats, horses, poultry and rabbits, milk production and agriculture land area. The projections are based on a three-year moving average taking actual data for 2016 as the base year. The various animal heads were subsequently sub-divided by age group and/or by type, for example cattle was first sub-divided between dairy and non-dairy and subsequently each division was sub-divided again for cattle aged less than 1 year, between 1 and 2 years of age and over 2 years of age. This approach allowed for greater precision in the estimation of emissions from livestock. The model covers projections of GHG emissions over a period spanning 1990  2040. The WPM scenario takes into account the measure relating to the dewatering of slurries as a management measure to address emissions from manure. In view of the minor significance of the emissions generated by the agricultural sector, no considerable reductions are envisaged as the activity within this sector is projected to remain stable over the coming years.  Figure 59 - Agriculture GHG emission projections, WEM and WPM    60.5061.0061.5062.0062.5063.0063.5064.0064.5065.00201720182019202020212022202320242025202620272028202920302031203220332034203520362037203820392040WPMWEM 141  LULUCF Projections Malta has developed the Forest reference level (FRL) relevant to Regulation (EU) 2018/841, and the final FRL value for 2021-2025 is -0.0376ktCO2. A similar slightly higher FRL is estimated for 2026-2030 (-0.0479 ktCO2). The very marginal nature of the sector is further shown in Figure 60 as projected under the WEM scenario, where a strong decrease in overall emissions from the sector is projected in percentage terms but only amounts to less than 1GgCO2eq.  Whilst the policy direction in the years to come is to further augment afforestation projects to enhance the sequestration potential to its maximum, the scale of such projects and the scale of removals would still be very limited in view of the geographical limitations of ours islands. Hence, LULUCF emissions in the WPM scenario correspond to those under the WEM.  Figure 60 - Net LULUCF emission totals   Waste Projections The waste sector will experience a significant reduction in the portion of municipal solid waste going to landfill, which shall be diverted to either biological or thermal treatment with energy recovery. The advent of thermal treatment of municipal waste will appear as a net increase in emissions for the year of application with a gradual but constant decrease in emissions from landfilling being more accentuated in the later period. This trade-pursuant to waste regulations and land use conflicts which will result in view of the potential extension to the engineered landfill. The projection of waste generation is based on the correlation between a relevant driver trend between 2013 and 2016, relative to the actual trend in waste generation 2013-2016. This correlation is represented by a constant, which is multiplied by the projected macroeconomic driver, leading to the projected waste generation for that particular year.

Following completion of a waste generation scenario, each waste stream was portioned into the different waste treatment options based on the WEM or WPM scenario. In the WEM scenario, the capacity of existing options is respected, with the remainder being directed to landfilling. In both scenarios, it is assumed that landfilling space will not run out at any moment and that capacity of present plants will be retained all along the period. This means that if any plant included in the WEM scenario ceases to operate in the timeframe of the projection, a similar plant in terms of technology and capacity will replace it immediately. The difference between the WEM and WPM scenarios, is due to shifting of waste streams from one option (e.g. landfilling) to another option higher in the waste hierarchy (e.g. thermal treatment with energy recovery, anaerobic digestion or recycling). To date the model does not account for behavioural changes that induce quantitative waste generation changes, thus waste avoidance is not accounted for at this stage. This is mainly due to the low confidence and inability to model behavioural change induced by measures included both in the WEM and WPM scenario. The below charts illustrate the waste distribution per emitting treatment stream.

As of 2017, the share of renewable energy in relation to gross final energy consumption is estimated to have reached 7.3%, increasing from 6.4% reached in the previous year. As shown in table, the highest relative share of renewable energy was achieved in the heating and cooling sector.  Table 20  Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption, total and per sector 2010 - 2017 %  2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Heating & Cooling86 7.1% 12.2% 10.9% 14.5% 14.9% 15.5% 17.2% 19.7% Electricity 0.0% 0.5% 1.1% 1.6% 3.3% 4.3% 5.7% 6.8% Transport 0.6% 2.2% 3.5% 3.8% 5.2% 5.3% 5.7% 7.2% Overall RES share 1.1% 1.8% 2.8% 3.7% 4.7% 5.3% 6.4% 7.3%  Total final energy consumption of RES in Malta in 2017 amounted to 454 GWh. This portrays a substantial annual increase from the 383 GWh registered in 2016, which can be attributed primarily to the continued deployment of solar PVs and greater use of biofuels on the Maltese market. This is to be compared to a mere 6 GWh of RES consumption registered in 2005, when only a handful of solar water heating systems were practically the only RES technology in Malta.                                                            86 Excludes ambient heat from heat pumps in 2010-2012.  100.00150.00200.00250.00300.00350.00400.00201720182019202020212022202320242025202620272028202920302031203220332034203520362037203820392040GgCO2YearWEMWPM 145   to fully exploit potential of effective indigenous gross final consumption of energy. PV technology was demonstrated to be the most robust and fastest-growing of all technologies, owing much to the characteristics of Malta in relation to solar intensity but also to the successful history of public and Government initiatives to promote the technology. Yield of PV systems in Malta is among the highest in Europe. There was a sharp increase in the uptake of PV between 2010 and 2017, with the total cumulative installed capacity at the end of 2017 standing at just over 112 MWp. Successful PV deployment has happened largely due to national incentives offered through various schemes, including ERDF co-financed grants and attractive feed-in-tariffs.  Figure 65 below provides a visualisation of the share of renewables in final energy consumption by technology in 2017. The largest contribution of renewable energy is provided by solar PVs, contributing to around 36% of renewable energy in 2017, followed by heat pumps with 25%, the use of biofuels in the transport sector at 19% and solar water heaters, contributing with 13%. While there has been a continued increase in the use of heat pumps for heating and cooling, and biofuels used in the transport sector, the installation of new solar water heaters in recent years has slowed down. Other sources of RES include electricity and heat produced by waste-to-energy plants, biomass imports and the electricity consumed by electric and plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles.  Figure 65 - Share of RES technologies in consumption in 2017  Share of RES in the heating and cooling sector Malta does not have any district heating networks as past studies indicated and confirmed that district heating networks would not be cost-effective. In 2017, the consumption of RES in the heating and cooling sector is estimated to have reached 195 GWh, which represents an increase from 175 GWh in the previous year. In comparison, the consumption of RES in H&C in 2010 only accounted for 45 GWh87. Renewable energy share in the heating and cooling sector can be attributed primarily to the                                                            87 Ambient heat from air-to-air heat pumps is estimated to have provided 42 GWh, making the total figure for RES_H&C 87 GWh as opposed to 45 GWh. However, in the published energy balances and energy statistics, ambient heat from heat-pumps is not calculated before 2013, that is, prior to the publication of Commission Decision 2013/114/EU which established the guidelines for Member States on calculating renewable energy from heat pumps.  146  use of air-to-air heat pumps and solar water heaters, with biomass imports, heat produced from Waste-to-Energy plants and bioliquids used for spatial heating and industrial processes in the industrial sector accounting for the balance.  Figure 66 below shows the development of renewable energy consumption in the heating and cooling sector between 2010 and 2017. The figure provides a visualisation of the continued increase of RES technology penetration in the heating and cooling sector, driven by heat pumps and solar water heaters. Renewable ambient cooling using air-to-air heat pumps is not included.   Figure 66 - Renewable energy consumption in H&C, 2010-2017, GWh  Due to its typical warm Mediterranean climate, the major application for heat pumps in Malta has traditionally been for ambient cooling. This has resulted in buildings being fitted with reversible air-to-air units. However, also in response to lower electricity tariffs, the utilisation of heat pumps technology for heating purposes increased, supplementing or, in some cases, replacing the use of either LPG heaters or electric filament heaters. In 2017, there were almost 300,000 air conditioners employing heat pump technology (split-units) installed in Malta, with 204,500 of these installed within the residential sector. Their utilisation in SMEs and large enterprises for both heating and cooling has also been on the rise.  Solar Water Heaters (SWH) are favoured by the high solar intensity prevalent in Malta and they eliminate a good percentage of energy consumption otherwise going for water heating in the residential and to a lesser extent the commercial sector. However, their use is limited in summer when ambient temperature is high and hot water demand is low even though their yield is at its maximum. Since 2005, a number of grant schemes have been provided to promote the use of solar water heaters for households, increasing RES-H generation by an average of 3.8 GWh/year. Nevertheless, a downward trend in recent years is evident, as the number of SWH installations including the number of grant requests fell well below the peak reached in 2009. This negative trend can be attributed mainly to the consumer shift towards PV systems, developments in the construction and renovation                                                             02040608010012014016018020020102011201220132014201520162017GWhRES consumption in H&C, 2010-2017, GWhHeat pumpsSWHWtE (heat)Biomass importsBioliquids (industry) 147  of buildings linked with limited roof accessibility and saturation of the SWH domestic market at current levels of support.  Biomass imports comprised primarily of wood charcoal, fuel wood and wood pellets, which are used for heating purposes by the approximately 12,000 households that have a wood or pellet burning stove or fireplace, as well as a small number of establishments in the services sector and industry. Generation of renewable energy from waste treatment in the form of heat made a contribution of just under 7 GWh in 2017.  This contribution is attributed to the combined heating and power (CHP) and Regenerative Thermal Oxidiser (RTO) facilities at the Sant Antnin Solid Waste Treatment Plan (SAWTP), an RTO at the Maghtab Environmental Complex and the Malta North Mechanical and Biological in 2014, which focuses on increased prevention, re-use, recycling and recovery and minimisation of disposal and considers energy recovery as an effective measure to process residual waste and reduce land-filling.  Share of RES in the electricity sector Figure 67 - Renewable energy consumption in the electricity sector between 2010-2017, GWh  The share of electricity production from renewable energy in relation to total electricity consumption was 7.4% in 2017, an increase from 6.4% from the previous year. Apart from electricity generation from PV systems, the other contributor towards renewable electricity are the electrical output from CHP plants treating waste and sewage, managed by Wasteserv and Water Services Corporation respectively. In 2017, waste-to-energy plants generated 9.74 GWh of electricity. The contribution of microwind is deemed to be negligible. The development of renewable energy consumption in the electricity sector from 2010 to 2017 can be seen in Figure 67. Renewable electricity generation in 2017 amounted to 172 GWh.

RES consumption in the transport sector in 2017 reached 87.1 GWh, which constitutes a significant increase from the 7.9 GWh in 2010.  Figure 68 - Renewable energy consumption in the transport sector, GWh   As shown in Figure 68, RES in the transport sector is almost exclusively the result of the use of biofuels, with renewable electricity in transport having a minimal role. The dominant biofuels used in Malta are Hydro-treated Vegetable Oil (HVO) and FAME biodiesel. Malta requires that biofuels placed on the market fulfil the necessary sustainability criteria and comply with EU directives and local legislation. In order to achieve an increasing penetration of biofuels in the transport sector, Legal Notice 68/2011 wholesalers of automotive fuels are obliged to place on the market a minimum biofuel content as a percentage of the total energy content of fossil diesel and petrol.  In 2018, fuel suppliers were obliged to blend conventional automotive fuels with at least 8.5% biofuels by energy content. The percentage blend shall rise to 10% by 2020, thus enabling Malta to reach its RES target in transport. To supplement diesel blending, the use of HVO has been introduced by importers since 2015. As of 2017, 47 GWh of HVO was consumed by road transport, which accounts for more than half of the renewable energy consumption of the transport sector.  As mentioned above and seen in Figure 68 the contribution of renewable electricity in the transport sector is only marginal. In 2017, there were 332 registered electric vehicles in Malta, ranging from passenger vehicles, motorcycles and quads to electric light and heavy-duty vehicles. Another 861 vehicles were registered as hybrid.  The main benefit of electric vehicles lies in achieving zero tailpipe emissions, although the effective reduction in GHG emissions largely depends on the energy mix and efficiency of generation infrastructure. However, these figures are negligible when compared to the total number of 364,274 passenger, light duty and heavy-duty vehicles registered in Malta as of end of 2017. The low uptake of electric vehicles can be attributed to the relatively high capital cost compared to internal combustion engines, notwithstanding Government incentives to promote the 0.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.090.0100.020102011201220132014201520162017GWhRES consumption in transport, GWhBiofuelsElectric vehicles 149  purchase of electric vehicles, which include a grant of 6,000 EUR available to individuals, enterprises, as well as NGOs when purchasing an electric vehicle.    Indicative projections of development with existing policies for the year 2030 with an outlook to the year 2040 Current policies and measures on the promotion and support of renewable energy extend until 2020, in line with the 2017 National Renewable Energy Actioscenario of the NECP it is assumed that existing support for RES, such as the PV grants scheme and the substitution obligation on fuel importers will not be extended beyond their current timeframe. In view of thisdevelopment in the area of renewables until 2030; this is outlined in Section 2.  Table 21 illustrates scenario. While the overall RES share, as well as renewables in the electricity sector and transport sector would decrease, RES in heating & cooling would continue to increase because air-to-air heat pump technology deployment is not policy-driven. In the transport sector, the RES-T share would fall almost to zero due to the absence of an obligation for fuel importers to blend biofuels post-2020.
