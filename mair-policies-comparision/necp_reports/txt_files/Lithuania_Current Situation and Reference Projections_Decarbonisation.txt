Oil and natural gas and other GHG emissions from energy production  289  285  304  377  497  502  555  525  After a significant recession in 1992, triggered by the collapse of the Soviet economy, a transition from a centralised planned economy to market economy by restructuring manufacturing, energy industries and agriculture took place. In 1990, after regaining independence from the Soviet Union after 50 years of annexation, Lithuania inherited an energy-intensive economy. The resource blockade carried out by the USSR in 1991-1993 led to a sharp decline in economic activity, as evidenced by the fall in GDP in the early 1990s. The economic situation improved in the mid-1990s and the GDP grew until 1999, before it slumped again in 1999-2000 due to the Russian economic crisis. The growth resumed in 2001 and continued until 2008.  In the early 1990s, the manufacturing, energy and agriculture mainly relied on fossil fuels. A comparison of the annual aggregate fuel balances for the period 19902017 shows a significant decrease in the final consumption of heavy fuel oil (e.g. from an annual level of around 57,800 TJ in 19901991 to around 17,200 TJ in 19931994, less than 600 TJ in 2008 and less than 500 TJ from 2015), as well as a decrease in the use of coal, petrol and natural gas, but a higher consumption of wood. The reduction in the use of heavy fuel oil was primarily a result of environmental requirements: the use of heavy fuel oil containing sulphur was banned from 1 January 2004 and even stricter requirements entered into force from 2008. As it was not economically viable for companies to remove sulphur from heavy fuel oil, these requirements led to a shift from heavy fuel oil to other fuels (e.g. natural gas) resulting in a significant reduction of annual emissions of 4.

The last significant decrease in 2009 was due to the economic crisis in Europe, and after 2009 GHG emissions stabilised at around 20 Mt CO2 eq.

GHG emission trends in 19902017  The energy sector is the largest contributor to GHG emissions, accounting for 55.5% of total GHG emissions in 2017. The energy sector accounted for the largest shares of CO2 (80% of total CO2 emissions) and CH4 (15.5% of total CH4 emissions) and a small amounts of N2O (5.8% of total N2O emissions).  The second sector in terms of GHG emissions is agriculture, which accounted for 21.3% of total GHG emissions. In 2017, the agricultural sector accounted for the largest share of N2O (84.4% of total N2O) and CH4 (54.1% of total CH4) as well a small amount of CO2 (0.22% of total CO2). The industrial processes and industrial products sector accounted for 17.6% of total GHG emissions, of which CO2 accounted for 19.7% of total CO2 emissions and N2O for 7.6% of total N2O emissions. One of the main sources of GHG emissions in the industrial processes and products sector is the use of fluorinated GHGs, which accounted for 19.8% of total industrial GHG emissions in 2017.  The waste sector accounted for 5.1% of total GHG emissions in 2017. This sector accounted for the largest share of CH4 (30.4% of total CH4 emissions) and a small amount of N2O (2.1% of total N2O emissions).

(excl. LULUCF) in 2017  In Lithuania, non-EU ETS sectors account for a larger share of GHG emissions than EU ETS sectors do. Between 2005 and 2017, this share increased from 56% to 70% of total GHG emissions (Figure 4.2.1.3). In 2017, GHG emissions from sectors participating in the EU ETS amounted to 6,283 kt CO2 eq, or 30% of total GHG emissions, and GHG emissions in non-ETS sectors totalled 14,421 kt CO2 eq , or 70% of national GHG emissions. In 2017, GHG emissions in ETS sectors decreased by 37% compared to 2005, and GHG emissions in non-ETS sectors exceeded the GHG quota by 0.1%. It should be noted that as from 2013 the chemical industry, with 3.4 million tonnes of CO2 eq in non-ETS sectors, has been classified as an ETS sector and therefore the change in GHG emissions in non-ETS sectors is considered positive (increased), although it is negative (decreased) based on actual data. 4.

Subsequently, due to expected improvements in vehicle efficiency, sustainable urban mobility plans and changes in the use of vehicles, GHG emissions in the transport sector are projected to decrease. The road transport sector accounts for 95% of total GHG emissions from transport, 80% of which is accounted for by passenger cars. GHG emissions in the industrial sector result technological processes where substantial reductions in GHG emissions from production are hardly possible. Therefore, reductions in industrial GHG emissions are expected to result mainly from the reductions in fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions due to the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 517/2014. The dynamics of GHG emissions in the agricultural sector depend on the quantities of mineral and organic nitrogen fertilisers used, the number of farm animals, crop yields and crop areas. No changes are projected in the distribution of GHG in the agricultural sector up to 2030. Agricultural soils will account for 56% and intestinal fermentation for 32% of total agricultural GHG emissions. The waste sector is expected to reduce GHG emissions as a result of an improved waste management system and increasing public awareness. 4.

GHG emission trends in 20182040 by non-ETS sector   GHG emissions from sectors not covered by the EU ETS will continue to account for the largest share in the future. The main sources of GHG emissions are energy, transport and agriculture. Figure 4.2.1.4 shows projected GHG emissions by non-ETS sector.  The projected GHG emissions from sectors participating in the EU ETS are presented in Table 4.2.1.3. The projections do not take into account the changes in the allowance price, except for the gas pipeline transport and services (state company Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant) sub-sectors, where GHG emissions are relatively low (not more than 11 kt CO2 eq in total).

Historical and projected GHG emissions, kt CO2 eq (excluding the transport sector)  Overall, GHG emissions in all sub-sectors will decrease or remain stable compared to 2017. It is estimated that increased energy consumption efficiency and use of biomass will reduce fossil fuel consumption by 13% and final energy consumption by 1.9% by 2040, leading to lower GHG emissions in this sector.   Transport GHG projections for the transport sector are based on forecasts on road transport, freight and passenger turnover and fuel consumption (domestic aviation and rail transport). These activity data for GHG projections have been provided by the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Republic of Lithuania. Fuel consumption for the transport of natural gas by pipeline has been calculated on the basis of gross natural gas consumption modelled based the LEAP modelling tool. Emissions have been calculated on the basis of the methodology set out in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines99. The total number of internal combustion engine vehicles is projected to grow by 2.9% per year until 2023 and subsequently growth is expected to slow down to 0.5% per year until 2030 as a result of the planned sustainable urban mobility plans. Taking into account the demographic situation in Lithuania (population decline), the number of vehicles with internal combustion engines is also projected to decrease by 0.5% per year between 2030 and 2040 (from 1.81 million road vehicles in 2030 to 1.71 million in 2040). This development will lead to a corresponding trend in GHG emissions in the transport sector.

Historical and projected GHG emissions in the transport sector by category  Compared to 2005, GHG emissions in all transport sub-sectors will increase or remain stable, with the exception of the rail sector, where electrification is currently underway. It is estimated that electrification of railways will reduce fossil fuel consumption by 29.9% by 2030 (and 47.2% by 2040), leading to lower GHG emissions in this sector. The road transport subsector is estimated to remain the main source of GHG emissions in the transport sector, accounting for 95% of GHG emissions in the transport sector in 2017 and 96.6% in 2040.   Industrial processes and product use Projections of GHG emissions from industrial processes and products using existing policies and measures (EPM) are based on data on production levels (activity data) provided by major industrial producers (of cement, glass, lime, ammonia and nitric acid). Projected data for the years 2020, 2025, 2030, 2035 and 2040 were provided by industrial enterprises. Interim data have been interpolated. The projection of fluorinated GHG emissions is based on macroeconomic indicators (GDP and population projections) and the projected number of vehicles, including restrictions and prohibitions laid down by Regulation No 517/2014100 and Directive 2006/40/EC101. GHG emission projections were calculated the using 102 the methods provided by the IPCC in 2006. The main sources of GHG emissions in the industrial processes and products sector are the chemical industry, the production of mineral products and the use of fluorinated GHGs (Figure 4.2.1.9).

Cement production accounts for a large proportion of GHG emissions in the mineral products category. According to the data provided by a company, cement production will increase up to 2020 and from 2020 production will remain stable until 2040. Emissions from the use of fluorinated gases are expected to gradually decrease as a result of the implementation of the requirements of Regulation 517/2014. GHG emissions are projected to decrease from 719 kt CO2 eq in 2017 to 209 kt CO2 eq in 2030 and 100 kt CO2 eq in 2040. The most significant reductions will be achieved by replacing HFC-134a in car conditioning systems with alternative gases with a VAP<150 and by replacing R-404A in commercial refrigeration equipment with gases having a VAP<2500 by 2022 and with gases with a VAP<150 after 2022.  Compared to 2005, the industrial processes and products sector is projected to show a modest GHG emission reduction of 13% and 16% in 2030 and 2040, respectively. The main source of GHGs in the industrial processes and products sector is the chemical industry (an ETS sector), which is expected to remain the largest source of GHGs in the industry in the future.  Agriculture Projections of GHG emissions from the agricultural sector under existing policies and measures (EPM) are based on the number of domestic animals, dairy cattle productivity indicators, the distribution of manure management systems for the main categories of livestock, the amount of mineral and organic N fertilisers used, the yield of main crops and the yield area used to lime soils. Activity data for GHG projections have kt CO2 eq 4. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 196   been provided by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Lithuania. GHG emissions have been calculated on the basis of the methodology provided in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines103. The evolution of livestock numbers over the forecast period has been assessed in the light of historical fluctuations in livestock numbers, prevailing market prices, demand and exports. Quantities of mineral and organic (compost and sewage sludge) N fertilisers and materials for soil calcination have been estimated taking into account the changes in crop area. Forecasts of crop yields have been estimated on the basis of crop yields and estimated crop areas. Forecasts of crop area have been calculated on the basis of historical data, the world market situation and the development of agro-biotechnology. Due to the unfavourable trading conditions and the structure of agricultural production, the crop areas of barley, triticale, rye, summer rape and potatoes are expected to shrink.  Compared to 2005, GHG emissions in the agricultural sector are projected to increase by 2% by 2030. GHG emissions will increase by 4% by 2040 (compared to 2005). Agricultural soils are the main contributor to GHG growth in the agricultural sector. This category is expected to remain the largest source of GHGs in agriculture in the future.

CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 197   report. The main data used for the forecasts are land use category areas, tree volume increment and volume change, tree stem volume cut in Lithuanian forests and dead tree stem volume.  Land use category areas and changes between categories are forecast based on the data provided in the Lithuanian National GHG Inventory Report 104 for 2019. On the basis of data on newly planted and self-expanding forest areas in 20132017, forest land area is projected to increase by an average of 3,200 ha annually. Accordingly, the area of productive land, grassland and pastures is projected to decrease as a result of the conversion of this land to forest land. The ratio of productive land to grassland and pastures is projected to remain the same as in 2013-2017. Greenhouse gas emissions from waters and bogs, built-up areas and other land areas are projected on the basis of GHG emissions recorded in 20132017.  The total volume of Lithuanian trees, the volume increase, the volume of felled and naturally dying trees are forecast taking into account the change in the forest volume increment inventoried by the NFI in 20022017 and its use. These data were used as a reference point for the estimation of total growth and its structure (main use, intermediate use, dead tree volume and volume change) in 20182040. Gross stand growth for the years 2007 to 2017 is estimated on the basis of NFI data and is projected as the product of the area forecast for the tree species concerned and the average annual volume increment over the period 20182040. The annual stand volume growth is slightly decreasing due to their ageing. The projected overall growth remains fairly stable, averaging between 20.51 and 20.04 million m3 per year. The decreasing tree volume growth primarily owes to changes in the structure of the tree age classes: recently, the middle-aged stands occupying the largest areas and generating the largest volume and carbon accumulation have been ageing, which leads to increasing areas of older and more mature stands with lower volume growth and GHG uptake. Based to the current level of use and regeneration of pine forests, the largest reduction in the volume growth of these stands is anticipated. Reductions in growth are also projected due to the large area of mature stands and the small area of juvenile stands, as both the ageing stands and juvenile stands have a lower growth rate than the most productive middle-aged stands. The projected increase in the volume of felling relates both to the increase in the volume of main fellings in mature stands due to the projected increase in the area of mature trees and to the increase in the volume of intermediate felling, in particular thinning, in order to increase forest sustainability and reduce tree deaths and forest losses. The main forest use in forests has been estimated as the product of the equivalent area of mature stands to be felled and the average volume of mature stands. An equivalent area of mature stands to be felled each year was calculated on the basis of the age class distribution of each tree species and the use of mature stands over a period of 12 to 15 years. It is estimated that the increase in the volume of main fellings in 20182027 will be affected by the restoration of economic activity in roughly 200 000 hectares of forest allocated for property restoration, either by designating these forests as public forests or by restoring private property. In order to reduce the volume of dying trees and consequently the forest cultivation losses, a gradual increase in the use of intermediate forests is forecast. Intermediate forest use is projected to account for 40-50% of basic forest use, drawing on many years of experience. In view of the increase in primary and intermediate forest use, general forest use is bound to increase in all forests of the country from 10.11 million m3 in 2017 to 11.75 million m3 in 2040 (Table 4.2.1.4). Thus, due to the projected increase in the volume of stand intermediate fellings, smaller natural losses of trees are anticipated. According to the NFI data, the average annual share of dead trees in the total volume increase decreased from 21% to 18% over the period 2007-2017. Taking into account the anticipated higher intensity of thinning, a corresponding decrease in the volume of dead trees is forecast. Based on trends observed between 2002 and 2017 and the changes in the age structure of forests, changes in stand volume and GHG absorption are expected to                                                            104 http://am.lrv.lt/uploads/am/documents/files/KLIMATO%20KAITA/Studijos%2C%20metodin%C4%97%20med%C5%BEiaga/NIR_20 19_04_15_FINAL.pdf 4. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 198   decrease over 2018-2040 (Table 4.2.1.4). Growth accumulation over the forecast period is defined as the difference between the total volume increase and the volume of trees cut and dead. The volume of felled trees and naturally dying trees from the main and intermediate fellings account for between 72% and 75% of the total annual increment in stand volume. Thus, the part of the increment accumulated in the stand accounts for about a quarter of the total increment.  Table 4.2.1.4.

The absorption of CO2 in new forests has been calculated on the basis of the volumetric change patterns determined on the basis of the volumetric changes in newly planted or naturally occurring wooded areas measured during the National Forest Inventory.  GHG removals by harvested wood products are projected in proportion to the volume harvested by increasing the production of different wood products. The distribution of wood products between different product groups (sawn wood, wood panels and paper products) is forecast to be the same as in the base year (2017).   Table 4.2.1.5.

GHG absorption will decrease by 26% by 2040 (compared to 2005). A forest land category, namely  the reduction of carbon removals in stand biomass, is the main contributor to GHG removals in the LULUCF sector. 4.

Actual and projected GHG emissions and absorption in the LULUCF sector by category  In accordance with the commitment under Regulation (EU) No 2018/841, the annual difference in GHG emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector (by applying the special accounting rules provided for in this Regulation) has to be negative, i.e. the sector has to generate more removals than emissions or at least the cumulative quantity of GHG removals and emissions has to be equal to zero. The cumulative quantity of GHG emissions and removals is accounted for by deducting the fixed reference levels from GHG removals or emissions calculated in the categories of annually managed forest land, managed cropland and managed grassland in the period from 2021 to 2030 and adding the quantity of GHG removals or emissions from afforested and deforested land. The reference level for managed forest land means projected GHG removals or emissions from forests, based on forest use tendencies between 2000 and 2009 and the structure of stand age classes for that period. The established indicative reference level of managed forest land (GHG removals of 2,722 kt CO2 eq / year) will be updated following the review by the European Commission according to the comments received. Reference levels for managed cropland and managed grassland and pastures are the average of GHG emissions/removals between 2005 and 2009. The indicative calculated reference level for managed cropland reaches 3,768 kt of GHG emissions of CO2 eq/year, and the reference level for managed grassland and pastures is 970 kt of GHG removals of CO2 eq/year.  Taking account of the accounting rules under Regulation (EU) No 2018/841, to calculate GHG removals and -6,227 kt CO2 eq of GHG removals each year in the period from 2021 to 2025, part of which can be used to meet the GHG emission reduction commitments by the non-ETS sectors. From 2026 to 2030 (during the second commitment period under Regulation (EU) No 2018/841), Lithugenerate a total of -5,252kt CO2e eq of GHG removals each year, part of which can be used to meet the GHG emission reduction commitments by the sectors outside the EU emission trading scheme. Waste kt CO2 eq 4. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 200   Projections of GHG emissions from the waste sector under existing policies and measures105 (EPMs) are based on macroeconomic indicators (GDP and population projections) and the development of municipal waste management infrastructure. GHG emissions have been calculated on the basis of the methods provided in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines106. G generation of municipal waste has been estimated by regression analysis on the basis of national statistics (quantity of municipal waste per capita), population and GDP. Municipal waste generation is projected to increase to 1,336 kt in 2030 and 1,396 kt in 2040. It is planned that by 2035 only up to 10% of the total waste generated will be disposed of in landfills, and the same percentage will remain until 2040. Methane formation has been assessed by the FOD (First Order Decay) method107 presented in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. The production and collection of biogas from landfills is expected to gradually decrease due to the decreasing waste disposal landfills. Biogas collected from landfills is used to produce heat and electricity and is included in energy forecasts.  The projections for methane and nitrous oxide from composting biodegradable waste have been developed in the light of the existing capacity of mechanical and biological waste treatment plants and the projected home composting. Home composting was assessed on the basis of the number of compost bins distributed and the amount of composted waste (220 kg) per household. GHG emissions from waste water treatment and discharges have been projected on the basis of anticipated biooxygen consumption, population projections and the share of residents connected to the centralised water and waste water collection systems. The share of connected residents is projected to be 83% in 2030 and 90% in 2040, taking into account the EU-funded infrastructure development projects, reluctance to connect to centralised networks and other conditions.  Waste incineration without energy recovery accounts for only 0.1% of total GHG emissions in the waste sector. Similar amounts of waste incineration are expected to continue in the future. In addition, in order to improve the efficiency of heat and energy consumption, to make more efficient use of local and renewable resources in heat generation plants and to reduce CO2 emissions, cogeneration plants will be built in Vilnius and Kaunas over the period 20192020, which will consume 360 tonnes of biomass and municipal waste per year for energy production, which will account for 30% of all municipal waste.  Analysis of sector projections has shown that GHG emissions are gradually decreasing as a result of the planned expansion of waste sorting, preparation of waste for recycling, waste incineration, modernisation of the capacities (sorting lines, other equipment) for re-use or other recovery and upgrading of the waste management information system and monitoring. Compared to 2005, GHG emissions are projected to fall significantly by 2030 and 2040, 62% and 74% respectively. The highest GHG emission reductions are expected in waste landfilling (69% by 2030 and 82% by 2040 compared to 2005) and waste water treatment and discharge (60% in 2030 and 70% in 2040 compared to 2005).                                                                  105 The measures adopted and implemented are set out in Chapter 3. 1062006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The107 FOD method assumes that decomposition of organic carbon in waste slowly degrades over several decades to produce CH4. If the conditions are constant, the rate of CH4 formation depends only on the amount of carbon remaining in the waste. CH4 emissions peak in the first few years after removal and gradually decline afterwards. 4.

Electricity generation from renewable energy sources and the technologies used are specified in the table. Due to uncompetitive fuel pricing, conventional electricity generation is not currently operational in Lithuania. The country imports most of its electricity (about 70%). The remaining domestic generation consists essentially of RES, dominated by hydro and onshore wind power plants. Recent years have seen significant development of solar power plants. This process owes to the development of the prosumer concept and subsidies directed to this area.  Table 4.2.2.3. Electricity generation from renewable energy sources in 2018 Technology Quantity, ktoe % Hydropower plants 37.1 20.1 Wind farms 98.4 53.3 Solar power plants 5.9 3.2 Biofuel power plants (cogeneration) 25.1 13.6 Biogas power plants (cogeneration) 10.9 5.9 Cogeneration (waste) 7.2 3.9  Construction of two large cogeneration power plants in Vilnius and Kaunas is to be completed in the near future. The power plants will burn household waste (Vilnius and Kaunas) and biofuels (cogeneration unit in the Vilnius power plant). The total installed capacity will be 73 MWe and 163 MWth. Based on the household waste stream will be considered as RES.  The evolution of RES-E capacity over the period 20102018 is shown in Figure 4.2.2.1.  Key for figure 4.2.2.1: Offshore wind farms Hydropower plants >10 MW  Solar (photovoltaic) plants Biofuel power plants Biogas power plants  Hydropower plants < 1 MW  Industrial and municipal waste power plants 4. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 203   Hydropower plants 1-10 MW    Fig. 4.2.2.1. Development of RES electricity generation and technologies used  Between 2010 and 2018, the installed capacity for electricity generation from RES increased almost threefold, from 278 MW  to 818 MW . The installed capacity of solar photovoltaic power plants has shown the fastest growth, increasing by 11.7 times since their launch in 2012. The installed capacity of wind power plants increased fourfold between 2010 and 2018, that of biofuel power plants increased by 3.2 times and that of biogas power plants almost doubled. The installed capacity of hydropower and cogeneration power plants burning industrial and municipal waste has remained largely unchanged. 65.2% of the installed capacity of all power plants is accounted for by onshore wind power plants, 11% by hydropower plants of >10 MW , and 10% by solar photovoltaic plants.  The above historical data show that the expansion of electricity generation from RES mainly took place through the installation of onshore wind farms. The power curve of onshore wind farms shows that in some periods (20122014 and partly 20162018) the expansion of the RES did not take place or was rather slow. This is directly linked to the pauses in the application of support mechanisms. The surge in solar power is attributable to the features of the support mechanism, where the power plant builder, having obtained the construction permit, was only allowed to connect the power plant to the grid 2 years after the permit was issued. At a high support rate, the possibility of postponing the installation for two years and the significant reduction in investment costs during this period led to a boom in the deployment of solar power plants. This expansion was seen as unsustainable and further promotion of solar power plants was suspended by political decisions.  Projections of change with existing policies and measures The energy modelling of existing policy measures in 2030 (with an outlook for 2040) requires discussion of the main measures and their implementation assumptions leading to the development of RES in the sectors concerned.   AEI1: Support scheme for electricity produced from RES. Around 700 MW  of units using RES will be installed over the period of the measure until 2025, which will generate around 2.4 TWh of energy (successive auctions for 0.3, 0.7, 0.7, and 0.7 TWh are planned). This support scheme (technologically neutral auctions) will be used up to a level of RES development economically and technically acceptable for the country or until the production of energy from renewable energy sources reaches the market price. In view of the planned lowest bid auction (lowest premium to the market price), it is likely that the winners of the auction will install onshore wind capacity. In the light of the above, the assessment makes assumptions regarding the investment needs and production volumes.   AEI2: Financial support to prosumers. The measure was approved in 2018 and is to continue until 2030. The supported activity is the installation of small-scale solar power plants. Around 25 000 consumers are expected to benefit from this support by 2023, setting up units with an installed power of approximately 0.168 GW and generating around 0.075 TWh of energy.   AEI3: Promoting high-efficiency cogeneration. Under this measure, two high-efficiency cogeneration plants will be built by 2021 in Vilnius (Vilnius cogeneration 4. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 204   power plants are essential for achieving the objectives of RES. The electrical capacity of the VCP will be about 92 MW  and it will produce about 0.4 TWh of electricity and its thermal capacity will be about 229 MW , covering about 40% of the total heat requirement for Vilnius. The KCP will have an electrical capacity of around 26MW and heat generation capacity of around 70 MW , generating around 0.5 TWh of heat and around 0.17 TWh of electricity.   AEI4: Support for the construction of biofuel boiler houses. Under the approved measure, biofuel boilers with a capacity of 70 MW, generating approximately 0.42 TWh of heat, will be built in 2023.   AEI10+A53: Mandatory blending of biofuels into mineral fuels. The measure has been applied from 2011 to ensure that additives of biological origin are added to mineral fuels: at least 7% of biodiesel and at least 5% (10% as from 1 January 2020) of bioethanol per litre or fuel, calculated based on volume. Blending of bio-additives into A98 petrol during the winter period is optional.   AEI11: Excise duty relief for biofuels. The measure has been in operation since 2010.   T4: Guarantees of origin for gases produced from RES. The measure has been operation since 2019.  Existing policy measures with the greatest impact on the use of RES include a support scheme for the production of electricity from RES (technologically neutral auctions), generating customers, upgrading of biofuel boilers and replacement of fossil fuel boilers. The obtained modelling results are set out in the table below.  Table 4.2.2.4.

RES share in gross final consumption of energy and relevant sectors (EPM)  Electricity Under the EPM scenario, the increase in RES-E capacity between 2021 and 2030 is shown in the table below. It is worth mentioning that the planned development of electricity generation relies exclusively on RES technologies, in particular, solar photovoltaic power plants and the development of onshore and offshore wind farms. The planned development of solar power plants is linked to the development of prosumers and remote prosumers. Meanwhile, the increase in wind power is expected to result (as the most competitive RES technology at the moment) from the competitive process of auctioning for the development of RES in electricity generation.

CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 207     District heating In the district heating system, a number of changes are foreseen under the EPM during the period under consideration. As mentioned above, the Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration plants will become fully operational in 2021. The total heat production capacity will be 163 MWth (domestic waste, biofuels). Additional heat production installations with a capacity of 70 MW  (biofuels) are planned to be launched in 2023. An additional 15 MWth biofuel combustion capacity is planned for 2024 (as part of the 5 MWe cogeneration installation).  The results of modelling the DH sector are presented in Figure 4.2.2.3.

DH fuel balance forecast under EPM  The graph shows that fuel use for district heating will decrease. This relates in particular to energy efficiency improvement measures (building renovation, consumer awareness raising, digitalisation of metering, etc.) and energy production efficiency improvement.  In 2018, total fuel consumption in the DH sector amounted to 1080 ktoe. In 2030 and 2040, fuel demand will decrease to 981 ktoe and 982 ktoe respectively, i.e. by 9.5%. 1080 1073 1012 981 984 982 Electricity, ktoe Coal, ktoe,   LPG, ktoe Liquefied and other gas oils, ktoe Sewage sludge biogas, ktoe Landfill gas, ktoe Other biogas, ktoe Household waste (non-RES), ktoe Industrial waste (non-RES), ktoe Heating and other gas oils, ktoe Peat, peat briquettes ktoe Natural gas, ktoe Industrial waste (RES share), ktoe Household waste (RES share), ktoe Firewood, wood waste and agricultural waste for fuel Total fuel consumption, ktoe 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 2035 2036 2037 2038 2039 2040 4.

Results of transport sector modelling under EPM  The results of the EPM scenario show a gradual decline in diesel consumption, with increased use of gaseous fuels instead. The modelling results suggest that the existing policies could contain the growth rates of fuel consumption in the sector, but this is not conducive to a more marked reduction in fuel consumption or a tangible fuel switch.  Figure 4.2.2.5 shows the total final energy consumption in the transport sector (TOTAL consumption in transport; scale on the left, ktoe) and energy consumption from renewable fuels, biodiesel and bioethanol (Y scale on the right side of the chart, etc.). The chart shows electricity in full (the specific share of RES in electricity depends on the RES-E rate achieved in a given year). 2215.4 2220 2285 2250 2202 2183 232.5 233.1 257.8 272.0 277.0 295.0 1562.3 1569.2 1586.7 1531.6 1466.2 1408.9 Heating and other gas oil, ktoe Petrol, ktoe  Kerosene type jet fuel, ktoe Bioethanol, ktoe Natural gas, ktoe Electricity, ktoe Diesel for road transport, ktoe Aviation gasoline, ktoe Liquefied petroleum gas, ktoe Bioethanol, ktoe Biogas, ktoe Total fuel consumption in transport, ktoe 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 2035 2036 2037 2038 2039 2040 4.

RES transport sector under the EPM scenario  As can be seen from the above results, the EPM scenario stabilises fuel consumption growth in the transport sector (as observed over the period 20142019). The scenario foresees relatively constant use of biodiesel and bioethanol, while the trend of electrification in the transport sector is weak (no tangible challenges for the power generation sector). 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 2035 2036 2037 2038 2039 2040
