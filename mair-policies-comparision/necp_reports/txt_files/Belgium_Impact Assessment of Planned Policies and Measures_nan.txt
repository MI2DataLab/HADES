IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF PLANNED POLICIES AND MEASURES  Impacts of planned policies and measures described in section 3 on energy system and GHG emissions, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures (as described in section 4) i. Projections of the development of the energy system and GHG and air pollutant emissions under the planned policies and measures  The WAM (49) scenario in Wallonia takes into account the impact of the measures described in Chapter 3 of this document.

The baseline scenario predicts a reduction of 24.5% compared with 2005. Compared with 2005, emissions fall by 79% in the non-ETS industrial sector (2,700 kt CO2, bearing in mind that most of this reduction occurred between 2005 and 2015), by 48% in the residential sector (3,406 kt CO2), by 52% in the tertiary sector (846 kt CO2) and by 24.6% in the transport sector (2,289 kt CO2). The agriculture sector reduces its emissions by 1,000 kt CO2, i.e. 19% compared with 2005.                                                             49 With Additional Measures. 104 Figure 22 - Sectoral trends in non-ETS GHG emissions (WAM)  Evolution des émissions de GES pour les secteurs non-ETS - Scénario avec mesures additionnelles Trends in GHG emissions in non-ETS sectors - Scenario with additional measures Energie (non-ETS) Energy (non-ETS) Industrie (non-ETS) Industry (non-ETS) Transport Transport Residentiel Residential Tertiaire Tertiary Agriculture Agriculture Déchets Waste Autres Other ktCO2e kt CO2eq  B. Renewables  By implementing new measures aimed at developing renewables, Wallonia plans to produce around 27.5 TWh of renewable energy, i.e. 23.5% of estimated gross final consumption in 2030.

The installed capacity in each subsector will need to be increased in order to achieve the targets set. In particular, 1,136 MW will need to be installed between 2020 and 2030 in terms of wind energy and 2,228 MW for photovoltaics.

The reduction in final consumption compared with 2005 is estimated at 22%.

Figure 33 - Trends in final consumption - Wallonia  Consommation finale énergétique totale Total final energy consumption   The reduction in final consumption between 2020 and 2030 is estimated at 2%, taking into account demographic changes and economic growth. The share of oil products reduces by 46% between 2005 and 2030, while the share of renewables increases by a factor of 10.

Compared with 2005, the reduction in consumption is 30%, chiefly due to measures already taken in this sector. Compared with a scenario without additional measures (WEM), the reduction is 13%.  Figure 35 - Final consumption in the residential sector  Résidentiel: conso finale totale  Residential sector: total final consumption   An 85% increase in the share of renewables is observed in this sector between 2015 and 2030, while the share of all other energy carriers falls (-35% for oil products and -23% for gas in particular).

The measures implemented in this sector, particularly through the renovation strategy, will have a greater impact in the 2030-2040 period. Between 2020 and 2040, the reduction in consumption in this sector is estimated at 11.6%. Compared with the baseline scenario, the estimated reduction is 12%.  Figure 37 - Final consumption in the tertiary sector  Tertiaire: consommation finale totale  Tertiary sector: total final consumption   In 2030, the share of renewables in the tertiary sector is 18 times higher than in 2015. The share of cogenerated steam increases by 140%. Other energy carriers are reduced (-56% for oil products and -43% for gas).

Compared with the baseline scenario, it reduces by 19%. Overall, final consumption in the road sector falls by 1% between 2020 and 2030. Final energy consumption in the other sectors increases by 5% for aviation, 10% for rail and 105% for inland navigation. Between 2005 and 2030, the overall reduction of 2% (or 687 GWh) breaks down into a 12% reduction in consumption in the road sector and a 17% reduction in the rail sector, with a 152% increase in the aviation sector and a 56% increase in the inland navigation sector.  Figure 39 - Final consumption in the transport sector  Transport: consommation finale totale Transport: total final consumption   Between 2015 and 2030, the final consumption of oil products falls by 32%, whilst the share of gas and electricity and the share of biofuels both increase.

There was a marked drop in consumption between 2005 and 2015, due in particular (but not exclusively) to the closure of several energy-intensive industrial operations in Wallonia; the upturn in this sector therefore has the effect of increasing final energy consumption (estimated at +1% between 2015 and 2020). Taking economic growth into account, final consumption in the industrial sector increases by 2% between 2020 and 2030 across all sectors (ETS and non-ETS). With additional measures, consumption is estimated to fall by 3% compared with the baseline scenario.  Figure 41 - Final consumption in the industrial sector  Industrie: consommation finale totale (hors non énergétique)  Industrial sector: total final consumption (excluding non-energy consumption)  Between 2015 and 2030, the final consumption of renewables, cogenerated steam and electricity increases by 57%, 27% and 6% respectively. The share of gas drops by 12%, and the share of solid fuels by 17%. Consumption of oil products, however, increases by 30%.

Primary consumption Primary consumption depends on estimated electricity generating capacity. The figures here assume that the nuclear phase-limited.  Figure 43 -   Consommation énergétique primaire Primary energy consumption  Primary energy consumption reduces by 36% compared with 2005 and by 15% compared with 2015. Primary consumption of oil products falls sharply. This reduction is offset by an increase in primary consumption of gas and renewables. Imports of electricity in the WAM scenario are assumed to remain relatively limited (1,600 GWh).  Macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmental, employment and education, skills and social impacts, including just transition aspects of the planned policies and measures  When preparing this plan, Wallonia did not have access to any appropriate tools for assessing in detail the socioeconomic impacts of its various measures. The following analysis is therefore mainly based on a review of Belgian and European literature. Those studies do not therefore precisely model the assumptions made in the Walloon plan, but are generally aimed at achieving the European objectives.  A. Impacts on economic growth A Belgium-wide study (53) suggests that emission reduction measures do not substantially affect economic growth and may even lead to a slight increase in GDP if appropriate policies are adopted.                                                            53 in collaboration with Professor Th. Bréchet, the Federal Planning Bureau and Oxford Economics, at the request of the Climate Change Service of the Federal Public Service for Public Health, Food Safety and Environment. It aimed to study the macroeconomic impacts of a low-carbon transition to 2050, with particular emphasis on growth,  116 According to the Federal Planning Bureau, the macroeconomic impacts particularly depend on how any public revenue from the auctioning of ETS allowances is used and whether a carbon tax is introduced for non-ETS sectors (54). When combined with recycling of carbon revenues, the measures may lead to a slight increase in GDP. For example, such revenues can be reinvested in developing technology associated with the energy transition or in infrastructure, particularly to encourage use of public transport. At sectoral level, the impact of climate measures on value added is estimated to be relatively limited and slightly different depending on the sector (Federal Planning Bureau Note). The energy production sector is the worst affected. For all other sectors, where carbon revenues are recycled, the estimated impacts are negligible or positive, with the construction sector seeing the most benefits. Climate change measures should also enable a series of costs to be avoided, such as those connected with air pollution and its effects on health, traffic congestion and road traffic accidents (55). Lastly, productivity (for example in offices and schools) may be positively affected by building-related measures such as improving insulation, ventilation and interior lighting (56).  B. Impacts on the energy system The energy system cost is an indicator used to calculate the costs of investing in installations and equipment producing or consuming energy and also the costs of purchasing energy. Climate measures can be expected to slightly increase this cost compared with a business-as-usual scenario, due to the estimated increase in investment costs that will not be offset by the estimated reduction in energy purchase costs.  C. Impacts on business competitiveness The impact of climate measures on business competitiveness is difficult to estimate because it depends on the international context (particularly energy and technology prices in other countries, etc.) and on the specific characteristics of the regional economic fabric. When drawing up its climate policies, Wallonia pays close attention to the potential impact on competitiveness, particularly as a result of possible increases in the energy cost. An environmental Life Cycle Assessment of products, combined with a social LCA, would allow a label prompting European products to be developed, while avoiding social dumping. The electricity price in Belgium is expected to increase slightly compared with a business-as-usual scenario (CLIMACT). The estimated price increase is higher for solid and liquid fuels than for natural gas and electricity. However, the energy price increase is estimated to have a moderate effect on production prices due to the improved energy efficiency promoted by the plan.  D. Impacts on employment, education and skills A Eurofound study (57) indicates that Belgium is the European country where climate measures have the greatest between the sectors.                                                            54  https://www.plan.be/admin/uploaded/201504270958240.WP_1503_10941.pdf  55   56 https://www.renovermonecole.be/fr/objectifs-bien-etre  57 particular emphasis on the construction sector. 117 However, a CLIMACT study suggests that the overall impact in the energy sector is negative, due to a general reduction in energy demand. This takes account of repercussions on the fossil fuel production and refining industries, and on the electricity generation and distribution sector. Investments in renewable energy production and energy infrastructure are often made in labour-intensive sectors. Overall, climate measures should therefore have a positive net effect on employment. An increase in the number of jobs is expected in the manufacturing sector directly connected with or forming part of the renewable energy or energy efficiency supply chain, particularly in the tertiary sector associated with these supply chains. The largest number of new direct jobs is expected in the construction sector, with the impact on workers in this ed demand for the maintenance of private vehicles should be offset by positive effects connected with the roll-out of public  (CLIMACT). An inventory of those sectors in which technology will need to evolve must be produced. Several issues will also need to be closely examined to ensure a just transition. There may be several reasons for misalignment (58) (+Eurofound). - Timing reasons: jobs may not be lost and created at the same time. A faster transition will in all likelihood lead to more friction, with workers being left jobless and certain requirements for new skills not being met. - Spatial reasons: jobs may be lost and created in different areas that are far apart. - Sectoral reasons: jobs may be lost and created in different sectors. - Educational reasons: jobs that are lost and created may be associated with different skills. Support in terms of adapting existing jobs, providing training in new skills, and anticipating training needs in high-growth sectors such as the ecological transition sector and in sectors with high social value (energy, mobility, communication, circular economy, etc.) will therefore be needed.  E. Impacts on households Although energy prices are expected to rise, a range of measures in the plan should reduce household gas and electricity bills, in particular building insulation, changes in energy carrier, self-consumption and behavioural change. Close attention will be paid to protecting the most vulnerable in energy poverty terms, by extending or increasing aid, carrying out awareness raising, monitoring consumption and offering support. This attention must be extendable to the lower middle classes. All energy policies will be closely examined in terms of their impact on the public. Energy is an essential resource and a fundamental right, to which access must be guaranteed for all. As with electricity and gas, fossil fuel prices are also expected to rise (CLIMACT). The impact on households is difficult to estimate as it will depend not only on how much prices rise, but also on how individuals change their behaviour in response to the roll-out and attractiveness of alternatives to private cars, on how the alternative-fuel vehicle market develops and on how the price of such fuels changes. Measures to raise awareness of soft mobility and encourage remote working are already being implemented in Wallonia. The measures in the FAST Vision aim to encourage a modal shift, including in rural environments and suburban areas. They also cover increasing the supply of shared transport and the attractiveness of co-modality, as well as providing information and support to the public on sustainable mobility.  F. Impacts on inequalities Individuals within society can be impacted differently by the same measure. To ensure a just and fair transition, the Walloon Government will implement the necessary measures after analysing their implications for the                                                            58  118 energy and climate transition. Those measures will also be based on recommendations made by the Walloon Public Service and on consultations with the public and stakeholders. They will cover all the skills and sectors affected by climate policy. In particular, there are numerous factors that can have an impact on workers or that can increase inequalities within society, such as: - developments in the labour market, which can be confronted by a series of misalignments (noted in Section D. Impacts on employment, education and skills) affecting unemployment and hindering retraining; - poverty, which must not be exacerbated by climate measures that must also not be more beneficial for those on high incomes (e.g. granting of incentives for the purchase of an electric vehicle); - geographical inequalities between urban and rural environments, for example in terms of access to mobility services, resources and energy infrastructures; - the gender issue, particularly in connection with:  employment, as climate change measures could reduce the number of women in employment;  the risk of poverty, which is slightly higher for women than for men and which is significantly higher for single-parent families, which mostly have a woman at their head;  representation in energy and climate processes, with women currently being under-represented even though they are generally more concerned about the climate;  communication actions, as men and women generally have different perceptions of sustainability, which can affect the chances of such actions being effective (59);  North/South relations, for example in connection with the origin of biofuels: due to their frequently weaker position in various countries in the South, women are more vulnerable to the seizure of their land, which, when combined with the arrival of large multinationals, is often accompanied by threats and violence against the local population, with sexual violence and abuse of women and girls also increasing in such cases; - social and environmental inequalities abroad as a result of actions taken on the ground (social dumping, exposure to pollution, etc.). That is why the Walloon Government is committed to combating any form of discrimination. It will particularly include the gender dimension in mobility and town and country planning policies from the first analysis of projects to their final evaluation.  G. Impacts on health and well-being Impacts on health The climate measures should have both positive and negative effects on public health. Climate change increases the risk of events such as flooding, heatwaves, droughts and fires. It is the people who are socially, economically or otherwise marginalised who are the most vulnerable to the consequences of such events. These may be, for example, pensioners who are left on their own or workers who spend most of their time outside during a heatwave (Eurofound). People on low incomes will also be particularly affected if crop yields fall. Most of the climate measures are aimed at improving air quality (further detail is provided in the next section), which will impact on health. The Environmental Impact Report for the Walloon Air, Climate and Energy Plan 2030 (Rapport sur les incidences environnementales du  RIE) indicates that pollutants present in the air, such as O3, SO2, NO2, NH3 and fine particulate matter, all have negative effects on the respiratory system and can also cause cardiovascular problems. Fine particulate matter                                                            59 s produced a manual and a checklist for this purpose, in collaboration with the Réseau des Communicateurs fédéraux (Federal Communicators Network). 119 is particularly harmful to health as it increases the number of premature deaths and is regarded at European level as being the issue with the greatest impact on public health. Fine and ultrafine particles, which can get into the pulmonary alveoli, are among the most dangerous: there is no evidence of a minimum threshold below which their effects on health can be ignored (60). They mainly stem from the production of domestic heat (heating and water) in solid fuel installations (coal, wood). Although improved building insulation reduces energy consumption, its impact on health depends on the quality of ventilation. Temperature variations are conducive to the development of respiratory and circulatory diseases. Building insulation can therefore reduce the number of hospitalisations for such diseases. However, if there is insufficient air circulation, increased airtightness can lead to the development of mould, particularly in cold and incorrectly ventilated houses, or the accumulation of indoor pollutants (released by materials for instance), with negative impacts on health (61). The EPB legislation lays down requirements in this respect. Furthermore, the Walloon Renovation Strategy should be accompanied by awareness-raising measures so that the public adopt best practices. In the transport sector, the RIE notes that promoting soft mobility can have beneficial effects on physical condition (walking, cycling, scooters, etc.), thereby generally improving the health of anyone using this approach. In terms of road safety, the modal shift and expected reduction in mobility needs should reduce the number of cars on the roads, which should generally limit the number of road traffic accidents. However, the RIE notes that, where cycling is not common, there is an increased risk of accidents involving cyclists. Within Europe, Wallonia has a high cyclist mortality rate per km. Measures will therefore be needed to develop appropriate infrastructure for cyclists and to increase the awareness of motorists. Lastly, dredging of waterways will also reduce flooding risks by increasing flow capacity. Impacts on well-being and quality of life -being and quality of life. The FAST Vision should reduce the number of cars on the roads, thus limiting congestion. The Walloon Renovation Strategy should improve both thermal comfort (improved thermal stability through more efficient control) and acoustic comfort (reduction of noise disturbance through better performing structures). It should also aid access to healthy housing, thereby greatly improving the quality of life and comfort of the most vulnerable households, while allowing them to use the savings made on their costs for basic needs. Some measures may result in noise pollution, such as renovation work, the development of new road, rail or airport infrastructure and the installation of wind turbines. This aspect must therefore be taken into account in the relevant projects. The installation oquality of life and must therefore also be taken into account when choosing the geographical position of such projects. Under the Walloon Renovation Strategy, a district approach may be envisaged, which would have the advantage of limiting the duration of noise pollution.  H. Environmental impacts (62) This section describes the most significant environmental impacts of the measures in this plan, which have been largely taken from the Environmental Impact Report for the Walloon Air, Climate and Energy Plan 2030 (Rapport                                                            60 https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/193108/REVIHAAP-Final-technical-report-final-version.pdf, page 1. 61 Frey S.E. et al. Indoor air 25:210-219. 62 Sustainable Development Goal No  The Convention on Biological Diversity sets out various biodiversity objectives. A number of strategic goals have been established, including:  ic diversity; 120 sur les incidences environnementales du  (http://www.awac.be/images/Pierre/PACE/2030/RIE%20PACE2030.pdf).  Impacts on air quality The NECP implementing energy and climate policy has been drawn up in parallel and in synergy with the Air Plan, which reinforces air quality policy under Directive (EU) 2016/2284 setting national targets for the reduction of certain atmospheric pollutants by 2020 and 2030 (NEC Directive). These two plans are incorporated within the Walloon Air, Climate and Energy Plan. This synergy is justified by the fact that the energy and transport sectors are two of the main sources of GHG emissions and atmospheric pollutants. These policies for better managing energy production and use, transport and mobility will reduce emissions of the main pollutants covered by the NEC Directive by [80%-85%]. The 2030 targets of the latter can be achieved only by implementing the NECP. Taking an integrated approach to the energy, climate and air policies also allows any conflicting or counterproductive measures to be avoided or limited. The following table, taken from the Air, Climate and Energy Plan, sets out the projections of SO2, NOx, VOC, PM2.5 and NH3 pollutant emissions based on the measures in this plan. Given certain assumpcommitments, which are based on the binding 2030 targets compared with 2005 under the NEC Directive, can be met.  Table 18 - Summary of reduction targets and projections for 2030 in absolute terms and as a percentage reduction Pollutants Belgian reduction target 2030 Walloon reduction target 2030 Walloon absolute ceilings 2030 (in kt) 2030 projections for Wallonia  (in kt) Estimated reduction for 2030 compared with 2005 SO2 66% 65% 15.4 10.76 75.8% NOx 59% 60% 49.4 41.72 * 66% VOC 35% 31% 32.1 29.88 * 37% PM2.5 39% 43% 8.8 8.3 45.4% NH3 13% 14% 27.0 24.23 23% * Under the NEC Directive, livestock manure and land management activities are not taken into account when calculating the target and its achievement.  The Environmental Impact Report indicates that the pollutant emissions generated by transport mainly come from exhaust gases (NOx, fine particulate matter, SOx, CO, N2O) and tyre, brake and road surface abrasion (fine particulate matter and heavy metals). The measures aimed at reducing the use of polluting vehicles or emissions from vehicles in use will have a positive impact on air quality. This plan also aims to significantly increase the share of biomass in future primary consumption, in all sectors combined. Concerns have been raised about the marked increase in the use of biomass as a source of renewable energy because in Wallonia, as in many other countries, the burning of wood (mainly for domestic heating) is the main source (60%) of fine particulate emissions, which are particularly harmful to health, black carbon emissions, which is a short-lived climate forcing agent and therefore contributes to global warming, and carcinogenic PAH emissions (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons).                                                             121 Greater use of biomass with a view to increasing the share of renewables in energy production therefore has a particularly negative impact. Emissions from installations should be taken into account as a priority, particularly in the residential sector and with regard to PAHs. A general framework should be proposed in order to limit pollutant emissions. Several recommendations can be made: (i) encourage the use of biomass in industry and for collective installations, rather than for small installations; (ii) favour the use of pellets (or, alternatively, wood chip or log installations that perform better in terms of air quality) and biogas, and (iii) offer advice on using boilers in order to limit pollutant emissions. The use of biomass for energy should also be consistent with the work carried out by the -conflicts between uses, integration into the bioeconomy roadmap, and consistency between energy carriers. In terms of indoor air quality, the impact of building insulation will depend on the quality of ventilation. By contrast, reducing methane (CH4) emissions is particularly beneficial under both plans, as methane is a significant greenhouse gas and also a precursor to tropospheric ozone, which is an atmospheric pollutant that is harmful to health and ecosystems. The impact of reducing methane is therefore not only entirely positive, but also twofold.  Impacts on biodiversity According to the IPBES (63), we are facing a biodiversity crisis that is unprecedented in human history. Direct exploitation, climate change, pollution and the introduction of invasive exotic species are all factors that have been cited. However, changes in land use are undoubtedly the most impactful factor in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Any construction work (whether buildings, infrastructure or renewable energy production sites) or any development work (e.g. work on waterways) can cause habitats to be lost or altered, which must therefore be prevented. Work can also disturb fauna during nesting periods or while raising young, which can require schedules to be adapted. There is also the risk of such work spreading invasive exotic species, which are costly to manage (64). Public lighting is a source of light pollution that affects fauna, comfort and observation of the night sky. The public service obligation with regard to municipal lighting should be accompanied by recommendations on timing and adjustment of the lighting, or orientation of light flows (65). A project to improve lighting on the network of greenways (RAVeL) is also envisaged. As these paths are closely linked with green spaces, the project should be studied in terms of the effects of this light pollution on fauna. Particular attention should also be paid to three sectors at the heart of this National Energy and Climate Plan. - The negative impacts of onshore wind farms on bats and birds are well-known (66). Whether for environmental, landscape integration or acoustic discomfort reasons, wind farm development has been significantly hampered by multiple appeals to the Council of State. To ensure that projects are successful, the legal framework needs to be revised and a carefully considered social acceptance campaign must be conducted. At an early stage of projects, investors should also be provided with a map of strategic sites, taking account of various exclusion factors. In some cases, visual markers, audible deterrent systems or even the shutdown of turbines during                                                            63 Germany, pp. 5-13. 64 France and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg have developed resources for this purpose:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kE0y6GnBT8  https://environnement.public.lu/fr/publications/conserv_nature/plantes_exotiques_envahissantes/plantes_exotiques_envahissantes.html  65   66 es  122 migratory periods could be used to reduce the risk of fauna colliding with the turbines. However, these actions require certain specific species to be targeted and a good knowledge of their ethological and biological characteristics (67). - Photovoltaic panels have a poorly understood impact in terms of polarised light pollution, which affects aquatic insects that choose the panels as laying sites. This phenomenon can be virtually eliminated by adapting the panel design (68). - Building insulation measures eliminate the cavities that are used by specific fauna for nesting or sheltering. However, simple fauna-friendly changes can be made during construction or renovation (69). Green roofs and walls (their impact on biodiversity will depend on the choice of species) or even agriculture projects on roofs (GROOF project) can also be envisaged, and also offer other benefits, particularly in terms of well-being. Some construction materials also have less impact on the environment than others and could therefore be favoured.  Mineral management issue Lastly, the development of renewable energy will lead to increasing demand for minerals, the exploitation of which has significant environment impacts. It will therefore be necessary, firstly, to encourage recycling and, secondly, to use resources that can be extracted and purified in the least harmful way possible, ensuring just exploitation that respects human rights.  Overview of investment needs i. Existing investment flows and forward investment assumptions with regard to the planned policies and measures As Wallonia does not currently (70) have an integrated tool for assessing investment needs, certain sectors are targeted below on the basis of available data.  The long-term renovation strategy period 2017-2050 has been estimated at EUR 63  (71). In more detail, it is expected that EUR 18.8 billion will be needed up to 2030. Estimates are currently being prepared for the renovation of non-residential buildings (72).  The following tables indicate the estimated investment needs (73) to 2030 for the production of renewable electricity and heat.                                                             67 -81. 68 Robertson B.A. et al. 28: 552-560; Száz D. et al. rnal of Insect Conservation 20: 663-675. 69 http://www.biodiversiteetbati.fr/  70 Wallonia is in the process of developing a TIMES economic optimisation model. Once this model becomes operational, it will be possible to assess investment needs for the entire energy system (within the limits of the data entered in the model). 71 This figure is currently being updated for the next long-term renovation strategy, which is expected in March 2020. Initial estimates, which are yet to be refined, point to EUR 80 billion in the residential sector up to 2050. 72 Initial estimates point to EUR 38-45 billion for non-residential buildings up to 2050. 73 Not taking account of discounting. 123 Table 19 - Estimated investment needs for renewable electricity production to 2030.

Sector or market risk factors or barriers in the national or regional context The Strategic Committee of the National Pact for Strategic Investments (PNIS) has highlighted a series of investment barriers (76). - detailed and complete overview of national financial assets - European rules currently prevent Belgian public investment. Belgium needs to reduce its public debt, which is  - The European funding channel is no The Strategic Committee has also highlighted a number of barriers in terms of public-private partnerships (PPPs): - technical expertise among project leaders, which often results in projects that are unbalanced in terms of risk- - the complexity   iii.

The Region will ensure that both regional and national and also European and private funds are used efficiently.   Maximise the mobilisation of European funding sources The PNIS Strategic Committee notes that, -utilise European funds out of  There are many funding opportunities, involving specific procedures. To ensure efficient mobilisation of European funds, an administrative unit providing technical support and coordination , submit and monitor applications to European bodies and                                                              76 https://www.premier.be/sites/default/files/articles/Rep  125 Overview of European funding opportunities -2027 particularly emphasises the policies of combating climate change and promoting the energy transition. The Commission has mainstreamed , and proposes that a significant proportion of the allocated funds should be used for climate objectives. Several European-wide financial instruments and programmes are aimed at financing energy transition measures, among others:  - Structural and Investment Funds, including the following:  The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), which, in the period 2021-2027, is set to support the achievement of five policy objectives (PO), including a greener, low-carbon Europe by promoting clean and fair energy transition, green and blue investment, the circular economy, climate adaptation and risk prevention (PO 2).  The European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), which aims to improve employment and education and may therefore be used to manage the development of the labour and retraining market associated with the energy transition. According to the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) (77), this fund could be mobilised to a greener, low carbon Europe through the improvement of education and training systems necessary for the adaptation of skills and qualifications, the upskilling of all, including the labour force, the creation of new jobs in sectors related to the environment, climate and energy, and the bioeconomy.  The common agricultural policy, which may be used to fund measures in the following areas, for example: - bioenergy; - development of short agri-food supply chains in Wallonia; - waste prevention (e.g. combating food waste and losses), sorting, recycling and recovery; - agri-environment and climate.  - European sectoral funds, which cover the following programmes (78):  LIFE(+) Environment and LIFE Climate Action, which specifically concern developing and implementing innovative responses to environmental and climate challenges and which, since 2014-2015, have been linked with the Natural Capital Financing Facility (NCFF) and Private Finance for Energy Efficiency (PF4EE) financial instruments. The current integrated project LIFE BE REEL aims to implement regional renovation strategies in Flanders and Wallonia. Total budget: EUR 5.4 billion over seven years (2021-2027). Energy budget: EUR 1 billion.  Horizon 2020 / Horizon Europe, which is a research and innovation programme. Budget: EUR 97.6 billion over seven years (2021-2027).  15 billion.  ERA-NETs, which are add-on instruments to the Horizon 2020 programme for funding transnational research and innovation (79).  - The Connecting Europe Facility for Projects of Common Interest aimed at interconnecting the EU and its regions in terms of energy, transport and digital infrastructure. Budget of EUR 42.3 billion over seven years (2021-2027): 126 - energy budget: EUR 8.7 billion; - transport budget: EUR 30.6 billion; - digital budget: EUR 3 billion.  - InvestEU, which is a new investment instrument replacing the European Fund for Strategic Investments. It will provide an EU guarantee that should allow public and private funds to be mobilised for strategic investments in support of EU internal policies, in particular to promote the energy efficiency of buildings and their use of renewable energy. Budget: EUR 15.2 billion over seven years (2021-2027). Objective: to mobilise over EUR 650 billion of additional investment.  - The Innovation Fund, which is a funding programme replacing NER 300. Its aim is to help energy-intensive industries develop innovative technologies in the areas of renewable energy production, energy storage, and capture and use or capture and storage of carbon dioxide. Proposed budget: EUR 10 billion over seven years (2021-2027) depending on the carbon price (as the fund will be largely resourced through the ETS).  - The European Energy Efficiency Fund (eeef), which is a public-private partnership aimed at encouraging small-scale renewable energy or energy efficiency projects.  - The European Investment Fund, which aims to help SMEs, micro-enterprises and social enterprises secure venture capital.  - The European Investment Bank, which can also support energy projects (connected with renewable energy, energy efficiency, and competitiveness or security of energy supply). The PNIS Strategic Committee notes that,  1.6 billion in Belgium in the areas of the environment, infrastructure, innovation and SMEs. The EIB acts as a catalyst in this respect, with its funding adding to the resources provided by public authorities and private funders. It also has the necessary expertise   - carbon leakagethe ETS sector and which will be extended to 2030.   Mobilise regional and national funding sources The investment plans set out in the following table are examples taken in the main from the PNIS (which comes under federal jurisdiction) and the Walloon Investment Plan. They will therefore have to be reassessed in light of the Walloon Regional Policy Statement 2019-2024 and the budgetary framework that are in the process of being adopted.                                                             77http://www.fse.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/widget/document/annexe_3_proposition_de_reglement_du_parlement_europeen_et_du_conseil_relatif_au_fonds_social_europeen_plus_com-2018-382-f1-fr-main-part-1.pdf 78 Note: all the budgets mentioned are Commission proposals made in May 2018. They give a rough idea, but will have to be negotiated during the new parliamentary term. 79 The corresponding budget is not yet known. 127 Overview of Investment Plans  Renewable energy Nationally, around EUR 19 billion is set to be mobilised for the electricity mix through private investment. o continue guaranteeing security of supply at   Transport In terms of mobility, it is estimated that EUR 22-27 billion will be invested nationally, with around 25% coming from private investors. This sum will be used to maintain and develop integrated transport infrastructure, networks and services, develop intelligent mobility, manage transport demand and establish a support framework. Private investors are set to provide EUR 0.3 billion of funding for the roll-out of alternative fuels, specifically for the deployment of CNG and electricity charging points and to support research into hydrogen and green gas. In the Walloon Region, an estimated budget of EUR 1.38 billion will be available to achieve the objectives of the Mobility Plan 2019-Charleroi metro, increase the depth and width of inland waterways through dredging, and improve mobility around the airports.  Buildings Nationally, around EUR 17 billion will be available for energy efficiency through the renovation of public buildings. Half of this amount could come from private investment, through public-private partnerships (PPPs) and/or energy performance contracts (EPCs), which seem particularly well-suited to this type of project. In the Walloon Region, an estimated total of EUR 755 million will be available for all aspects of the housing sector (i.e. not limited to the fight against climate change) and could be particularly used for the energy efficiency of public and private housing. Still in Wallonia, an estimated sum of EUR 675 million will be available for the energy sector, part of which will be allocated to the energy efficiency of school buildings (with the rest being used to develop smart grids and meters and also for the energy transition of businesses).  Systems and storage Nationally, around EUR 17 billion could be provided through private investment for improving transmission and distribution systems and also for developing smart grids. In the Walloon Region, an estimated sum of EUR 675 million will be available for the energy sector, part of which could be allocated to develop smart grids and meters (with the rest being used for the energy efficiency of school buildings and also for the energy transition of businesses). Nationally, around EUR 5 billion should be available through private investment for developing energy storage.  Industry In the Walloon Region, an estimated sum of EUR 675 million will be available for the energy sector, part of which could be allocated to the energy transition of businesses (with the rest being used for the energy efficiency of school buildings and also to develop smart grids and meters).  Agriculture As regards agriculture, the Walloon Investment Plan has estimated that the local economy will provide EUR 15 million   Waste As regards the waste sector, an estimated EUR 1.2 million will be available in Wallonia to fund the current REGAL Plan (2015-2025), which is the Walloon Food Waste and Loss Programme. 128 The Walloon Waste and Resources Plan (Plan Wallon des déchets-ressources  PWD-R) adopted on 22 March 2018 details the funding needed for its implementation (80). This plan aims to steer Wallonia along the lines proposed by the European Commission with regard to developing the circular economy.   Mobilise private funds Some semi-public bodies, sectoral associations and non-profit associations or private individuals, and also financial institutions (banks, insurance companies, pension funds and other investment funds) have considerable financial reservesblic-private partnerships (PPPs) allow authorities to make investments without having to significantly increase public debt. Furthermore, PPPs are particularly advantageous due to interest and technical expertise of many private businesses, for example in the possibility of budget deconsolidation depending on the  This approach is key to the renovation strategy, which is why several measures have been prioritised in order to develop the legal and regulatory framework for ESCOs and EPCs in Wallonia (point 3.2.3). This type of measure could be extended to other sectors where PPPs have a role to play, particularly in the development of transport and digital infrastructure allowing the emergence of intelligent mobility solutions (81). Moreover, as mentioned in point . offers price signals consistent with the decarbonisation objectives and the polluter- Taxation will therefore be a useful tool for encouraging operators to change their behaviour and adapt their investment will take account of the financial capacity of households.                                                              80 http://environnement.wallonie.be/rapports/owd/pwd/PWDR_3.pdf  As an example, the estimates made indicate that implementing the actions envisaged in Book 3 of the draft PWD-R (management of household waste) should result in short-term costs estimated at ±EUR 5 million/year for the public authorities, ±EUR 18 million/year for businesses and ±EUR 3 million/year for local authority waste management associations, with a total average annual benefit estimated at around EUR 14 million/year. 81 See for example: ITS.be. 129 Brussels Capital Region  Impact of the new measures on GHG emissions The graph below presents the results with regard to GHG emissions to 2030.

The WAM scenario would lead to a transition compatible with the 2050 target (red point) of an 80% reduction in GHG emissions compared with 1990.  Renewable energy The table below shows the expected trend in the use of renewable energy in the Brussels Capital Region between 2021 and 2030. Given the distribution of powers, the efforts made in Brussels solely involve the production of electricity, heat and cold from renewable sources.  130 Unit: GWh 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 RES-E 234.66 239.32 244.36 249.77 255.58 270.51 271.17 281.33 292.06 303.48 Solar PV  99.76 105.38 111.31 117.58 124.20 139.90 150.30 161.17 172.59 184.68 Municipal waste 112.79 111.84 110.94 110.09 109.27 108.50 107.75 107.04 106.35 105.68 Biogas 13.12 13.12 13.12 13.12 13.12 13.12 13.12 13.12 13.12 13.12 Liquid fuels 8.99 8.99 8.99 8.99 8.99 8.99 - - - -            RES-H&C 136.11 138.00 139.92 144.19 148.56 153.00 152.19 157.03 162.08 167.44 Heat pumps 27.32 27.97 28.64 30.62 32.61 34.61 36.68 38.80 40.98 43.27 Solar thermal 16.72 17.84 19.04 21.29 23.63 26.04 28.60 31.28 34.11 37.12 Municipal waste 1.08 1.08 1.08 1.08 1.08 1.08 1.08 1.08 1.08 1.08 Biogas 28.32 28.32 28.32 28.32 28.32 28.32 28.32 28.32 28.32 28.32 Solid fuels 57.21 57.32 57.38 57.42 57.46 57.48 57.51 57.55 57.59 57.65 Liquid fuels 5.47 5.47 5.47 5.47 5.47 5.47 - - - -            Total 370.77 377.32 384.28 393.97 404.15 423.50 423.37 438.36 454.14 470.92  Dimension energy efficiency Lastly, the graph below shows that the proposed measures will reduce final energy consumption by 28.5% compared with 2005.

Multiple public and private funding sources will need to be mobilised.  Financing needs The NECP is a strategy document; it has not yet been decided how various measures will be implemented. As a result, it has not been possible to estimate the total financing needs. However, the needs associated with the renovation strategy have been estimated, as the methods of implementing at least some of the measures have been determined. 133 By multiplying the surface areas of the types of housing by the total discounted costs (TDC) by type of housing (taken from the Cost-Optimal renovation strategy is estimated at EUR 28.7 billion up to 2050, based on units to be renovated and the 2017 Cost-Optimal study.

The COBRACE therefore stipulates that the revenue of this fund, which mainly consists of the Brussels revenue under this scheme, will be used in particular for: o measures in relation to buildings, installations and products that are aimed at reducing GHG emissions; o measures in relation to transport and mobility that are aimed at reducing GHG emissions. - The energy policy fund is financed by the levy calculated on the basis of available power (electricity) and meter size (gas). The revenue from this levy is allocated to the energy policy fund (95% of the revenue, which is used for the rational energy use policy of Bruxelles Environnement and for the operation of Brugel) and to the energy guidance fund (5% of the revenue, which is used by the public social welfare centres). The terms of this fund are set out in Article 2.16 of the Order creating the budget funds and reiterated in Article 26 of the Order on the organisation of the electricity market in the Brussels Capital Region. In 2019, this fund received revenue of EUR 14,238,276.37. - The economic transition fund is a new fund launched by the Brussels Government with a budget of EUR 10 million. This fund has been established in partnership with Finance.Brussels and the Secretary of State for the Economic Transition. Its aim is to encourage a wholesale change in methods of production and consumption in order to achieve a low-carbon economy. The Brussels Government will also study the possibility of a single fund dedicated to the energy transition of buildings, which will combine the current contributions to the energy improvement of buildings (green certificates, energy and climate fund, renovation incentives, etc.) with other financial support. To ensure that a fair contribution to the fund is made by all the various energy carriers, a federal agreement will include heating oil suppliers among the contributors.  Financing tools Given the challenge facing us, existing tools (such as the Brussels green loan, energy incentives, etc.) will be fully utilised and extended, with additional tools also having to be created. This approach is particularly important for the renovation strategy (see point 2.2.1.1.2). 134 In addition to these tools, the Brussels Government has decided to significantly increase the funding allocated to support the energy renovation of buildings. It has therefore decided to create an -Environment--Environnement-, within which all sectoral stakeholders will work to implement the Strategy for the sustainable renovation of Brussels buildings (Stratégie de rénovation durable du bâti bruxellois). The government will also involve public and private sponsors in the Alliance so that all possible options are available for funding the transition of buildings. The government will also extend its ambitious policy of encouraging renovation, by steering public and private investment towards this goal, particularly through the next ERDF programming period and use of the third-party investor mechanism. In order to tackle the wide range of situations (jointly owned properties, landlords, etc.), the government will implement an equally wide range of public and private funding solutions. In collaboration with public and private financial operators, it will develop innovative methods of funding suited to energy renovation, such as mortgages repayable over terms corresponding to the financial return on the planned renovation, or energy renovation loans that are repayable on transfer of ownership. In order to take full advantage of the opportunity offered by the transfer of ownership for undertaking ambitious renovations, the government will establish a price of transfer, through reduced registration fees or reduced inheritance or gift taxes. The reduction will depend on a comprehensive energy renovation being carried out within a set timescale and following an EPB analysis and development of an improvement strategy. More generally, the government will study how taxation can be used to encourage owners to improve the EPB class of their property.
