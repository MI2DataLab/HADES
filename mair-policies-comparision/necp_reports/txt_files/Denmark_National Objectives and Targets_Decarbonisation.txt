        25  2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS  2.1 Dimension Decarbonisation  2.1.1 GHG emissions and removals (i) The elements set out in point (a)(1) of Article 4: (i) The Member State's binding national target for greenhouse gas emissions and the annual binding national limits pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/8421; commitments pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/8412; (iii) Where applicable to meet the objectives and targets of the Energy Union and the long-term Union greenhouse gas emissions commitments consistent with the Paris Agreement, other objectives and targets, including sector targets and adaptation goals.  In October 2014 the European Council agreed on the 2030 climate and energy framework on objectives regarding greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency, renewable energy and interconnections. On greenhouse gas emissions the EU endorses a binding EU target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 % by 2030, compared to 1990. The agreement on the 2030 framework, specifically the EU domestic greenhouse gas reduction target of at least 40 %, formed the basis of the EU's contribution to the Paris -called Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) was formally approved at an Environment Council meeting in March 2015. The 40 % reduction target is sub-divided into two separate targets for the EU Emission Trade System (ETS) and non-EU ETS sectors elaborated below. In May 2018 the European Council adopted a regulation on the EU effort sharing of greenhouse gas emission reductions in the non-ETS sectors in the period 2021-2030  the so-called Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR). Under this regulation Denmark is committed to a 39 % reduction of greenhouse gas in non-ETS emissions in the period 2021-2030 by 2030 relative to 2005.  Under the Effort Sharing Regulation flexibilities mechanisms ensuring cost-effective reductions include borrowing, banking and transfer of annual emission allowances between years and between member states (cf. Article 5), cancellation of EU ETS Allowances instead  in practice meaning that reductions are made under EU ETS instead of under ESR (cf. Article 6) and use of credits from LULUCF (cf. Article 7). Further details on the commitments under the ESR regulation are included below. In May 2018 the European Council also adopted a regulation of emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the land sector  -Use, Land-ation can be used to reach the target for the non-ETS sector in accordance with the ESR up to a certain limit. The limit for Denmark is 14.6 million CO2-equivalent credits from LULUCF during the period                                                            1 Effort sharing regulation, 2018/842 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R0842&from=EN 2 LULUCF, 2018/841 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R0841&from=EN         26  2021-2030. Further details on the commitments under the LULUCF regulation are included below. The EU is committed to reducing its ETS emissions by 43 % in 2030 from 2005 to achieve the total greenhouse gas emissions reduction of 40 % below 1990 levels by 2030.The EU has also set itself the target of increasing the share of renewables in energy use to 32 % by 2030. In June 2018 all parties of the Parliament agreed on a Danish Energy Agreement with funding that will set the path towards a 55 % renewables share in 2030 in Denmark. The Energy Agreement of June 2018 furthermore specifies that given the allocated funding renewables are to cover all final electricity consumption or more by 2030  The agreement also includes a phase out of coal in electricity production by 2030.  -term low targets under the ESR regulation and the LULUCF Regulation are to be seen as steps in 2021-2030 towards the objective to work towards net zero emissions in accordance with the Paris agreement and for a net-zero-emission target in the EU and Denmark by 2050 at the latest.  Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) removals as well as contributing to the achievement of the economy wide EU greenhouse emissions and annual binding national limits pursuant to Regulation ESR are as follows: 2030-ETS greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 at least by 39 percent ESR3. 2021-2029: -ETS greenhouse gas emissions in each year between 2021 and 2029 do not exceed a specific linear trajectory. LULUCF Regulation  As regards the dimension "Decarbonisation", and with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and removals and with a view to contributing to the achievement of the economy wide EU  pursuant to LULUCF Regulation are as follows: 2021-2030: Account for emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry ('LULUCF')4 during the periods from 2021 to 2025 and from 2026 to 2030 occurring                                                            3 Taking into account the flexibilities provided for in Artic 9 on compliance check (see footnote 5). 4 MMR: Regulation(EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on a mechanism for  monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and for reporting other information at national and Union level relevant  to climate change and repealing Decision No 280/2004/EC (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0013:0040:EN:PDF)         27  in the following land accounting categories on the EU territory of Denmark: afforested land, deforested land, managed cropland, managed grassland and managed forest land and as of 2026 also managed wetlands.5  2021-2025 and 2026-2030: Denmark will ensure that emissions do not exceed removals under the accounting rules, calculated as the sum of total emissions and removals on ed above combined and as accounted in accordance with the LULUCF Regulation. (ii) Where applicable, other national objectives and targets consistent with the Paris Agreement and the existing long-term strategies. Where applicable for the contribution to the overall Union commitment of reducing the GHG emissions, other objectives and targets, including sector targets and adaptation goals, if available The Government objective for 2030 is to reduce greenhouse gases by 70%, relative to 1990 levels and the long-term objective for Denmark is to obtain net-zero emissions no later than 2050.  On December 6, 2019 the Government reached an agreement on a new Climate Act with 8 out of the 10 parties in the Danish Parliament. The agreement includes the following key elements6: - the Climate Act is legally binding, - a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70 percent by 2030 compared to the 1990 level, - commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest,  - a mechanism for setting milestone targets every five year with a ten-year perspective,  - milestone target will be set for 2025,  - the milestone targets will be implemented into Danish law, - emissions are calculated in accordance with the UN greenhouse gas inventory rules, - the Government will develop annual Climate Programmes that will outline concrete policies to reduce emissions,  - a strengthening of the Danish Council on Climate Change (Klimarådet) with tasks such as:                                                             5 Ar land converted to forest land.

Furthermore, reductions from energy cooperation can be included in the separate report. Finally, the separate report will shed light on the impacts of consumption, - formulation of a yearly global climate strategy to ensure that Denmark keeps on its ambitious work at the global scene. -  2020.  The Climate Act is expected to be adopted by the Parliament in spring 2020. Moreover, on 2 December 2019 the Government reached agreement with the Red-Green Finance Act 2020. With the Finance Act the parties agreed to implement a range of initiatives which will strengthen the effort for a better environment, create more nature and which is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 0.5 million ton CO2- equivalents in the year 2030 on national level 8. The Government has furthermore taken steps to ensure that climate, environment and nature will be considered across all relevant policy areas. A permanent government committee on green transition has been established to ensure that effects on climate, environment and nature is taken into account in government proposals and bills. Moreover, through decades of committed efforts. With the Energy Agreement from June 2018 the parties have allocated funding that sets a course towards an RE (renewable energy) share of approximately 55% by 2030. The agreement will also give Denmark an RE share in                                                            7 As part of the agreement on the Finance Act 2020, 10m in 2020 and 15m annually in the period 2021-2023 was allocated to the strengthening of the Council on Climate Change. 8 See the agreement on the Finance Act here: https://www.fm.dk/nyheder/pressemeddelelser/2019/12/finanslovsaftale-prioriterer-velfaerd-og-et-mere-groent-danmark          29  electricity above 100% of consumption, while ensuring that at least 90% of district heating consumption is based on energy sources other than coal, oil or gas by 2030. The Government (the Social Democrats) with the Red-Green Alliance, the Social Liberal   Introduce binding targets. During the first parliamentary year, the Government will present a proposal for a climate act with binding sub-targets and binding long-term targets, including: o A goal to reduce greenhouse gases by 70% by 2030, relative to 1990 levels. This is a very ambitious goal, and it will be particularly difficult to realise the last part of the goal, i.e. from 65% to 70%. This will require currently unknown methods and, therefore, also a close collaboration with the Danish Council on Climate Change and other experts. o That the Danish Council on Climate Change assists a the Government in making decisions on reduction targets and methods which ensure that Denmark complies with the Paris Accord temperature targets. o That an annual follow-up target assessment is performed, and that this follow-up is linked to the national budget process. 9   Transport sector transition. As part of a green mobility plan, a wide range of initiatives are required to ensure a significant increase in the number of electric vehicles on the roads and the required transport sector transition: o A stop to sales of all new diesel and petrol cars as of 2030 and enhanced low emissions zones. o It will be investigated whether the Commission for Green Transition of passenger cars can advance its work so that the final report is available before the end of 2020. As soon as possible thereafter, a political agreement must be reached to provide a sense of security to the industry and car owners and to ensure that the green transition can be undisturbed. o The Government will negotiate an infrastructure agreement, which will consider climate and environmental issues to a much higher degree. This requires investments in public transportation and cycling, among other things. o Implementing initiatives to ensure more sustainable aviation.10   Secure climate contributions from agriculture. Agricultural support shall be used as an active tool to provide farmers the incentive to transition to a more sustainable production and thereby supporting the green transition of the industry. The Government has decided to implement a pilot scheme for multifunctional land distribution which will contribute with experience and knowledge for a major land                                                            9 Cf. above as a follow-up on the political understanding an agreement on the climate act was reached on 6 December 2019.  10 For more information on new initiatives on transport see section 3.1.3(iii).         30  reform. It is important that it is designed in a way that contributes to solving multiple challenges at the same time and engages stakeholders.11   Adopt a climate action plan. The climate act will be followed by a climate action plan, which will contribute to ensuring that national reduction targets are met. In addition to describing which initiatives, cf. above, will be required for the transport industry and agriculture, the action plan will also include the following elements:  1) Energy efficiency measures, including energy saving requirements for public sector buildings;  2) a national strategy for sustainable construction;  3) a unified strategy for electrification of the transport sector, industry and society in general;  4) increased funding for green research and demonstration programmes;  5) investigating the potential for Denmark to prepare a common strategy with the North Sea nations for a significant expansion and exploitation of the offshore wind potential;  6) investigating the potential for Denmark to construct the first energy island by 2030, with a minimum of 10 GW connected12; 7) support afforestation13;  8) climate adaptation, including stronger coordination of coast protection efforts.   Assume the responsibility for more ambitious targets in the EU and enhance green diplomacy. EU started off as a coal and steel union. The Danish Government will propose the objective that a future EU will be a climate union. This means, among other things, that Denmark will be working towards increasing the EU climate targets in 2030, that the EU will be climate neutral by 2050 and that the future EU budget will focus more on climate. Denmark will also, together with other ambitious nations, push for an expansion of sustainable energy in the EU so that the EU becomes self-reliant in terms of energy. The Government will also commitment. The Government will implement a new development policy strategy with climate assistance as a central element.14   Create greater biodiversity and more woodlands. There is a need for more untouched woodlands and more cohesive nature areas where nature is allowed to spread out on more natural terms than is currently the case. A biodiversity package will improve conditions for biodiversity in Denmark. The plan will include clear targets for the proportion of the area of Denmark to be laid out as nature zones (including untouched woodlands and national nature parks) as well as specific initiatives to ensure that targets are reached.                                                            11 For more information on new initiatives related to agriculture see section 3.1.1(i).  12 For more information see section 3.1.2(i). 13 For more information see section 3.1.1(i).  14 For more information see section 3.5(i).          31    Strengthen green calculation models. Climate and green transition considerations develop greener calculation models will be secured and enhanced. A dialogue will be entered into with Statistics Denmark about strengthening the effort to produce green national accounts and GDP.   Increase organic foods targets and strengthen initiatives against food waste. The Government will increase the ambitions for more organic foods in Denmark, starting with an aim to double organic farming acreage, the export of organic foods and the consumption of organic foods by Danes by 2030, and to implement initiatives to reduce food waste.   Include stakeholders. green efforts, the Government will include stakeholders in the work on an on-going basis, including independent experts, popular movements and interest organisations. This will be the case, e.g., for areas such as promoting a strategy for circular economy, transitioning to a more energy-efficient society, smarter waste sorting and transitioning public sector procurements so that they support the green transition   As described in the previous section the climate action plan will include climate adaptation, including stronger coordination of coast protection efforts.  Moreover, updated information on adaptation in Denmark was reported to the Commission/EEA in March 2019 in accordance with the Monitoring Mechanism.  initiatives were included: Following a new government in 2011, a National Adaptation Plan (NAP) was adopted in 2012. The Action Plan for a Climate-Proof Denmark was launched in December 2012 and is the first NAP in Denmark. The NAP is based on the notion that a responsible climate policy must do more than just work to address climate change in the long term, it must also ensure necessary action is taken now to adapt our society to a climate that is already changing, and that all parts of society contribute to climate adaptation.  Dealing with the climate challenge requires collaboration between authorities, organisations, private enterprises and individuals, regardless of whether the project is maintenance of existing roads, coastal protection, construction, or investments in new infrastructure. The Government itself has a responsibility as the owner of infrastructure, buildings and land. However, the principal role for the Government is to establish an appropriate framework for local climate adaptation by, for example, adapting laws and regulations, but also by ensuring coordination and providing information. The Government requested all municipalities to develop their own adaptation action plans within two years.         32  A solid framework for the efforts must support the specific parties involved, so that they can address the challenge in a socio-economically appropriate manner at the right time.  In the NAP, the Government commits to creating the basis for continued technological and knowledge development, so that Denmark will have a strong position on the global market for climate adaptation. The NAP presents 64 new initiatives within five general areas of initiative: an improved framework for climate adaptation; more consultation and a new knowledge base; strengthened collaboration and coordination; green transition; and international climate adaptation. A few national sectors, such as transport, roads and coastal protection, have dedicated adaptation plans. In 2017, the Danish government decided to carry out a number of initiatives to support municipalities and property owners in establishing cost-effective and holistically planned flood and erosion protection. A cross-ministerial committee was set up and 15 new initiatives were decided (Denmark's 7th NCC, p. 297).  In 2017 a new national mobile team with a focus of flooding and erosion was established by the Ministry of Environment and Food (MEF) to help share knowledge, best practices and enhance cooperation, primarily with municipalities. In 2018 an amendment to the Planning Act was adopted so that all municipalities know how to identify areas at risk of flooding and erosion and ensure remediation measures in their municipal plans. The amendment was in January 2019 followed by national guidelines and examples on how and what data to use in local-government spatial planning. The Danish Coastal Authority, under the Ministry of Environment and Food of Denmark, is responsible for the implementation of the Floods Directive in Denmark. Under this mandate, the Danish Coastal Authority has reviewed and updated the preliminary flood risk assessment together with an adjustment of identified areas of potential significant flood risks. The adjustment of identified areas of potential significant flood risk has resulted in the confirmation of the 10 areas appointed back in 2011 and the appointment of 4 new flood prone areas in 2018. Municipalities in the flood risk areas will be instructed to evaluate and prepare flood risk management plans.  Adaptation strategies have not been adopted at the subnational level but all municipalities have adopted local adaptation action plans in line with the national adaptation plan (NAP). Although not a formal responsibility or obligation, four of five regions have incorporated adaptation into their regional climate strategies: South Denmark, North Jutland, Region oal of formulating and implementing a  Climate Atlas The Danish Meterological Institute (DMI) has developed a nationwide Climate Atlas based on own data and data from IPCC. Data are free and available on DMI's website.  The Climate Atlas provides an indication of areas with particular risk of storm surge and cloudburst, and thus the risk of flooding in Denmark in the future. This tool gives the climate data so municipalities can take the necessary precautions and guard citizens, infrastructure and buildings against the expected extreme weather in the future.          33  In Denmark, the municipalities are responsible for climate adaptation - for example, to build dikes or secure exposed areas from cloudbursts. The Climate Atlas is therefore developed in a collaboration with the municipalities and other relevant collaborators working on climate adaptation. Data in the Climate Atlas describe the future Danish climate in the beginning, middle and end of the century. Initially there is data about future temperature, rainfall, extreme rainfall, sea level and storm surge both at national and municipal levels - down to a 1 km grid map. Further data are added towards 2021 for other relevant climate indicators such as wind, evaporation and growth season.  Towards a circular economy  In a circular economy, the purpose is to minimize the generation of waste, while products, materials and resources are kept in circulation for as long as possible. Prevention and recycling of more waste reduces waste treatment in e.g. incinerators and can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from heat production if heat is produced from carbon neutral sources instead. Furthermore, CO2 emissions from the extraction of raw materials and production of new products will also be reduced. In 2015, the European Commission adopted an ambitious new circular economy action plan. The action plan was followed by revisions of the waste framework directive and five related waste directives, which were adopted in 2018. The revised directives set new and more ambitious targets for recycling of waste, which will incur reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from use of recycled materials instead of virgin materials and from waste management processes. The directives include a target of 70 % recycling of packaging waste by 2030, 65 % recycling of municipal waste by 2035 and a number of material specific targets. With the revised directives the method for measuring recycling has changed from  Denmark has ambitious policies for waste prevention and management. In 2018 a circular economy strategy was launched focusing on supporting the transition towards more circular production. The circular economy strategy was followed by a plastics action plan later that year. The plastics action plan focused on waste prevention and increased recycling. Denmark will further implement measures to promote the transition to a circular economy and fulfillment of the new EU targets in the coming national plan for waste prevention and management, which will be released in 2020.  In March 2019 a new think tank on prevention of food loss and food waste was established in Denmark  supported by the Danish Government. The think tank brings together research institutions, public authorities, companies and organisations to ensure collaboration across the entire food product chain and to to advance efforts to achieve SDG , halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post- The Government is also planning on adapting a climate action plan. Furthermore, as part of the Finance Act 2020 the Government, the Red-Green Alliance, the Social Liberal Party, the         34  , agreed to increase taxes on disposable tableware and shopping bags to reduce the waste amount from these single-use products.          35  2.1.2 Renewable energy  (i) The elements set out in point (a)(2) of Article 415  The new Government formed in June 2019 has set a very ambitious national target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 70 % in 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The Government will adapt climate action plans, which will contribute to ensuring that national reduction targets are met. The climate action plans will include new measures that will further accelerate the renewable transition in the energy and transport sectors.   through decades of committed efforts. Back in 2012 the political Energy Agreement concluded by a broad majority in Parliament defined the initiatives covering crucial energy policy areas for the period until 2020. Also, the parties to the 2012 Energy Agreement agreed by 2018 to commence discussions on additional initiatives for the period after 2020, which was done with the Energy Agreement from June 2018. The 2018 Energy Agreement sets out the policies and trajectories on renewable energies for the coming years. With the agreement, the Parliament has allocated funding that sets a path towards a renewables share of total energy consumption of approximately 55 % in 2030.  Renewable energy sources are promoted with economic measures, including e.g. taxes on use of energy, CO2 taxes on fossil fuels and through the Public Service Obligation Scheme (PSO), which is a levy on electricity paid by all consumers. The PSO levy is now being phased out during a period of 5 years (2017-2021), and the financing of subsidies to renewables will gradually shift to the State Budget. In September 2017, the government and a majority in Parliament reached a political agreement on tenders in 2018 and 2019 allowing photovoltaic panels and wind turbines to compete to deliver the largest amount of green power to the consumers. The amount of subsidized renewable energy resulting from the tenders, will depend on the size of the bids in the tenders. The 2018-tender was completed in December 2018 and will increase annual                                                            15 With a view to achieving the Union's binding target of at least 32 % renewable energy in 2030 as referred to in Article 3 of the Renewables Directive, a contribution to that target in terms of the Member State's share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy in 2030, with an indicative trajectory for that contribution from 2021 onwards. By 2022, the indicative trajectory shall reach a reference point of at least 18 % of the total increase in the share of energy from renewable sources between that Member State's binding 2020 national target, and its contribution to the 2030 target. By 2025, the indicative trajectory shall reach a reference point of at least 43 % of the total increase in the share of energy from renewable sources between that Member State's binding 2020 national target and its contribution to the 2030 target. By 2027, the indicative trajectory shall reach a reference point of at least 65 % of the total increase in the share of energy from renewable sources between that Member State's binding 2020 national target and its contribution to the 2030 target. By 2030, the indicative trajectory shall reach at least the Member State's planned contribution. If a Member State expects to surpass its binding 2020 national target, its indicative trajectory may start at the level it is projected to achieve. The Member States' indicative trajectories, taken together, shall add up to the Union reference points in 2022, 2025 and 2027 and to the Union's binding target of at least 32 % renewable energy in 2030. Separately from its contribution to the Union target and its indicative trajectory for the purposes of this Regulation, a Member State shall be free to indicate higher ambitions for national policy purposes.          36  production equivalconsumption. In addition, it was agreed to allocate DKK 150 million for new test wind turbines to be established inside the two national test centres for large wind turbines as well as subsidies for 35 MW of new test wind turbines outside the national test centres in 2018 and 2019. Wind power In accordance with the energy policy agreement from February 2008, the 400 MW offshore wind farm at the island of Anholt started operation in September 2013. The Energy Agreement of 2012 includes an expectation of 500 MW additional onshore wind capacity and 1350 MW of new capacity from offshore wind.  In this respect the Danish Energy Agency was responsible for tendering the new offshore capacity: The Horns Rev 3 tender of 400 MW in the North Sea with commercial operation in August 2019, the Kriegers Flak-tender of 600 MW in the Baltic Sea with commercial operation in 2021 and the so-called near shore tender of 350 MW  Vesterhav Nord and Syd - with expected commercial operation in 2023. Also, as a part of the 2012 Energy Agreement, Denmark was responsible for tendering a 28 MW offshore test project at Nissum Bredning. As a result, wind energy is expected to cover about 50 % of Danish electricity consumption in 2020.  Biomass In 2017, biomass accounted for approximately 64 % of renewable-energy production, mostly in the form of straw, wood pellets, wood chip and biodegradable waste for incineration. Import accounted for 45 % of the total consumption of bioenergy in Denmark in 2017, mainly in the form of wood pellets (59 PJ), liquid biofuels (10 PJ) and wood chips (7 PJ). The energy production from biomass has more than doubled since 1990 - primarily due to the policy agreement from 1993 (the Biomass Agreement: requires power plants to use 1.4 million tonnes of straw and wood, equivalent to almost 20 PJ per year) and the policy agreement from February 2008 on the increased use of straw and chips at the large co-generation plants (up to 700,000 tonnes in 2011). The conversion from fossil fuels (primarily coal) to biomass at the large combined heat and power plants expanded after the Energy Agreement in 2012 as a result of the improved incentives (see below) At the same time, the consumption of biomass continues to rise as a source of energy for the supply of heat in district-heating plants and in smaller installations for households, enterprises and institutions. An analysis has been initiated in order to address the sustainability of the large Danish consumption of biomass for energy purposes. The outcome of the analysis will serve as input to the forthcoming climate action plan.  Heating and cooling The share of renewables in the Danish heating sector including biomass and biodegradable waste is currently approximately 54 %. This has largely been achieved without direct support. The use of biomass for heat production, however, is exempted from energy and CO2 taxes. A large part of the biomass utilization for heat production takes place in large scale combined heat and power generation at centralized plants converted from coal based         37  production. This has largely been the result of incentives for biomass conversions enacted with the Energy policy agreement from 2012. These incentives allow for a larger share of the combined operating costs to be carried by the district heating companies and consequently the consumers, along with the aforementioned support schemes for biomass-based electricity production in co-generation plants.  Biogas Denmark has supported the production and use of biogas through a variety of financial and in 2004, when it was politically decided that electricity based on biogas would be granted a fixed feed-in tariff of 0.6 DKK/kWh  the first 10 years, followed by 0.4 DKK/kWh the next 10 years, the production of biogas began to stagnate. As a result, the incentive scheme was modified again in 2008 in order to increase biogas production by making it financially more viable. All new and existing biogas plants would receive either a feed-in tariff of 0.745 DKK/kWh electricity or a price premium of 0.405 DKK/kWh electricity. In addition to that, it was decided to partially adjust for inflation each year. Although it was expected that the increase in direct support would boost the production of biogas, actual production remained fairly stagnant at roughly 4-5 PJ.   In 2012, the incentive scheme was adjusted once more, and two new price premiums were introduced, both of which are still in place today. The first premium consisting of 0.26 DKK/kWh is pegged to the market price of natural gas and includes a floor price. If the market price of natural gas drops below the floor price, the premium increases and vice versa. In addition to that, the second premium introduced in 2012 grants each producer another 0.10 DKK/kWh electricity, but is reduced by 0.02 DKK/kWh every year and phased out by 2020. The changes to the incentive scheme implied that biogas upgraded to biomethane and the use of biogas for industrial, transport- and heating purposes became eligible for support.  Bioeconomy Denmark supports the updated Bioeconomy Strategy launched by the European Comission in 2018. Moreover, The Danish Government has formed a National Bioeconomy Panel which gives advise to the Government on sustainable utilization of biomass resources to fodder, food products, materials and energy purposes. Futhermore, with the agreement on circular economy of 2018 funding has been allocated to conducting analyses of the potential of a Danish bioeconomy strategy.    Policy frame post 2020 In 2020 Denmark expects to reach an overall renewables share of 41 %, according to 16. The individual shares for electricity, district heating and transport are estimated to 77 %, 71 % and 9 % respectively. The share of biomethane in the natural gas grid is expected to reach 14 % in 2020.                                                             16 Based on the EU methodology         38  In June 2018 the Danish Parliament agreed on a policy framework for the energy policy from 2020 to 2024. With the agreement, the Parliament has allocated funding that sets a path towards a renewables share of total energy consumption of approximately 55 % in 2030. The agreement from June 2018 is expected to give Denmark a renewable share in electricity above 100 % of consumption, while ensuring that at least 90 % of district heating consumption is based on energy sources other than coal, oil or gas by 2030. The agreement also includes a phase out of coal in electricity production by 2030. It is a political priority to achieve the increase in renewable energy production through market mechanisms.   The Danish binding EU target for 2020 for renewables is 30 %. Denmark plans to count the extra 11 percentage points as early effort towards the 2030 renewables target. With the Energy Agreement, the Parliament has allocated funding that sets a path towards approximately 55 % renereducing greenhouse gas emissions by 70 % in 2030 compared to 1990 levels will also further accelerate the renewable transition in the energy and transport sectors. The new measures that will be included in the upcoming climate action plan are described further in section 3.1.2.  The indicative trajectory for the Danish contribution from 2020 and onwards is displayed in figure Figure 2. The trajectory represents a frozen policy scenario17 and entails great uncertainly. Therefore, the actual renewables share may vary from this estimation. Figure 2. Indicative trajectory for the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption compared to the minimum reference points                                                             17 Frozen policy scenario present the baseline projection based on existing measures as of May 2019 and under the assumption that no additional measures are implemented.         39  Included in the indicative trajectory are the specific initiatives described in the 2018 Danish Energy Agreement, in which funding has been allocated to renewables. Consequently, this is the Danish expected contribution to the 2030 EU target, in accordance with Article 4 (a) 2 of the Governance Regulation.  As mentioned, the trajectory represent a frozen policy, however, as shown in Figure 28, current modelling of the consequences of the Energy Agreement, leads to a renewables share of 54%, very close to the 55 % share - without further policy measures. The June 2018 Energy Agreement also include a reserve of 400 million DKK in 2025 and 500 million DKK annually for further efforts from 2026 to promote renewable energy, however it is currently not possible to quantify the effects of the implementation of the reserve for additional investments in RE from 2025.  In addition, new policy will need to be implemented to reach the 70 % CO2 reduction target that may impact the pace and magnitude of the renewables penetration. (ii) Estimated trajectories for the sectorial share of renewable energy in final energy consumption from 2021 to 2030 in the electricity, heating and cooling, and transport sector  Denmark has not at present set any individual objectives or targets for sectorial shares of renewable energy. Estimated trajectories for the sectorial share, based on modelling of a frozen policy scenario is presented in Figure 3.   Figure 3. Estimated trajectories for the sectorial share of renewable energy  Due to new investments for renewables as well as a decision to phase out coal in the electricity production sector in 2030  the renewables share in electricity consumption is expected to exceed 100 % of consumption in 2030. As for the district heating sector, it is the frozen policy projection that at least 80 % of the heating in the district heating sector will be based on renewables in 2030. For the heating and cooling sector as a whole the         40  renewables share is expected to reach 60 % in 2030. For transport the share is expected to reach 19 %, based on the calculation methodology described in the REDII. (iii) Estimated trajectories  by renewable energy technology that the Member State projects to use to achieve the overall and sectorial trajectories for renewable energy from 2021 to 2030 including expected total gross final energy consumption per technology and sector in Mtoe and total planned installed capacity (divided by new capacity and repowering) per technology and sector in MW  Denmark has not at present set any individual objectives or targets for individual technologies to use to achieve the overall and sectorial trajectories. Denmark is subsidizing renewable energy through multi-technology tenders for wind power and solar PV. New multi-technology tenders is being planned for years 2020-2024. The following trajectories are therefore based on the available model simulations.  Figure 4. Estimated trajectory for the overall share of renewable energy, by technology  Offshore wind will continue to increase rapidly, in part due to 3 new offshore wind parks of a total of minimum 2,400 MW planned for the period, figure Figure 5. Each of the parks will be minimum 800 MW. The tender for the first park is to be finalized in 2021 and will have a capacity of 800-1000 MW the next two tenders will take place in 2023 and 2025 respectively. The new Government of June 2019 has furthermore, in the new political undertaking an in-depth analysis of the possibility of building an energy island in the North Sea with at least 10 GW of offshore wind connected by 2030. This will also drastically increase the share of renewable energy from offshore wind turbines in the Danish energy mix.          41  Since the cost of offshore wind is expected to continue to decrease in the coming years, it is agreed in the Energy Agreement of 2018 to gradually reduce the number of onshore wind turbines from approx. 4,300 today to a maximum of 1,850 in 2030. At present, onshore wind is the cheapest form of renewable energy in Denmark and the production from onshore wind turbines is still expected to increase in the coming years as smaller existing turbines are replaced with newer and more effective ones. Figure 5. Estimated trajectory for the RES-E, by technology  The renewable share in the heating and cooling sector and the district heating sector is expected to be achieved mainly through the use of biomass and heat pumps, cf. Figure 6 and Figure 7.  For the heating and cooling sector, the renewables share is expected to increase from 53.5 % in 2020 to 59.9 % in 2030. The estimated increase based on the frozen scenario corresponds to an average increase over the entire period of 0.64 percentage point per year and 0.94 and 0.34 percentage point for the period 2021-2025 and 2026-2030         42  respectively. These numbers only include renewables. Any contribution from surplus heat is not included.  Figure 6. Estimated trajectory for the RES-HC, by technology   For the district heating sector, the renewables share is expected to increase from 70.7 % in 2020 to 79.6 % in 2030. The increase correspond to an average increase over the 2021-30 period of 0.88 percentage point per year and 1.37 and 0.40 percentage point for the period 2021-2025 and 2026-2030 respectively. These numbers only include renewables. Any contribution from surplus heat is not included.  The reason that the renewable share in district heating does not reach over 80 % is partly the high share of non-bio-degradable share in waste incineration that is still expected to supply large part if the district heating network in 2030. Another reason is that a final plan         43  for the phase out of the last remaining coal fired CHP plant on the island of Fyn remains to be agreed.   Figure 7. Estimated trajectory for the RES-DH, by technology   The renewables share in transport is expected to reach 19 % in 2030 (based on the REDII methodology). The increase in the period is primarily a result of increased electricity consumptions for electric vehicles combined with a higher share of renewables in the electricity mix. The increase in the electricity share for rail transport from 2027 is mainly due to new electrically powered trains and electrification of the railway line between         44  Frederica and Aalborg. Uncertainty regarding future technology development and other factors implies that these figures have to be interpreted with caution. There is a specific blending obligation for advanced biofuel at 0.9 % (before double counting) in the Danish legislation. Fulfilling this obligation will be sufficient to fulfil the specific RED target for advanced biofuels in 2022 and 2025, but not in 2030. Figure 8. Estimated trajectory for the RES-Transport, by fuel          45   Table 2. Estimated energy consumption, by technology and sector   Table 3. Estimated total capacity, by technology and sector   The amount of re-powering project dependents on many factors, including specific market conditions and technological development. Denmark has no specific objectives regarding         46  re-powering projects, and the simulation for planned capacity does not distinguish explicitly between new and re-powered capacity. Therefore, regarding the split on total planned installed capacity in new capacity and repowering, there is no reliable data available regarding the amount of re-powering projects. (iv) Estimated trajectories on bioenergy demand, disaggregated between heat, electricity and transport, and on biomass supply, by feedstocks and origin (distinguishing between domestic production and imports). For forest biomass, an assessment of its source and impact on the LULUCF sink  The use of bioenergy in Denmark has been growing for several years, and today (2017 numbers) the bioenergy consumption constitutes approx. 75 % of the total use of renewables. Figure 9 shows the development divided upon sectors. Figure 9. Estimated trajectory for biomass consumption, by sector, ktoe.  Denmark has not at present set any individual objectives or targets on bioenergy demand, Climate Outlook 2019 the use of bioenergy will continue to grow until 2020-2025. After that the consumption is expected to decrease slightly. Figure 9 shows the expected development until 2030. More than half of the present bioenergy consumption is used for production of district heat and electricity, and the use of bioenergy for these purposes has increased by almost a coal fired power plants have been or are being converted to use of biomass fuels. The conversion is expected to be complete 2020-25. Hereafter the use of bioenergy will decrease slightly due to among other factors an uptake from heat-pumps and the revision of the subsidy schemes.         47  Use of bioenergy in households constitutes the second largest consumption. In households, bioenergy is mainly being used for heating using wood stoves (firewood) and biomass boilers (wood pellets). In Denmark, there are large energy and CO2 taxes on fossil fuels for heating. For houses situated outside areas with access to district heating and natural gas, use of bioenergy for heating is therefore often the cheapest and most convenient solution.  Today, the industry and transport sectors together use approx. 15 % of the bioenergy. The consumption is expected to increase further until 2020  2025. The main reason for this increase is the introduction of biogas in the natural gas system. Figure 10 shows the historical and expected use of bioenergy divided upon fuel types. The figure shows that wood products constitute more than half of the total bioenergy consumption. Figure 10. Estimated trajectory for biomass supply, by type of fuel.  Denmark uses both indigenous biomass fuels and imported biomass fuels. Figure 11 shows the use of different types of bioenergy divided upon indigenous sources and imports, based on 2017 data.         48  Figure 11. Biomass origin. Domestic production and imports, 2017.  The figure shows that the import shares differ substantially between fuel types. Wood pellets, bio ethanol and biodiesel are nearly 100 % imported, while the other types of biomass fuels are mainly from domestic sources. Wood pellets are primarily imported from the Baltics (primarily Estonia and Latvia) and from Sweden and Russia. Smaller amounts are imported from other EU countries (primarily Portugal, Poland and Germany) and from the United States. The most important import countries regarding wood pellets are shown in Figure 12 below, based on data for 2016.  Figure 12. Countries of origin for wood pellets imported to Denmark.  Source: "Det danske træpillemarked 2016".         49  biomass fuels, but a fairly good assumption will be to say that the 2016/2017 picture is valid for the near future as well. However, for wood chips, a larger import share must be expected due to the expected conversion of the remaining coal fired CHP plants. The conversion will lead to an increase in the use of wood chips by approx. 400 ktoe, and it is expected that most of this increase will be covered by imports. The resulting use of wood chips for electricity and heat production will be around 45 PJ per year, whereof approx. 50 % will be covered by imports. Forest biomass comprises wood chips, firewood, wood pellets and wood residues. The forecast shows that the total consumption of forest biomass will decrease slightly in the coming years from 140 PJ in 2020. Of this amount, approx. 65 % will be used for production of district heating and electricity, 25  30 % will be used for individual heating, and 5  10% will be used for other purposes.  Wood pellets used for individual heating constitute approx. 10 % of the total consumption of wood products for energy use. At present, this consumption is not subject to any Danish rules concerning sustainability. Nearly all of the forest biomass used for production of district heating and electricity is covered by a voluntary Danish industry agreement, concluded in 2014. The voluntary Danish industry agreement on sustainable biomass The purpose of the agreement is to ensure that biomass used in Denmark fulfils internationally recognized sustainability demands. Thus, the biomass must come from forests that are operated in a sustainable way, and the use of biomass has to lead to real CO2 reductions. The sustainability of the used biomass has to be documented in annual reports verified by a third party. The agreement comprises all plants producing district heat and electricity based on wood pellets and wood chips. Only plants with a capacity above 20 MW have to provide the documentation. The agreement covers wood from forests, but not wood from other areas such as farm land, cities etc.  According to the agreement, 90 % of the used biomass has to be sustainable, and the sustainability has to be documented. The remaining 10 % also has to be sustainable, but for this share, the documentation demands are fewer18. The sustainability criteria in the agreement are based on the guidelines regarding sustainable forestry from Forest Europe and the Eugases from production, harvest, processing and transport of the biomass. Besides, the agreement contains criteria for CO2 reduction compared to fossil alternatives, in order to ensure that the used biomass contributes to a positive climate effect.                                                            18 See the agreement here: https://www.danskenergi.dk/sites/danskenergi.dk/files/media/dokumenter/2017-09/IndustryAgreement_Biomass-20160623.pdf         50  Moreover, an analysis has been initiated in order to address the sustainability of the large Danish consumption of biomass for energy purposes. The outcome of the analysis will serve as input to the forthcoming climate action plan.  Danish forest regulation Danish forests are subject to a regulation with the purpose to maintain the existing forests and increase the forest area. Besides, the purpose of the regulation is to promote sustainable forestry. Thus, the regulation ensures that use of Danish produced firewood does not lead to deforestation.  Denmark will implement the sustainability criteria of the revised renewable energy directive directive. In light of this implementation, the role of the industry agreement will be considered, as well as possible new regulation covering the use of biomass in other sectors.  (v) Where applicable, other national trajectories and objectives, including those that are long-term or sectoral (e.g. share of renewable energy in district heating, renewable energy use in buildings, renewable energy produced by cities, energy communities and self-consumers, energy recovered from the sludge acquired through the treatment of wastewater)  As for the district heating sector, it is the frozen policy projection that at least 80 % of the heating in the district heating sector will be based on renewable sources in 2030, see Figure 7.
