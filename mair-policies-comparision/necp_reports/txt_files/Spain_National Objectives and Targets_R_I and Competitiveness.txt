2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 67 2.5 RESEARCH, INNOVATION AND COMPETITIVENESS DIMENSION 2.5.1 National objectives for RIC and national funding targets           National objectives for RIC  Aligning Spanish policies with the objectives pursued internationally and by the European Union in terms of energy and climate RIC while taking into account our distinctive features.  Coordinating the energy and climate RIC policies of the Public Administrations with the other sectoral policies. In particular, coordinating energy policy and innovation policies.  Guiding research and development towards finding solutions to social challenges and sustainable development goals.  Strengthening technology transfer from the public system to society and industry to facilitate the ecological transition.  Promoting public-private partnership and business research and innovation.  Putting citizens at the centre of the energy and climate transition model by helping them to take on a greater role.  The objectives of decarbonising the economy and combating and adapting to climate change require technical and economic improvements and new solutions, for which research and innovation are at the core. Governments, as promoters and funders of science, development and innovation, have a key role in defining priority strategic areas, promoting targeted research and development and facilitating the introduction and adoption of new environmentally friendly technologies.  From this perspective, Spanish science has made a firm commitment to protecting the environment and sustainability, as the sustainable development perspective was included in previous State Strategies and Plans for research, development and innovation.  In particular, the current State Plan for scientific and technical research and innovation 2017-2020 prioritises areas related to sustainability, the energy transition and climate change34.                                                             34 These priority areas of research include the development of the next generation of renewable energy technologies; the design of flexible and distributed networks and management systems; the design and development of efficient energy systems; methods of reduction, capture, storage and use of carbon; the treatment of waste for energy purposes; nuclear security; hydrogen technologies (including photoelectrocatalysis); the development of clean combustion technologies; sustainable mobility and the modal shift in transport; the promotion of sustainable building; low-carbon technologies; climate change mitigation and adaptation; climate observation; the integrated and sustainable management of natural systems and resources; sustainable and resilient management of water resources; and areas related to the implementation of the circular economy, among others. 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 68 For the new period of strategic planning of science and innovation policies, the dimensions of sustainability, decarbonisation and the fight against climate change will be guidelines, thereby contributing to the achievement of international and EU objectives (Agenda 2030 of the United Nations and the Paris Agreement) from the perspective of science and innovation.  Research, development and competitiveness objectives for energy and climate will be achieved in accordance with the following guiding principles:   Coordination: RIC priorities must be coordinated and aligned with sectoral and regional plans and strategies in order to maximise the impact of policies.  Co-responsibility: The General State Administration and the rest of the public administrations, the private sector and civil society as a whole should embrace advances in science and innovation for the ecological transition.  Interdisciplinarity: The complex and cross-cutting climate challenge requires contributions from and the coordination of different scientific areas and disciplines.  Coordination  It is essential to coordinate the energy and climate RIC policies of all the Public Administrations and coordinate these with the other sectoral policies, and to create the necessary synergies and complementarities. This, in turn, implies the co-responsibility of the competent administrations and the adoption of shared criteria for management, evaluation and, where appropriate, the implementation of co-financing models. This policy coordination should expand to both the sectoral dimension and regional dimension while guaranteeing adequate participation and involvement of stakeholders at all levels of administration (Central, Autonomous Community and Local Administration). In this respect, the autonomous communities play a fundamental role due scientific and industrial potential.  In this regard, the national and regional strategies for Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3 strategies) are integrated agendas for territorial economic transformation. The S3 concept appeared in the mid-2000s within European debate, and an expert group (the Knowledge for Growth group) was set up at the request of the DG for Research and Innovation to find solutions to the competitiveness gap observed between the European Union and the United s and regions.  The European Commission sees Smart Specialisation as a key instrument in ensuring cohesion potentially competitive and development-driving areas within a global context. Accordingly, the development of Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3) has been made a requirement for regions and Member States to be eligible for structural funds in the 2014-2020 budget period. Therefore, it is essential that regions identify areas of specialisation that are eligible for EU funding during this period for R&D, innovation and ICT projects.  In this context, the S3-Energy Platform, created by the European Commission, is a tool that helps Strategies for Smart Specialisation in energy with energy RDI objectives. This platform also connects and gives visibility to the various national and regional priorities and strategies by facilitating cooperation and preventing fragmented efforts. The S3 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 69 Energy platform itself includes already active partnerships on bioenergy, marine renewable energy, smart grids, solar energy and sustainable buildings.  Co-responsibility  Achieving the decarbonisation objectives set by the INECP requires public-private participation and collaboration in research and innovation. To this end, flexible structures for national and international collaboration, which identify technical challenges and development opportunities, and share investment needs, will be promoted.  In addition to directly financing research and development for energy and climate, the public sector will seek to mobilise private investment by acting as a driver for change from the demand side of the administrations, implementing new public procurement and pre-commercial schemes that facilitate the introduction of new solutions into the market.  Interdisciplinarity  Due to its characteristics, the climate challenge has a complex and cross-cutting nature that requires knowledge and technical developments from very diverse research disciplines.  The disciplines needed to address the climate challenge in a comprehensive manner include scientific-technical areas such as those related to public health, the study of natural ecosystems, the conservation of cultural heritage, bio-economics and the circular economy, digital development, or smart networks. It is also necessary to consider contributions from the social sciences and humanities that introduce important economic, social and adaptation perspectives.  Similarly, R&D in energy and climate must combine scientific and technical advances at different stages: from basic research, to development and technological and non-technological innovations for the development of new products and services that help to overcome these challenges. 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 70 National funding targets         National funding targets  increase the importance of RDI in national economic activity, to reach investments of no less than 2.5% of GDP, and to maintain these levels regardless of economic cycles.  A significant part of this investment in RIC will be allocated to energy and climate RIC in line with EU objectives and ambitions in this area. This percentage is currently being evaluated.  Spain plans to apply to join the Mission Innovation (MI) Energy Initiative. As part of the initiative, the participating countries have agreed to try to energy research and development in five years while encouraging higher levels of private sector investment in clean technologies.  2.5.2 Specific objectives for clean and low-carbon energy technologies  continental scale, with increasing energy interconnection, which promotes competition and the efficient use of resources, including measures to stimulate the use of renewable energy sources that help to decarbonise the energy system within the framework of international agreements on climate change. Achieving these goals will require technologically feasible solutions and innovations, not only in terms of energy efficiency and clean energies but also as regards consumption patterns, eco-design, governance, finance and transport, among others.  Priority objectives for energy and climate R&D in Spain have been defined based on the global objectives of this INECP, those established in the implementation of the SET Plan and consultation with experts from the public and private sectors. Energy R&D objectives can be grouped into four areas:   the development of clean energy sources (onshore and offshore wind, solar photovoltaic and solar thermal, bioenergy, ocean energy, biomass, geothermal) and energy efficiency, as well as energy vectors like hydrogen;  competitiveness to improve the effectiveness of the Spanish and European network through the development of a highly digitalised internal energy system and market;  security of supply, in order to better coordinate national energy supply and demand in an international context; and  the social and technological drive towards lower energy consumption patterns. 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 71 Specifically, the following priority areas and technologies are defined in accordance with the SET Plan, the international commitments meconomy, natural resources, industry and geography:  Energy efficiency. o In the case of building (Action 5 of the SET Plan), improvements will be sought to facilitate the deployment of:  heating and cooling systems;  the use of renewable energy in urban heating and cooling networks;  the use of renewable energy in buildings;  renewable energy produced by cities, energy communities and self-consumers;  active and passive solutions in the energy upgrading of buildings. o With regard to industry, priority will be given to implementing innovation and energy competitiveness measures aimed at increasing process efficiency, waste heat recovery, the incorporation of renewable energies and the integration of CO2 capture technologies to reduce emissions. Special attention will be given to technologies and applications for energy- and resource-intensive industries, (Action 6 of the SET Plan).  Energy generation from renewable sources in which Spain already has a competitive or leadership position with high levels of participation by Spanish companies in the market, in line with the European goal of being a world leader in renewable energies 35 (Actions 1 and 2 of the SET Plan). Two priority objectives are defined in this area of action: increasing the use of the various renewable energies and reducing the cost of these technologies. Specifically: o Photovoltaic Energy. Development of new materials and technologies; reduction of costs in the development, construction, operation and maintenance of large plants; integration of photovoltaic solar energy into buildings; improvement of the manageability of photovoltaic generation and its integration into the grid. o Concentrated Solar Power. Technological solutions that allow costs to be reduced and the integration of this technology into the energy system, taking advantage of its capacity to increase the inertia and manageability of the system, are particularly important. Promoting medium-temperature concentrated solar technologies (90 -400 development and implementation of the next generation of thermoelectric solar technology will be promoted in order to increase manageability and renewable strength in the system at competitive prices.                                                              35 On 30 November 2016, the European Commission presented a package of measures to keep the European Union competitive as the clean energy transition is changing the global energy markets. The goals are: putting energy efficiency first, achieving global leadership in renewable energies and providing a fair deal for customers. 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 72  o Biomass. Technological solutions that optimise the value chain, from obtaining the resource to exploiting it, seeking to reduce costs and improve the efficiency of installations and processes. o Offshore wind energy. Technical advances that allow the costs of this technology to be reduced, with an emphasis on floating solutions and assembly techniques that are less invasive to the marine environment; they will increase the number of potential areas for locating offshore wind farms and accelerate their contribution to decarbonisation goals at a competitive cost. Innovative solutions for onshore wind energy that result in cost reductions and manageability improvements will also be supported. o Deep and shallow geothermal energy. In the case of shallow geothermal energy, given its potential for decarbonisation in buildings, technical developments will be sought to reduce implementation costs, improve land evaluation methods, increase drilling productivity and integrate it into the upgrading of buildings, etc. Deep geothermal energy needs support in order to improve efficiency and reduce costs. o Ocean Energy. The developments made in this energy, in both current and wave technologies, need a boost to increase the TRL to 7, 8 and 9. This requires focusing activities on possible demonstration projects that will generate knowledge and experience in a real marine environment. The long-term strategy for ocean energy includes developing and implementing reliable and competitively priced generation fleets.  Technologies that contribute to the flexibility and optimisation of the electricity system as a whole36 taking into account the objectives sought: generation based on renewable primary resources (usually variable), support for the inertia of the system, and market potential via international interconnections (including major international lines). Special attention will be paid to manageable renewable energies such as solar thermoelectric energy with thermal storage, biomass and other storage options. Three areas are therefore included: o Generation: R&I in other technologies that contribute to manageability and are necessary in the transition process. o Storage: Electricity storage systems and optimising their management. In this area, the development of both mobile and stationary batteries will be especially important. Advances in batteries will require the development of new advanced materials and technologies that offer an alternative scenario to lithium. Collaboration between industry and academic research includes developing pilot lines for the manufacture of new generation batteries, as well as addressing battery sustainability in terms of materials and raw materials, reuse and recycling. (Action 7 of the SET Plan). o Electricity system: Achieving a secure and resilient system in the context of the energy transition will require technological developments in digitisation, power electronics,                                                            36 The implementation of low-carbon technologies that provide flexibility to the system is essential in order to achieve high penetration rates of intermittent (or flowing) renewables. Without this flexibility, despite offering low generation costs, renewables such as PV, wind and others would have a lower penetration ceiling. 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 73 storage, equipment and materials improvements, thus aiming to strengthen smart electricity grids, increasing asset flexibility, and the manageability of renewable energy (Action 4 of the SET Plan).  Nuclear energy: Furthermore, while Spain keeps its nuclear power plants in operation it is necessary to continuously strengthen their safety, optimal operation and waste management. Given the scenario of an orderly and phased shutdown of the nuclear fleet envisaged in the INECP throughout the decade from 2025 to 2035, specific research and development efforts are required in this area. Priority areas of research and technologies include long-term secure operation, irradiated fuel and waste management, and the participation and acquisition of know-how. Research and development in the nuclear field will be carried out in collaboration with other EU nuclear countries with experience in fully or partially closing their nuclear facilities. (Action 10 of the SET Plan).  Sustainable transport: implementation of new solutions that are less polluting, safer, better integrated and capable of responding to the demands and uses of society.  Renewable fuels for the transport sector. The development of these technologies is considered a priority because of their application in aviation, mobility, industry and buildings. (Action 7 of the SET Plan). o Development of advanced biofuels. o Hydrogen production using 100% renewable sources and its use as stationary storage for large quantities and long periods of time.  New services and technologies for consumers, cities and smart communities. (Action 3 of the SET Plan). o Smart solutions for the energy consumer status as an energy consumer. In this area, digitalisation technologies are also particularly important. o Smart cities and communities that integrate the various technologies available in successful pilot experiences, involving city councils, citizens and service companies, in various cities under the PED (Positive Energy District) framework, and this should serve as an example to encourage innovation and replicate the best solutions. starting point and its specific context.

Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019  In order to achieve these priorities, Spain is willing to participate in international consortia for research, innovation and industrial implementation. It will be particularly important to take part in future energy ERA-NET projects, in the SET Plan implementation working groups (IWG), as well as in partnerships under Horizon Europe, leading in areas in which Spain has greater scientific and technical capacity and seeking opportunities for complementarity with leading countries in other priority technologies which are less developed in the country.  Specific objectives for climate change science  From the perspective of RIC, it is essential to deepen scientific knowledge of oceans, terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere for modelling and evaluation of adaptation and mitigation strategies. Due to their geographical location and importance to the Spanish economy, particular 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 75 attention should be paid to aspects related to water resources, particularly integrated water management systems, and technologies aimed at the efficient use and reuse of water in irrigation, rural, urban and industrial environments and any activities that make it possible to make progress in the protection of aquatic ecosystems, seas and oceans.  Due to their particular importance and impact on the territory as a whole, technologies and monitoring systems aimed at preventing and mitigating forest fires, protecting and recovering biodiversity, and natural, rural and urban environments should be promoted.   Obtaining atmospheric, oceanographic and land observation data that feed the models that define these projections.  Improvement of the accuracy and predictability of the models, to better deal with adaptation to the impact of climate change in our country.  Creation of climate change scenarios to visualise its impacts, by region and for each of the climate variables.  Dissemination of scenarios to encourage adaptation by different economic sectors, especially those considered most vulnerable. RIC activities and objectives targeting climate change are focused on contributing to the overall objectives of the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (PNACC) and fulfilling the commitments of the Paris Agreement and the EU 2030 Climate and Energy Framework, the EU strategy on adaptation to climate change, the 2020 road map for non-ETS sectors, the forthcoming Law on Climate Change and Energy Transition and the future Strategy for decarbonisation of the Spanish economy by 2050.  In addition to meeting these objectives and commitments, the RDI approach to climate change sees the efficient use of natural resources and environmental competitiveness and socio-economic development. Research, development and innovation must facilitate the transition to a production model that reduces pressure on the environment and natural resources, and which sparks the application of less polluting and better-monitored industrial processes. 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 76 2.5.3 Competitiveness of the economy  decarbonisation, but it also has a positive effect on the industrial and productive fabric, on large, small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as on households and individuals.  These benefits are the combined result of three main effects that represent a significant improvement in competitiveness:   A widespread increase in energy efficiency in all sectors, resulting in less energy required per unit of GDP in 2030. The policies included in the Plan foresee an improvement by 2030 of 39.5%, which is equivalent to an annual improvement of 1.9% from 2017 to 2030.  A significant replacement of imported fossil fuels with indigenous renewable energy energy in the electricity sector will enable the average marginal generation cost to be reduced by 30% by 2030, compared to the Baseline Scenario.  A reduction in external energy dependence that minimises the negative effects of the high volatility of fossil fuel markets. At present, the degree of dependence of our country is 73%, and  Spain is one of the European countries with the highest potential for exploiting renewable energy. Mediterranean and Atlantic winds, high levels of sunshine, extensive forests and substantial water resources are complemented by a business, technological, innovation and knowledge network in this area.  The reduction in electricity prices through the use of renewable technologies will clearly improve competitiveness, particularly for electricity-intensive companies. The planned improvements in energy efficiency have a positive effect on the whole industrial and production fabric, on large, small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as on households and individuals.  Our country also has leading international companies in sectors that will be important for the energy transition; it has significant knowledge capital with pioneering institutions such as CIEMAT, networks and a strong industrial network in the field of renewable energy.  ernational renewable technology value chains, as well as to map existing technological, industrial and knowledge capacities, an Industrial Development Plan will be drawn up, in which all issues related to the energy transition will be a central element.   2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS 77 In short, the INECP allows Spain to aspire to be one of the leading European Union countries in the energy transition. The Spanish economy can benefit greatly from this transformation in terms of the competitiveness of its economy, in the form of prosperity, energy security, job creation in industry, innovation, technological development and the elimination of energy poverty.
