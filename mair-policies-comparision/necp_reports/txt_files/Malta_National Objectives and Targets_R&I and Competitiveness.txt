2.5 DIMENSION RESEARCH, INNOVATION AND COMPETITIVENESS  National objectives and funding targets for public and private research and innovation relating to the Energy Union   to the Energy Union are defined in the Draft National Strategy for R&I in Energy and Water 2021-203045. This is the first sectoral-specific Strategy which relates to energy and low-carbon technologies. During the upcoming ten-year period, Malta will seek to support and bolster R&I initiatives relating to the dimensions of Energy Union, specifically those which address national policy priorities and challenges, and those which contribute to national competitiveness and economic growth. This Strategy also seeks to strengthen and increase coordination and cooperation on R&I projects between the public sector, research institutions and business enterprises. The Strategy places the research and the innovation aspects of R&I on equal footing, both considered to play an important role in contributing to the realisation of national ambitions relating to decarbonisation and industrial competitiveness. In the same vein, multidisciplinary research is emphasised and encouraged by the Strategy, which foresees support of R&I initatives from engineering and natural sciences, to digitalisation and artificial intelligence, and socio-economic and behavioural research. Within this multidisciplinary framework, a number of priority areas for R&I during the period 2021-2030 are identified (Figure 22). Those relating specifically to dimensions under the Energy Union include the following: (i) renewable solutions for islands; (ii) integration of RES electricity; and (iii) energy efficient solutions for industry and services. Note that these are the priority areas included in the Draft Strategy, selected based consultations with experts and early engagement with stakeholders. These are subject to updates/modifications based on the feedback received through the public consultation process which is expected to start in November 2019.                                                              45 At the time of writing of the Final NECP, the Draft National Strategy for R&I in Energy and Water 2021-2030 is about to be published for public consultation, with a view to its finalisation by the beginning of 2020.   60  Figure 22 - Priority areas for R&I activities defined in the Draft National Strategy for Research and Innovation in Energy and Water (2021-2030), subject to amendments following the upcoming public consultation process.    As noted in a report by the JRC Policy Support Facility (2019) on its peer-review of the Maltese research and innovation system, it is difficult to acquire a clear picture of the present R&I landscape in Malta and this naturally extends to R&I in field of energy and low-carbon technologies. As a result, a d, without which concrete targets cannot be set out. During the first implementation period under the National Strategy for R&I in Energy and Water, it is planned that a framework for systematic data collection on R&I in energy and water will be developed and a comprehensive baseline formed. Based on this, quantified 2030 objectives for R&I in energy and water could be established.    [Where available] National 2050 objectives related to the promotion of clean energy technologies and [if appropriate] national objectives including long-term targets for decarbonising energy and carbon-intensive industrial sectors Malta does not have 2050 objectives related to the promotion of clean energy technologies. Additionally, there are no long-term targets for the decarbonisation of energy and carbon-intensive industrial sectors as Malta does not have an energy and carbon-intensive industry.    [If applicable] National objectives with regard to competitiveness Malta does not have specific national objectives with regard to competitiveness. That being said, the National Strategy for Research and Innovation in Energy and Water (2021-2030) prioritises support for research activities which contribute towards the competitiveness of domestic business enterprises. Such home-grown products may also have the potential for scaling up and replication, thus multiplying the inherent added-value of such research and enhancing its potential contribution to increasing industrial competitiveness.
