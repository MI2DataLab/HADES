2.2. Energy efficiency  2.2.1. The elements set out in point (a)(1) of Article 4  2.2.1.1. National contribution to the EU target of 32.5% by 2030  Article 1 of the Regulation on the governance of the Energy Union and Article 3(4) of Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency set a maximum figure for primary energy consumption in the EU of 1,273 Mtoe and for final energy consumption in the EU of 956 Mtoe by 2030, which is equivalent to a reduction of at least 32.5% compared to a trend-based reference scenario.  Articles L. 141-1 to L. 141-6 of the Energy Code, amended by the Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth of 17 August 2015, provide a framework for the MEP. The MEP sets priorities for government action in the field of energy within mainland France for the next 10 years, split into two periods of five years. The MEP that is currently being adopted covers two successive five-year periods: 20192023 and 20242028. It is linked to the SNBC, and uses the same scenarios.  According to the reference scenario used in the MEP and the SNBC, which incorporates all the measures resulting from the MEP and other future measures that have not yet been decided on, estimated final energy consumption in 2030 is 120.9 Mtoe, and estimated primary energy consumption in 2030 is 202.2 Mtoe.      Target  Final energy consumption in 2030 (in Mtoe)  120.9  Primary energy consumption in 2030 (in Mtoe)  202.2  The main macroeconomic assumptions that are used in the scenario and that lead to these results are outlined in Section 4.1 of this report.    2.2.1.2. Total cumulative amount of end-use energy savings to be achieved in accordance with Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU  Under Article 7(1) of Directive 2012/27/EU, France must make annual savings equivalent to 0.8% of final energy consumption compared to the average for 20162018.  The amount of energy to be saved over the period 20212030, based on the average final energy consumption for 20162018, is indicated in the following table:    In ktoe  2015  2016  2017  Final energy consumption (non-HVAC*): total excluding international bunkers  (source: energy balance sheet for 2017)  142,262  141,173  142,816   69    Average 20152017   142,083   *non-HVAC: not adjusted for climate variations.  The annual target is therefore 1,143.1 ktoe or 62,871 ktoe (731 TWh) for the entire period 20212030.  which is currently being drafted and which will be forwarded to Eurostat in December 2019.  The main action taken by France with a view to complying with its obligations under Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU will be to require energy sellers to provide evidence of their energy saving operations through a system of white certificates.  2.2.1.3. Indicative milestones of the long-term strategy for the renovation of the national stock of buildings  The reference scenario under the MEP incorporates the gradual tightening up of the environmental regulations that apply to new builds, in particular through the introduction of a criterion for GHG  Over the period between 2015 and 2030, the average rate of renovation will be equivalent to around 370,000 complete renovations per year.    2.2.1.4. Total floor area to be renovated or equivalent annual energy savings to be achieved   Since France introduced (in 2018 and 2019) an energy saving target of 40% by 2030 for tertiary buildings with a floor area exceeding 1,000 m², both public- and private-owned, the country chose to comply with the provisions of Article 5 of Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency by opting for an alternative  The buildings covered by the scope of Article 5 are buildings owned and occupied by the Government: offices, buildings used for education or sport, buildings used for health or social welfare purposes, cultural buildings, businesses or living quarters. Agricultural buildings, technical buildings, Ministry of Defence buildings (excluding living quarters and offices), civil engineering structures for roadways and utilities, places of worship, and monuments and memorials are excluded from the scope of the Directive.  The savings that will be made by following this alternative approach are estimated at 7,200 GWh of primary energy for the period 20212030, compared to 4,100 GWh for a BaU approach. These savings will be achieved through a combination of various measures:   work on the building shell and building installations;   measures relating to technical building services and the bui  reductions in the floor area occupied by Government.  The annex to this report contains details of the annual energy savings calculated for the period 2021 ew to transposing Article 5 of Directive 2012/27/EU.     2.2.2. Indicative milestones for 2030, 2040 and 2050, the domestically established efficiency targets as included in the roadmaps set out in the long-term renovation  70    strategies for the national stock of residential and nonresidential buildings, both public and private, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU  In keeping with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU, France will forward the final version of its longterm strategy for the energy renovation of buildings by March 2020 at the latest. Certain elements of this strategy have not yet been finalised, in particular the calculations of expected energy savings. A preliminary version is annexed to this report.    2.2.3. Where applicable, other national objectives, including long-term targets or strategies and sectoral targets, and national objectives in areas such as energy efficiency in the transport sector and with regard to heating and cooling  The national objectives for energy demand management are specified in the Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth of 2015 and the Law on Energy and Climate of 2019:   reduction in final energy consumption of 7% by 2023 (compared to 2012), of 20% by 2030 and of 50% by 2050;   reduction in the consumption of primary energy from fossil fuels of 40% by 2030 (compared to 2012); this target is broken down by fossil fuel according to the respective GHG emissions factor.    2.2.3.1. Final energy consumption reduction targets     2017  2023  2028  Final energy consumption (TWh)  1634  1525  1378  % reduction compared to 2012  0.9%  7.6%  16.5%    2.2.3.2. Final energy consumption reduction target in the buildings sector       2016  2023  2028  Final energy consumption of buildings (TWh)  745  712  636  Decisions on the action to be taken in the buildings sector were adopted on the basis of the estimates in the reference scenario. If economic developments differed from the assumptions but the measures were still implemented in their present form, energy consumption might increase by an additional 12 TWh (7 TWh in the residential sector and 5 TWh in the tertiary sector). To maintain the same level of energy consumption in the buildings sector, the Government would need to introduce extra policy initiatives to achieve the target that has been set. Potential renovation figures are as follows:   an additional 25,000  living quarters per year, with 300,000 additional living quarters over the entire period, or in other words 1.5% of the park;   an additional 1.25 Mm² of floor area per year in the tertiary sector, with 15 Mm² over the entire period, or in other words 1.5% of the park.  2.2.3.3. Final energy consumption reduction target in the transport sector    71     2016  2023  2028  Final energy consumption in the transport sector (TWh)  511  473  427  If economic developments differed from the assumptions in the reference scenario but the measures were still implemented in their present form, energy consumption might increase by an additional 8 TWh. To maintain the same level of energy consumption in the transport sector, the Government would need to introduce extra policy initiatives to achieve the target that has been set. The energy efficiency of all vehicles might need to be improved by as much as 17.5%, i.e. a target of 3.3 l/100 km in 2030 for personal-use internal combustion vehicles instead of a target of 4 l/100 km.  2.2.3.4. Final energy consumption reduction target in the industrial sector    2016  2023  2028  Final energy consumption in industry (TWh)  319  291  269  Decisions on the action to be taken in the industrial sector were adopted on the basis of the estimates in the macroeconomic reference scenario. If economic developments differed from the assumptions but the measures were still implemented in their present form, energy consumption might increase by an additional 6 TWh. To maintain the same level of energy consumption in the industrial sector, the Government would need to introduce extra policy initiatives to achieve the target that has been set. Energy efficiency might need to be improved by as much as 2.5% to 3%, depending on the sector in question.
