2.4 Dimension internal energy market2.4.1 Electricity interconnectivityi. The level of electricity interconnectivity that the Member State aims for in 2030 in consideration of the electricity interconnection target for 2030 of at least 15 %, with a strategy with the level from 2021 onwards defined in close cooperation with affected Member States, taking into 23 https://energiavirasto.fi/documents/11120570/13026619/Raportti-National-report-2019-Finland/5f0408b2-5903-11cf-29a3-3a6d0ed0d2a5/Raportti-National-report-2019-Finland.pdf24 Flexible and customer-centred electricity system; Final report of the Smart Grid Working Group 2018 http://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/161147/TEM_39_2018.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y71account the 2020 interconnection target of 10 % and the following indicators of the urgency of action:(1) Price differential in the wholesale market exceeding an indicative threshold of EUR 2 /MWh between Member States, regions or bidding zones;(2) Nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30 % of peak load;(3) Nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30 % of installed renewable generation.Each new interconnector shall be subject to a socioeconomic and environmental cost-benefit analysis and implemented only if the potential benefits outweigh the costsThe level of interconnection of electric networks is defined as the ratio of commercial transmission capacity to the neighbouring EU countries, excluding connections to third countries, divided by the installed power plant capacity. Finland™s electricity interconnection target for 2030 is to keep the level of interconnectivity above 15 %.According to data for 2017, the installed power plant capacity in Finland is about 17,100 MW and commercial transmission connections, excluding connections to Russia, total 3,700 MW. The level of interconnection is thereby 22 % (3,700 MW divided by 17,100 MW). When the nuclear power plant unit OL3 in Olkiluoto is completed in 2020, the generation capacity will be 18,700 MW and, correspondingly, the commercial transmission connections, excluding connections to Russia, will decrease due to technical characteristics of the power system to total 3,400 MW. In 2020, the level of interconnectivity will thus fall to 18 %. The peak load in Finland has varied between 13,400Œ15,100 MW in the period 2010Œ2018.25 The 25 https://www.fingrid.fi/globalassets/dokumentit/fi/tiedotteet/ajankohtaista/sahkojarjestelman-toiminta-talvella-2017---2018.pdf72current total transmission capacity to neighbouring EU countries is thus 25Œ28 % of the historical peak load.Fingrid Oyj (Finnish transmission system operator) and Svenska Kraftnät (Swedish transmission system operator) have signed a letter of intent concerning the construction of an alternating current connection of 800 MW between northern Finland and northern Sweden by 2025. The transmission line project is included in the EU™s Project of Common Interest list approved in spring 2018. The project has shown strong socioeconomic benefits in both countries, especially in Finland26. Commercial transmission connections to neighbouring EU countries would then be 4,200 MW and the installed power plant capacity somewhere in the order of 21,000 MW. This equals an interconnectivity level of 20 %. The predicted peak load in 2025 is in the order of 15,700 MW27. Thus, the transmission capacity is predicted to be approximately 27 % in 2025, excluding the effect of connections to Russia.The Finnish Government is fully committed to delivery of the project between Finland and Sweden. Swift delivery of the project is a key target in the development of the regional electricity markets. The importance of the project has also been acknowledged in the National Energy and Climate Strategy for 2030.The EU™s aim is to bring the level of interconnection in the Member States to at least 10 % by 2020 and at least 15 % by 2030. Finland™s interconnection capacity exceeds these targets.The price difference in electricity between Finland and the Nordic electricity market has fallen in recent years. Whereas in 2015 the average difference between Finland and the Nordic System Price in the day-ahead market was as high as EUR 8.68/MWh, it was just EUR 2.81/MWh in 2018. The price difference between Finland and Estonia has decreased fairly steadily in 2012Œ2018 and was just EUR 0.27/MWh in 2018. Table 10 shows the price differences between Finland, its neighbouring bidding zones and the Nordic System Price.26 For more information, see ENTSO-E ten years network development plan 2018, https://tyndp.entsoe.eu/tyndp2018/projects/projects/111#cba-results27 https://tem.fi/documents/1410877/2132100/S%C3%A4hk%C3%B6ntuotannon+skenaariolaskelmat+vuoteen+2050+%E2%80%93+selvitys+22.2.2019/8d83651e-9f66-07e5-4755-a2cb70585262/S% C3%A4hk%C3%B6ntuotannon+skenaariolaskelmat+vuoteen+2050+%E2%80%93+selvitys+22.2.2019.pdf73Table 10.

Key electricity and gas transmission infrastructure projects, and, where relevant, modernisation projects, that are necessary for the achievement of objectives and targets under the five dimensions of the Energy Union Strategyii. Where applicable, main infrastructure projects envisaged other than Projects of Common Interest (PCIs)In addition to the 800 MW interconnection between Finland and Sweden described in Chapter 2.4.1 above, the most important projects concerning the domestic electricity transmission infrastructure are listed in Table 11.74The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment grants permits to grid owners to build cross-border electricity interconnectors based on the network operators™ applications. The Finnish Government has long been of the view that there should be no increase in dependency on third countries for electricity imports. Thus, in the foreseeable future there will be no increases in capacity to third countries.Table 11.

The Balticconnector gas pipeline will enter commercial service on 1 January 2020. The new gas pipeline connection is needed to open up Finland™s gas market and to create an interconnected gas market of Finland and the Baltic states.28 Nordic Grid Development Plan 2017, page 9 https://energinet.dk/-/media/10ACA6E691D94E0ABC600C0B07216E7E.pdf752.4.3 Market integrationi. National objectives related to other aspects of the internal energy market such as increasing system flexibility, in particular related to the promotion of competitively determined electricity prices in line with relevant sectoral laws, market integration and coupling, aimed at increasing the tradable capacity of existing interconnectors, smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, and real-time price signals, including a timeframe for when the objectives shall be metii. Where applicable, national objectives related to the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be metiii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to ensuring that consumers participate in the energy system and benefit from self-generation and new technologies, including smart metersElectricityWell-functioning regional and European electricity markets and sufficiently strong cross-border connections are the most efficient and cost-effective way of guaranteeing competitive electricity prices and security of supply. The objective in accordance with the National Energy and Climate Strategy is therefore to develop Finland™s electricity market as part of the regional electricity markets of the Nordic countries and the Baltic states, and more widely as part of the internal electricity market in Europe. A European-wide electricity market with a common set of rules is the best way of reaching competitive electricity prices, security of supply and given incentives for flexibility in the electricity system.The Nordic electricity markets are characterised by the substantial share of hydro capacity accompanied by CHP and other thermal units, and a growing share of wind power generation. The electricity generation portfolios of the Nordic countries complement each other. The dynamics of the electricity market are affected by the new transmission capacity from Norway to Central Europe and the UK. SKM 76Predictor has estimated that the new connections will increase electricity exports to Central Europe and subsequently raise the Nordic system price by EUR 3.5 /MWh in the mid-2020s29. The effect of price fluctuation in the Central European market will also be more strongly transmitted to the Finnish electricity market.Regarding the wholesale market, the electricity market is already coupled to the Baltic market. The transmission capacity between Finland and Estonia (EstLink 1 & 2) is currently 1,000 MW. The installed net capacity of the Estonian electricity system was less than 3,000 MW in 201830, so the connection can be deemed very strong. Price levels in the Estonian and Finnish wholesale markets have greatly converged in recent years (see Chapter 2.4.1). The Baltic states already represent an integral part of the Nordic electricity market.The Nordic electricity market will be further integrated with the Central European market in coming years when the new Nordlink (NO2-DE) and North Sea Link (NO2-UK) connections are finalised in early 2020s. Higher connection capacity with Central Europe and the increasing share of intermittent renewable energy, particularly wind energy, requires strengthening the interconnector capacity also within the Nordic market area. The increased level of market integration with Central Europe is estimated to contribute to higher price volatility during the winter months in Finland, given the high prices of fuels and emissions allowances.GasConstruction of the Balticconnector gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia will enable the opening and renewal of the gas market. When this investment is completed, the derogation from the Internal Market in Article 49(1) of the Natural Gas Directive will be dropped and the gas market will be fully open to competition from the beginning of 2020. Under the new Natural Gas Market Act (maakaasumarkkinalaki 587/2017)31, price regulation of piped gas will be dropped, 29 Sähköntuotannon skenaariolaskelmat vuoteen 2050.

On 1 January 2020, Finland will join a common regional gas market area with Estonia and Latvia (FINESTLAT-gas market area). Finland also aims at joining a regional entry-exit system with Estonia and Latvia from 1 January 2022. The final objective is to create a regional gas market comprising Finland and the three Baltic states including also Lithuania. The creation of the regional gas market is being prepared between the ministries, the national regulatory authorities and gas network operators in Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.iv. National objectives with regard to ensuring electricity system adequacy, as well as for the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production, including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be metFinland will define the national target for the security of supply related to the adequacy of electric power when the methodology concerning the definition has been approved in the EU. At the moment, the target related to the adequacy of electric power has been defined indirectly through the size of power reserve described in Chapter 2.3.v. Where applicable, national objectives to protect energy consumers and improve the competitiveness of the retail energy sectorFinland does not have quantitative objectives for the protection of energy consumers and to improve the competitiveness of the energy retail market.The requirements related to consumer protection have been included in the Electricity Market Act (sähkömarkkinalaki 588/2013) and the new Natural Gas Market Act (587/2017) currently in force32. On 1 February 2019, an amendment came into force regarding a centralised information exchange database called Datahub, which will provide each party in the electricity market with all relevant information on electricity trading. Datahub will enable even more efficient and consistent transfer of data, which will be essential in the future electricity 32 http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2013/20130588; http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2017/2017058778retail market. This kind of common platform is also vital to developing other opportunities, such as services for enabling significantly better demand flexibility even at an individual consumer level. The project has already started and is expected to be completed in 2022.2.4.4 Energy povertyi. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to energy poverty including a timeframe for when the objectives are to be metOne possible definition of energy poverty is that it means difficulty in maintaining or satisfying basic needs due to high energy costs. There is not a significant number of households in Finland that would suffer from energy poverty. This is why Finland does not have national objectives related to energy poverty as mentioned in Article 3.3 (d) of the Governance Regulation. In Finland, energy poverty is in current practice discussed as part of general social policy, which secures the right of all citizens to basic necessities such as energy.In relation to point 3.3 (d) of the Governance Regulation, Finland has made three studies concerning energy poverty, in 2013, 2015 and 2018.The first study, Selvitys energiaköyhyydestä - Kotitalouksien energiakustannukset33, examines the importance of energy poverty in Finland. The report defines the concept of energy poverty and identifies to what extent and what kind of households can be affected by energy poverty. In addition, the report assesses how to respond to the challenges posed by energy poverty and how to respond to them most appropriately. According to the study, energy poverty affects a small proportion of households in Finland as part of poverty otherwise. The group at risk of energy poverty is primarily low-income households living in large non-energy-efficient dwellings outside urban areas. The report contains suggestions and recommendations for action to prevent and resolve the energy poverty problem.33 Selvitys energiaköyhyydestä - kotitalouksien energiakustannukset (Energy Poverty Survey). Ympäristöministeriön raportteja 21, 2013. https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/41424/YMra21_2013_Selvitys_energiakoyhyydesta_FINAL.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y79The study in 2015, Pienituloisen omistusasujan energiaköyhyys34, is a follow-up to the Energy Poverty Survey in 2013. This study, which combines energy poverty with questions on improving energy efficiency in housing, examines the relationship between changes in housing improvements and the way in which the heating system is changed to the risk of energy poverty. In this study, energy poverty means difficulty in maintaining or satisfying basic needs due to energy costs. The review of the survey is limited to owner-occupied dwellings. According to the survey, there are 60,000 to 100,000 households in Finland living in owner-occupied housing included in groups at risk of suffering from energy poverty (but not suffering from energy poverty at the moment). In Finland, however, energy poverty is still rare, as social security mitigates its effects. The risk of energy poverty can be reduced and energy poverty can best be prevented by developing new types of financing. Particularly interesting are the financial instruments in which investment costs are paid by generating energy cost savings and state-guaranteed loans.The latest study, ASSIST - Support Network for Household Energy Saving, in 2018 has been conducted by VaasaETT as a part of the ASSIST 2GETHER Œproject. 35According to the ASSIST-report, at present, there is already a very comprehensive social support system designed to guarantee a minimum income for all in Finland. Although there are no subsidies specifically targeted at energy poverty, subsidies that reduce housing expenditure or are targeted at meeting basic needs such as energy costs can be considered an aid to mitigate energy poverty. These subsidies include, for example, housing allowance and social support. In addition to these direct subsidies, tax credit for household expenses is also an aid to reduce energy poverty.In Finland, the consumer is protected by the obligation imposed on energy companies to limit disconnection of the electricity supply, especially in winter. Due to unpaid bills, electricity distribution can usually be disconnected five weeks after the customer has been reminded. During the winter months (October to April), the 34 Pienituloisen omistusasujan energiaköyhyys (Energy poverty of a resident™s owner with low-income).
