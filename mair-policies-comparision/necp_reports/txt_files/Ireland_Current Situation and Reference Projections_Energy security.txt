4.4. Dimension Energy Security i. Current energy mix, domestic energy resources, import dependency, including relevant risks Current Energy Mix fuel. Primary energy consumption in Ireland in 2018 was 14,653 ktoe, a 1.6% increase on the previous year. Over the period 2005  by 7.6% (0.6% per annum on average).   Figure 14: Total primary energy requirement by fuel The individual fuel growth rates, quantities and shares are shown in Table 27. Primary energy requirement peaked in 2008 and has fallen by 10.3% since then. The following are the main trends in the national fuel share:   189  Overall primary energy use grew by 1.6% in 2018  Fossil fuels accounted for 89% of all the energy used in Ireland in 2018. Demand for fossil fuels increased by 0.1% in 2018, to 13,039 ktoe, but was 15% lower than in 2005  Coal use decreased by 34% in 2018 and its share of total primary energy requirement fell to 4.9%, down from 10.3% in 2015. Since 2005, coal demand has fallen by 61% (7.1% per annum)  Peat use fell by 1.3% in 2018 and its share of overall energy use was 4.7%  Oil continues to be the dominant energy source and maintained a 49% share of total primary energy requirement in 2018. The share of oil in overall energy use peaked in 1999 at 60%. Consumption of oil, in absolute terms, increased by 3.3% in 2018, to 7,148 ktoe, but compared with 2005, oil demand in 2018 was 22% lower  Natural gas use increased in 2018 by 3.8%, to 4,480 ktoe, and its share of total primary energy requirement increased to 31%. Natural gas use was 28% higher than in 2005  Total renewable energy increased by 10.2% during 2018, to 1,471 ktoe. Hydro and wind increased by 0.4% and 16% respectively. Biomass use increased by 11% in 2018, to 410 ktoe, and other renewables fell by 2.8%, to 259 ktoe. The overall share of renewables in primary energy stood at 10.0% in 2018, up from 9.3% in 2017.  Energy from non-renewable wastes increased by 28% in 2018, to 145 ktoe, and accounted for 1% of primary energy  Ireland continued to be a net exporter of electricity in 2018, exporting just 2 ktoe, 96% less than in 2017 Table 27: Growth rates, Quantities and Shares of TPER fuels  Overall Growth % Average Annual Growth % Quantity (ktoe) Shares %  2005-2018 - - - - 2018 2005 2018 2005 2018 Fossil Fuels (Total) -14.8 -1.2 -1.8 -2.1  1.1 0.1 15,306 13,039 96.6 89.0 Coal -61.5 -7.1 -8.1 3.0  -20.2 -34.1 1,882 725 11.9 4.9 Peat -13.3 -1.1 -0.7 0.0 -3.6  -1.3  791 686 5.0 4.7 Oil -21.7  -1.9  -4.4 -1.8 2.4  3.3  9,130 7,148 57.6 48.8 Natural Gas 27.9  1.9 6.1 -4.4 5.9  3.8  3,503 4,480 22.1 30.6 Renewables (Total) 297.2  11.2 12.9 10.9 9.0 10.2  370 1,471 2.3 10.0 Hydro 10.0  0.7 -1.0 6.1 -4.9 0.4  54 60 0.3 0.4 Wind 677.0  17.1 20.4 18.5 9.5 16.1  96 743 0.6 5.1   190 Biomass 127.1  6.5 3.1 6.2 12.9 11.0 180 410 1 .1 2.8 Other Renewables 546.1 15.4 34.2 4.5 6.1 -2.8 40 259 0.3 1.8 Wastes (Non-Renewable) - - - 51.7 28.3 28.4 - 145 - 1.0 Electricity Imports (Net) -101.4 -171.8 -25.5 7.4 -134.5 -95.9 176 -2 1.1 0.0 Total -7.6 -0.6 -1.5 -1.2 1.8 1.6 15,852 14,653 - -  Domestic Energy Resources Figure 15 shows the indigenous energy fuel mix for Ireland over the period. The reduction in indigenous supply of natural gas (until 2016) is evident from Figure 15 as is the switch away from peat. Production of indigenous gas decreased by 94% over the period between 1990 and 2015 to 106 ktoe but then increased dramatically in 2016 to 2,493 ktoe. It increased again in 2017 to 2,854 ktoe. This is the highest natural gas production level ever recorded in Ireland. Production from the Corrib field is expected to cease by 2030 with the high level of production expected to taper off significantly in the next couple of years. This appears to have started in 2018, with a small reduction in production (to 2,752 ktoe). Indigenous renewable energy production increased by 258% between 2005 and 2018 to 1,326 ktoe. Indigenous production of all energy in Ireland reached the highest level ever with a new peak in 2018 of 5,040 ktoe, up from the previous peak in 2017 at 4,884 ktoe. Peat production was down since 2013 following significant production during that summer which provided favourable harvesting conditions for peat. In 2018 peat production was up 3.4% to 816 ktoe compared with the previous year.  Figure 15: Indigenous Energy Production Import Dependency   191 Figure 16 illustrates the trend in import dependency since 1990, comparing it with that for the resulting from the start of natural gas production from the Corrib gas field. Indigenous production accounted for 32% of mid-1990s import dependency had grown significantly, due to the increase in energy use together with the decline in indigenous natural gas production at Kinsale since 1995 and decreasing peat produvaried between 85% and 90% until 2016 when it fell to 69%. It fell further, to 66% in 2017, but increased to 67% in 2018. It is estimated that in 2015 the cost of all energy imports to Irel in 2016 due mainly to reduced gas imports. It ha in 2018.    Figure 16: EU and Ireland import dependency Figure 17 shows the trend for net fuel imports (imports minus exports) over the period 2005  2018. The dependence on oil, due largely to energy use in transport, is the most striking feature up until 2008. Between 2008 and 2018 net imports have fallen by 33% with oil imports falling 20%. In 2018 net imports increased by 2.3% but were still 32% below 2005 levels while oil imports were 24% below 2005. In 2018 gas imports increased by 23% to compensate for lower indigenous ouput and the closure of the Inch storage facility.  Coal imports fell by 31% in 2018 because of the reduced operation of Moneypoint electricity generating plant. In 2018, oil, gas and coal accounted for 73%, 17% and 8% of net imports respectively. Contributions to the increase in import dependency in 2018 were:   192  Natural gas imports were up 23% to 1,728 ktoe  Net oil imports were up 3.6% to 7,382 ktoe Countering these were:  Coal imports were down 32% to 830 ktoe  An 11.4% decrease in renewable energy imports (biomass and biofuels) to 141 ktoe  Net electricity exports, were down 96% to 2 ktoe  Figure 17: Imported energy by fuel Relevant Risks  Petroleum Product Availability given its import dependency and its geographical position is vulnerable to both domestic supply constraints (for example caused by severe weather) and international oil emergencies (caused by geopolitical or other factors). These risks are mitigated by the y the Oil Emergency Allocation Plan (OEAP), which may be utilised in the event of a prolonged supply constraint. In the event of a disorderly (no agreement) UK withdrawal from the EU, the British Standards Institute (BSI) is likely to continue to be a member of CEN. As a result, the UK refining industry, due to its domestic use of the relevant aligned BSI standards, is likely to continue to produce product suitable for the Irish market, and for export to the EU as a whole.   193 ii.
