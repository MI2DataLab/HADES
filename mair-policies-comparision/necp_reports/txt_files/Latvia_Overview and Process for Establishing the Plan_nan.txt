The implementation of the plan will require joint investments which will ensure a positive impact on the development and sustainability of the Latvian economy. An important result of the implementation of the plan is improvement of energy security and getting closer to energy independence, as well as to ensure that the funds used in the country are shifted from funding of imports to financing of local production. The energy policy measures included in the plan will contribute significantly to local energy production using zero-emission technologies, thus having a positive effect on energy prices while ensuring an improvement in energy efficiency for energy consumers. This is supposed to reduce public energy spending. The plan mainly includes support and promotion measures, avoiding, as far as possible, prohibition measures and avoiding measures that could impair the quality of life of citizens environmental condition, living conditions and quality of life (social situation). 1.1.2. Strategy for all dimensions of the Energy Union The plan covers objectives of all the dimensions7 of the EnU, as well as policies and measures required to reach them. Discussions on the EU structural funds available to EU Member States continue, including on the contributions from the CF for the 20212027 programming period and the scope of support. In Latvia, the allocation of the EU structural funds (ERDF, ESF and CF) for the programming period 2021-2027 is planned to be based on NDPL2027, so the source of funding referred to in the Plan for support of the programmes for which the funding is intended to be raised is indicative. 1.1.3. Main targets of the Plan The plan includes targets for all dimensions of the EnU, where many of the numerical targets are set by EU legislation, such as the GHG emissions reduction target, the target for the share of RES in energy consumption in transport, the share of advanced biofuels and biogas in energy consumption in transport, the interconnection target, whether EU legislation makes it obligatory to set targets, including specific conditions applying to the targets. Table 1 includes the main targets of the Plan, but detailed targets of each dimension of the EnU are defined in Chapter 3 of the Plan. Table 1.

Global Competitiveness Index (position in the world) - - 42 - higher than 42 The measures and principles set out in the Plan are based on full introduction and whereby creators of pollution should shoulder the costs of managing it in order to prevent harm to human health or environment. Pollution is mostly caused by the end consumer, since satisfaction of consumer demand stimulates supply, which in turn causes pollution. Consumers should therefore also be responsible for the costs of administration of pollution  containment, reduction and prevention of harm to human health or the environment. However, consumers should also have the right to accurate information on the costs relating to resource, including energy, consumer and producer, regardless of legal status or social status, is responsible for any kind of emission or pollution resulting from the consumption of the resources in question or from the production of that resource for own consumption or sale to other consumers, and is entitled to be told how those administration costs are applied and used.                                                       11 GHG emission reduction and CO2 removal target in LULUCF accounting categories in 2030 12 The target can be reached by setting an obligation for fuel suppliers, within the scope of which it is allowed to use advanced biofuel and/or biogas, which is produced from the raw materials listed in Annex IX to Directive 2018/2001, electricity obtained from RES, hydrogen obtained from RES, processed carbon fuels, as well as other biofuels or biomass fuels which are not produced from food or animal feed crops 13 Advanced biofuel & biogas should be produced from the raw materials listed in Part A of Annex IX to Directive 2018/2001, for example, animal manure, sewage sludge, straw, different waste, etc. 14  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 1.2. Overview of current policy situation  1.2.1. Context of the Latvian energy system  At EU level, the energy policy for 2050 is defined in the EC Communication Roadmap for moving to a competitive low-carbon economy in 205014. The energy policy for 2030 in its turn is defined in the EC Communication Clean Energy For All Europeans15. With regard to planning the development of Latvia the Plan is subordinated to SDSL203016 and NDPL2027.  Key reads: Changes in total consumption of energy resources, EU Changes in final energy consumption, EU Changes in total consumption of energy resources, Latvia Changes in final energy consumption, Latvia  Figure 3. Total energy sources consumption and final energy consumption changes in EU and Latvia (1990 = 1)17 Energy is one of the sectors that contributes directly to the economic growth of the country and forms a significant part of the total costs in some industries, especially manufacturing. The most important factor for industry growth has been and will continue to be the lowest possible sustainable energy price, which includes security and quality. Development of the energy sector requires significant investment, to attract which a stable and predictable investment environment is needed. At the same time, energy, including industry and transport, is one of the sectors fully affected by consumer demand, whilst the consumer is responsible for ensuring .

In final energy consumption by sector, Latvia does not differ significantly from the EU structure, the highest share in Latvia being for households and agricultural, forestry and fisheries activities.  1.2.2. Current energy and climate action policies and measures  Development of the plan and of its  background policies and measures, is governed by a number of items of EU legislation, the main ones being:                                                        18 Data source: EUROSTAT 16  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00  Regulation 2018/1999;  Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (hereinafter  Directive 2003/87/EC);  Decision No 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the effort of Member States to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to meet (hereinafter  Decision No 406/2009/EC);  Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 (hereinafter  Regulation 2018/842);  Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry in the 2030 climate and energy framework, and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 and Decision No 529/2013/EU (hereinafter  Regulation 2018/841);  Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC (hereinafter  Directive 2009/28/EC);  Directive 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (recast version)19 (hereinafter  Directive 2018/2001);  Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, amending Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC (hereinafter  Directive 2012/27/EU);  Directive (EU) 2018/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 amending Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency20 (hereinafter  Directive 2018/2002);  Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings (recast) (hereinafter  Directive 2010/31/EU); There are currently a number of policy planning documents (including informative reports) in force in Latvia related to energy and climate change mitigation issues with objectives concerning energy and climate change mitigation, as well as policies for reaching these targets. 1) SDSL2030 lays down the following objectives in the context of the plan:  to ensure energy independence of the country by increasing self-sufficiency of energy and integrating in the EU energy networks;                                                       19 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/LV/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018L2001&from=EN  20 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/LV/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018L2002&from=EN  17  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00  to be the EU leader in the preservation, increase, and sustainable use of natural capital;  to preserve the originality of Latvia  the diverse natural and cultural heritage, typical and unique landscapes. SDSL2030 includes targets for GHG emission reduction, the share of RES and energy intensity, as well as innovation goals for 2030. 2) NDPL202021 lays down the following objectives in the context of the Plan:  To ensure sustainable use of the energy resources required by the national economy by promoting the availability of a market for the resources, decrease of the energy intensity and emission intensity in certain sectors, and increase of the proportion of RES in the total consumption, while focusing on competitive energy prices.  To maintain the natural capital as the basis for sustainable economic growth and promote its sustainable use while minimising natural and human risks to the quality of the environment. NDPL2020 includes targets for the national GHG emission intensity, the share of RES, energy consumption, and energy independence, as well as agricultural, forestry, and waste management goals for 2020. 3) LTESL203022 lays down the following objective in the context of the Plan:  Competitive economy with a sustainable energy sector and increased security of energy supply. LTESL2030 includes optional and non-binding targets for the use of RES, energy and energy sources, and the share of imports for 2030. Annex 1 of the plan includes detailed information about the connection of the plan with policy planning documents of Latvia (including informative reports) and provides detailed information about their objectives in the context of the policies of the plan and the main measures for reaching these objectives. 1.2.3. Key issues of cross-border relevance  The key measures implemented in the context of the plan are related to the interconnections of the Baltic energy market, common energy market and energy security. In cross-border terms it is also important that the Baltic States coordinate the measures that influence not only the compatibility of infrastructure and electricity, but also the flow of energy sources (fossil energy sources, as well as biomass and biofuels23) between the Baltic States. In the context of carbon removal it is extremely important to establish and maintain a common (harmonised) view on decarbonisation options in the Baltic States and a common approach to implementing decarbonisation measures. However, using a common approach to implementing decarbonisation measures might be difficult due to the different situation in the Member States, especially in terms of the energy structure and the main sources of GHG emissions: Latvia has the highest share of GHG emissions from non-ETS activities                                                       21 http://polsis.mk.gov.lv/documents/4247 22 http://polsis.mk.gov.lv/documents/4849  23 biofuels mean liquid or gaseous fuel for transport produced from biomass (Articles 2(28) and (33) of Directive 2018/2001). Biofuels are considered RES, if this meets the sustainability criteria defined in the EU legislation 18  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 among the Baltic States (second highest EU ), with agriculture and transport dominating in the area of GHG emissions from non-ETS activities, while Estonia is among the top EU Member States with the lowest share of GHG emissions from non-ETS activities and the -ETS activities and their structure with the largest contribution from transport and agriculture is more similar to Latvia than Estonia. Nevertheless, transport is one of the major sources of GHG emissions from non-ETS activities in all three Baltic States. Coordinated activities should therefore be implemented to reduce emissions particularly from the transport sector.  1.2.4. Administrative structure of implementing national energy and climate policies  A Cabinet Order on the National Energy and Climate Council was approved at the meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers of 26 November 2019, setting up this council to ensure coordinated, integrated and sustainable State policy for resolution of energy and climate matters. The Council is headed by the Prime Minister, and includes 8 ministers and 24 industry representatives. Competences of sectoral ministries are laid down in ministerial statutes24, which are approved by the Cabinet of Ministers (as Cabinet regulations). Development of the policy for the use of RES, promotion of energy efficiency, as well as energy security and internal energy market is the responsibility of MoE, however, sectoral ministries also implement resource efficiency improvement promotion measures in their sectors. The policy for reduction of GHG emissions, including CO2, is drafted by MoEPRD in cooperation with MoE, MoT, MoA and other sectoral ministries, and MoEPRD coordinates implementation of this policy. The authority responsible for education and science is MoES, while MoE and MoEPRD are responsible for matters related to innovation and competitiveness. The responsibilities under the Latvian policy planning documents currently in force are set out in Annex 1 to the Plan. 1.3. Consultations and involvement of national and EU entities and their outcome  During drafting of the plan (draft and final versions), the conditions included in it (global vision, objectives, thrust and measures) were effectively discussed with the public at a number of events devoted to the and measures, along with events dedicated to the plan in general, with planning regions and municipalities, as well as representatives of sectors and non-governmental organisations. The comments and recommendations received have been evaluated and incorporated into the Plan, as far as possible, in cooperation with all the stakeholder ministries.  The draft plan was also evaluated by several non-governmental organisations. The CEE Bankwatch Network25 proposed a more ambitious use of RES and improving energy efficiency, as well as developing appropriate policies and measures to achieve these ambitions. It also proposed reviewing the measures to reduce GHG emissions in the event of waste incineration not being supported, and it is worth noting that although a gradual reduction in the final consumption of natural gas is envisaged, there is no target for gradual termination of the use of fossil heating fuel.                                                       24 https://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=207119; https://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=74746; https://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=74749; https://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=79100; https://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=228051   25 https://bankwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NECP-in-8-CEE-countries-1.pdf 19  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 A study by the Ecologic Institute and Climact for the European Climate Foundation26 ranked Latvia 11th out of the 28 EU Member States and took stock of the trend towards increased public involvement, and the draft plan also includes detailed information on policies and measures and the total Latvian GHG emissions reduction target set in the Plan for 2030. However, the minimum level of reduction of non-ETS GHG emissions for 2030 non-ETS activities, as well as the lack of information on the phase-out of energy subsidies and the termination of fossil energy use came in for criticism. The CAN Europe study27 shows that Latvia does not have a transparent and systemic RES use promotion support policy, and states that the plan contains an objective to use non-fossil gas, whilst simultaneously failing to include a de goal for phasing phase out fossil gas or analysing its potential and what this means for investments in terms of infrastructure (storage and transportation). 1.3.1. Involvement of the Saeima and Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia  On 26 June 2018, CM approved an informative report on drafting the National Energy and Climate Plan28, which set out the basic components and timeframe of the plant, along with the principles governing its development and responsibilities for preparing  information. The Plan drafting coordinators are MoE and MoEPRD, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, MoF, MoES, MoW, MoT, MoA and CSCC are also involved. The submission of the draft Plan to the EC was approved by the Cabinet at its meeting of 18 December 2018 (meeting minutes No.60 §96). In accordance with the Latvian development planning system, the draft plan needs to be announced at the Meeting of the State Secretaries and approved by the Cabinet. In 2019, the draft plan was reviewed in several commissions of the Parliament of the Republic of Latvia  the Saeima Commission for Sustainable Development and the Saeima Commission for European Affairs. The Saeima Commission for European Affairs proposed to primarily develop tax burden reduction solutions for residents who have taken energy efficiency improvement measures and who promote self-consumption, and it also asked to submit specific and detailed solutions on the proposed increase in taxes, if any, and an opinion was provided. Energy efficiency and competitive pricing for energy sources, as well as the need to prevent legislative obstacles to the development of off-shore wind parks, have been mentioned as priorities.  Latvia should also support the ESCO system more actively and include in the Plan conditions on how to reduce the high dependency on Russian gas supplies, which can be achieved through diversification of natural gas supply sources, as well as through the development of new interstate connections. The Saeima Commission for Sustainable Development was of the opinion that the RES targets set by Latvia could not be achieved in the light of the decisions adopted with regard to the abolition of the MPC system, and proposed including in the plan specific conditions for achieving the Latvian RES targets without the existing support mechanisms (by developing other types of RES), and including the impact assessment for these measures, it also being pointed out that the draft plan did not clearly define the objectives with regard to ensuring the competitiveness of electricity prices, a proposal also being made to include a definition of price competitiveness and to assess the impact of all proposed measures on electricity prices throughout the entire period of the Plan.                                                       26 https://europeanclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Planning-for-Net-Zero.-Assessing-the-draft-NECPs.pdf  27 http://www.caneurope.org/docman/climate-energy-targets/3477-time-to-pick-up-the-pace-insights-into-the-draft-national-energy-and-climate-plans/file  28 No.30 §50 of 26 June 2018) 20  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 1.3.2. Involvement of local and regional authorities   In 2018, active cooperation was ensured with the Riga planning region within the scope of -TRACK-50). Similarly, the topical issues regarding the development of the Plan and the involvement of local governments required for fulfilling the conditions to be included in the Plan was discussed with the representatives of planning regions of Latvia. The conditions, action lines and measures included in the Plan were presented in the Latvian Association of Local and Regional Governments, at the meeting of partners of the Co2mmunity project of the Interreg Baltic Sea Region Programme 2014-2020 of the Riga planning regio 1.3.3. Consultations with stakeholders, social partners, engagement of civil society  On 31 August 2018 and on 31 October 2018, the details of drafting of the Plan were presented to the Energy Committee of the National Economy Council established by the Ministry of Economics29. In the course of 2018, there were also consultations with undertakings and sectoral associations from different sectors on the measures for the achievement of the targets proposed in the draft plan, where overall no critical objections against the measures were received from representatives of sectors, while the proposed improvements in measures and proposals for additional measures were taken into account as far as possible. In 2018, the draft pChallenges of the Nordic and Baltic States. M The Ministry of Economics organised a major conference for a broader, namely the National Energy and Climate Plan 20212030: Energy Development and Climate Change Mitigation on 26 November 2018 (with about 100 participants), where discussions focused on all the dimensions of the plan and where all the participants had the opportunity to make suggestions, express opinions, and comment on the issues. Presentations and the video recording from the conference is available on the Web page of the Ministry of Economics30. The first version of the plan was published on the Web page of the Ministry of Economics on 17 September 2018 to ensure public participation. The second version of the plan was published on the Web page of the Ministry of Economics on 5 November 2018. In 2019, extensive information activities on the updated draft plan continued without generally any critical position regarding the direction of the measures included in the Plan, including by presenting the Plan to the Latvian Association of Local and Regional Governments, the Agricultural Organization Cooperation Council, in the panel discussion of   Updated versions of each chapter of the plan were published on the website of the Ministry of Economics in June and September 2019, giving the public sufficient time to prepare and                                                       29 The Energy Committee of the National Economy Council was established according to Sections 6.11, 7.2, and 17 of the e National Economy Council of the Ministry of Economics No 1-7-32 of 9 November 2012 30 https://em.gov.lv/lv/par_ministriju/notikumu_kalendars/21866-konference-nacionalais-energetikas-un-klimata-plans-2021-2030gadam-energetikas-attistiba-un-klimata-parmainu-mazinasana  21  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 submit their opinions. Members of the pubic were able to submit their opinions until 20 October 2019.  A conference was also held in 2019 to present the plan more widely. The opinions of members of the public have been summarised and published on the website of the Ministry of Economics31, where taken on board in the plan. 1.3.4. Consultations with other Member States  Latvia had its main discussions with regard to the preparation of the plan and definition of the measures included in the plan with other Baltic countries and Baltic Sea countries. At the Meeting of the Baltic Ministers for the Environment on 2324 May 2018, ministers and experts shared ideas and experience about the development of the plan and the conditions for decarbonisation for the purposes of climate change mitigation to be included in the plan. On 30 October 2019, at the Meeting of the Baltic Ministers for Environment, representatives of delegations of the three countries shared their experiences in the drafting of the plan, and during discussions participants also pondered long-term strategies for the reduction of GHG emissions and potential targets for progress towards climate neutrality in 2050. During 2018, energy matters were discussed within the Baltic Council of MinistCommittee of Senior Energy Officials, where experts discussed issues relating to cross-border cooperation in the energy sector and exchanged opinions on the conditions for future regional cooperation during the drafting of the plan and also within the framework of the implementation of the plan in order to discuss regional consultations of the plan and future cooperation opportunities within the framework of the dimensions covered by the plan, and to discuss specific measures included in the plan whose implementation had a regional impact. Several times during 2019 (for example, on 6 February, 18 April, 29 August, 30 October), Latvian, Lithuanian and Estonian experts exchanged opinions on updating the plan and the action lines and measures included therein within the scope of the Baltic also met several times to discuss possible intergovernmental measures in the field of RES, such as wind energy development or transport energy matters.  1.3.5. Iterative process with the EC  Latvia submitted the draft plan to the EC on 28 December 2018. In January 2019, Latvian the draft plan and possible ways of improving it, which Latvia has fully taken into account. Latvian experts also work together with EC experts on policies and measures needed to meet the RES and energy efficiency targets. On 18 June 2019, the EC published the Commission recommendations on the draft integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of Latvia covering the period 2021-2030 (C (2019) 4414, {SWD (2019) 265 final}). On 27 November 2019, Latvia published a justification for taking into account the EC recommendations32. The final version of the plan submitted by Latvia will be evaluated by the EC, taking into account Article 13 of Regulation 2018/1999, in particular as regards the adequacy of the                                                       31 https://em.gov.lv/lv/nozares_politika/nacionalais_energetikas_un_klimata_plans/ 32 https://em.gov.lv/lv/nozares_politika/nacionalais_energetikas_un_klimata_plans/ 22  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 proposed contribution to the achievement of the EU objectives and in order to assess whether the EC recommendations have been taken into account. 1.4. Regional cooperation in preparing the plan  1.4.1. Regional cooperation in preparing the plan Latvia participates in a variety of regional cooperation formats in the field of climate and energy (in the context of the Paris Agreement and the climate and energy policy), including:  The Baltic Assembly33;  summit meetings of Prime Ministers of Baltic States;  the Baltic Council of Ministers (BCM);  EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR) and Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP);  The Nordic Energy Research programme. Although intensive coordination in energy policy matters in the Baltic States takes place at the level of senior officials of BCM, wider regional cooperation is also linked to countries such as Finland, Sweden, Poland, Denmark and Germany. In the EU context, regional cooperation takes place in the format of BEMIP, covering infrastructure planning and helping to increase and make efficient use of financial resources, including the Connecting Europe Facility, which supports cross-border energy projects, thus further improving cooperation in the Baltic Sea region. A number of projects are being implemented to improve the security of electricity and gas supply in the Baltic region and to ensure efficient market development. The most important regional project is the synchronisation of the Baltic electricity grid with the European electricity grid. In the meantime, there is a number of other important projects to ensure the efficient functioning Underground Gas Storage Facility (hereinafter   The Baltic States discussed with each other the preparation of their plans within the framework of the BCM. Several meetings of senior officials took place in the second half of 2018 and in 2019 with regard to the plan as a whole and with regard to the possible policy measures that could be implemented jointly:  Meeting of the Committee of Senior Environmental Officials in Vilnius on 26.04.2018, introduction of climate measures;  BMC meeting of Environmental Ministers in Vilnius on 23-24.05.2018, introduction of climate measures;  Nordic and Baltic Energy Conference on 29 September 2018;  BCM Meeting of Senior Energy Officials on 30.10.2018 and 29.08.2019;  Nordic and Baltic Energy Conference on 2425 October 2019. Regional consultations identified regional opportunities for cooperation in the field of RES and their technologies, particularly as regards possible joint development of offshore WPPs, taking into account maritime spatial planning considerations, which allow joint projects to be                                                       33 cooperation between parliaments of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania 23  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 developed on the Latvian-Estonian border and on the Latvian-Lithuanian border. The Baltic States have included regional offshore wind parks with a maximum capacity of 800 MW in the list of policies and measures to be implemented. The study of the wind energy potential of the Baltic Sea estimates that the total offshore wind power capacity identified in the Baltic Sea34 exceeds 93 GW and that the Baltic Sea has a potential of 187 wind power units, with a capacity of 500 MW each, including respectively:  Estonia: 14 wind parks with a capacity of 7 GW and annual energy production of 26 TWh  Latvia: 29 wind parks with a capacity of 15.5 GW and annual energy production of 49.2 TWh  Lithuania: 9 wind parks with a capacity of 4.5 GW and annual energy production of 15.5 TWh. 1.4.2. Regional cooperation in implementing the plan Presently, regional cooperation is implemented with regard to the regional gas market, synchronisation with the European continental electricity grid, electricity and gas interconnection projects, as well as . Regional cooperation on the implementation of the Rail Baltic project and the development of the EV charging network, which is carried out in all EU Member States in the transport sector. Cooperation with other countries is already in place to ensure the convenient use of EV charging networks for foreign representatives within the EU. Consequently, there are prerequisites for the possibility of moving between EU Member States using EVs. Similarly, regional cooperation to reduce agricultural GHG emissions is carried out in accordance with Directive 91/676/EEC35 (on nitrogen emissions) or the Action Plan to Reduce Air Pollution (on ammonia emissions). The Baltic States agreed that regional cooperation could be extended to the areas of energy efficiency and the development of RES, which are particularly relevant to the transport sector, including:  biomethane production and market development;  coordination with regard to biofuel requirements (admixture of biofuels and tax-related matters);  coordination regarding possible road tolls (in Latvia  road use tolls) or road tolls for trucks. In addition, potential regional cooperation could be extended to include the cooperation of national EV charging networks at the Baltic level and to include agricultural and forestry sectors (for example, amelioration, soil quality measures, etc.), taking into account the potential transboundary impacts of agricultural, forestry or fisheries activities. The planning and implementation of the long-term energy and climate policy and measures (by 2030 or 2050)  could be improved or implemented in the required quality, with the possibility of sharing experience and knowledge with other EU Member States, particularly in the field of reduction of carbon emissions, and promoting energy efficiency, as this could help Latvia to choose the most appropriate instruments and actions for the achievement of specific objectives.                                                       34 https://op.europa.eu/en/publication/--cd30-11e9-992f-01 aa75ed71a1/language-en 35 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/LV/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31991L0676&from=LV  24  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 In order to plan and implement measures in the field of RES, energy efficiency and climate, the Baltic States will continue to cooperate within different working groups and measures, namely:  Cooperation of the Baltic region in the field of security initiated by TSOs of the Baltic States (Elering, AST, Litgrid);  BRELL (Belarus, Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) system;  Regional Gas Market Coordination Group and UAB GET Baltic;  Activities of the International Energy Agency (Estonia is an IEA member, Lithuania is the IEA accession country);  Nordic Energy Research Programme for Baltic Science Cooperation projects and the exchange of PhDs.
