105  3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 3.1. Dimension decarbonisation 3.1.1. GHG emissions and removals 3.1.1.1. i. Policies and measures to achieve the national target  Policies to reduce emissions from conventional power plants will contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the coming period. The most important policy measure relevant to electricity production concerns import and utilisation of natural gas for electricity production. Promoting RES is a top policy priority to move towards the decarbonisation of the economy. All measures for the penetration of RES in electricity generation, in heating, cooling and in transport contribute to this objective. In addition, reduction of the quantities of biodegradable waste in solid waste treatment facilities through separate collection, not only for electricity and thermal energy generation (e.g. biogas production), but also for complementary actions such as recycling. The above measures, which have already been launched in the framework of the National Solid Waste Management Plan, will be intensified in the period 2021-2030, as National Planning is currently being revised under the new package of Directives on waste. The improvement of energy efficiency in all sectors has been examined in the framework of the energy efficiency first principle. The policies and measures set for improving energy efficiency contribute significantly to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Transport is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and to the improvement of energy efficiency and, therefore, calls for interventions that will make a substantial contribution towards the sustainability of the sector. To this end, policy measures in the transport sector contribute to promoting RES and improving energy efficiency. Examples include the promotion of electrification in road through the development of the necessary infrastructure. Other examples of measures are the development of public transport, the promotion of alternative fuels, the promotion of low emission busses and vehicles and the implementation of the sustainable urban mobility plans. Moreover, the promotion of biofuels and the use of electricity will contribute to reducing emissions in the transport sector.  A combination of policy measures additional to the current/existing will be implemented to reduce fluorinated gases, focusing on the implementation of a proper recovery system for F-gases in equipment. The revised Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) introduces specific measures in the context of Green Direct Aid by promoting sustainable food production, sustainable farm management and environmentally and climate-friendly practices and methods. The measures that will be 106  implemented aim at preventing desertification, improving water management, reducing the intensity of natural resources, optimising the use of agricultural land, reducing the use of fertilisers and improving animal waste management.  Furthermore, the Rural Development Programme will promote a more intensified implementation of the forestry measure, which will also increase the absorption from the emissions/absorption balance cannot be estimated. Table 3.1 summarises the policies foreseen for reducing greenhouse gas emissions as detailed in the following sections.

A summary of how the existing measures change is presented in the table below. Table 3.2: Planned policies and measures for sectors other than energy.

LULUCF The Department of Forests is implementing a plan to increase forest tree production from its nurseries for planting in now non-forested lands. and is directed towards public or private organizations such as municipalities, churches, schools, NGOS and firms who wish to forest public or privately owned lands and who will agree to be responsible to provide the funds and care (i.e. water) of these areas for a minimum of three years. The Department of Forests, after evaluating the applications, will be providing the trees for free, taking into account the area of the plot and the specificities of the location, i.e. elevation. The plants supplied will be selected from a specific list of mostly indigenous, non-invasive species that are suited to the climatic conditions of Cyprus such as: Pinus brutia, Cupressus semperivines, Quercus spp., Juniperus spp., Tamarix spp., Laurus nobilis, Ceratonia silique, Myrtus nobilis, Nerium oleander and Rosmarinus officinalis. The scheme starts from around 70,000 trees in 2020 and is planned to reach 300,000 trees planted per year in 2030. Transport The shift of modal share from car trips to sustainable modes of transport, through the policies and measures that are included in the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP) and the National Transport Strategy (NTS) is taken into consideration for the purpose of the PPM scenario. The Limassol SUMP was completed in June 2019 and the Larnaca SUMP is expected to be completed in March 2020. Furthermore, the remaining cities in Cyprus are planning to start preparing their own SUMPs within 2020.  SUMPs include costed policies and measures which scientifically prove (via world leading traffic prediction software) that a specific modal shift from car trips to sustainable modes of transport can be achieved. This group of measures include significantly improved bus services (routes, frequency, hours of operation), upgrading of infrastructure for pedestrians/ cyclists / public transport, development, implementation of a holistic parking policy, implementation of high-quality public transport corridors and essentially a group of targeted measures that promote the use of sustainable modes of transport and discourage the use of car trips. The modal share of cars in Cyprus is currently over 90% and based on the plans and studies that have already been completed; a modal share of 75% car, 13% public transport, 12% walking/ cycling can be achieved and is set as a national target.  Based on the plans and studies that have already been completed, the cost of implementing this action is es.4 billion and includes both capital and operational costs for the 2020-2030 period. It is worth noting that part of this cost is already included each year in the budget of the relevant authorities, while some of this cost can also be sourced from European funding as well as private funding.  108  Another measure is the promotion of the purchase and use of vehicles with low or zero emission takes into consideration the harmonisation and implementation of European Directives (e.g. Cleans Vehicle Directive) for the purchase of new vehicles both for the private and public sector. Based on these parameters, the impact assessment has estimated that approximately 11% of the passenger car fleet could be electric and 9% could be hybrid until 2030.  In addition to the results of the impact assessment, this action also includes further incentives for the purchase and use of low/zero emission vehicles including additional old vehicle scrapping schemes, further financial incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles and further amendment of the Motor Vehicles and Road Traffic Law (Law 100(I)/2013) for revision of the vehicle taxes and annual circulation taxes. Based on these additional measures, the target for the penetration of electric vehicles is set at 20% as a proportion of the total vehicle fleet. The emission reduction impact of this higher target is not included in the latest impact assessment and its cost is based on the current old vehicle scraping scheme/ financial incentives but proposed to be implemented on an annual basis with a  million every year. This measure is expected to be more effective after 2025 when the market conditions are expected to be more favourable for the purchase and use of electric vehicles. Furthermore, the promotion of the purchase and use of low/zero emission buses is based on the incorporation of the new public transport contracts terms, the harmonization/ implementation of European Directives (etc. Cleans Vehicle Directive) for the purchase of new buses for the private/public sector and the incentives for the use of low/zero emission tourist buses are expected to contribute towards the reduction of emissions from transport. The cost of vehicles and cost of infrastructure will be sourced mainly from private sources. Based on these parameters, the impact assessment has estimated that approximately 7% of the bus fleet could be electric until 2030. This measure is expected to be more effective after 2025 when the market conditions are expected to be more favourable for the purchase and use of electric buses.  Finally, extensive tree planting of up to 650,000 trees along the urban road network and up to 350,000 trees along the interurban road network is an ambitious measure currently studied by the Ministry of transport million and includes the planting cost and infrastructure changes required along the urban network, but it does not include the maintenance and watering costs. The positive impacts for this measure include C02 absorption, aesthetic upgrading, shading, lowering temperatures and better conditions for cycling and walking that could have a significant impact in the use of sustainable modes of transport. It is noted that the effects of this measure are long term, due to the amount of years required for a tree to reach a significant size and for the benefits mentioned above to be effective. 3.1.1.2. Achieving the national target of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions The goal of the National Energy and Climate Plan is to achieve a 24% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2005.  The greenhouse gas emission reduction target for Cyprus in accordance with Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2018/842 is 24% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared 109  to 2005. The expected annual emission allowances for the years from 2021 to 2030 was calculated taking into account the relevant provisions of the Regulation, and is presented in Table 3.3. Table 3.3: Expected annual allocation of allowances for the years 2021-2030 for Cyprus  2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Allowances (kt CO2 eq.) 4190 4085 3979 3874 3769 3663 3558 3453 3347 3242 Note: The average 2016-2018 emissions were estimated at 4190 kt CO2 eq., while non-ETS emissions in 2005 based on the most recent greenhouse gas inventory report (November 2019) were 4265 kt CO2 eq. The expected GHG emissions for Cyprus for the period 2021 to 2030 for the non-ETS sectors according to WEM and PPM scenarios are presented in Table 3.4 and Figure 3.1. Table 3.4: Expected GHG emissions for the period 2021 to 2030 for WEM and PPM  2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 WEM emissions (kt CO2 eq.) 3995 3983 3970 3964 3959 3954 3941 3926 3880 3829 PPM emissions (kt CO2 eq.) 3920 3878 3836 3801 3761 3714 3635 3556 3477 3374   Figure 3.1: Projected evolution of GHG emissions of non-ETS sectors according to the WEM and PPM scenarios According to the projection of GHG emissions, it appears that during the period 2021-2030, Cyprus will have in some years a small surplus and in some years a small deficit in terms of the annual allowances that are expected to be allocated. Table 3.5 presents the relative annual and total deficits / surpluses. 050010001500200025003000350040004500500020172018201920202021202220232024202520262027202820292030kt CO2 eq.

Additional measures under examination to achieve the reduction target of -24% are: - Fiscally neutral green tax reform  expected to be ready in 2020 for gradual implementation to start in 2021. No details are yet available to be included in the planned measures. - Additional reductions in emissions from the implementation of measures to be included in the Common Agricultural Policy - Further reductions in emissions from industries through the support scheme (expected to reach 15%). - Design of nature based solutions for the increase of CO2 absorption (e.g. promotion of green roofs, increase of private forests, Increase of urban public green spaces, improvement of urban green spaces) - Additional shift of modal share from car trips to sustainable modes of transport. The modal share for cars in Cyprus is currently over 90% and with the effects of the proposed tax reform, a modal share of 68% car, 20% public transport, 12% walking/ cycling can be achieved and is set as a national target. Potential revenues from the tax reform can also be used to finance part of the proposed measures.  - Higher penetration of vehicles and buses with low or zero emissions based on the effects of the proposed tax reform. Possible revenues from the tax reform can also be used to finance part of the proposed measures.  - Further tree planting along the urban and suburban network for a total of 2 million trees. Potential revenues from the tax reform can also be used to finance the proposed measure. - Strengthen the involvement of local authorities 111  - Replacing of oil-fired boilers with Heat-pumps and further study the district heating and cooling network 3.1.1.3. ii. Where relevant, regional cooperation in this area Cyprus Government Initiative Recent studies from prominent institutions (e.g. the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the World Meteorological Organization) have classified the Eastern Mediterranean -vulnerability to climate change impacts. The Cyprus Government Initiative builds upon the work that led to the International Conference held in Cyprus, in May 2018, which focused on organized by the Cyprus Institute and placed under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Cyprus, drew international attention, attended by eminent scientists and policy makers (e.g. L. Fabius, P. Taalas, J. Sachs et al.) from thirty countries as well as leaders of global stature. The principal conclusion of the Conference was that regional concerted action is urgently needed. It is noteworthy that all EMME countries have underlined their serious concerns about regional and national climate change impacts and expressed their willingness to comply with the Paris Agreement.  3.1.1.4. iii. Financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds As already mentioned, a significant part of the funding for the implementation of the proposed measures, especially in the areas of waste, rural development and forestry, comes from European Union resources and involves infrastructures and programmes that are either implemented within the current (2014-2020) programming period, or will be planned for the coming (2021-2027) programming period through the corresponding NSRF and Rural Development Programme. 3.1.2. Renewable energy 3.1.2.1. i. Policies and measures to achieve the national contribution to the binding 2030 Union target for renewable energy and trajectories as referred to in point (a)(2) Article 4, and, where applicable or available, the elements referred to in point 2.1.2 of this Annex, including sector- and technology-specific measures Over the last 15 years, the Cyprus Government has developed various support schemes with incentives and soft measures in order to further support the Renewable Energy Sources penetration, especially in the electricity sector. This experience and lessons learned from previous support schemes (over 30 different support schemes)43, were used by MECI, to develop its new policy and measures for the period 2021-2030.                                                            43 Renewable energy policy database and support  RES-LEGAL EUROPE National profile: Cyprus 112  A concise list of the planned measures is provided in the Appendix 4 and deliverable of the Impact Assessment Study44, where the most important of them are listed in Table 3.6.

Currently the Net-metering category is applied for small scale photovoltaic systems with capacity up to 10KW, for all consumers (residential and non-residential). The scope of the net-metering is to provide the option to residential and small commercial consumers to cover all or part of their electricity consumption from a consumption. Consumers pay only for the difference between the energy consumed and energy produced (net electricity used) plus a cost that reflects the cost of the electricity grid to support continuous supply and taxes (VAT, RES levy). The above scheme is expected to continue, with some modifications in the near future in order to enhance better the self-consumption for small systems. For household owners and for those having a building permit prior of 2017, there is a support scheme in operation for the period 2018-2020. The grant support was set at a level of 250 Euro/kW installed with a maximum possible grant per system of 1,000 Euro.  In addition, if the above measure is combined with rood insulation there is a total grand of 3,000 Euros, where the grand for PV itself is increased to 300 Euro/kW. Furthermore, a support scheme for vulnerable consumes is in place since 2013 with the financial grant of  Self-consumption / Net billing With Self-consumption and Net-billing schemes, PV generated energy has to be self-consumed within the same 20-min time period it was generated in. If local energy demand exceeds PV production, energy is imported from the grid. With Self-consumption scheme, excess PV generation is exported to the grid without any economic compensation nor any 114  additional fee. A compensation for excess energy is foreseen by the Net-Billing scheme. The size of these systems is basically unlimited (up to 10MW). This support scheme is the most effective for both industrial and commercial consumers, since the self-consumption is almost excluded for all the taxes for the energy that is self-consumed.  Consumers are billed on energy consumed from the grid at the retail electricity price and they inject back into the grid. The avoidance cost is intended to reflect the savings offered to the country by avoiding the generation of fossil-fuel based energy. If the PV system owner generates more power than they consume during any two-month period, the avoidance cost credit is rolled over into subsequent billing periods and is likely to be cancelled out over the course of each year because of the constraints applied to the generation capacity of eligible arrays. In the unlikely instance of a system owner exporting more power to the grid than they consume, the excess does not secure any credit. Prosumers who qualify for net billing are taxed on all the energy they consume, whether generated on-site or imported from the grid, and also pay a fee for using the network. There was a debate during the public consultation regarding the self-consumption fee, which is something that needs to be examined in more detail, taking into account the results of the study contacted from JRC, under the Administrative arrangement of SRSS/C2017/077. The study concluded that the existing framework for network charges has to change moving towards a usage-based capacity charging system.  In the next paragraphs two tools are presented that can indirectly assist in the further penetration of RES. These tools were the result of recommendations from an IRENA45 and a JRC46 study. Development of a specific Software tool to perform technical and economical evaluations of  In order to enhance the above schemes (net-metering, net-billing and self-consumption), a software tool was developed47 and provided free of charge to both energy consultants and to the end users. With this tool, the end user can have an indication of what size system to install that will make economic sense, and can also evaluate the offer received from various installers. The advance mode of the software tool, will give some more insights to the consultants in order to advice better the pronsumers in other sectors as well (Energy efficiency, storage, etc.).                                                             45 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/EnergySe.nsf/C1028A7B5996CA7DC22580E2002621E3/$file/ IRENA%20REPORT%202030_Jan_2015.pdf 46 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/EnergySe.nsf/C1028A7B5996CA7DC22580E2002621E3/$file/ Cyprus_RESGRID_summary_v16.pdf 47 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/EnergySe.nsf/All/312EB6608C682704C22582CF0025445D? OpenDocument 115  The operation of the whole system can be simulated by making energy balance calculations in each time step (interval) of the year. For each time step, the SW tool compares the electricity demand to the energy that the system can supply in that time step, and calculates the flow of energy to and from each component of the system and the corresponding cash flows. For systems that include batteries, SW tool will determine in each time step whether to charge or discharge the batteries. The tool estimates also the cost of installing and operating the system over the lifetime of the project, defined by the user as an input. Economic and Financial calculations account for costs such as initial investment, replacement, operation and maintenance, network fees and tariffs, RES incentive schemes etc.  Figure 3.2: Cost-optimization Software tool specific designed for Support schemes of Cyprus.  New Forecasting Tool that will help further the penetration for RES At a basic level Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) forecasting aims to predict the generation of renewable energy technologies with variable outputs that are strongly affected by weather (wind, sunshine, etc.). VRE forecasting was first developed for use by the wind power industry but has been adapted to provide forecasts for solar technologies including PV and CSP. Modern VRE forecasting has achieved a high level of accuracy through a combination of models and analysis tools that use historic and real-time weather observations along with characteristics and real-time generation of VRE assets to predict VRE power generation. VRE generation can be forecast across numerous different time scales, from minutes to hours to days and across various system scales, from single wind turbines to PV panels to CSP units up to regional systems with gigawatts of generation capacity. 116  Due to the isolation of the island and the various weather phenomena in Cyprus, deterministic numerical weather prediction (NWP) model forecast can provide useful information for decision-making.  MECI has requested a Technical Assistance, through SRSS (SRSS/S2017/048), in order to improve and correlate all the existing forecasting models in an effort to create a new weather to energy model tool for RES that will participate to the market and also for the Transmission System Operator for the smoother penetration of Renewables. One important aspect that was identified and examined, is the dust forecast prediction, which occurs vary often in the Area of Cyprus. The study was performed by RSE (Italy) and there were several stakeholders involved (Department of Metereological Service, Department of Energy, Inspection and Labor, Transmission System Operator, Distribution System Operator and one research Center in Cyprus, Cyprus Institute).  Forecasting tool, aims to provide an accurate prediction of when and how much power VRE assets will generate at a given time in the following hours (i.e. up to 4-6 hours), along with an associated probability. This information will support TSO in reducing VRE integration costs and assists utilities and independent power producers (IPP) in more efficient operation of VRE assets, which increases revenue and makes VRE more attractive to investors as it was highlighted in IRENA study. In general forecasting (and nowcasting48) will help to increase the share of VRE generation that can be safely and economically integrated into an electricity grid. By evaluating, with high accuracy, the future production from the non-programmable renewable plants and the knowledge at least one day in advance of the generation profile from renewable energy sources (RES) enables to improve the reserve calculation, the grid management and the competitiveness on the energy market, in addition to a better plan of the plants maintenance. The deliverables of the study and the tool itself were presented and provided to the Transmission and Distribution System Operators in an effort to enhance the existing forecasting tools. Alternative fuels  Biofuels in transport Charging points and infrastructures for electric vehicles have been installed in public buildings and in public roads. There are currently 18 double charging stations in Cyprus: 6 charging stations in Nicosia, 5 in Limassol, 2 in Larnaca, 2 in Ammochostos and 3 in Paphos. Additionally, the Department of Electromechanical Services is proceeding to the installation of 10 fast charging stations in highways and public roads. These numbers are expected to grow as the electric vehicles are increasing, the expectation is that the registration of electric cars will increase considerably after the year of 2024-2025. New electric car sales are expected to comprise the major vehicles on the road by 2030, since Cyprus has end to end distance of less than 350 km. This means that with the autonomy that the new cars are                                                            48 Nowcasting: a continuous update of the generation forecast during the day, devoted to gain a more accurate profile in the next few hours, brings benefits for grid and reserve management and for participating in intra-day market 117  having with 64kWh-80kWh batteries, they can cover a distance over 500km. On top of that, other support schemes that will be put in place, i.e. net-metering (up to 2kW) for car charging can also help reducing the cost of electricity charging significantly.  Regarding biofuels more details are listed in section 2.1.2 (iii) and 4.2.2(i).  RES in buildings Minimum energy performance requirements for new buildings foresee a mandatory minimum level of energy consumption to be covered by RES. Obligatory installation of RES in new buildings has been introduced since 2010, but it has been gradually tightened up in order to meet by 31st of December, 2020 NZEB requirements (for more details see paragraph 4.3(iv)). According to the Order 1/2014 of the Minister of Interior, incentives are provided regarding the increased RES in certain types of developments. These incentives associated with increased building ratio (5%) and in some cases a minimum amount of RES is required for the application of other incentives, under the Development Plans. The regulation is associated with the installation of PV and solar systems in new or existing developments (sizeable composite use developments, tall buildings, Industries etc.). All developments covered by the Order must meet the minimum renewable energy use requirements in conjunction with the relevant energy efficiency requirements of the development. These incentives are currently under re-examination by the Town Planning and Housing Department in association with the Energy Service, based on the new minimum energy performance criteria in building that are set by the new Directive. 3.1.2.2. ii. Where relevant, specific measures for regional cooperation, as well as, as an option, the estimated excess production of energy from renewable sources which could be transferred to other Member States in order to achieve the national contribution and trajectories referred to in point 2.1.2 Cyprus, in the PPM scenario (without Euroasia Interconnector) is remaining isolated with the relevant consequences as highlighted throughout this report.  As illustrated in Appendix 2, the impact of the EuroAsia interconnector on the electricity supply outlook is substantial. It enables further investments on renewable energy technologies and increases the share of RES-E considerably, turning Cyprus into a net exporter of electricity by 2030. The key differences between the two PPM scenario alternatives in the electricity supply sector are shown in Table 3.1.2. In the absence of an interconnector, an additional CCGT unit must be installed in 2024 to supply low-cost electricity and provide flexibility that would otherwise be offered by the interconnector. The lack of electricity trade potential reduces the installed capacity of solar PV drastically, as a difference of nearly 880 MW is observed between the two scenarios in 2030. In turn, the lower deployment of variable renewable energy technologies eliminates the necessity for the development of the 130 MW pumped hydro facility (or other similar storage infrastructure) before 2030. 118  In terms of generation, fossil-fired generation is higher by 270 GWh, while renewable electricity generation is lower by 1,420 GWh in 2030; most of this volume of electricity is destined for electricity exports in the PPM scenario with interconnector development. As a result, the share of renewable electricity generation is restricted to 30% in this scenario, instead of 51%. The increased generation from fossil fuels results in an increase in GHG emissions of 140 kt CO2 eq. in 2030. Table 3.7: Installed Capacity difference (MW) between the PPM without interconnector and the PPM with interconnector scenarios.  2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 New CCGT (MW) 216 216 216 216 216 216 216 Solar PV (MW) 0 0 0 -280 -557 -707 -876 Pumped Hydro (MW) 0 0 0 -130 -130 -130 -130 Lack of interconnector development has milder impacts in the outlook of road transport. Due to the reduced RES-E share, in order to achieve the renewable energy target of 14% in the transport sector, the fleet of battery electric vehicles increases by approximately 3.200 units by 2030. This leads to a small reduction in GHG emissions in this sector, amounting to 15 kt CO2 eq. in 2030. In this scenario, the renewable energy share in the total final energy demand reaches 22,9% in 2030, instead of the relevant 23% target. Additionally, the macroeconomic analysis carried out (Chapter 5) shows that this case will lead to slightly lower positive effects on GDP and employment, in comparison to the PPM scenario, due to the reduced investments in power generation if the interconnector is not built.  Finally, in case Cyprus and Greece will be interconnected, there will be a net export opportunity for Cyprus in the range of 92 ktoe in 2030 with the trend to be further increased up to 2040 to 179 ktoe of export electricity. This energy could potentially transferred to other MS based on the Article 8 of the RES Directive. 3.1.2.3. iii. Specific measures on financial support, where applicable, including Union support and the use of Union funds, for the promotion of the production and use of energy from renewable sources in electricity, heating and cooling, and transport EU Funding As far as it concerns EU Funds, Cyprus has already used several Funds for RES projects. Such Funds include the NER300 support program and the Structural and Cohesion Funds 2014-2020. Some projects will be implemented during the period of 2020-2022. The total  From the Structural and Cohesion Funds the RES Technologies that were supported directly were: Heat-pumps, Solar Water heaters for hot water use, while indirectly, the RES Technologies supported were the Photovoltaics for own consumption, through net-metering Scheme (i.e. additional money allocation was given to Energy Efficiency measures if the building was installing RES without any subsidy). 119  RES and Energy Efficiency National Fund from 2004 to 2019 to finance and promote both renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency measures.  based on their energy consumption. The fee was varying over the time from 0,13 eurocent per kWh to 1 eurocent per kWh and was intended to cover the cost of the long-term PPAs and the grant schemes that the MECI wanted to promote for achieving the RES and Energy Efficiency targets.

The Fund is monitored by a Management Committee provided in the relevant Law. A list of proposed measures that have been included for the period 2020-2022 are listed in Appendix 8. There are more measures that are listed in that can be promoted through Energy Communities, while some other RES measures are promoted through other pillars of the NECP. For example, the new obligation in buildings to have at least 25% RES penetration indirectly force all the new buildings to take into consideration the best available RES Technologies based on specificities of their location and the type of building. 3.1.2.4. iv. Where applicable, the assessment of the support for electricity from renewable sources that Member States are to carry out pursuant to Article 6(4) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 The required assessment will be presented at the next update of the NECP. A comparison of various support schemes and financing models in the EU compared to those in Cyprus was performed from Adelphi and OEB49.                                                            49 www.oeb.org.cy/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Report_GHG-financing-models-Cyprus_final.pdf 120  3.1.2.5. v. Specific measures to introduce one or more contact points, streamline administrative procedures, provide information and training, and facilitate the uptake of power purchase agreements Currently there is not a dedicated one stop shop for RES Projects. However, there is a general framework for big projects50 that can indirectly support this effort. MECI is in the process of establishing specific measures to introduce one or more contact points along with all the relevant stakeholders and create the one-stop-shop as indicated by the RES Directive (2018/2001/EC). Training and information Certification of small-scale RES system installers is provided through four accredited institutions for issuing certificates51. Currently these accredited institutions are monitored from MECI and as of 11/2019 there were 62 52certified small-scale PV installers and 25 Solar water heater certified installers. In parallel the MECI is participating in various public places in order to promote the various support schemes. In that respect the website is going to be redesigned and the use of social media can help also towards to that direction. MECI also is in the process of creating a digital platform where all the installers will be able to register (and re-register) electronically. In parallel, newsletter can be delivered and an online forum can be created to support all the certified installers. Power Purchasing Agreements PPAs are supported through the support schemes for all rooftop PV projects that are used for self-consumption. The PPAs have duration from 10 to 15 years and the producer is able to choose their supplier, once the electricity market will be in operation. For large scale projects there was a support scheme that enabled a short-term contract with the state-owned company of electricity (EAC). The terms and conditions of such a contract are being monitored by CERA and have a short duration (till the operation of the competitive electricity market).  Administrative Procedures The Republic of Cyprus has taken a number of measures aiming at improving administrative procedures and removing barriers to the promotion of RES Energy. There are various simplified procedures specifically for RES Electricity projects that have been improved over time by the various authorities involved, such as, Ministry of Interior53,                                                            50 http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/moi.nsf/All/0886B91AFE961083C22581D000247B8A/$file/% CE%9A%CE%A0%20%CE%95%CF%80%CE%B5%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%85%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%BF%CC%81%CF%82%20%CE%9D%CE%BF%CC%81%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%822.pptx 51 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/EnergySe.nsf/All/EDE50CAB048EE2B7C22581AE00331331?OpenDocument 52 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/EnergySe.nsf/All/3FCDDDF3AF023C34C225822F00266422?OpenDocument 53 www.publicaccess.tph.moi.gov.cy  121  Cyprus Energy Regulator54, Department of Environment and Transmission55 and Distribution System Operator56.  More specifically, the following apply:  Continued exemption of RES electricity generation systems with a capacity of up to 5MW from the obligation to obtain construction and operating licences from CERA.   To set up RES electricity generation systems with a total capacity between 1kW to 20kW, it is necessary to apply to CERA for an exemption from the obligation to obtain a licence. There is an exemption from that obligation in the case of photovoltaic systems included in, and operating under, net metering and self-consumption support systems.   Exemption of photovoltaic systems up to 150kW from the obligation to obtain a town planning permit, on condition that the systems are installed in accordance with the General Town and Country Planning Decree of 2014. An exemption from the obligation to obtain a building permit exists for photovoltaic systems up to 20kW installed in legally existing buildings.  Environmental impact assessments are not required in the following cases:   Wind turbines with a capacity of up to 30kW (a preliminary environmental impact assessment is required for wind turbines with capacity over 30kW).   Photovoltaic systems with a capacity of up to 100kW and no limit for the rooftop Photovoltaic Systems.  Electricity generation plants using biomass with an installed capacity of up to 20kW.  Additionally, MECI, in cooperation with all competent authorities, is looking into ways to further simplify the licensing procedures for small RES systems with a view to significantly reducing the time taken to review applications. Finally, MECI is aiming to create a digitalized cross platform that will connect all the different stakeholders and thus facilitate the procedures for licencing of both large- and small-scale projects. 3.1.2.6. vi. Assessment of the necessity to build new infrastructure for district heating and cooling produced from renewable sources Based on a project during a technical assistance received from SRSS, by Ricardo Energy & Environment (SRSS/C2017/004), in order to identify the potential for high efficiency heating and cooling solutions in agreed areas of Cyprus, where high efficiency solutions include District Heating and Cooling (DHC) and local, building level heating solutions, including Combined Heat and Power (CHP), heat pumps and solar thermal solutions, a model (excel based) was developed. The key findings arising from the Technical Assistance Report were as follows:                                                            54 https://www.cera.org.cy/en-gb/ilektrismos/details/apallagi-ape 55 https://www.dsm.org.cy/el/electricity-market/new-connections 56 https://www.eac.com.cy/EL/RegulatedActivities/Distribution/renewableenergy/Pages/default.aspx 122   District Heating and Cooling (DHC) solutions based upon the CHP technologies fired by Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) and oil fired CHP are the only solutions found to be cost effective relative to the baseline on an economic basis (i.e. using a Discount Rate of 6%).  With one or two isolated exceptions, these solutions are only found to be cost effective in two of the 10 Geographical Areas evaluated.  The areas where economic cost-effective potential is found are the two tourist areas evaluated: Area 3 Poseidonos Avenue, Paphos and Area 4 Kryo Avenue. These areas are comprised entirely of hotels. The positive potential found for these two areas is primarily due to assumed higher hours of occupancy for hotels, compared with other building types, which increases the load factor on the plant and, therefore, reduces plant Capex for the same quantity of heating and cooling energy delivered.  When viewed from a financial perspective (i.e. using a Discount Rate of 12%), some of the above mentioned solutions, which were cost effective from an economic perspective (DR=6%), cease to be cost effective, implying that private investment in these particular solutions would not come forward without support. We caution against assuming that projects that are shown to be cost effective with DR=12% in this work would bring forward private sector investment for District heating and cooling, returns on investment consistent with DRs greater than 20% would be needed. Therefore, the model should be used to explore other DRs, consistent with the private sector investment environment in Cyprus, to understand better the bounds of financial cost effectiveness. The model developed, is an ideal tool for doing this.  The cost effectiveness of the RDF based solutions is strongly driven by the relatively low cost assumed for this fuel in the above study. Further consideration should be given to the possibility of supplying RDF at this price so that this finding can be validated. In that respect there are consultations between relevant stakeholders in order to promote such support scheme.   While District Heating and cooling based upon Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) CHP is attractive from a cost effective and CO2 savings point of view, the modelling indicates that it would not generate Primary Energy Savings, relative to the baseline. This finding is driven by the assumption made in this study about how efficiently grid electricity would be generated in the future based on the PPM Scenario.  3.1.2.7. vii. Where applicable, specific measures on the promotion of the use of energy from biomass, especially for new biomass mobilisation taking into account:  biomass availability, including sustainable biomass: both domestic potential and imports from third countries  other biomass uses by other sectors (agriculture and forest-based sectors); as well as measures for the sustainability of biomass production and use Under examination. 123  3.1.3. Other elements of the dimension 3.1.3.1. i. National policies and measures affecting the EU ETS sector No national policies have been prepared explicitly for the ETS sector. However, there are national policies and measures included in the NECP that will also affect the EU ETS sector and in particular the electricity production: (a) Promotion of natural gas as an intermediate fuel for the decarbonisation of the energy system (b) Promotion of renewable energy sources in all sectors by further emphasizing on synergies between various sectors (c) Improvement of energy efficiency in all sectors (d) Research and Innovation and new technologies. The impact of the implementation of these policies to the emissions of the ETS sectors is presented in Chapters 4 and 5. 3.1.3.2. ii. Policies and measures to achieve other national targets, where applicable There are no other national targets. Not applicable. 3.1.3.3. iii. Policies and measures to achieve low emission mobility (including electrification of transport) The planned policies and measures to achieve low emission mobility include the following: 1) The shift of modal share from car trips to sustainable modes of transport, through the policies and measures that are included in the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP) and the National Transport Strategy (NTS). The Limassol SUMP was completed in June 2019 and the Larnaca SUMP is expected to be completed in March 2020. Furthermore, the remaining cities in Cyprus are planning to start preparing their own SUMPs within 2020.   SUMPs include costed policies and measures which scientifically prove (via world leading traffic prediction software) that a specific modal shift from car trips to sustainable modes of transport can be achieved. This group of measures include significantly improved bus services (routes, frequency, hours of operation), upgrading of infrastructure for pedestrians/ cyclists / public transport, development, implementation of a holistic parking policy, implementation of high-quality public transport corridors and essentially a group of targeted measures that promote the use of sustainable modes of transport and discourage the use of car trips. The modal share of cars in Cyprus is currently over 90% and based on the plans and studies that have already been completed, a modal share of 75% car, 13% public transport, 12% walking/ cycling can be achieved and is set as a national target.   124  Based on the plans and studies that have already been completed, the cost of implementing this ac.4 billion and includes both capital and operational costs for the 2020-2030 period. It is worth noting that part of this cost is already included each year in the budget of the relevant authorities, while some of this cost can also be sourced from European funding as well as private funding.   2) The promotion of the purchase and use of vehicles with low or zero emission takes into consideration the harmonisation and implementation of European Directives (e.g. Cleans Vehicle Directive) for the purchase of new vehicles both for the private and public sector. This action also includes further incentives for the purchase and use of low/zero emission vehicles including additional old vehicle scraping schemes, further financial incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles and further amendment of the Motor Vehicles and Road Traffic Law (Law 100(I)/2013) for revision of the vehicle taxes and annual circulation taxes. The cost of vehicles and cost of infrastructure for this action will be sourced mainly from private sources. Based on these parameters, the impact assessment has estimated that approximately 11% of the passenger car fleet could be electric and 9% could be hybrid until 2030. This measure is expected to be more effective after 2025 when the market conditions are expected to be more favourable for the purchase and use of electric vehicles.   3) The promotion of the purchase and use of low/zero emission buses is based on the incorporation of the new public transport contracts terms, the harmonization/ implementation of European Directives (e.g. Cleans Vehicle Directive) for the purchase of new buses for the private/public sector and the incentives for the use of low/zero emission tourist buses. The cost of vehicles and cost of infrastructure will be sourced mainly from private sources. Based on these parameters, the impact assessment has estimated that approximately 7% of the bus fleet could be electric until 2030. This measure is expected to be more effective after 2025 when the market conditions are expected to be more favourable for the purchase and use of electric buses.   4) Extensive tree planting of up to 650,000 trees along the urban road network and up to 350,000 trees along the interurban road network. The cost of this action is estimated at  million and includes the planting cost and infrastructure changes required along the urban network, but it does not include the maintenance and watering costs. The positive impacts for this measure include C02 absorption, aesthetic upgrading, shading, lowering temperatures and better conditions for cycling and walking that could have a significant impact in the use of sustainable modes of transport. It is noted that the effects of this measure are long term, due to the amount of years required for a tree to reach a significant size and for the benefits mentioned above to be effective. 3.1.3.4. iv.
