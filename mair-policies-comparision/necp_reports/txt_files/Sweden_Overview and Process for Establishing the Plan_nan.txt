OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN  1.1 Executive summary  1.1.1 Political, economic, environmental, and social context of the plan In December 2015, the European Commission presented its communication on an Energy Union1 for Europe. In practice the Energy Union involves the revision of all European energy and climate legislation. In November, the Commission presented Clean Energy for all Europeans2, a package of measures to keep the EU competitive as the clean energy transition changes global energy markets. The package included legislative proposals for energy efficiency, renewable energy, electricity market design, security of electricity supply and rules for the governance of the Energy Union. The Governance Regulation3 came into force on 24 December 2018. The Regulation states that, by 31 December 2019, and subsequently by 1 January 2029 and every ten years thereafter, each Member State must notify to the Commission an integrated national energy and climate plan, containing the elements set out Energy and Climate Plan in accordance with the Governance Regulation and is structured according to the general framework set out in Annex I to the Regulation.  energy and climate goals, policies and measures and on the associated scenarios. It is based primarily on the Climate Policy Framework, energy policy and the targets drawn from the Energy Policy Framework Agreement (see Section 1.3).  The long-term energy and climate targets and objectives described in the plan establish long-term conditions for the business community and society as a whole.  1.1.2 Strategy for the five dimensions of the Energy Union Overall, Swedish energy and climate policy is compatible with the ambitions as energy cooperation in the EU and aims to combine ecological sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply. The energy policy must therefore create the conditions for effective and sustainable energy use                                                       1 COM/2015/080 final. 2 IP/16/4009. 3 Regulation 2018/1999 (EU) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council. 5 (199) and a cost-effective energy supply in Sweden, while minimising the damage to health, the environment and climate and facilitating the transition to a sustainable society. Sweden must lead the way on environmental and climate -free welfare state. Sweden aims to cut its net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2045, and reduce the emissions from activities on Swedish territory to 15% of their 1990 levels.  1.1.3 Table summarising important objectives, policies and measures in the plan Table 1 Summary of targets for energy and climate policy.

Although it is a minority government, there are broad-based agreements and frameworks in many policy areas.  The January Agreement The January Agreement, signed in January 2019, is a sectoral policy agreement between the two ruling parties  the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party  and the Centre Party and the Liberals5. This agreement,                                                       4 The Government aims to achieve the target entirely with national measures. 5 https://www.regeringen.se/regeringens-politik/regeringens-politik-bygger-pa-sakpolitisk-overenskommelse/. 6 (199) which consists of 73 points in a number of areas, forms the basis for some of the Government's policies. Point 30 of the agreement states that the Government must pursue an active climate policy which upholds the Climate Policy Framework.  Sweden's Climate Policy Framework The Riksdag adopted a climate policy framework for Sweden in June 201766. The Framework was adopted with a broad majority and comprises national climate targets, a climate act and a climate policy council. The Climate Policy Framework provides order and stability for climate policy and establishes long-term conditions for the business community and society as a whole. It   The Climate Act The Climate Act (2017:720) regulates the Government's climate policy; it sets out the aims of the policy and specifies how it should be conducted. long-term emission targets set by the Riksdag and must create conditions which allow the climate policy and budget policy targets to work together. The Act also determines when and how the Government should monitor climate policy and report planned measures to the Riksdag.  It must present a climate statement to the Riksdag every year in the draft budget and present a climate policy action plan the year after an ordinary general election.  The Climate Policy Council As part of the Climate Policy Framework, the Government has set up the Climate Policy Council; the members of the council are experts on climate, climate policy, economics, social sciences and behavioural science. The s.  The Energy Agreement In March 2015, the Government decided to set up a parliamentary commission to oversee energy policy7. Under the directive, the Energy Commission was tasked with preparing the ground for a broad agreement8 on energy policy, with a particular focus on electricity supply after 20252030. Five political parties (representing a majority in the Riksdag) came to an agreement on 10 June 2016. These were the Social Democrats, the                                                       6 Government bill 2016/17:146 Report 2016/17:MJU24, Riksdag communication 2016/17:320. 7 Directive 2015:25. 8 https://www.regeringen.se/artiklar/2016/06/overenskommelse-om-den-svenska-energipolitiken/. 7 (199) Moderates, the Green Party, the Centre Party and the Christian Democrats. The Riksdag adopted energy policy targets based on the Energy Agreement. cooperation in the EU; it therefore aims to combine sustainability, security of supply and competitiveness. The policy aims to combine security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability. The energy policy must therefore create the conditions for effective and sustainable energy use and a cost-effective energy supply in Sweden, while minimising the damage to health, the environment and climate and facilitating the transition to a sustainable society. The Riksdag has set the following targets as a result of the Energy Agreement.9:   The 2040 target is 100% of electricity generated from renewable sources. This is a target, not a deadline for banning nuclear energy; nor is it a policy decision to stop generating nuclear energy.  Consumption of energy in Sweden must be 50% more efficient in 2030 than it was in 2005. This target is expressed as energy supplied in relation to gross domestic product (GDP).  Progress on the Energy Agreement is monitored by regular reviews. The reviews must contain conclusions and suggestions for the evolution of the electricity market and the monitoring of energy policy targets. The first review report was submitted to the Riksdag in June 201910. On 10 December 2019, the Moderates and the Christian Democrats announced that they are abandoning the agreement.  1.2.2 Current energy and climate policies and measures relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union See Section 3 for information about policies and measures.  1.2.3 Key issues of cross-border relevance Sweden is part of the well-integrated and interconnected Nordic electricity market and is involved in matters related to further market integration A properly functioning, integrated cross-border energy market is extremely important.  1.2.4 Administrative structure of implementing national energy and climate policies  The role of the agencies Each department is responsible for a number of Government agencies                                                       9 Government bill 2017/18:228, Report 2017/18:NU22, Riksdag communication 2017/18:411. 10 Government communication 2018/19:153 Första kontrollstationen för energiöverenskommelsen. 8 (199) which have to apply the laws and carry out the activities decided on by the Government and the Riksdag. The following agencies are mainly responsible for energy and climate matters11:  The Swedish Energy Agency works in various sectors of society to promote effective and sustainable energy consumption and to make the supply of energy in Sweden cost-effective.  The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency plays a key role in environmental work, driving, supporting and coordinating environmental policy.  quality targets and proposes measures for environmental work as required.  The Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate supervises the electricity, natural gas and district heating markets.  The Swedish National Grid manages Sweden's national electricity network. It is also the system operator for electricity supply in Sweden, which involves balancing the system in the short term and ensuring that system installations work together reliably.  The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) provides supporting information for weather and water-related plans and decisions. It is the expert body for meteorology, hydrology, oceanography and climatology and a resource for environmental work.  The National Board of Housing, Building and Planning is the central agency for the built environment, land and water management, town and country planning, building and building management and finance for housing.  Formas (the Swedish research council for the environment, agricultural science and spatial planning) provides assistance and information about research in its field. It promotes sustainable growth and development.  County councils  Sweden is divided into 21 counties all of which have a county council led by a governor. The county council is a public coordinating authority, a service authority and an appeal body and has                                                       11 www.regeringen.se. 9 (199) supervisory responsibility. The county councils are guarantors for the implementation of the Government's national goals and play an important part in drafting national energy and climate plans and allocating state aid for energy and climate purposes.  Many other agencies also play a large part in implementing energy and climate policy.  The role of municipalities and regions Municipalities and regions are important for Sweden's climate work. Their closeness to the population, their role in town and country planning and the fact that they are major employers make them important operators in the work to meet climate targets. The municipalities work with companies, organisations, residents and other operators to drive local developments, thus helping to meet national and local targets. Many local initiatives are contribut  The primary aim of the regional energy management agencies is to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy sources locally and regionally. They work with public and private operators on assignments and projects based on international and national energy and environment goals. Since they are not allowed to compete with private companies, they operate as independent, not-for-profit energy organisations. There are around 360 energy management agencies in Europe. The 15 agencies in Sweden have   1.3 Consultations and involvement of national and Union entities and their outcome  1.3.1 Involvement of the national parliament integrated energy and climate plan is based on goals and policies Committee held a consultation on guiding principles before Sweden's national energy and climate plan was finalised. It also held a consultation on climate plan on 17 December 2019.  1.3.2 Involvement of local and regional authorities The Swedish Energy Agency and other relevant agencies started the preparatory work for the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan in Spring 2019. An information meeting was held on 29 August 2019 for a wide range of operators, including the municipalities and regions. The meeting explained the process and the type of information the plan would 10 (199) for the energy and climate plan was held on 1 September 2019,  in which the municipalities and regional operators expressed their opinions and provided input for the plan.  See Section 1.3.3 for more information about these consultations.  1.3.3 Consultations of stakeholders, including the social partners, and engagement of civil society and the general public The political goals and policies described in this plan have been through the usual consultation process, which gives stakeholders and the general public the opportunity to express their views. The memorandum Responding to the Consultation  How and Why12 issued by the Coordination Department of the Swedish Government Offices describes how and why the consultations are sent out and the mechanism for dealing with them in the subsequent stages of the procedure.  Much of the Integrated Energy and Climate Plan is based on the targets and goals developed as a result of the Energy Commission's work and the work on the Climate Policy Framework described in Section 1.2. The consultations held during this work are described separately below.  Consultation on the preparatory documents for the Integrated Energy and Climate Plan The preparatory documents for the draft energy and climate plan were sent to 30 operators for consultation in spring 2018. Ten responses were received, mainly from trade associations. The views were taken into account in the draft, which was reported on 17 January 201913. One of the views written in Swedish to make it more accessible to the general public; this was taken into account in the work on this plan.  Work began on the final energy and climate plan in spring 2019. An information meeting about the plan for a wide range of operators was held on 29 August 2019. Around 80 operators (trade associations, agencies, research institutes, universities, municipalities, regions and environmental organisations) were invited. The meeting explained the process for the energy and climate plan and the type of information the plan would contain. proposals currently in the plan were also discussed.                                                        12 SB PM 2003:2. 13 https://www.regeringen.se/rapporter/2019/01/sveriges-utkast-pa-integrerad-nationell-energi--och- klimatplan/. 11 (199) energy and climate plan was held on 1 September 2019. The Government has commissioned The Swedish Energy Agency to produce a proposal for the plan. However the proposal does not contain all of the parts of the template set out in the Governance Regulation. The parts related to ongoing work to implement the revised Energy Efficiency Directive and the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive are missing. The written consultations produced 36 responses containing views and comments on the plan. Detailed views have been incorporated into the plan. A summary of the views expressed is given in Annex 1.  Consultation on the Climate Policy Framework The Government assigned the Environmental Objectives Committee, a cross-party policy committee, the task of developing the proposal for the Climate Policy Framework, along with a long-term goal for 2045. The Committee also prepared a proposal for a long-term climate and air pollution control strategy, including intermediate targets for 2030 and 2040.  The Environmental Objectives Committee was composed of representatives from seven of the eight parties in the Riksdag and a chair. It was assisted by 30 experts, who represented various categories of operator: agencies, representatives from industry, researchers, environmental organisations and trade unions. These experts were involved in some of the monthly meetings held by the Committee during this project, participating in discussions and contributing their expertise Key questions discussed were the level of ambition and the timing of the long-term goals. The research representatives and environmental organisations stressed that it was important to achieve net-zero within a short t14 conclusions. They also responded to assumptions about the potential of measures in the scenarios included in the preparatory documents for the intermediate targets for 2030 and 2040.  To explore the opportunities and challenges involved in reducing emissions and to discuss policy, ten seminars were held during the project for a broader range of experts and operators to examine how to implement the transition in various sectors of society. Separate round table discussions on possible measures and policies were also held with representatives from various sectors of industry (base materials, the bioeconomy and agriculture) and the academic world.  When the Committee had prepared its report, the proposal for a climate policy framework and a long-term goal for 2045 was sent for consultation to                                                       14 IPCC = Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 12 (199) around 200 stakeholders who were given three months to consider it15. Similar consultations were held for the long-term climate and air pollution control strategy16. The stakeholders selected represented all types of operator: voluntary organisations (NGOs), trade associations, think tanks, universities and colleges, authorities etc. The consultations showed that stakeholders broadly supported the climate policy framework and climate goals.  The Energy Commission The Energy Commission arranged six major seminars in its areas of focus: consumption, supply, transmission and the market. Representatives from trade associations, trade unions, research institutes, environmental organisations, industry, departments and agencies were invited to the seminars along with many experts from Sweden and abroad. The seminars were open to the public, broadcast over the internet and documented on the 17, which also publishes the latest information experts, one on the electricity and heating markets and one on energy storage facilities in cooperation with the Swedish Smartgrid Forum18. It also organised a round table discussion on the design of the future electricity market with Swedenergy. During Politician's Week in Almedalen in July 2016, the Energy Commission also arranged a seminar on the framework agreements concluded in June 2016.  During the course of this work, the Energy Commission held 14 ordinary meetings to which the Directors General of the Swedish National Grid, the Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate and the Swedish Energy Authority were invited. These meetings were held in conjunction with external parties  The Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, Swedenergy, the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and County Councils (now the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions) and the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation  to gain a deeper understanding of the views of the various operators19.  1.3.4 Consultations of other Member States A draft of Sweden's Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan was sent to Denmark, Finland and Norway for comment. There were no comments on the draft.  1.3.5 Iterative process with the Commission                                                       15 https://www.regeringen.se/remisser/2016/03/remiss-av-delbetankande-fran-miljomalsberedningen-med- forslag-om-ett-klimatpolitiskt-ramverk-inklusive-langsiktigt-klimatmal/. 16 https://www.regeringen.se/remisser/2016/06/remiss-av-delbetankande-fran-miljomalsberedningen-med- forslag-om-en-klimat--och-luftvardsstrategi-for-sverige/. 17 www.energikommissionen.se. 18 Described in Section 2.4.3 and 3.4.3. 19 Kraftsamling för framtidens energi (SOU 2017:2). 13 (199) Sweden took part in the meetings held with the technical working group set up by the European Commission to assist Member States with the development of their integrated energy and climate plans. To start the iterative process with the Commission, Sweden uploaded an early draft of the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan to the technical cooperation platform set up for the technical working group in June 2018. This early draft was discussed informally with the Commission during autumn 2018. Sweden formally reported its draft Integrated Energy and Climate Plan on 17 January 201920.  The Commission assessed the draft plans of all Member States and, on 18 June 2019, issued recommendations for each of the plans along with a general assessment of whether they are ambitious enough to meet the common EU goals. The specific recommendations for Sweden21 were taken into account for the work on this Integrated Energy and Climate Plan and for the aim to implement it as far as possible within the framework of established targets and policies.  1.4 Regional cooperation in preparing the plan  1.4.1 Elements subject to joint or coordinated planning with other Member States Cooperation, coordination and dialogue between the Nordic countries is conducted through the Nordic Council of Ministers. An ad-hoc network group has been set up within this cooperative framework to coordinate the national energy and climate plans in the Nordic region. The ad-hoc group has met to discuss matters of common interest and to share knowledge. It has also held discussions with Nordic Energy Research (NER) about ways of using its analytical work for the preparation of the integrated energy and climate plans of the Nordic countries.  The ad-hoc group was formed in 2018 to encourage the Nordic countries to cooperate on the preparation of their national integrated energy and climate plans. The first meeting was held in Stockholm in May 2018.  Sweden is a member of the North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC), a forum for regional cooperation founded in 2016. Ten countries and the European Commission belong to the NSEC. The member countries, besides Sweden are: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom. Cooperation is voluntary; one of the aims is to produce joint strategies for cost-effective                                                       20 https://www.regeringen.se/rapporter/2019/01/sveriges-utkast-pa-integrerad-nationell-energi--och-klimatplan/. 21 C (2019) 4427 final. 14 (199) expansion of renewable energy, in particular offshore wind power in the North Sea region.  The work on the integrated energy and climate plans has also been discussed within the regional cooperation on the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP).  1.4.2 Explanation of how regional cooperation is considered in the plan The Nordic cooperation on energy and climate matters has benefited the work on many parts of the plan. The interconnected nature of the Nordic energy market is reflected in the scenarios used in this plan.  The analytical work of Nordic Energy Research was considered particularly in Section 5.  2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS  2.1 Dimension decarbonisation  2.1.1 GHG emissions and removals  2.1.1.1 The elements set out in point (a)(1) of Article 4  With respect to greenhouse gas emissions and removals and with a view to contributing to the achievement of the economy wide Union greenhouse gas emission reduction target:  The Member State's binding national target for greenhouse gas emissions and the annual binding national limits pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/842. For the emission sectors22 emission allowance trading. For the (EU ETS) or LULUCF23 sector, each Decision/non-traded sector (ESD24/ESR25). Sweden's contribution to effort sharing is to reduce its emissions to 20% of their 2005 levels by 2030.  The Swedish national intermediate target for 2030 is to reduce emissions from the non-EU ETS or LULUCF sectors by 63% compared to their 1990                                                       22 Examples of sectors that do not belong to the EU ETS or LULUCF are heating of homes and commercial premises, agriculture and national transport (excluding national flights). 23 LULUCF stands for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry . In this sector, carbon storage changes are reported for each soil type and for harvested wood products. https://www.naturvardsverket.se/Sa-mar-miljon/Statistik-A-O/Vaxthusgaser-utslapp- och-upptag-fran-markanvandning/. 24 Decision No 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the effort of Member States to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to 2020. 25 Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation (EU) No 525
