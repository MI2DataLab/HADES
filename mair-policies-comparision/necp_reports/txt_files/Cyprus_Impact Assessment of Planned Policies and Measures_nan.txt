189  5. IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF PLANNED POLICIES AND MEASURES NOTE The Impact Study was completed in November 2019 and therefore the results reflect the data available at the time. On 12 December 2019, the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, through th84, announced the acceptance of the revised Cyprus greenhouse gas emission inventories for the period 1990 - 2017. As a result the emissions of the non-ETS sectors for 2005 (reference year for the national reduction target) increased from 3954 kt CO2 eq. to 4266 kt CO2 eq. This affects the results of the impact analysis only on the issue of achieving the greenhouse gas emissions reduction target and the associated costs for purchasing greenhouse gas emission allowances for compliance. Specifically, taking into account the expected results of the implementation of the policies and measures included in the National Plan, and in particular of the new planned policies and measures, it appears that based on the revised emissions of 2005 (4265 kt CO2 eq.) the national mandatory target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions of the greenhouse is covered to a great extend (a 21% decrease is expected by the end of the period compared to 24% which is the target). In view of the above, it appears that while the national mandatory target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the end of the period is not expected to be fully met, due to the use of the flexibility mechanisms available in the ESR, Cyprus is not expected to have any financial cost for purchasing additional greenhouse gas emission allowances. 5.1. Impacts of planned policies and measures described in section 3 on energy system and GHG emissions and removals, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures (as described in section 4). Having noted the above, the projected impacts of WEM and PPM scenarios on the energy mix and emissions are presented in the next sections until 2030. The outputs of the cost-optimisation model employed for the two scenarios until 2030 are subject to technical constraints, development plans and policy options conveyed to the project team by the authorities. For instance, in the WEM scenario solar PV capacity is constrained to a maximum of 750 MW, while this limit is removed for the period 2031-2050. Scenario results                                                            84 https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/arr2019_CYP.pdf 190  for the entire period 2020-2050 have been provided in the underlying impact assessment study which is publicly available. 5.1.1. Existing Policies and Measures Scenario The results for this section have been broken down by sector (i.e. electricity, transport, heating and cooling). Additionally, results regarding the primary energy supply and final energy demand are provided along with a forecast on the carbon dioxide emissions from both ETS and non-ETS sectors. 5.1.1.1. Electricity Supply Sector Capacity The projection offered by the model for the electricity supply sector is quite interesting and can be considered optimistic. Following the expected deployment of renewable energy technologies until 2020, as promoted by the existing support schemes and the development of the planned 50 MW CSP plant by 2021, an additional 390 MW of solar PV and 33 MW of biomass-fired facilities are deployed between 2021 and 2030. The increase in solar PV in this period coincides with the development of two new combined cycle gas turbines with a total capacity of 432 MW, which can operate as baseload and also offer flexibility to the system; flexibility is necessary when levels of variable renewable electricity generation increase. The new CCGT units allow a higher volume of low-cost gas-fired electricity generation, as these are the most efficient thermal units available. Despite the low fossil fuel price projections and the higher renewable energy technology prices adopted in the analysis as compared to EC recommendations, a substantial deployment of solar PV occurs in the period 2020-2030 (Table 5.1). This deployment is enabled by the deployment of Li-ion batteries during the same period, as these reach 41 MW in 2030.

This publication foresees that by 2030 battery life will exceed 15 years and round-trip efficiency will reach 95% at an installation cost of approximately 160 EUR2016/kWh. These projections are further corroborated by other recent publications examining the subject (e.g. by NREL86). All Li-ion batteries deployed are in-front-of-the-meter facilities and have 4 hours of storage; this results in 164 MWh of battery storage in 2030. No behind-the-meter battery storage is deployed as from a systeperspective it is deemed cost-optimum to deploy storage at the centralised level, where it can serve a larger array of generation technologies. It should be mentioned though that behind-the-meter storage could be profitable for end-consumers under a net-billing plan and in case Time-of-Use electricity tariffs are adopted in the future. Furthermore, in 2027 a 130 MW (1,040 MWh) pumped-hydro facility is also developed. The deployment of batteries and solar PV can be attributed to the reduction of their respective capital cost over time. At the same time, increasing fuel and ETS prices make fossil-fired plants less competitive. However, the feasibility of these results has to be scrutinized thoroughly, as during low electricity demand and high PV output periods, a significant amount of curtailment may be observed. The results presented here estimate a curtailment level of 0.1% for solar PV and 0.5% for wind in 2030. Nonetheless, curtailment is not accurately captured by a long-term energy systems model as the one employed here. Hence, a separate detailed grid analysis study, like the one performed by JRC in a previous project87, focusing on a single year in a much finer temporal resolution may be needed to properly assess this proposed outlook. Generation The technology deployment presented in Section 2.1.1.1 provides the generation mix shown in Figure 5.1. The substitution in the latter part of 2021 (i.e. in the period November-December) of oil-fired generation with gas-fired generation results in a transitional period as indicated below. In the post-2020 period, gas-fired generation dominates the electricity mix. The RES-E share in 2030 reaches 26%, as more solar PV and solar thermal is introduced in the system. It should be noted that the absolute contribution of fossil-fired generation remains relatively stable until 2030, and the increased demand in electricity drives solar PV deployment.  The deployment of solar PV discussed above increases the share of PV in the generation mix, which occurs gradually until 2030. Another factor which leads to the expansion of solar PV is the electrification of the transport sector, as this raises the demand for electricity throughout the year. Specifically, in 2030 approximately 148 GWh are consumed in the                                                            85 IRENA, 2017.

This aspect is further elaborated in the relevant section later on in the report.   Figure 5.1: Projected generation mix till 2030  WEM scenario. 5.1.1.2. Transport Sector The forecast for the transport sector foresees penetration of alternative fuels and technologies (Table 5.2). Regarding the passenger car fleet, the number of diesel vehicles are reduced over time; these are replaced by gasoline, gasoline hybrid and battery electric vehicles. Additionally, a moderate number of LPG conversions occurs. It is worth highlighting that a significant penetration of new electric vehicles appears in the fleet in the latter part of the modelling horizon. Significant investments occur in the period 2028-2030 which bring the number of BEVs to nearly 42,000 by 2030. The number of gasoline hybrid vehicles is also substantial as these increase to 60,000 by 2030.  The projected shift in the road transport fleet results in an equivalent change in the fuel consumption in the transport sector. As indicated in Table 5.3, gasoline remains as the main fuel consumed in road transportation for the entire model horizon. Gasoline consumption stays relatively constant until 2030, with a slight increase observed in the middle of the decade. However, the use of diesel decreases slightly, dropping from 11.7 (325 million litres) in 2021 to 10.7 (297 million litres) by 2030. Similarly, biodiesel used for blending follows a similar trend, as the current blending mix is kept constant throughout the whole period. Forced blending was implemented for 2nd generation biodiesel, as the government of Cyprus has issued decrees which force such blending. Electrification of the transport sector is regarded as a key step in the decarbonisation and diversification of fuel supply of this sector. A degree of electrification occurs in the projected scenarios by fully-electric vehicles. Therefore, electricity demand in the transport sector increases proportionally, reaching 0.5 PJ (148 GWh) in 2030; this corresponds to 2.2% of the total final electricity demand.   - 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 8,0002021202220232024202520262027202820292030Generation (GWh) DieselHFOGasWindSolar PVSolar ThermalBiomassNet ImportsDemand193  If the electricity demand in the transport sector increases further, it could pose challenges to the grid, but could also offer opportunities. On the one hand, electricity demand rises; this will not happen uniformly as charging will primarily occur at specific hours of the day. It can be expected that the overall load profile will be affected as a consequence. This is something that perhaps is not captured adequately by the current version of the model and may need to be amended in the future. The assumed charging profile can have a significant impact on the results and with increasing penetration of BEVs in the system, more information could become available to assist such an analysis.  Smart charging of vehicles and potential use of vehicle-to-grid systems, in which vehicle batteries can be used as additional supporting infrastructure by the grid operator, can offer demand response services that in turn can add flexibility and have an enabling effect for intermittent renewable energy technologies, subject to wider regulatory and market developments such as the introduction of Time-of-Use or dynamic pricing retail contracts. It has to be noted that changes in the transport sector are subject to the social behaviour of individuals, which is not a trivial matter to address in optimization models. The willingness of consumers to change their behaviour is a factor that may limit the transition of the transport sector to alternative fuels and technologies. 194  Table 5.2: Projected vehicle fleet (total number of vehicles)  WEM scenario.   2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Passenger cars Diesel 63,430 57,686 51,942 46,117 40,372 34,628 33,252 35,680 36,893  37,055  Diesel hybrid - - - - - - - - -  -  Diesel PHEV - - - - - - - - -  -  Gasoline 485,181 498,305 512,262 525,256 538,687 552,959 548,566 526,681 505,780  485,950  Gasoline Hybrid 5,170 5,170 5,170 5,170 5,170 5,170 18,738 32,387 46,117  59,927  Gasoline PHEV - - - - - - - - -  -  BEV 241 297 354 411 467 524 581 14,229 27,959  41,770  LPG 320 424 529 633 739 843 948 1,061 1,174  1,174  Natural gas - - - - - - - - -  -  Hydrogen - - - - - - - - -  -  Buses Diesel 3,058 3,097 3,141 3,186 3,230 3,274 3,318 3,362 3,406  3,450  Diesel hybrid - - - - - - - - -  -  BEV - - - - - - - - -  -  CNG - - - - - - - - -  -  MCs Gasoline 51,685 52,442 53,175 53,910 54,667 55,424 56,133 56,893 57,626  58,383  BEV - - - - - - - - -  -  Trucks Diesel 13,166 13,355 13,545 13,734 13,923 14,112 14,301 14,175 14,044  13,907  BEV - - - - - - - 314 635  961  Natural gas - - - - - - - - -  -  Light Trucks Diesel 121,355 123,095 124,842 126,583 128,323 130,064 131,810 133,551 135,291  137,032  BEV - - - - - - - - -  -  PHEV Diesel - - - - - - - - -  -  Hybrid diesel - - - - - - - - -  -  Grand Total 743,606 753,873 764,960 774,999 785,578 796,997 807,647 818,334 828,924 839,609  195  Table 5.3: Evolution of fuel consumption (PJ) in the transport sector until 2030  WEM scenario.  2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Biofuels  1.20   1.20   1.20   1.20   1.20   1.20   1.20   1.18   1.16   1.15  Diesel  11.66   11.46   11.25   11.09   10.91   10.73   10.71   10.73   10.71   10.66  Gasoline  16.46   16.79   17.10   17.40   17.69   17.97   18.00   17.49   17.01   16.58  LPG  0.01   0.01   0.02   0.02   0.02   0.03   0.03   0.03   0.04   0.04  Natural gas  -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -  Electricity (road)  0.003   0.003   0.004   0.005   0.005   0.006   0.006   0.181   0.357   0.533  Electricity (rail)  -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -    196  5.1.1.3. Heating and Cooling Sector Continued investments in renewable energy technologies in buildings, as well as investments in heat pumps lead to an increase in the renewable energy share in the heating and cooling sector. The significant RE share increase projected until 2030 will be mainly driven by solar thermal technologies and heat pumps in buildings. The projected final energy demand of the Heating and Cooling sector is provided in Table 5.4. The RES share foreseen in the Heating and Cooling sector increases and reaches 39% in 2030.

Primary Energy Supply and Final Energy Demand A moderate decrease in the primary energy supply can be observed in the middle of the period 2021-2030, but then increases back by 2030 (Table 5.5). The main driver of this is the incorporation of greater shares of renewable energy, which displaces fossil-fired generation in the electricity sector. Additionally, in 2021 heavy fuel oil is still used to a considerable extent until the introduction of less carbon-intensive natural gas in the power sector in the last two months of the same year.

The main driver in this case is the increased final electricity demand due to the broad trend for electrification in the economy (which in turn is generated by more efficient gas-fired plants and renewable energy technologies and therefore reduces primary energy needs). Continued electrification of the heating and cooling sector, as well as the considerable volume of electricity consumed in the transport sector have a significant role in the growth of electricity demand. The contribution of fossil fuels decreases with time. Furthermore, the total contribution of solar thermal in the electricity supply sector and the heating and cooling sector is projected to increase by 44% from 2020 to 2030.  Useful insights can be provided through a comparison of the final energy demand with the primary energy supply. Even though final energy demand undergoes a moderate increase between 2021 and 2030, primary energy supply stays at comparable levels. This is an indication of improved energy efficiency. Specifically, when final energy demand is measured as a share of primary energy supply, total energy efficiency amounts to 72% in 2021; this value increases to 77% in 2030. As shown in Table 5.7, the RES share in final energy demand is projected to increase gradually. The key sector driving this transition is the electricity supply sector. The 13% target for 2020 is expected to be achieved, while the share increases further to 20.1% by 2030. It should be noted that the above takes into account fuel consumption of aviation and the special treatment of this sector in the case of Cyprus, in line with Directive (EU) 2018/2001.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions Drawing directly from the model outputs, a greenhouse gas emission trajectory is extracted for the energy system (Figure 5.2 and Table 5.8). A degree of decarbonisation is achieved initially by gas-fired generation and later by solar PV and solar thermal generation in the ETS sector in this scenario; total CO2 eq. emissions in the ETS sector drop from 3,220 kt in 2021 to 2,290 kt in 2030. The reduction in CO2 eq. emissions in the non-ETS sector is relatively moderate. Emissions in the energy portion of the non-ETS sector decrease from 2,800 kt in 2021 to 2,750 kt in 2030. The main driver for this is the continued dependence of the transport sector on oil products.  Table 5.8: GHG emission trajectory in the ETS and Non-ETS energy-related sectors.

Even though the increased renewable energy share across the economy leads to a reduction in NOx and SO2 emissions, PM2.5 and PM10 emissions initially decline up to 2025, as a result of more stringent regulations in road vehicle transport and a decrease in diesel passenger cars, emissions remain relatively constant during the period 2025-2030 and even increase slightly. This is attributed to an elevated use of biomass in the Heating and Cooling sector. It should be mentioned that the National Emission Ceiling set for SO2 constrains the use of HFO with high sulphur content from 2020 onward.

It should be noted that DLI projects emissions for the major air pollutants only until 2030, and as such the horizon is limited in this case (Table 5.10).

Planned Policies and Measures Scenario 5.1.2.1. Electricity Supply Sector Capacity The incorporation of energy efficiency measures and the resulting lower electricity demand in the PPM scenario lead to mild changes in the investment outlook of the electricity supply sector (Table 5.11). This scenario removes the constraint implemented on the total installed capacity of solar PV, thus increasing the technology capacity from 750 MW in the WEM scenario to 804 MW in the PPM scenario in 2030. The lower electricity demand reduces the need for storage technologies, as a portion of the electricity consumption in peak demand periods is eliminated.     200  Table 5.11: Capacity projections in the electricity supply sector (MW)  PPM scenario.  2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Vasilikos 836 836 836 836 836 836 836 836 836 836 Dhekelia 450 450 450 102 102 102 102 102 102 102 Moni 128 128 128 128 128 128 128 128 128 128 New CCGT 216 216 216 432 432 432 432 432 432 432 New ICE 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 New ST 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 New GT 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Light fuel oil CHP 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Solar PV 380 400 420 440 460 480 500 523 673 804 Solar Thermal 0 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 Wind 158 180 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 Biomass & waste 22 27 32 37 42 47 50 50 58 58 Pumped Hydro 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Li-Ion Batteries 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Generation The above technology deployment provides the generation mix shown in Figure 5.3. Exported electricity is largely dependent on the increased solar PV generation. As compared to the WEM scenario, electricity generation reduces by 550 GWh in 2030 in the PPM scenario. Fossil-fired generation is also reduced by 650 GWh in this case, while electricity from RES increases by 105 GWh. The higher deployment of solar PV and the lower electricity demand lead to a RES-E share of 30% in 2030, as opposed to 26% in the WEM scenario.   Figure 5.3: Projected generation mix till 2030  PPM scenario. 5.1.2.2. Transport Sector Due to the assumed modal shift from passenger cars to sustainable transport modes, significant changes occur in the vehicle fleet of the PPM scenario. The most notable change is the lower projection in passenger cars compared to the WEM scenario. Specifically, the   - 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,0002021202220232024202520262027202820292030Generation (GWh) GasHFODieselSolar PVSolar ThermalWindBiomassNet ImportsDemand201  Most of this reduction is experienced by gasoline-fired passenger cars; these are lower by about 140 thousand in 2030. The rollout of gasoline hybrid passenger cars is comparable to WEM, while BEVs are increased by 18 thousand vehicles in 2030. On the other hand, a small number of diesel PHEV purchases can be noticed which were not present in the WEM scenario. In addition, a reduction in light truck and motorcycle fleets can be noticed, driven by the relevant mileage demand assumptions. On the contrary, the shift towards public transport creates a necessity for additional buses, which are higher by 2,560 units in 2030. As a result of the Clean Vehicles Directive for the public procurement of clean vehicles, a large number of these additional buses are fully-powered by electricity.  The outlook of fuel consumption in the transport sector changes as a result of the aforementioned transport fleet outlook (Table 5.13). The biggest variation can be noticed in the consumption projection of gasoline. This decreases by 27% in 2030 as compared to the WEM scenario. This is attributed to the reduced use of passenger cars and higher use of sustainable transport modes. Increased use of buses does not affect diesel fuel sales, as they remain at similar levels as in the WEM scenario. As regards biofuels, the same assumption is made as in the WEM scenario, i.e. forced blending for 2nd generation biodiesel, as the government of Cyprus has issued decrees which force this blending; especially in the PPM scenario it is assumed that the use of biofuels complies with the minimum share of 3.5% of rest is satisfied by the use of used cooking oils (blended with diesel fuel) and bioethers (blended with gasoline). Despite the penetration of natural gas in power generation and the assumed investments in at least one CNG refuelling station in each district of Cyprus, use of natural gas in motor vehicles is not deemed cost-effective in either of the two scenarios; this is of course directly affected by the relevant techno-economic assumptions adopted in the analysis. In terms of electricity consumption in the transport sector, total consumption increases by 0.3 PJ (90 GWh) in 2030 as compared to the WEM scenario. Annual electricity consumption in rail transport is assumed to remain at the same levels throughout the model horizon as the number of trips by the tram line in Nicosia was kept constant. It is important to highlight the drastic reduction in overall energy demand of the transport sector through the promotion of sustainable transport modes. It is estimated that additional cumulative investments in public transport for this scenario amount to 800-900 million EUR2016 to develop a tram line in Nicosia and increase the bus fleet, and an additional 500 million EUR2016 for creating the necessary infrastructure for sustainable transport until 2030. These also lead to lower private investments in passenger vehicles of approximately 2 billion EUR2016 during the same period. It is noted that the materialisation of these projections will necessitate infrastructure investments that will need to be partly financed by EU funds, and an equivalent level of public acceptance and adoption of these modes of transport to make such investments successful. Using the SHARES methodology, RES-T share in this case has been estimated to rise to 14.1% in 2030. In the case of the WEM scenario, the equivalent value is limited to 7.9% in 2030. 202  Table 5.12: Projected vehicle fleet (total number of vehicles)  PPM scenario.   2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Passenger cars Diesel 63,430 57,686 51,942 46,117 40,372 44,733 41,052 37,217 33,212  28,964  Diesel hybrid - - - - - - - - -  -  Diesel PHEV - 56 127 189 252 367 465 587 692  799  Gasoline 471,880 472,116 472,350 472,675 472,909 460,124 431,217 402,301 373,386  344,664  Gasoline Hybrid 5,170 5,170 5,170 5,170 5,170 5,170 18,738 32,387 46,117  59,927  Gasoline PHEV - - - - - - - - -  -  BEV 241 297 354 411 467 3,439 17,007 30,656 44,385  58,196  LPG 320 424 529 633 739 843 948 1,061 1,174  1,174  Natural gas - - - - - - - - -  -  Hydrogen - - - - - - - - -  -  Buses Diesel 3,314 3,579 3,840 4,106 4,372 4,609 4,856 5,089 5,332  5,574  Diesel hybrid - - - - - - - - -  -  BEV - 30 69 103 138 200 254 320 377  436  CNG - - - - - - - - -  -  MCs Gasoline 50,442 49,981 49,471 48,961 48,476 47,990 47,505 46,971 46,485  46,000  BEV - - - - - - - - -  -  Trucks Diesel 13,209 13,442 13,675 13,912 13,848 13,778 13,703 13,621 13,534  13,441  BEV - - - - 297 600 909 1,223 1,544  1,870  Natural gas - - - - - - - - -  -  Light Trucks Diesel 121,024 122,434 123,850 125,260 126,670 128,080 129,490 130,906 132,316 133,726  BEV - - - - - - - - -  -  PHEV Diesel - - - - - - - - -  -  Hybrid diesel - - - - - - - - -  -  Grand Total 729,030  725,215 721,378 717,537 713,710 709,934 706,142 702,340 698,554 694,771   203  Table 5.13: Evolution of fuel consumption (PJ) in the transport sector till 2030  PPM scenario.  2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Biofuels  1.18   1.17   1.16   1.15   1.13   1.12   1.09   1.06   1.03   1.35  Diesel  11.72   11.57   11.41   11.30   11.10   11.24   11.11   10.97   10.83   10.50  Gasoline  16.02   15.90   15.78   15.65   15.53   14.98   14.26   13.56   12.86   12.02  LPG  0.01   0.01   0.02   0.02   0.02   0.03   0.03   0.03   0.04   0.04  Natural gas  -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -  Electricity (road)  0.003   0.006   0.010   0.014   0.042   0.104   0.282   0.462   0.642   0.823  Electricity (rail)  -   -   -   -   -   -   -   0.033   0.033   0.033     204  5.1.2.3. Heating and Cooling Sector The additional energy efficiency measures adopted in the PPM scenario lead to a decrease in the total final energy demand of the Heating and Cooling sector. A reduction of 5% is estimated by 2030 as compared to the WEM scenario. As shown in Table 5.14 all of the fuels indicate lower figures, while the RES share in the Heating and Cooling sector is comparable to that in the WEM scenario.

Primary Energy Supply and Final Energy Demand Primary energy supply decreases considerably in this scenario, due to the changes in the energy mix and demand indicated in all the sectors (i.e. electricity, transport, heating and cooling). Specifically, by 2030 a 10% is achieved compared to the WEM scenario; this corresponds to a difference of 215 ktoe (Table 5.15). A considerable decrease is achieved in the use of gasoline, due to measures in the transport sector, which is reduced by 110 ktoe in 2030. Similarly, a higher deployment of renewable energy technologies in the electricity supply sector reduces the supply of natural gas by 115 ktoe in 2030. On the other hand, primary energy supply from solar photovoltaics increases by 8 ktoe for the same year.

This results in a total difference of 160 ktoe in 2030. Other than the aforementioned difference in gasoline consumption in the transport sector, a difference of 45 ktoe by 2030 is also observed in the final electricity demand. In terms of overall system efficiency, through a comparison between primary energy supply and final energy demand, slightly improved figures compared to present can be noticed. This is estimated at 77% in 2030, same as in the WEM scenario.

In the present scenario, this is estimated at 22.9% (Table 5.17) versus 20.1% in the WEM scenario by 2030.  Table 5.17: RE share in final energy demand across the energy system  PPM scenario.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions As opposed to the WEM scenario, a greater level of decarbonisation is achieved in both energy-relevant ETS and non-ETS sectors (Figure 5.4). In the PPM, the deployment of the EuroAsia Interconnector enables further penetration of solar PV, and reduces CO2 eq. emissions by 250 kt in 2030 (with a total of 2,040 kt) as compared to the WEM scenario. A lower electricity demand also plays a role in this reduction. Similarly, in comparison to the WEM scenario, non-ETS sector CO2 eq. emissions reduce further by 415 kt in 2030 (with a total of 2,335 kt). In this case, the reduction is largely driven by a modal shift in the transport sector away from passenger cars towards sustainable transport modes.

Air Pollutant Emissions As compared to the WEM scenario, a reduced projection in air pollutant emissions is observed, as illustrated by Table 5.19. A reduction is noticed for most air pollutants, but PM2.5 and PM10 indicate the highest reduction in the long-term. This is due to a lower use of biomass in the Heating and Cooling sector, as well as to lower fossil fuel consumption in road transport. However, by 2030 a considerable difference is noticed in SO2 emissions. This is attributed to a slightly increased utilisation of oil-fired generation than in the WEM scenario; a higher deployment of RES in electricity supply in the PPM scenario necessitates an increased use of the flexibility offered by the Dhekelia ICE units. Finally, NOx emissions are lower in the PPM scenario due to a lower gas-fired generation, as well as a lower dependence on fossil-fired passenger vehicles in the road transport sector.  012345672021202220232024202520262027202820292030GHG emissions (Mtons CO2eq) ETS sectorNon-ETS sector207  Table 5.19: Air pollutant emission projections until 2030 in the PPM Scenario.

Energy Savings and their Effect on Energy Supply As explained in the previous sections, the scenario with PPM (or PPM scenario) assumes the implementation of diverse energy efficiency policies for buildings and equipment in the Heating and Cooling sector, as well as important measures to enable a shift from passenger cars towards public and non-motorised transport modes. As a result of these measures, the energy system of Cyprus is expected to become considerably more efficient by 2030 in comparison to that foreseen in the scenario with Existing Policies and Measures (or WEM scenario). This is illustrated in Table 5.21, which displays key energy consumption data and the calculated energy savings between the two scenarios. It is evident that the main portion of energy savings comes from the road transport sector. Electricity supply also requires less primary energy input in the PPM scenario, both because of the reduction in electricity demand and because of the marginally higher penetration of renewables in the power generation system. Despite the reduced needs for energy supply due to energy efficiency improvements, it seems that there is no risk of stranded investments in the PPM scenario. The implementation of this scenario leads to a drop in new investments only in storage technologies, while no new investments occur in steam turbines, gas turbines and CHP facilities. Existing power plants will continue to operate until the end of their technical lifetime. Therefore, there is no issue of stranded assets in the Cypriot economy due to the implementation of PPM. 208  Table 5.21: Projected evolution of savings in final and primary energy consumption in Cyprus up to 2030.

Comparison with EU Climate and Energy Targets Table 5.22 presents the projected total GHG emissions for the period 2021-2030, split into the emissions of ETS and non-ETS sectors. These aggregate forecasts come from the calculations of MARDE to be included in the final report of the NECP of Cyprus. Similarly, Table 5.23 illustrates the projected evolution of non-ETS GHG emissions for the two scenarios of the NECP. In line with these emission forecasts, Table 5.23 provides an overview of the projected progress up to 2030 for meeting the EU energy and climate targets according to the WEM and PPM scenarios presented up to now. Although not all of these targets are entirely linked with the energy system (GHG emissions also depend on non-energy activities such as waste management, land use and the use of fluorinated gases), the energy modelling results of this study play a crucial role for assessing the achievement of Energy Union related policy objectives. The package of PPM included in the corresponding scenario seems to be sufficient for meeting88:  The renewable energy targets related both to total energy consumption and to road transport;  The energy efficiency target declared by the Republic of Cyprus. Even though until recently it was expected that, fulfilling the emissions abatement target for non-ETS sectors was going to be very challenging for the Cypriot economy due to the revised 2005 estimate available, emissions are expected to reduce by 20.9% by 2030, leaving a gap of 208 kt CO2eq. reduction in emissions of 2030 compared to those of 2005. These are new information and have not been taken into account and are not presented in the financial analysis in the sections that follow. Table 5.23 demonstrates how much more is needed for aligning the emissions of Cyprus with the deep decarbonisation target.

Moreover, each ETS sector that is relevant for Cyprus (power generation, cement production and ceramics/tiles production) has different allocations of emissions depending on provisions of the relevant EU legislation. 210   Figure 5.5: Projected evolution of GHG emissions of non-ETS sectors according to the WEM and PPM scenarios.

Application of the Energy Efficiency First Principle in Planned Policies and Measures According to guidance provided by the European Commission, when designing their energy and climate policies, Member States should apply the Energy Efficiency First Principle, meaning that priority should be given to policies and measures that reduce primary or final energy consumption and improve energy security, and other measures should be considered only after energy efficiency actions are deemed unfeasible or very costly. 050010001500200025003000350040004500500020172018201920202021202220232024202520262027202820292030kt CO2 eq. Estimated allowances allocationWEMPPM-10.2% -20.9% 211  The package of Planned Policies and Measures foreseen in the PPM scenario of the Cypriot National Energy and Climate Plan seems to be in line with the Energy Efficiency First Principle, for the following reasons:  As explained in the relevant section of the NECP of Cyprus, the measures of the PPM scenario are sufficient to comply with the energy efficiency obligations of the country as required in Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive; this means that the appropriate measures have been taken into account.  As a result of energy efficiency measures, energy supply of Cyprus will be lower in comparison to that of the WEM scenario. This means that energy efficiency has indeed been given priority in comparison e.g. to stronger deployment of renewable energy.  All cost-effective policies and measures that are related to energy efficiency have been included in the PPM scenario; these involve renovations of residential and tertiary buildings and industrial equipment, strong promotion of public and non-motorised transport and switch to electric cars. These measures have a negative or near-zero total lifetime cost and are therefore cost-effective. Further energy efficiency measures are not recommended to be deployed because they have a very high cost per tonne of carbon abated (e.g. the renovation of very old buildings to become nearly-zero energy buildings) or are considered to be unrealistic (e.g. an increase in the number of energy renovations of buildings up to 2030, which would reach unprecedented levels of refurbishments that would require very high financial and human resources to realise). This finding is based Support Service in the recent past, and whose results were utilised in the NECP of Cyprus and in the current Impact Assessment study89,90.   It is particularly important to note that the PPM scenario foresees energy efficiency measures in transport (modal shift towards public and non-motorised transport and electrification of cars) which involve very significant investments that reach unprecedented levels for the standards of the Cypriot transport system. This underlines how strongly the Energy Efficiency First principle has been taken into account.  Apart from the cost-effectiveness argument mentioned above, further prioritising demand-side measures such as energy efficiency improvements would put Cyprus at risk of not meeting the two main objectives of Table 5.23 which are related to energy supply: the renewable energy target and the reduction in emissions of ETS sectors  which in the case of Cyprus is predominantly power generation. Therefore, measures in the electricity supply that have been foreseen in the PPM scenario are indeed those which are absolutely necessary for Cyprus to meet the above mentioned commitments.                                                            89 Vougiouklakis Y., Struss B., Zachariadis T. and Michopoulos A. (2017), An energy efficiency strategy for Cyprus up to 2020, 2030 and 2050.

(2018), Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Possible Climate Change Mitigation Policies and Measures. Final Report submitted to the European ervice under Service Contract No. SRSS/C2017/024. 212   As a result of the above considerations, energy efficiency measures in all end uses of the Cypriot economy, as foreseen in the PPM scenario and to the extent that they will be fully deployed, can greatly improve the security of energy supply of the country.  The only further policy that is worth examining is the implementation of a green tax reform that would involve carbon pricing in non-ETS sectors of the Cypriot economy. Such a reform can indeed stimulate further improvements in energy efficiency and substitution of liquid fossil fuels by low- or zero-carbon energy forms. In September 2019 the Finance Minister of Cyprus announced that a green tax reform will be put in consultation in 2020 with the aim to adopt the relevant legal framework and implement such a reform in 2021. However, considerations for the adoption of such a reform were still at an early stage by the time of this writing, so that it could not be considered as  5.2. Macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmental, employment and education, skills and social impacts, including just transition aspects (in terms of costs and benefits as well as cost-effectiveness) of the planned policies and measures described in section 3 at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures  5.2.1. Macroeconomic impacts 5.2.1.1. Methodology To assess the macroeconomic impacts of the PPM scenario in comparison to the WEM scenario, input-output (IO) analysis was applied. IO is a quantitative technique for studying the interdependence of production sectors in an economy over a given time period, which has been extensively applied for policy impact evaluation, technical change analysis and forecasting91.  For this purpose, the national Cyprus IO table available by the European Statistical Service (Eurostat) for 2015 was transformed to a system of linear equations accounting for the way in which the output of each economic sector is distributed through sales to other sectors (intermediate demand) and final demand (consumers). The IO framework has been incrementally extended to employ physical units to trace energy use and related environmental activities92.                                                             91 Miller, R.E., Blair, P.D.

(2019). Exploring the economy-wide effects of agriculture on air quality and health: Evidence from Europe. Science of the Total Environment, 663, 889-900. 213  Thus, a dynamic input-output model was developed and applied to estimate the economy-wide effects of the two different scenarios examined for the economy of Cyprus over time (to 2030). The rationale of this approach is that the PPM scenario will involve additional and/or different types of investments during the period 2020-2030 in comparison to the WEM scenario. These changes in investment needs were used as input in the IO model of Cyprus in order to simulate their effects on the economic output and employment of each main sector of the Cypriot economy.  5.2.1.2. Input data As a result of the simulations of the energy system with the OSeMOSYS model, for each one of the two scenarios (With Existing Measures and With Planned Policies and Measures) there is a projection of annual investments in each production sector of the economy as well as a projection of the annual expenditures of households for energy goods. For this analysis, investments were classified in seven categories, namely: (a) industry, (b) power generation technologies, (c) electricity storage technologies, (d) gas infrastructure, (e) electricity interconnector, (f) public transport, (g) private transport, and (h) buildings (energy efficiency measures). Model results of OSeMOSYS, outlined in Chapter 5.1, were introduced in the IO model through changes in its exogenous variables, that is, expenditure for investments per sector of economic activity. A critical parameter of the impact assessment is to what extent the production of the necessary equipment for implementing the investments of the two scenarios, and thus the relative expenditures, occurs inside the economy of Cyprus or abroad. The estimation of the associated macro-economic impacts is based on those investment expenditures that are spent inside the national economy and not directly imported from abroad. This analysis takes also into account the induced effects from energy savings, i.e., the reduced household expenditures for energy consumption. Table 5.24 presents the total estimated vector of spending within the national economy associated with the development and operation of all the interventions under the WEM scenario, and Table 5.25 presents the corresponding figures for the PPM scenario. The allocation of spending to the various economic sectors has been carried out on the basis of information obtained from a literature review93,94 as well as based on experience from our earlier application of such studies for Cyprus. It is noted that the investment costs consist of the capital and operation and maintenance cost. As mentioned above, to measure more accurately the impact of investments in the economy investments for each sector are divided into local investments and imports.                                                            93 Tourkolias, C., Mirasgedis, S., Damigos, D. and Diakoulaki, D.

Results Table 5.26 presents the economy-wide effects in terms of generated economic output and employment created by the investments under the two scenarios. The investments in the PPM scenario results in an annual increase of the economic output of the country ranging between 0.17% and 0.32% higher compared to the annual increase due to the investments under the WEM scenario for the period 2020-2030. Similarly, investments in the PPM scenario results in an annual increase of national employment ranging between 0.17% and 0.31% higher compared to the annual increase due to the investments under the WEM scenario for the same period. Specifically, in 2030, the economic output and employment of the country under the PPM scenario will be higher by 0.29%, compared to the respective figures of year 2030 under the WEM Scenario.  The estimated macro-economic effects associated with the Planned Policies and Measures are relatively higher during the last years of the study period, i.e., from 2027 to 2030. The notable change in 2027 is attributed to the increased capital and operational investments for the Transportation and Construction sectors, i.e., the sectors with the highest output multipliers in the economy of Cyprus. This change is mainly due to the large investments foreseen in the PPM scenario in the road transport sector, with substantial investments in new buses, the Nicosia tramline and other interventions for sustainable urban mobility. Thus, the increase in the final demand for products and services of those sectors through demand for investments, generate indirect growth effects to the other sectors of the economy (e.g., Machinery and Equipment, Banking-Financing, Real Estate, Accommodation and Food Services and others). 215  Table 5.24: Annual spending associated with investments and private consumption under the WEM Scenario by sector of economic activity for the period 2020-2030 (in million   2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Agriculture 1.1 1.5 1.9 2.3 2.7 3.1 3.6 3.6 3.7 3.8 Forestry 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Mining 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Food Manufacturing 3.6 4.9 6.2 7.6 9.0 10.4 11.9 12.0 12.2 12.6 Textile 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Wood and Paper 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Chemical and Plastic Products 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Metal Products 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Machinery and Equipment 14.9 14.1 13.7 12.8 12.4 12.1 12.5 12.6 12.8 12.8 Energy 475.5 498.3 516.8 532.0 545.4 566.2 586.4 603.3 625.0 637.4 Construction 88.8 106.1 119.3 135.9 150.6 165.7 188.0 190.0 194.9 195.3 Trade 62.4 75.7 89.3 102.6 116.0 129.9 143.8 145.5 148.5 151.7 Accommodation and Food Services 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.4 1.5 1.5 1.6 1.5 Transportation 10.0 11.2 12.4 14.3 15.5 16.8 18.0 18.2 19.3 18.0 Banking-Financing 21.2 25.0 28.5 32.1 35.7 39.4 43.5 44.0 44.9 45.8 Real Estate 9.9 11.6 12.1 13.7 14.5 15.4 17.2 17.4 17.8 17.6 Public Administration 4.9 5.8 6.7 7.8 8.7 9.7 10.7 10.8 11.0 11.2 Education 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Health 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Other Services 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0   216  Table 5.25: Annual spending associated with investments and private consumption under the PPM Scenario by sector of economic activity for the period 2020-2030 (in million   2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Agriculture 1.1 1.4 1.7 2.0 2.3 2.7 3.1 3.1 3.1 3.1 Forestry 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Mining 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Food Manufacturing 3.5 4.5 5.5 6.6 7.7 8.9 10.4 10.4 10.4 10.4 Textile 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Wood and Paper 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Chemical and Plastic products 8.1 8.1 8.1 8.1 8.1 8.1 8.1 8.1 8.1 8.2 Metal Products 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.1 4.1 4.1 4.1 4.1 4.1 Machinery and Equipment 17.5 16.7 16.5 15.7 15.6 15.5 15.4 16.1 16.0 15.8 Energy 473.1 493.6 511.0 524.0 534.3 552.1 569.1 583.8 603.1 614.5 Construction 127.8 149.2 166.6 186.8 203.2 220.8 239.2 257.6 272.1 272.6 Trade 61.8 72.9 84.1 95.1 106.5 118.6 133.0 136.9 138.1 137.8 Accommodation and Food services 1.1 1.3 1.5 1.8 1.9 2.1 2.3 2.6 2.8 2.8 Transportation 12.5 16.0 19.6 23.7 27.0 30.6 34.0 41.3 45.2 44.2 Banking-Financing 20.1 23.6 26.8 30.0 33.1 36.5 40.3 41.9 42.8 42.8 Real Estate 9.9 12.9 14.5 16.8 18.0 19.2 20.3 22.6 24.6 24.7 Public Administration 4.7 5.6 6.4 7.5 8.3 9.1 10.1 10.4 10.7 10.7 Education 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Health 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Other Services 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0   217  Table 5.26: vestments under both scenarios for the period 2021-2030.   2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Total Economic Output With Existing Measures   59,038 60,610 62,119 63,553 64,916 66,380 67,944 69,464 71,037 72,514 With Planned Policies and Measures  without electricity interconnection   59,187 60,756 62,261 63,691 65,047 66,510 68,060 69,646 71,257 72,725 Difference between Scenarios  0.25% 0.24% 0.23% 0.22% 0.20% 0.19% 0.17% 0.26% 0.31% 0.29% Total Employment With Existing Measures   477,810 490,408 502,484 513,952 524,825 536,458 548,936 560,590 572,776 584,814 With Planned Policies and Measures without electricity interconnection   479,173 491,684 503,675 515,089 525,884 537,489 549,866 562,166 574,636 586,502 Difference between Scenarios  0.29% 0.26% 0.24% 0.22% 0.20% 0.19% 0.17% 0.28% 0.32% 0.29% Note: Total economic output includes both intermediate and final demand and is hence higher than GDP which includes final demand only.     218  Table 5.27 presents the sectoral distribution of the generated economic output in the Cypriot economy in 2030 associated with the investments under the two scenarios. Evidently, the economic sectors that mainly benefit in the PPM scenario are: (a) Construction, (b) Metal products, (c) Wood and paper, (d) Transportation, and (e) Chemical and plastic products. The highest negative effects are observed in the economic output of the energy sector due to the reduced energy demand attributed to the implementation of energy efficiency measures in the PPM scenario. In the rest of the economy, there is a notable increase in the metal products output of the PPM scenario due to their use in the energy efficiency measures adopted in the PPM scenario, and an even larger increase in investments in construction. The construction sector has a strong local character and is skewed by large-scale investments, as the ones found in the PPM scenario, notably in new transport and energy infrastructure. The differences are overall quite small however, without a single sector showing disproportionately large changes compared to the others. A minor negative effect in the economic output of traditional activities of the economy such as agriculture is created, principally due to lower numbers of biofuels to be blended with transport fuels (these are forecasted to be used in larger quantities in the WEM scenario). It is important noting that the above analysis is bound by the use of IO modelling as a tool for investigating the distribution of investments cross-sectorally. The IO model does not allow for the simulation of fiscal effects, which may be important in this case since the measures in the PPM scenario assume large public investments in public transport infrastructure, and associated reductions in private investments in private vehicles. This alone could have a large effect on the government budget, but it is not captured in this model.

Competitiveness Aspects As will be explained in more detail in the next Section, in the absence of other policies (e.g. change in energy taxation) that could affect energy prices, changes between the WEM and PPM scenarios can be foreseen only in the retail prices of electricity and automotive fuels, while prices of other fuels used for heating or in industry are not affected. In the case of electricity, consumer prices are projected to remain essentially the same in the two scenarios. In the case of automotive fuels, due to additional blending of advanced biofuels in the PPM scenario, retail prices of gasoline are expected to rise by 1.5% in 2030 in comparison to those of the WEM scenario. These changes are very small and constitute a negligible share of production costs in the different sectors of the Cypriot economy. As shown in a previous productivity modelling study95, fuel price increases of the order of 7% for fuels and 12% for electricity were expected to affect production costs by less than 0.4%. This means that, in the case of the Cyprus NECP, with much lower changes in energy prices, no competitiveness concerns should arise. 5.2.2. Socio-economic impacts The implementation of strong energy and climate policies typically leads to changes in the These price changes in turn affect the cost of living of households in different ways. This section focuses on analysing the distributional effects induced by policies of the Planned Policies and Measures Scenario in comparison to the Existing Policies and Measures Scenario; this involves an assessment of how much Cypriot households of different income, location (urban and non-urban areas) and demographic characteristics are affected by the changes in prices of electricity and fuels due to the implementation of the PPM scenario. 5.2.2.1. Expenditures of Cypriot households on energy goods  A main concern with energy and environmental policies is that they may have a disproportionate effect on the most vulnerable parts of society by raising energy prices. Expenditures for energy goods are generally found to be regressive, i.e. low-income households spend a higher fraction of their income on these goods than high-income households. Despite this widespread belief, regressivity of energy expenditures is not always the case. Table 5.28 shows the annual expenditures of Cypriot households on main energy                                                            95 Keteni E., Mamuneas T. and Zachariadis T., 2013.

This information comes from the latest Household Expenditure Survey conducted by the Statistical Service of Cyprus on a representative sample of about 2,700 households in year 2015. According to the information of Table 5.28, Cypriot households used to spend on average about 3,100 Euros per year on fuels and electricity or 10.6% of their income in year 2015; poorest households spent around 1,300 Euros (19% of their income) while richest ones close to 5,000 Euros per year (6% of their income). This means that overall the expenditures on energy goods are indeed regressive. Half of these expenditures are for transport fuels on average, but the distribution among income groups is quite different: the poorest spend more on electricity and automotive fuels, and the rich spend more on automotive fuels. Overall, regressivity is strongest in the case of electricity, where poor households spend (as a fraction of their income) over three times more than rich households. This means that a change in the prices of electricity has a greater distributional effect than a change in the prices of other energy commodities.

Changes in energy prices between WEM and PPM scenarios  Table 5.29 and Table 5.30 present the projected evolution of prices of fuels and electricity respectively, according to the WEM and PPM scenarios of the NECP. In the absence of other policies (e.g. change in energy taxation) that could affect energy prices, changes between the two scenarios can be foreseen only in the retail prices of electricity and automotive fuels, while prices of other fuels used for heating or in industry are not affected.  In the case of electricity, changes in power generation costs will be the composite result of various differences between the WEM and PPM scenarios as explained in Chapter 5.1  mainly due to the higher penetration of renewables and the lack of electricity interconnection with neighbouring countries, which leads to additional investment needs for electricity storage. As a result, electricity costs are expected to be 2.7% higher in the PPM scenario in 2030. Taking into account other fixed costs of power generation, this decrease in generation costs is estimated to lead to a rise in consumer prices of electricity of about 1.5% by 2030. In the case of automotive fuels, the change in prices is due to the assumption that the 2030 renewable energy target obligation in the transport sector is achieved in the PPM scenario. This leads to additional blending of automotive gasoline and diesel with (more costly) advanced biofuels in line with the requirements of Article 25 of Directive 2018/2001/EU, thereby increasing the retail prices of gasoline and diesel by 2.0% and 0.9% respectively in 2030, or by 1.5% as a weighted average of the increases in total automotive fuel expenditure of Cypriot households.  If households were not able to react to these price changes, it would be possible to compute the change in the cost of living of each income group by multiplying the percentage change in prices of Table 5.29 and Table 5.30 by the corresponding expenditures of Table 5.28. However, in reality households adjust their consumption and their expenditures after a price change according to their preferences. The way each household reacts depends on different socio-detailed modelling of consumer behaviour is necessary, and the modelling approach that was adopted here is briefly explained in the next section. 222  Table 5.29: Projected evolution of electricity generation costs in the WEM and PPM scenarios.

Modelling approach  Household demand for energy and the subsequent distributional effect of energy efficiency or renewable energy policies has been analysed in several countries. These studies rely, inter alia, on data from household expenditure surveys conducted annually by national statistical agencies; this enables the empirical estimation of detailed income and substitution patterns. However, in some countries (Cyprus being one of them) household expenditure surveys are conducted less frequently. This poses problems to performing empirical demand analysis, as price variation over time is limited. To overcome this problem, an alternative approach was developed and applied with data from Cypriot households by Pashardes et al.96. This approach is based on the fact that price changes differ across goods, hence their effect can vary between households due to preference heterogeneity. For example, vegetarians are not affected by changes in the price of meat; therefore, when the only item in the food basket that increases in price is meat, only meat eaters face an increase in the unit cost of food.  In the case of energy, the unit cost is made from the prices of items such as electricity, gasoline, gas, heating oil, solid fuels and renewable sources. To the extent that these items do not increase proportionately in price and their shares in consumption vary across households due to preference heterogeneity, then the unit cost of energy also varies across households. Similar to the vegetarian example mentioned above, households without a car are not affected by a change in automotive fuel prices, whereas multi-car households may see a considerable increase in their cost of living if fuel prices rise. Thus, Pashardes et al. constructed a consumer theory based measure of the unit cost of composite goods commonly used for empirical demand analysis, and used the variation in this cost across households to estimate a demand system from a limited household expenditure surveys. They applied the method to estimate the price elasticity of household demand for energy in the context of an integrable complete demand system using data drawn from three household expenditure surveys conducted in Cyprus in 1996, 2003 and 2009 by the Statistical Service of Cyprus. Then they simulated the welfare effects of price households grouped by income, location and demographic characteristics.  This study uses the same model, simulating the effect of the above mentioned price changes in electricity and automotive fuel for the year 2030, in order to explore the welfare impact of scenario. 5.2.2.4. Simulation of welfare impacts  Based on the relative weight of expenditures on different energy goods (last row of Table 5.28), and on the outcome of Table 5.29 and Table 5.30 that the PPM scenario foresees changes in consumer prices of 1.5%, 1.5% and 0% for electricity, transport fuels and heating                                                            96 Pashardes P., Pashourtidou N. and Zachariadis T., Estimating welfare aspects of changes in energy prices from preference heterogeneity.

This means that the PPM scenario will have a slightly negative effect (i.e. an increase) on the cost of living of Cypriot households up to 2030, but overall the changes in household welfare are expected to be very small. This becomes evident if one observes the results of the welfare simulations shown in Tables 4, 5 and 6 of Pashardes et al., keeping in mind that the effects of that study were simulated assuming a 7.6% increase in the composite cost of all energy goods by 202097, whereas we assume here an increase of less than 1.5% in total energy costs in 2030. In our case, households in the low-income deciles may experience an increase in their costs of the order of 10--income groups may incur additional costs of 30--income and rich households alike. Obviously these changes are too low to be considered substantial. This holds both for urban and rural households. To summarise, the implementation of the PPM scenario is not expected to cause any substantial costs or benefits to households nor affect the distribution of income or poverty levels in the Cypriot society. Despite the considerable investments required and emission reductions achieved in the PPM scenario, as described in other sections of this Impact Assessment, there will be essentially no impact on energy affordability and social equity. 5.2.3. Employment impacts 5.2.3.1. Additional human resources in renewable power generation Investments in renewable energy technologies could have substantial local economy benefits in terms of job creation. Based on the results described in Chapter 3 of this report and on average figures provided through a relevant IRENA report98, a quantification of the employment potential is conducted for utility-scale PV installations in each scenario (Table 5.31).

These figures are broadly in line with the findings of increased employment found though the IO macroeconomic analysis in paragraph 5.2.1.3. In the case of wind installations, these are limited to 40.5 MW in both scenarios. As such wind99 are employed, the employment potential is significantly lower than for solar PV (Table 5.32). Again, the total new positions for wind are equivalent to 24, using the assumption of the previous paragraph.

Furthermore, since wind and solar PV equipment is primarily imported, aspects such as the manufacture of the components may not have an impact in the local economy.  5.2.3.2. Net employment impacts: The international evidence As outlined in Chapter 5.1 and will be further elaborated in Chapter 5.3, the scenario with PPM involves substantial additional investments in renewable power generation, energy efficiency in buildings and public transport, accompanied by reductions in the investments in fossil fuel power plants and conventional motor vehicles in comparison to the scenario with WEM. for a significant fraction of jobs in Europe and worldwide, there has been a growing interest in assessing the employment impact of the energy transition. According to a review of available studies conducted by the UK Energy Research Centre100, the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors are clearly more labour-intensive than the sectors related to fossil fuel power generation, both in terms of short-term construction phase jobs and in terms of average plant lifetime jobs. On average, 0.35 jobs are created per annual GWh of renewable energy generated or per energy saved thanks to an energy efficiency measure, compared to 0.2 jobs per annual GWh for fossil fuelled power plants.  When using such data, however, one should be cautious because it is not always clear i) whether such figures always express a net growth in jobs (i.e. jobs created minus jobs eliminated in other economic sectors); ii) whether this is a long-lasting effect or is meaningful only for the short to medium term; and iii) to what extent this effect is different if an economy is close to reaching full employment levels. Other studies in European countries have found that the adoption of renewable energy and energy efficiency policies yield net employment effects ranging from neutral (i.e. close to zero) to slightly positive (i.e. increase in employment)101,102impact assessment related to its strategic long-term vision for a climate-neutral Europe by 2050 contains, apart from modelling results, an extensive review of the available literature on employment impacts of green policies in Europe103. There seems to be a consensus that the transition towards more renewable energy and energy efficiency is unlikely to lead to negative aggregate effects on employment at both national and EU-wide level. What is particularly important in the assessment of the employment impact is how the additional                                                            100 UK Energy Research Centre (2014), Low Carbon Jobs: the Evidence for Net Job Creation from Policy Support for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, UKERC Technology & Policy Assessment Function, London, UK. 101 Pestel N.

In the long term, if the economy is expected to retuoverall economic efficiency, taking into account environmental externalities, the desired words, the proper domain for the debate about the long-term role of renewable energy and energy efficiency is the wider framework of energy and environmental policy, not a narrow  5.2.3.3. Overall assessment of the net employment impacts in Cyprus In the case of Cyprus, one can express with reasonable confidence the conclusion that the risk of reducing country-wide employment from the implementation of the PPM scenario is very low. This is based on:  Results from the economic modelling reported earlier in Chapter 5.2, which indicate a slight increase in net employment (1,688 new positions in 2030 between the two scenarios, see Table 5.26);  The international evidence mentioned above about positive employment effects of green policies;  The fact that the number of employees in the fossil fuel sector (power plants, oil companies etc.) is relatively limited. On the contrary, it should be expected that a significant number of additional jobs may be created to enable deployment of energy efficiency and renewable energy measures because of the substantial shift of investment towards these sectors up to 2030. At any rate, the implementation of the PPM scenario in Cyprus is very likely to yield positive employment impacts, at least in the short to medium term. These are expected to be stronger if the measures assumed in the scenario are implemented without reducing the purchasing power of Cypriot households and without absorbing a large amount of national public funds. Public investments that can be supported from the EU budget and private investments that may be facilitated through financing instruments of the European Investment Bank or Cypriot banks may be particularly beneficial in this regard. 5.2.4. Environmental and health impacts As shown in Chapter 5.1, implementation of the PPM scenario leads to reductions in the emissions of air pollutants which cause health effects. Table 5.33 uses information from Table 5.10 and Table 5.19 and shows the relative change in emissions of the three main air pollutants in the year 2030, compared to those of the WEM scenario. The decrease in PM emissions by 4.8% is due to a lower use of biomass in the Heating and Cooling sector, as well as to lower fossil fuel consumption in road transport. NOx emissions are lower in the PPM scenario by 3.9% due to a lower gas-fired generation, as well as a lower dependence on 229  gasoline and diesel passenger cars. Conversely, an increase is expected in SO2 emissions (by 9.1%), because increased renewable power generation in the PPM scenario in the absence of electricity interconnection with other countries leads to slightly more oil-fired generation compared to the WEM scenario. The health effects of the main air pollutants are well documented in the literature, and there is a growing number of assessments about the actual impacts to human health due to exposure of people to high levels of ambient concentrations of certain air pollutants. The impacts are usually expressed in premature deaths and in years of life lost. Premature deaths are deaths that occur before a person reaches an expected age. This expected age is typically the life expectancy for a country stratified by sex. Years of life lost (YLL) are defined as the years of potential life lost due to premature death. It is an estimate of the average number of years that a person would have lived if he or she had not died prematurely104.  According to the European Environment Agency, exposure of Cypriot population to high levels of ambient concentrations of PM, NO2 and ozone gave rise to about 580, 240 and 30 premature deaths per year respectively in year 2016105. Emission reductions shown in Table 5.33 for the PPM scenario will lead to an improvement in air quality, especially in cities, and thus to a decrease in premature deaths and years of life lost. It has to be noted that there is no direct relationship between emissions and ambient air concentrations, and a part of air pollution is due to transport of air pollutants from other countries. These two facts underline that it is not straightforward to assess the change in health impacts from the reduction of national air emissions alone. Still, one can reasonably estimate that under the PPM scenario, the number of premature deaths caused by emissions of PM and NOx may decrease by about 20-25 per year. Exposure to SO2 concentrations has decreased over the past few decades in Europe. Since 2007, the exposure of the urban population to concentrations above the EU daily limit value has remained under 0.5%. Therefore, seriously adverse impacts on human health are expected to be very few. However, SO2 emissions are still regulated at EU level because of the role of this substance to corrosion in buildings and acidification of soils causing loss of biodiversity. Under the Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the Reduction of National Emissions of Certain Atmospheric Pollutants, Cyprus is committed to reducing its national SO2 emissions (compared to those of year 2005) by 83% by 2029 and by 93% from 2030 onwards. Implementation of the PPM scenario, in the absence of higher levels of electricity storage or electricity interconnection with other countries, will make compliance with these targets difficult. On the other hand, implementation of the PPM scenario will help Cyprus achieve the corresponding obligations about the emissions of NOx and PM2.5.  The health benefits mentioned above can also be expressed in monetary terms by using assessments of the external cost of each pollutant; this is the sum of the economic damage                                                            104 European Environment Agency (2018), Assessing the risks to health from air pollution. https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/health-impacts-of-air-pollution/assessing-the-risks-to-health 105 European Environment Agency (2019), Air quality in Europe  2019 report.

For assessing the cost of NOx, PM and SO2 emissions, calculations of European studies were used: results from the CASES project106 for emissions from power plants, and from Ricardo-AEA107 for road transport emissions. All values were transformed to constant Euros per tonne of pollutant. As explained elsewhere108, these damage costs increase over the years, so that a variable external cost is used per year. The last column of Table 5.33 contains an estimate of the reduction in damage costs thanks to the reductions in pollutant emissions in the PPM scenario; overall the economic benefit due to reduced air pollution of the PPM scenario 016 in 2030; as a total over the whole decade 2020-2030 the emissions because these have the most adverse health impacts and hence the highest damage costs per tonne109.

Financial Implications of WEM scenario in the Electricity Supply Sector Investments foreseen in power generation will significantly affect electricity costs in total. Thus, due to the considerable investments in the electricity supply sector, the average cost of gross electricity generation increases gradually during the modelling period. Undeniably, this is a function of the assumed fuel price and technology costs adopted in the model. Figure 5.6 provides a breakdown of the different system cost components; these are all undiscounted110. As illustrated, a reduction in cost is achieved when the system shifts fully                                                            106 FEEM (2008), CASES (Cost Assessment for Sustainable Energy systems)  Final Conference Proceedings and External Costs Database. 2008.  107 Ricardo-AEA (2014), Update of the Handbook on External Costs of Transport.

Taking into account that the discount rate adopted is 8.5% for 231  towards gas-fired generation in 2021-2022. It can be noticed that variable costs (i.e. fuel costs) are the main driver of the electricity cost till 2030. Regarding the actual investment costs, these are illustrated for each technology in Figure 5.7.   Figure 5.6: Average cost of electricity and breakdown of system cost components  WEM scenario.

PVPumped HydroLi-Ion batteries232  5.3.2. Financial Implications of PPM scenario in the Electricity Supply Sector Due to the higher RES penetration, and reduced dependence on fossil-fired generation, both enabled by the interconnector, the cost of electricity remains relatively stable throughout the model horizon in the PPM scenario (Figure 5.8). In comparison to the WEM scenario, electricity cost increases by 2% in 2030. The increase in cost is driven by the fact that less electricity is generated for a similar level of generation investments, despite the lack of investments in storage technologies.   Figure 5.8: Average cost of electricity and breakdown of system cost components  PPM scenario. As compared to the WEM scenario, investment requirements in the electricity supply sector (which are presented in Figure 5.9) are marginally lower in the PPM scenario. There are no investments in battery storage or pumped hydro, but these are higher for utility-scale solar PV deployment; annualised investments in this technology amount to 44 million EUR in the PPM scenario, as opposed to 40 million EUR in the WEM scenario in 2030.

Additional Economy-Wide Investment Needs in the PPM Scenario In contrast to what is projected for electricity supply alone, the PPM Scenario foresees that the level of economy-wide investments needed up to 2030 to implement all these measures is lower than that of the WEM Scenario. Error! Reference source not found.Chapter 5.1 resents these estimated investment needs. The power generation and electricity storage sector needs fewer investments in the PPM Scenario because, as explained in Chapter 5.1, energy efficiency measures reduce the demand for electricity compared to WEM.  Enabling a significant modal shift towards sustainable modes of transport is an important ingredient of a serious decarbonisation policy, and this is reflected in the PPM Scenario. The purchase of new, clean buses and the construction of a tram line are costly measures, with iinvestment needs  which are expected to be covered by the national budget and perhaps partly through EU funds  are counterbalanced by the decline in purchases of new vehicles, 2020-2030 period. These very substantial savings account for 15-20% of the annual purchase costs of new cars foreseen in the WEM Scenario. Energy renovations in buildings of the residential and tertiary sector, if implemented actively up to an extent that is considered realistic in Cyprus, will require by the year 2030 additional investments of about 715 million Euros. This amount is expected to come from a combination of public and private investments and is the result of extensive data collection and discussions with MECI in the frame of previous Technical Assistance studies111; this amount is consistent with the level of achievable energy savings in households and services which have been calculated in the PPM scenario. Similarly, investments in industry to reach period 2020-2030. In total, as shown in Table 5.34, implementation of the PPM is projected to economy-wide foreseen in the WEM Scenario. The main reason for this, as explained above, is the substantial decline in the expenditures for new cars because of the significant shift towards public and non-motorised transport foreseen in this scenario. This counterbalances the amount of investments required for promoting public transport, cycling and walking through the implementation of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans that the government of Cyprus is currently preparing. Even if the above mentioned decline in private car investments is considered ambitious and optimistic and one assumes lower reductions in the purchase of new cars, the additional investment needs are not expected to amount to more than 1.4 -2030; these may account for about 0.5% of the                                                            111 For a summary, see Zachariadis T., Michopoulos A., Vougiouklakis Y., Piripitsi K., Ellinopoulos C. and Struss B., Determination of Cost-Effective Energy Efficiency Measures in Buildings with the Aid of Multiple Indices.

Out of the investments shown in Table 5.34, those for private transport are expected to come from private sources, whereas those for sustainable transport modes are expected to come from public funds. As regards buildings and industry, it should be expected that about half of the amount of 792 million Euros will come from public funds in order to mobilise an equal amount of private funds for energy renovations and replacement of equipment, appliances and machinery. This is in line with the experience obtained by national authorities from the implementation of energy efficiency subsidy schemes during the last years. As a result, it should be expected that about 1.4 billion Euros for sustainable transport investments and about 400 million Euros for renovations in buildings and industrial plants will have to be funded from the government budget, or from EU funds.  In total, the required additional investments to realise the PPM scenario are entirely feasible for the standards of the Cypriot economy and, as will be shown later in this report, will pay off because fuel import costs throughout the lifetime of these measures may decline considerably due to these investments. Still, in view of the substantial amount of public funding needed, it is advisable that a considerable portion of this may come from EU funds such as the EU Structural Funds or loans from the European Investment Bank.  An indication about the cost-effectiveness of these investments is provided in the separate impact assessment study.

Impacts of planned policies and measures described in section 3 on other Member States and regional cooperation at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures  5.4.1. Regional Infrastructure Projects A key theme that arises implicitly is that of regional cooperation. The Cypriot NECP has regional impact directly associated to two major pieces of infrastructure, which may enable trade of electricity, via the EuroAsia Interconnector on the one hand, and natural gas, via the EastMed pipeline on the other hand. Through a conducted sensitivity analysis, the modelling effort in the supporting impact assessment study has attempted to illustrate the benefits offered by the EuroAsia Interconnector on the electricity supply system of Cyprus. It should be noted that in this study the systems of Greece and Israel are represented as simple nodes of electricity demand and supply; as such, the insights offered by the analysis have significant limitations. Overall, the sensitivity analysis indicated that if the interconnection is established, Cyprus can become a net exporter of electricity, fuelled primarily by solar PV facilities. Even though domestic gas production and the potential development of the East Med pipeline are not explicitly modelled in the present analysis, it is expected that the project will not have direct impacts on the energy mix of the island. Since natural gas, whether imported or domestic, will be provided to the internal market at international market prices, the cost-competitiveness of gas-fired technologies will remain unaffected. Nonetheless, revenues attained through the exports of domestic natural gas may be recirculated in the Cypriot economy, thus affecting the purchasing power of economic actors. Similarly, the revenue secured by the state could to a degree be utilised for the support of clean energy technologies. For instance, the existence of financial incentives could promote further investments in technology options that facilitate the decarbonisation of the system; such technologies include but are not limited to solar photovoltaics, electric vehicles, heat pumps or energy efficiency measures.  Efforts of the local authorities in the near future should be directed to reaching an agreement with neighbouring countries as to the assumptions to be employed in regards to major infrastructure projects. This is of critical importance in the case of the EuroAsia Interconnector112, especially since it can have a drastic effect on the Cypriot energy outlook. However, assumptions regarding size and development schedule of other projects such as                                                            112 Recent developments regarding the EuroAsia Interconnector occurred after finalisation of the bulk of the present analysis. Specifically, it has been decided that development of the portion of the cable connecting Crete with Attica will not be undertaken within the PCI-status EuroAsia Interconnector project, but will rather be developed as a national project. As such, this could have a significant impact on the electricity exchange potential between Cyprus, Israel and Greece. The degree of this impact will depend on the capacity of the two separate projects (i.e. Crete-Attica and Crete-Cyprus-Israel), the timeline for their full operation, as well as the interoperability between the two projects. 236  and trade potential of the countries in question. Similar observations apply for the case of other potential gas pipeline development between Cyprus and Egypt. 5.4.2. Market Integration A long-term cost-optimisation model has been used for the scenario analysis. These types of models assume that a perfectly functioning and predictable market exists in the system in question. This in turn implies that perfect competition occurs between the market participants, who act as price-takers and provide energy at a marginal production cost, while perfect foresight allows market participants to be fully aware of all present and future conditions affecting the cost at which they provide or purchase energy. In essence, since optimisation models assume perfect market conditions, model outputs are presented in terms of potential for improvement so as to recognize the extent at which cost-competitive investments of certain technology choices are financially viable. The EU has placed significant importance in the full liberalisation of the internal electricity market.113 It should be noted that the plans for the full implementation of a competitive electricity market in Cyprus are gradually moving forward. Once fully implemented, the electricity market would create a favourable environment for investors, under which the technology investments foreseen in generation and storage infrastructure can occur.  For instance, in the WEM scenario a pumped-hydro project of 130 MW is deemed as cost-competitive, not only for energy arbitrage, but also for provision of operational reserve. This centralized storage option can store electricity from variable RET in periods of high output, as a preferred alternative to curtailment. Additionally, if flexibility of existing thermal units in Cyprus is not improved and output from thermal plants cannot be ramped down or even shut off easily to accommodate variable generation, storage can be useful for the operation of these units as well. For instance, the most efficient units in Cyprus are the combined-cycle gas turbines, but these cannot be turned on and off constantly as the cost of operation would increase dramatically. Instead, they could potentially be run constantly for long periods of time, even at low loads, making use of the storage infrastructure.  Therefore, it can be argued that centralized storage  while primarily an enabler for RET  can act for the benefit of the whole system. Control of the centralized storage to an extent can be handled by the Transmission System Operator (TSO), but the most complex issue is agreeing on which stakeholder would act as the investor of such a project and hence bear the financial risk. The market environment in which the project operator will function and generate profit has to be clear. Since a functioning liberalized electricity market structure is still in its early development stages in Cyprus, conditions are not yet ideal for investors. Generally, in Europe the legal framework of handling storage assets in unbundled markets is                                                            113 2009 Concerning Common Rules for the Internal Market in Electricity and Repealing Directive http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2009/72/oj. 237  not perfectly clear as requirements such as grid support become more prominent114. Depending on the status of the network operator, a complete or partial ownership and operation by either the transmission and distribution system operator or a third-party is a plausible business model that allows provision of both network and market services.  Despite the fact that deployment of lithium-ion batteries is capital-intensive, it is calculated as economically optimal to also develop this storage option, as it allows for additional cost-competitive generation from variable renewable energy options. In this case, a lower system cost is achieved through time of use arbitrage, where cheap electricity from solar PV can be used to charge the storage during the day and then be used during peak demand periods in the evening. Provision of ancillary services, in terms of operational reserves, can further increase the attractiveness of this technology as an option.  Further, lithium ion batteries can be deployed at both the centralized and the distributed level; for instance, at residential or commercial buildings. In order for the technology option to provide grid support, installation of ICT infrastructure is a prerequisite, as it assumes operation of a smart grid1144, which will have a cost associated to it. At the same time, even though decentralized batteries can potentially offer both energy arbitrage and ancillary services for the grid, the cost of capital lies with the consumer. As such, incentives will have to be given to provide the market conditions for consumers to invest in such a technology and be willing to offer use of their infrastructure for facilitating in a smooth operation of the grid. Furthermore, the establishment of a competitive electricity market internally is important for the operation of a regional electricity market. In case the EuroAsia interconnector project proceeds successfully, it can allow for an increase in the renewable energy share in the electricity supply sector. According to conducted sensitivity analysis, this increased RET deployment corresponds mainly to solar PV and assumes that at times when generation will exceed domestic demand, the excess can be transmitted to Israel or Greece. Similarly, it is assumed that during periods of low PV output, electricity can be readily procured from these neighbouring systems. This assumes the existence of a framework through which the involved systems can trade at cost-efficient prices and volumes, similar to the way Nord Pool is structured. This Nordic power exchange currently operates in 9 countries (Nordics, Baltics, Germany and UK)115 and trades electricity between market participants at the intraday or day-ahead stages, as well as allowing for long-term contracts of up to five years116.

Discussion of Policy Options  The Impact Assessment of the National Energy and Climate Plan of Cyprus, as presented in this Chapter, leads to some clear indications about the outlook of energy and climate policy of the country with a view to meeting the objectives foreseen in the EU Energy Governance Regulation. The following sections focus on a cost-benefit and a cost-effectiveness assessment of the policy options that seem to be available to Cyprus at this stage. 5.5.1. Costs and Benefits of Planned Policies and Measures Table 5.35 displays a summary of the projected change in total energy system costs of the PPM scenario in comparison to the corresponding costs of the WEM scenario. Cost differences are presented for each main group of measures that are included in the PPM scenario: power generation, electricity storage, construction of the electricity interconnector, measures for promoting public and non-motorised transport, measures related to motor vehicles, and policies related to energy efficiency improvements in buildings and industry.  Cost differences are presented separately for investment costs and operation & maintenance costs; the latter also include fuel costs, and in many cases these are negative, reflecting the savings in fuel expenditures that can be achieved in the case of energy efficiency measures in transport, buildings and industry. Note that fuel costs that were included in these calculations are net of taxes and duties in order to reflect the societal effect from the reduction of fuel import costs. At the end of the table we have added the economic benefits foreseen due to reduced damages from air pollution, in line with the assessment shown in Chapter 5.2.  It is evident that the policies and measures foreseen in the PPM scenario are expected to be beneficial to society. Total benefits, including the environmental ones, are over 500 million additional investments, especially in energy efficiency measures and sustainable transport modes, although designed to be effective over a longer time horizon, pay off to a large extent by the end of the decade: fuel cost savings in buildings and industry as well as reduction in the purchase and use of private cars lead to a substantial decrease in operation costs and therefore to the total energy system costs. The benefits become also somewhat larger thanks to the improvements in air quality and the associated benefits from lower health impacts. One might argue that these results are optimistic because of the projected strong reduction in the fleet of passenger cars, which leads to much lower investments for private transport in the PPM scenario. However, if one observes the figures of Table 5.35, it is evident that the PPM scenario leads to lower energy system costs even without the reductions in investments of private transport. This leads to a clear conclusion that the implementation of 239  Planned Policies and Measures will be beneficial to society, leading to a reduced fuel import bill and improved air quality. This finding is in line with international evidence, such as the -depth analysis of the carbon neutrality objective, 117 the World Bank118 or other organisations.119  The above conclusion is valid as long as the policies and measures foreseen in the PPM scenario are actually realised. There are financial and behavioural barriers that may delay or cancel the deployment of some of these measures. However, the analysis shows that these measures seem to be the only way for the country to approach its long-term energy and climate policy commitments.                                                            117 -Depth Analysis in Support of the Commission Communication COM(2018) 773 -  118 World Bank (2014), Climate Smart Development.

Ranking of Policies and Measures According to their Cost-Effectiveness Which measures should be prioritised among those included in the list of Planned Policies and Measures? A first answer could be that all measures have to be implemented because, as shown in Table 23, even their full deployment is not sufficient to make Cyprus comply with the legally binding target of the Effort Sharing Regulation, i.e. to reduce its non-ETS emissions by 24% in 2030. However, as public policy always has to take into account practical or political constraints, it is still useful to provide recommendations about the costs and emissions abatement potential of each measure. Such an analysis can only partly be made with models like OSeMOSYS, because it requires -available in energy system models. We therefore report in this section some results of a previous Technical Assistance study that was conducted for the government of Cyprus, and has undergone peer review in an academic journal120. Data used in that study are consistent with those used in the OSeMOSYS model and in the present report. The study led to the construction of a baseline and several alternative marginal emission abatement cost curves for policies and measures in the Cypriot non-ETS sectors. Nationally appropriate data were collected from earlier studies and from the local market. The results of this detailed analysis showed that the most cost-effective measures are the following:  Roof insulation in pre-2008 residential multi-family buildings;  The installation of heat pumps in pre-2008 residential buildings;  Cogeneration in the industrial and tertiary sector;  Increased use of anaerobic digestion for animal waste;  Replacement of oil-fired burners in industry. Measures that are not recommended to deploy because they have a very high cost per tonne of carbon abated are the renovation of very old buildings to become nearly-zero energy buildings, and wall insulation of pre-2008 buildings. All other measures are worth investing in, and most of them lead to negative social costs, which means that they yield benefits to society because the fuel cost savings during the lifetime of these investments outweigh the initial investment costs. The benefits are even stronger if the reduction in health damages because of lower air pollutant emissions are also taken into account.  However, at a realistic rate of building and equipment renovations, many of the above cost-effective measures have a relatively limited potential to reduce GHG emissions up to 2030. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to proceed with policies for decarbonising road transport, i.e. with the promotion of public and non-motorised transport and the electrification of the car fleet. Only these measures can yield significant emission reductions, and although they seem to be more costly than others, they are beneficial to society if all their benefits are taken into account.                                                            120 Sotiriou C., Michopoulos A. and Zachariadis T., On the cost-effectiveness of national economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions abatement measures. Energy Policy 128 (2019) 519529. 242  Obviously, the findings of that project are in line with the results reported in the previous section of this report. Therefore, the recommendations mentioned above are fully relevant for this study as well. That study dealt with non-ETS sectors only. As regards the justification of ETS-related measures that are included in the PPM scenario of this Impact Assessment study, i.e. those related to power generation and electricity storage, it is clear that they are necessary for reaching the ETS emission reduction target and the renewables penetration target as shown in Table 5.23. The measures described above relate to energy use, agriculture and waste. Apart from these measures, additional options are included in the PPM Scenario, namely a) the proper recovery of fluorinated gases in industrial equipment and b) afforestation. The following paragraphs comment on the cost-effectiveness of these two measures.   As regards fluorinated gases, a legislative obligation is under preparation, which will apply to new installations and new amounts of gases to be used in existing installations. For gases that are currently in use, which have not been regulated up to now, a financial support scheme has been prepared by MARDE in order to facilitate their proper recovery. The scheme has been designed in such a way that it leads to emission reductions which correspond to avoided costs (for purchasing additional emission allowances due to non-compliance with the ESR target) that are higher than the cost of the scheme. In other words, benefits of emission reductions outweigh the costs. This has been estimated assuming gradually increasing emission allowance prices, which overall lie around 30-35 Euros per tonne of CO2eq. Therefore, one can safely state that fluorinated gas recovery passes the cost-effectiveness test and is worth pursuing.  As far as afforestation is concerned (the main LULUCF-related measure that seems to be relevant for Cyprus), MARDE announced in September 2019 plans to proceed with planting of trees around Cyprus. Starting from around 70,000 trees in 2020, it is planned to reach 300,000 trees planted per year in 2030. Moreover, MTCW prepared a proposal for planting of trees along urban and inter-urban roads of Cyprus. According to MCTW, not include a cost asscreation of the infrastructure for the one million trees (not including watering and maintenance costs). As regards the emission reductions due to absorption of CO2, MCTW estimates a capture of about 2.5 kt CO2 per year by 2030, starting from very low levels and increasing gradually as trees grow. If one assumes a total absorption of 10 kt throughout the period 2020-2030, to account for the gradually increasing number of trees planted, at a cvery high cost per tonne of CO2 abated. This clearly does not pass the cost-effectiveness test. However, if one keeps in mind that trees have a very long lifetime and will absorb higher amounts of CO2 when they grow further, this measure can be considered as important (and maybe cost-effective) in the longer term. Still, for achieving the 2030 non-ETS emission target, it seems to be an option with low potential and large uncertainty about its feasibility. Keeping in mind the above information, Table 5.36 provides a summary of the cost-effectiveness assessments mentioned in the last two Sections. It describes the contribution 243  of all major non-ETS sectors to emissions covered by the Effort Sharing Regulation in year 2017, based on the latest data of the National Inventory Report of greenhouse gases submitted by the Republic of Cyprus. It also displays the evolution of emissions of these sectors between 2017 and 2030. The fifth and sixth column present the estimated investment costs and total net costs (from investment, operation and maintenance) for the entire period 2020-2030 by sector, on the basis of the assessments made in our study; such costs are not provided for the policies and measures related to waste management, agriculture and recovery of fluorinated gases, as it has not been possible to collect or reliably estimate costs for the relevant measures foreseen by national authorities. It should be underlined that, even of this cost information were available, it would not be appropriate to calculate a cost-effectiveness index on the basis of costs and emission abatement during the decade 2020-2030 only. Most of these measures have a much longer lifetime and will hence continue to yield emission benefits over a period much beyond 2030. The proper way to compare cost-effectiveness of measures with different lifetimes is to calculate the annualised discounted costs and the corresponding emission abatement of each investment. This is done in the eighth and ninth column of Table 5.36, which provide summary information on costs per tonne of CO2eq. abated for each sector, based on the results of the study of Sotiriou et al. (Energy Policy 128 (2019) 519529). The last column shows assessments made with the aid of information provided by governmental authorities on the management of fluorinated gases and afforestation  measures that had not been considered by Sotiriou et al.  The overall conclusion that can be drawn from Table 5.36 is that most policies and measures considered in the PPM scenario pass the cost-effectiveness test as their costs are lower than the central estimates of damage costs of GHG emissions (also called 121. Especially if the economic benefits due to reduced emissions of air pollutants are taken into account, most measures show a negative social cost, which means that they yield net benefits to society and are therefore particularly worth implementing immediately. The only sector for which cost-effectiveness is not clear is that of solid waste management, where important measures have to be taken for proper treatment of municipal waste, as outlined in the relevant section of the NECP. As regards afforestation, it seems to be costly over the short and medium term, but if one takes into account that trees have a very long lifetime and can therefore reduce carbon emissions for many decades, it turns out to be a beneficial measure; it has to be noted, however, that the costs of afforestation may have been underestimated because cost estimates do not include water and maintenance costs, which may be particularly important for trees planted around the road network.                                                            121 IWG (Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon), 2013.

It should be emphasized that RES self-consumption energy was not examined as a possible sector that can reduce the energy demand due to the self-consumption energy for heat-pumps. 245  5.5.3. Multi-criteria assessment of the two scenarios  Based on the main results of the impact assessment that were presented in Chapters 5.1-5.4, and on the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness appraisals reported earlier in this Chapter, it is possible to compare the WEM and PPM scenarios of the Cypriot NECP on the basis of a set of criteria. This section provides a brief multi-criteria evaluation of the two scenarios. 1. Energy and environmental criteria: The Planned Policies and Measures Scenario is clearly the preferred scenario with regard to all energy and environmental criteria included in the energy Union strategy. It can lead to:   Lower GHG emissions (14.7% lower in 2030 compared to 2005, as opposed to only 3% emission reductions in the WEM scenario);  Improved energy efficiency, which can lead to compliance with the requirements of Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive, as opposed to non-compliance in the WEM scenario;  Improved penetration of renewable energy sources, reaching 30% of total energy consumption in 2030 and leading to compliance with the corresponding EU-wide objective, as opposed to 20.7% in the WEM scenario which is not sufficient to meet the EU-wide commitment;  Achievement of the EU objective for reaching 14% share of renewable energy in transport by 2030, as opposed to just 7% in the WEM scenario;  Improvement in air quality thanks to a reduction in emissions of most air pollutants in 2030 compared to the WEM scenario, leading to fewer public health problems in the population of Cyprus, to a decrease in premature pollution-related deaths and to a reduction in health-throughout the decade 2020-30. Thus the PPM scenario is the one that can enable Cyprus tto comply with its international climate obligations deriving from the Paris Agreement.  2. Economic criteria: The Planned Policies and Measures Scenario is the preferred scenario with regard to the economic criteria considered in this study. More specifically, it can result in:   A small increase in national GDP by the year 2030, of the order of 0.3% compared to the WEM scenario; this will be a result of the re-allocation of investments in the PPM scenario and the re-adjustment of economic output towards activities with higher local value added, coupled with a decline in costs for importing fossil fuels thanks to the substantial decrease in fossil fuel consumption compared to the WEM scenario;  An overall benefit to society thabe a combination of reduced energy system costs (thanks to energy savings in buildings, industry and primarily in road transport) and reduced health-related economic damages.  246  3. Social criteria: The Planned Policies and Measures Scenario is also estimated to yield slightly better results in employment and social welfare because:   It is projected to lead to somewhat higher employment, about 0.3% higher in 2030 compared to the WEM scenario, which means about 1700 more full-time work positions; this will be a result of the re-structuring of the economy towards jobs in economic sectors that benefit from the increased promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy.  It is expected to have an essentially zero effect on social equity, i.e. negligible effects on the distribution of income between households of different income groups; this will be the composite result of changes in electricity and fuel prices between the WEM and PM scenarios as explained in Chapter 5.2. 4. Governance criteria: In terms of administrative costs, simplification of planning, reporting and monitoring obligations, and ensuring a coordinated and coherent implementation of the Energy Union strategy across its five dimensions, the PPM scenario is not expected to add considerable administrative burden compared to the WEM scenario; conversely, because the PPM scenario is clearly superior to the WEM scenario in all other criteria mentioned above, it will certainly contribute to a better implementation of the Energy Union strategy across its five dimensions.  5.6. Conclusions of the Impact Assessment  NOTE The Impact Study was completed in November 2019 and therefore the results reflect the data available at the time. On 12 December 2019, the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on annual submission of Cyprus submitted 122, announced the acceptance of the revised Cyprus greenhouse gas emission inventories for the period 1990 - 2017. As a result the emissions of the non-ETS sectors for 2005 (reference year for the national reduction target) increased from 3954 kt CO2 eq. to 4266 kt CO2 eq. This affects the results of the impact analysis only on the issue of achieving the greenhouse gas emissions reduction target and the associated costs for purchasing greenhouse gas emission allowances for compliance. Specifically, taking into account the expected results of the implementation of the policies and measures included in the National Plan, and in particular of the new planned policies and measures, it appears that based on the revised emissions of 2005 (4265 kt CO2 eq.) the national mandatory target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions of the greenhouse is covered to a great extend (a 21% decrease is expected by the end of the period compared to 24% which is the target).                                                            122 https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/arr2019_CYP.pdf 247  In view of the above, it appears that while the national mandatory target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the end of the period is not expected to be fully met, due to the use of the flexibility mechanisms available in the ESR, Cyprus is not expected to have any financial cost for purchasing additional greenhouse gas emission allowances. The following are the original conclusions of the Impact assessment. The Impact Assessment of the National Energy and Climate Plan of Cyprus has been based on detailed modelling of the energy system of the country, which was mainly conducted with the OSeMOSYS optimisation model. Final energy demand projections for sectors other than road transport have been derived from a separate demand forecast model that has been used for the assessment of national energy efficiency action plans of Cyprus in the recent past, which were then input to OSeMOSYS. The optimisation results, as shown in Chapter 5.1, along with the associated costs and calculated emissions of GHGs and air pollutants, have been fed into other models in order to assess the macroeconomic and employment impacts of the two scenarios that were explored. Apart from the above energy-related data and results, information about emissions abatement and costs for non-energy-related GHG emissions were obtained from the relevant calculations of national authorities that are included in the NECP of Cyprus. Taking into account that national authorities have decided to proceed in their energy and climate policy in three stages time steps base on the 3 reporting periods (Stage 1 implement all PPMs till 2022, Stage 2 additional PPMs based on the progress of stage 1 and Stage 3 being an intention to proceed with more ambitious measures in the near future in order to fill the gap towards the -24% CO2 target), the main findings of the Impact Assessment can be summarised as follows: 1. Existing policies and measures (Stage 1 of the national climate policy) are clearly insufficient to lead Cyprus to compliance with its obligations stemming from the Energy Union Governance Regulation. They cannot lead to compliance with the national renewable energy and energy efficiency targets, and they can only lead to 3% reduction in non-ETS emissions in 2030 compared to 2005; this will require purchasing a significant amount of emission allowances to fill the 2030 emissions gap, which, under optimistic assumptions, will cost the Republic of Cyprus at least 131 million Euros123 in the period up to 2030. Moreover, non-compliance with the 2030 target of 14% renewable energy in transport will lead to additional costs in the WEM scenario, because the gap in renewable share will have to be covered through the Statistical Transfer procedure. 2. The Planned Policies and Measures scenario that will be implemented in stages, is able to make Cyprus meet its goals. If fully implemented, these measures will lead to net accompanied by small positive effects on economic indicators  a 0.3% increase in                                                            123 This calculation is based on assumptions provided by MARDE about the evolution of ETS allowance prices up to 2030. They are considered to be optimistic because Cyprus will not have the right to er states expect to be in deficit of allowances for meeting their 2030 ESR targets, it is likely that the cost for purchasing allowances to cover the non-ETS emissions gap will be considerably higher. 248  national GDP and a 0.3% rise in economy-wide employment in 2030. The changes in energy costs to end consumers will be very small and overall will have essentially no adverse impact on the welfare of households and social equity.  3. Road transport holds the key to emissions abatement both for 2030 and for the longer term. Investments in sustainable mobility may exceed 1.3 billion Euros throughout the period 2020-2030 and can therefore be considered as costly. However, these investments are expected to fully pay off because of multiple benefits from the reduction of the use of passenger cars, which can yield aggregate economic benefits to passenger car sector, they can enable achieving the 2030 non-ETS emission reduction target and shifting the whole Cypriot economy to a low-carbon path towards 2050. 4. There are essentially no higher investment requirements to realise the PPM scenario, but a re-allocation towards public investments for sustainable transport; these are expected to pay off because fuel import costs throughout the lifetime of these measures may decline considerably due to these investments. 5. However, successful implementation of the package of Planned Policies and Measures is not guaranteed because it requires significant investments for energy renovations in buildings and industry and  most importantly  a substantial commitment to promote public transport and non-motorised transport modes (walking and cycling) as well as a shift to electric cars. 6. Among the list of Planned Policies and Measures, some measures are more cost-effective than others (e.g. roof insulation or installation of heat pumps in buildings and further deployment of rooftop PVs and solar panels for hot water use). However, with very few exceptions, all other measures pass the cost-effectiveness test and can be deployed without delay. 7. Non-energy-related measures can also contribute to emission reductions. Recovery of fluorinated gases seems to be cost-effective, while extensive planting of trees may be a measure with relatively limited potential and high cost up to 2030, but is an important ingredient of decarbonisation policy in the longer term. 8. In the event that the project of electricity interconnection of Cyprus with Greece and Israel is realised, penetration of renewable energy will be considerably higher. This will enable substantial additional investments for decarbonising the electricity system, and will be able to put Cyprus on track to meet its long-term decarbonisation targets. On the other hand, if the project is not materialized substantial investments are needed in Energy Storage to support at least the minimum level of RES penetration that is required for the Cyprus to meet the RES targets for 2030. On the other hand, if the project is not materialized substantial investments are needed in Energy Storage to support at least the minimum level of RES penetration that is required for the Cyprus to meet the RES targets for 2030. 9. On the way to decarbonisation of the energy system, research and innovation can play an important role. Although great technological breakthroughs are unlikely to come 249  from research in Cyprus alone, the existence of a critical mass of researchers in topics such as energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and fuels, and emission abatement measures can accelerate a) the demonstration and deployment of novel technologies in Cyprus, b) the implementation of innovative measures under the particular conditions of the Cypriot market, and c) the development of expertise for innovative services related to low-carbon technologies. 10. Even if implemented fast and effectively, Planned Policies and Measures are not sufficient for reaching the non-ETS GHG emission reduction target of 24% by 2030, as required from Cyprus in the Effort Sharing Regulation; the reduction can only reach 14.7% in the PPM scenario. In order to achieve full compliance, the government of Cyprus has to choose between three options: a. Not proceed with further GHG emission abatement measures and use instead flexibility mechanisms to purchase emission allowances, with the associated costs; these are estimated to reach at least 55 million Euros up to 2030 but as indicated in point 1 above, may reach much higher levels if several EU Member States are in need to purchase emission allowances to fill their own emission abatement gap. b. Implement stronger emission abatement policies and measures (e.g. double the number of energy renovations of buildings, increase cogeneration plants or biogas production plants from waste, encourage accelerated replacement of conventional cars with electric ones); however, all these measures are extremely difficult to implement at such a scale within the short time frame available; therefore they cannot be considered as a realistic alternative. c. Induce energy conservation measures through the adoption of a fiscally neutral green tax reform, by imposing a gradually increasing carbon tax on all non-ETS sectors. The revenues of such a tax can be recycled in the economy by reducing labour taxes and providing financial support to energy conservation and green transport policies. Such a reform can have substantial economic benefits without harming low-income households or the competitiveness of firms124.                                                            124 Zachariadis T., A Proposed Green Tax Reform for Cyprus and its Co-Benefits for Urban Sustainability In: Critical Issues in Environmental Taxation, Ezcurra M.V., Milne J., Ashiabor H. and Andersen M.S.

In view of the declared political commitment of the European Union to carbon neutrality by 2050, the measures foreseen in the NECP of Cyprus and the options mentioned above for filling the non-ETS emissions abatement gap have to be assessed in light of the need for deep decarbonisation. It has been shown that it is impossible to attain the 2050 target if there is low ambition about decarbonisation in 2030.125,126,127 Therefore, purchasing allowances to fill the 2030 emissions gap is both costly and does not lead to a strong decarbonisation path towards 2050; hence it is not the preferred option for the government of Cyprus.  12. In September 2019 the Finance Minister of Cyprus announced that a green tax reform will be put in consultation in 2020 with the aim to adopt the relevant legal framework and implement such a reform in 2021. As this measure is still provisional and no specific details have been agreed, it has not been included by authorities in the Planned Policies and Measures scenario of the NECP. Based on the previous considerations outlined in this section, the gradual implementation of a green tax reform from 2021 onwards (Stage 3) seems to be a necessary additional policy, both for leading Cyprus to achievement of the non-ETS emission reduction target of 2030 and for enabling the transition to a net-zero-carbon economy by 2050.                                                               125 Zachariadis T., Michopoulos A., Vougiouklakis Y., Piripitsi K., Ellinopoulos C. and Struss B., Determination of Cost-Effective Energy Efficiency Measures in Buildings with the Aid of Multiple Indices.
