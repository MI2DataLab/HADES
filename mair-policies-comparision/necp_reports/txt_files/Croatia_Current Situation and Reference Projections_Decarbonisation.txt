4.2 Dimension decarbonization 4.2.1 Greenhouse gas emissions and removals i. Trends in current GHG emissions and removals within the framework of the EU Emissions Trading System, Effort Sharing Regulation, LULUCF and other energy sectors  The trend of GHG emissions in the Republic of Croatia is presented in Figure 4-6. 183   Figure 4-6. Trend of GHG emissions in the Republic of Croatia Since 1 January 2013, plants in the Republic of Croatia participate in the EU Emissions Trading System for GHG. The emissions from ETS and non-ETS sectors are available for 2005 and for the period from 2013 to 2017 (Figure 4-7).  Figure 4-7. Trend of GHG emissions from ETS and non-ETS sectors in the Republic of Croatia ii. Projections of GHG emissions by sector with existing national policies and measures and EU policies and measures  Projections of GHG emissions by sector with existing national policies and measures and EU policies and measures by 2040 are presented in Figure 4-8.  184   Figure 4-8. Projection of GHG emissions with existing measures 4.2.2 Energy from renewable sources  i. Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in each of these sectors In the case of the scenario with existing measures (Scenario S0), RES shares and forecasts with existing measures are presented below. Table 45.: Indicative trajectories of RES shares by 2030 in the scenario with existing measures RES share, % Projection 2020 Projection 2030 (Scenario S0) In the gross final consumption of energy 28.6 34.0 In the final consumption of electricity 47.0 62.2 In the final consumption of energy for heating and cooling 33.3 35.2 In the final consumption of energy in transport 5.2 7,3 ii. Projections of sectoral developments in addition to existing national and EU policies and measures, at least until 2030. The following figure shows the expected trajectories (shares) for the observed categories: total RES in the gross final consumption (Figure 4-9), RES in electricity (Figure 4-10), RES in 185  heating and cooling (Figure 4-11) and RES in transport (Figure 4-12) for the scenario with existing measures.
