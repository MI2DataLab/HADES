2.5 Dimension Research, innovation and competitiveness   In order for Lithuania to evolve from an energy technology importer into an energy technology producer and exporter, it is necessary to promote the experimental and industrial development of the most promising energy technologies as well as innovation incubators, research and pilot implementation of research results in practice. Research and development in the field of energy in Lithuania and the products developed must be integrated into industrial production and become part of Lithuanian exports, thus contributing to the economic growth of the country. Lithuania needs to identify energy research and innovation priorities at national level and focus on them to create a competitive advantage. There are currently two strategic documents setting out guidelines for national policies to promote research and innovation in the context of the Energy Union, namely the National Energy Independence Strategy and the Smart Specialisation Strategy.  Objectives set out in the National Energy Independence Strategy One of the four strategic areas established by the strategy adopted in 2018 (in addition to Competitiveness, Reliability, Climate Change Impact and Reduction of Ambient Air Pollution (Energy Saving and Green Energy)) is Pacontext, the objective has been set for Lithuania to evolve from an energy technology importer into an energy technology developing and exporting country. The goal for Lithuania is to become a centre of information technology and cybersecurity solutions for energy, biomass and biofuel technologies, solar and wind energy technologies, geothermal technologies, energy market development, changes of electricity system operation, development of new electricity system management approaches and implementation of energy projects.  Taking into account the specificities and needs of the Lithuanian energy sector, the strategic objectives, and the existing and desirable competencies, the following priority areas of energy research and development have been identified:  Planning the prospective development of the energy sector, and energy economy;  Modernisation of existing energy production technologies to take account of new challenges and requirements;  Development and network integration of new technologies for low greenhouse gas and ambient air emissions and climate change energy generation and storage; integration into the EU's strategic value chains;  Power generation technologies from indigenous and renewable energy sources;  Electrical system performance analysis and improvement of electrical system management;  Technologies for distributed energy production, smart grids, and production and use of new viable forms of energy  Ensuring security and quality of electricity supply, vulnerability of electricity systems and 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 48   optimisation of operating modes;  The functioning of electricity markets, power mechanisms and active involvement of consumers in the functioning of the electricity system and markets;  Energy and cyber security, reliability of energy equipment and systems, and resistance to cyber attacks.  The National Energy Independence Strategy of Lithuania also stipulates that in order to promote the development of energy innovation and the use of energy competences and the results of research and development in other areas of the economy, also to stimulate export growth and creation of new forms of business in the country:   Synergies between scientific and academic institutions, energy companies and engineering industry companies will be enhanced by promoting cooperation in different forms (including international cooperation), through investments from the EU framework programme for research and innovation Horizon 2020, national and other programmes, developing digital energy innovations and improving technologies in Lithuanian energy, thereby strengthening the Lithuanian research and innovation ecosystem;  Partnerships and support programmes will be developed between energy companies and engineering industry companies to foster cooperation in the development and application of digital energy innovation and technological development, with a view to closer cooperation between energy businesses and education institutions;  Tax measures will encourage investment in the technological development of the production of solar, wind, biomass, biofuels and other renewable energy sources, the improvement of production, the acquisition of technology and the development of a centre of excellence, and the development of liquefied natural gas technologies and a centre of excellence;  Involvement of engineering industry companies in the development and market integration of new liquefied natural gas technologies, technological equipment and means of transportation will be promoted;  Development of new energy production technologies, including energy from renewable energy sources, distributed energy production, smart grids and their integration into the energy system will be promoted;  The production of electricity storage technologies will be encouraged by attracting investment in the production of these technologies in Lithuania;  Possibilities for offshore wind energy technology production by attracting investment in the production of these tda port will assessed;  Technologies for the production and use of local energy sources will be developed, produced and  exported;  Information technology solutions to optimise the energy sector will be promoted and tested in Lithuania and the export of such products will encouraged;  Energy facilities and infrastructure construction companies will be strengthened in order to increase their added value, promote the export of services and innovation of such companies; 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 49    Production of solar technologies will encouraged by establishing Lithuania as the largest centre of excellence and exporter of solar technologies in the Baltic and Nordic region. An addition promising area in order to promote the development of energy innovation and the use of energy competences and the results of research and development in other areas of the economy, also to stimulate export growth and creation of new forms of business in the country is the use of hydrogen in energy, industry and transport. It is also necessary to further develop carbon capture, use and storage technologies and to analyse their applications in Lithuania. The European Innovation Fund will provide support estimated at EUR 10 billion over the period 2020 to 2030 for five strategic areas, two of which are directly related to CO2 storage.  Objectives of the Smart Specialisation Programme In order to focus resources on the areas with the highest potential, in 2014 Lithuania adopted the Smart Specialisation Strategy 20142020 (final target values to be set for 2023). 3 of the 7 research, development and innovation (RDI) priorities of this programme are relevant for the National Plan: is important in the efforts ensure clean, reliable and intelligent energy for the consumer. Progress in this area will help to achieve the goal of Lithuania and, at the same time, Europe as a whole becoming a leader in renewable energies. This priority includes rapid development of alternative energy sources, alternative fuels and energy-saving technologies, which would increase energy efficiency in end-use, boost Lithuania's competitiveness in clean energy technologies and open up potential for growth and jobs. Areas of implementation of the   enhancing interoperability between distributed and centralised generation, networks and energy efficiency;  meeting the needs of existing and new end-users, and strengthening energy efficiency and smartness;  development of the use of renewable biomass and solar energy sources and the recycling of waste for energy recovery. The priority "Intelligent, clean, interlinked transport" must contribute to the national challenge of reducing the impact on climate change in the transport sector, where GHG emissions have only been growing so far. In order to achieve the objectives of the National Plan in the field of transport, the introduction of clean, environmentally friendly and environmentally sustainable transport technologies is expected to reduce the negative impacts of the transport system on climate and nature (air pollution, noise), while reducing the transport sector's dependence on fossil fuel and energy imports. Innovative solutions for intelligent transport systems and autonomous transport are needed to achieve a breakthrough. Changing mobility paradigms requires the development and application of new mobility models and the integration of engineering, information technologies, means of communication, flow management, data processing and other solutions. Joint interdisciplinary projects should increase the competitiveness of the products being developed on the market and the efficiency of the entire transport system. Areas of implementation of the pr  intelligent transport systems; 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 50    technologies/models for the management of international transport corridors and for the integration of transport modes. The priority "New production processes, materials and technologies" is important to ensure efficient and sustainable business development and the introduction of digital solutions and new technologies in industry, thereby increasing productivity and added value. Increasingly demanding energy efficiency, safety, durability and other requirements for materials and structures around the world are constantly increasing the need for RDI activities and enabling businesses to engage in innovative activities. The size of the sector also makes it possible to increase international competitiveness much more, not only by achieving certain physical or mechanical characteristics of the composite materials and structures being developed, but also by reducing their production costs. The implementation of the priority is particularly relevant in the context of industry digitalization (Industry 4.0).  New manufacturing processes, materials and technologies  photonic and laser technologies;  advanced materials and structures;  flexible technologies for product development and production.  Implementation of all measures under the Smart Specialisation Programme across all priorities is expected to produce the following results, in 2023:  investment in RDI in Lithuania will increase to 1.9% (from 1.04% of GDP in 2015);  employment in knowledge-based sectors will reach 13.6% (9.7% in 2017);  the number of patent applications will double (150 applications in 2023);  The number of small and medium companies using new products or processes will double (40% in 2023);  the number of innovative SMEs will double (35% in 2023).  National targets for the promotion of clean energy technologies The current situation, national targets and measures to promote investment in innovative technologies for the development of clean, renewable sources and energy efficiency are also covered in a number of other strategic documents:   The strategy Lithuania 2030 and the National Progress Programme implementing that Strategy envisaged enhancing business incentives to invest in green technologies. (In addition, the National Progress Programme 20212030, which is currently being developed, sets a target of RDI funding from all sources in Lithuania at a minimum 2% of GDP by 2030).  The Sustainable Development Strategy envisages the introduction of cleaner production methods, promotion of recycling of secondary raw materials and building recycling capacities as one of the more important tasks of industrial development.  The Industrial Development Programme covers the need promote energy efficiency in industry, increased use of renewable sources of energy as well as introduction of technologies reducing carbon dioxide emissions.  The 2014-2020 Programme for Promotion of Investment and Industrial Development aims at energy efficiency and increasing the use of RES. 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 51     3.1.1. ction 3.1   Trends of research into climate change processes An important factor for climate change mitigation and adaptation in all sectors of the economy is RDI development by creating favourable investment conditions for risk assessment and training of qualified professionals. Insufficient GHG reductions in individual sectors may be caused by new technologies that are too costly or underdeveloped, and by insufficient practical applications. In order to promote RDI, the European Commission has proposed a new EU resHorizon Europe, one of the priorities of which is climate change. 35% of this programme would be devoted to promoting the development of GHG zero-emission technologies. Research required in Lithuania in the sectors of agricultural and land use, land use change and forestry:   alternatives to the cultivation of annual crops;  breeding of low-methane bovine breeds;  change in the composition of feedingstuffs;  the possibility of changing land use in order to increase the absorption of GHG in biomass and/or soil;  industry-appropriate low GHG production techniques;    identification of ecosystem changes, invasive species, etc.  Lithuania is carrying out research on climate change, but there is no uniform system for publishing the results of the research. Cooperation between science and business is needed to increase the practical application of RDI.  National targets concerning competitiveness In order to ensure that Lithuania actively participates in the processes of the fourth industrial revolution and to ensure industrial competitiveness while achieving ambitious climate targets, the Ministry of Economy and Innovation pursues the following objectives:  To promote active digitisation of industry, thereby increasing international competitiveness;  To promote an efficient industrial transformation towards a circular economy;  To promote the integration of industry into European strategic value chains (9 selected strategic value chains for European development were officially announced by the EC at the end of January 201949). The strategic value chains related to the National Energy and Climate Change Plan and relevant for Lithuania are the following:  batteries;  interconnected, clean and self-contained vehicles;  low-carbon industry;  hydrogen technologies and systems.                                                            49 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/stronger-and-more-competitive-eu-industry-president-juncker-open-2019-eu-industry- days_en
