INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 46   2.2 Energy Efficiency Dimension Overview of key targets:  improving energy and material efficiency in all sectors (and therefore reducing consumption of energy and other natural resources) as the first and key measure for the transition to a climate-neutral society,  by 2030 improve energy efficiency by at least 35% in relation to the 2007 baseline scenario (in line with the Energy Efficiency Directive),  ensure the systematic implementation of policies and measures adopted, so that final energy consumption will not exceed 54.9 TWh (4 717 ktoe),  reduce final energy use in buildings by 20% by 2030 compared to 2005 and ensure a reduction of GHG emissions in buildings by at least 70% by 2030 compared to 2005,  speed up implementation of programmes for informing, raising awareness and training of different target groups on the benefits and practical aspects of the development and use of EEI technologies and the use of RES. Energy and material efficiency in connection with sustainable use and local energy supply is the most important developmental segment of modern society. The accelerated development of these areas, which is based on increasing the quality of energy services with less energy input, is one of the cornerstones of the transition to a climate-neutral society and will have a key impact on the competitiveness of Slovenian industry and society in future, and it is important to reinforce the already highly developed competencies of Slovenian companies in this field. Efficient use of energy and natural resources is a priority and key measure of development and energy policy for increasing competitiveness and decarbonisation of Slovenian industry and society. For Slovenia, the accelerated development of energy-efficient technologies also means reducing energy dependency, which will contribute not only to the achievement of environmental and climate goals but also to an increase in security of energy supply and to other beneficial national economic effects. 2.2.1 National contribution to energy efficiency by 2030 Slovenia's goal is to improve energy efficiency by 2030 by at least 35%, i.e. so that with the systematic implementation of the policies and measures adopted, final energy consumption in 2030 will not exceed 54.9 TWh (4 717 ktoe). Converted to primary energy terms, consumption in 2030 will not exceed 73.9 TWh (6 356 ktoe). The NEPN scenario confirms that Slovenia can by 2030 achieve a 35% reduction in final and primary energy consumption compared to the 2007 PRIMES reference scenario, a more ambitious target than the overall EU target of 32.5%. Transport has the greatest impact on the long-term management of primary and final energy consumption and - due to high volatility, expected growth trends and a large share of energy consumption (in 2017, 36% of total final energy consumption)  will, if measures are not implemented, seriously jeopardise the achievement of the targets set for 2030.

INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 48   2.2.2 Savings achieved under the mandatory savings scheme Slovenia will continue to implement the mandatory energy savings scheme for end consumers51 by implementing energy services and measures from energy suppliers and the Eco fund and will upgrade the scheme in line with the amendments to the Energy Efficiency Directive.52 The new annual savings for the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030 should be at least 0.8% of annual final energy consumption compared to the average over the last three years before 1 January 2019. The commitment will be split over the 2020-2030 period into the contribution of providing savings to energy suppliers and, through an alternative measure, implementing the Eco fund programmes and tax mechanisms.53 The savings made under the mandatory savings scheme are shown in the table below.

This will also substantially reduce emissions of other harmful substances into the atmosphere. The objective is also to in the area of sustainable construction. A new Long-term renovation strategy to support the renovation of buildings by 2050 in line with Directive 2018/844 amending the Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings and Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency is in preparation and will also be brought into line with the NEPN and the Long-Term Climate Strategy.                                                             51  Decree on ensuring energy savings, UL RS No 96/14. 52  Directive (EU) 2018/2002 of 11 December 2018, available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/SL/ALL/?uri=LEGISSUM:4372644. 53  The NEPN envisages a gradual increase in the environmental tax on CO2 and the contribution to energy efficiency. Prior to the notification of an additional alternative mechanism, it will be necessary to carry out more detailed analyses of energy price flexibility in view of the anticipated increase in duties. 54  Long-term strategy to encourage investment in the energy renovation of buildings (DSEPS),  October 2015, available at: http://www.energetika-portal.si/fileadmin/dokumenti/publikacije/dseps/dseps_final_okt2015.pdf. 55  Supplement to the Long-Term Strategy for the Promotion of Building Energy Investment, February 2018, available at: https://www.energetika-portal.si/fileadmin/dokumenti/publikacije/dseps/dopolnitev_dseps_feb_2018.pdf.

The expected changes in final energy consumption by sector and fuel are shown in the figure below. Figure 11: Expected changes in final energy consumption by individual sectors and fuels  Key to Figure 11:  Final energy consumption  Solid fuels  Liquid fuels  Gaseous fuels  Res and waste  Electricity  Heat  Hydrogen Energy savings in the NEPN scenario in 2030 TOTAL  Industry Transport General consumption The penetration of energy-efficient technologies in the markets today is limited primarily by the lack of information and limited investment capacity of end consumers. The NEPN anticipates that necessary social changes and related changes in financial flows will occur in the next decade, significantly accelerating the penetration of competitive energy-efficient technologies. Additional support is planned for the implementation of new technologies and further development of energy services and to manage their quality: design, implementation, construction supervision, targeted monitoring of energy use and active energy management in buildings. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 50   Slovenia has started drawing up an assessment of potentials for efficient heating and cooling, and plans are being made to develop a comprehensive heating and cooling strategy, a district heating action plan and heat maps. The vision, defined by strategy in the area of market development to establish adequate infrastructure associated with alternative fuels in the transport sector in the Republic of Slovenia and also contained in the NEPN, envisages intensive promotion of e-mobility. In order to achieve these goals and accelerate the promotion of e-mobility, it is necessary to ensure, by 2021, the adequate conditions to accelerate the transition from the existing to the new, smart distribution network, which will, with the necessary reinforcements and information and communication technology, enable connections between customers, suppliers and manufacturers and the development of new services specifically aimed at optimising costs, increasing reliability and reducing environmental impacts in the accelerated electrification of personal transport.
