Greenhouse gas emissions and removals In terms of consistency with the objective set out in Article 2.1.a of the Paris Climate Agreement, Luxembourg is aiming at a national level to reduce GHG emissions for the sectors outside the emissions trading scheme by 55% by 2030 compared to the base year 2005. In fact, the IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels states that it will only be possible to limit global warming to 1.5 °C if global greenhouse gas emissions are halved by 2030 (compared to current levels), followed by climate neutrality by 2050.  to the EU target in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/842 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030. The GHG reduction target enshrined in this regulation for the sectors outside the emissions trading scheme is 40% by 2030 compared to 2005. The annual emissions budgets are calculated on the basis of a linear reduction trajectory between the real average GHG emissions in 2016 to 2018 and the points target for 2030. According to Regulation (EU) 2018/841 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry in the 2030 climate and energy framework, each EU Member State is given a target for the LULUCF sector5. Taken together, the debits from the land use categories included in the accounting (in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2018/841) may not exceed the credits at the end of the two five-  2.1.2. Renewable energy Luxembourg is aiming to increase the share of renewable energy from 11% in 2020 to 25% by 2030.  According to current scenarios, the national expansion of renewable energy by 2030 would amount to 19.6%, in each case on the basis of the gross final energy demand, in other words the sum of the sectoral energy demands for electricity, heat and fuels in the transport sector. In addition to ambitious renewable energy policies, what these scenarios have in common is a significant increase in energy efficiency (see Section 2.2) and thus a reduction in energy demand, which in turn implies an additional increase in the share of renewable energy in relation to consumption. However, in line with the EU target (increasing the renewable share to 32% at EU level by 2030), a national contribution of 25% would appear to be reasonable                                                            5 LULUCF: Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 33   and appropriate. To cover the corresponding shortfall, it is advisable to cooperate with other EU Member States, which would involve the use of the cooperation mechanisms that had already proved themselves by 2020. Cooperation with other Member States as well as statistical transfers will be further developed and will include concrete projects (e.g. large solar installations in southern Europe or offshore wind installations).  Target volumes at sectoral and technological level will be presented below, while the following chapters contain a discussion of the measures and an impact assessment. The results and values presented relate to the target of 25%.

However, this can and should change significantly in the coming years, thus making it a consistent continuation of the trend that has been set in the recent past. Renewable energy such as wind energy and photovoltaics, but also biomass  the core technologies in the field of electricity generation for Luxembourg  have also seen considerable growth in recent years. In the space of a decade, their contribution has doubled  both in the electricity sector (from 3.3% in 2007 to 8.1% in 2017) but also in  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 34   terms of heat production (from 4.4% in 2007 to 8.1% in 2017). In the transport sector, this change has been even more pronounced. The renewable energy share was 2.2% in 2007 and increased to 6.4% in 2017.

Resch et al. 2019), using a variety of possible development trajectories and corresponding energy scenarios. The target scenario presented in this plan corresponds to 25% in 2030. If the status quo (2017) and the reference development, which corresponds to a continuation of the existing policies, are additionally taken into account, the increase is even more noticeable. The share of renewable energy in gross final energy demand, in other words the sum of the sectoral energy demands for electricity, heat and fuels in the transport sector, would accordingly increase from 6.4% in 2017 to 12.9% in the case of merely continuing with the existing policies (reference development)  as illustrated by corresponding data in Section 4 of this report. If additional interventions are made, in both renewable energy and energy efficiency, an increase to 19.6% in 2030 would be possible in accordance with the target scenario presented here.   Table 1 provides information on the sectoral decomposition of the overall balance and Table 2 provides supplementary details on the potential underlying technology split. Accordingly, the highest growth is expected for renewable energy in the electricity sector. Here, a share of around 33.6% appears possible for 2030  including on the basis of projects that are already in progress (for example in the field of wind turbines, solar installations and biomass cogeneration). By 2040, the share of renewable energy in gross electricity consumption would then increase further to a remarkable 45.4%. In second place in terms of the speed of change is the heat sector. Considerable growth compared to the current situation is expected here, partly in line with electricity generation (biomass cogeneration), but also at a decentralised level, for instance in the case of heat pumps, solar thermal collectors for water heating or modern biomass heating systems. Accordingly, the share of renewable energy in the heating sector would rise from the current 8.1% (2017) to 30.5% by 2030 and to 47.1% by 2040. The considerable increase in the share of renewable energy in the years after 2030 is mainly a consequence of the significant increase in energy efficiency, and thus the reduction of energy demand in the heating sector. Furthermore, a massive increase in the use of renewable energy is also expected in the transport sector. This assumes an increase in biofuel blending (second generation). It is also assumed that the biofuel mix up to and including 2030 will consist of a maximum of 5% of first-generation fuels6, measured by total road transport fuel demand. The aim is also to massively increase e-mobility. Overall, this will result in a significant increase in the share of renewable energy in the transport sector, to 25.6% by 2030 and 54.3% in 2040 (using the calculation logic established                                                            6 More specifically, both the target and the reference scenarios assumed that by 2030 the share of first-generation biofuels could be reduced to 2.5% of road transport fuel demand.   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 36   under EU Directive 2018/2001). The required renewable energy volumes, which are to be covered in future by renewable energy cooperation with other countries, as they are necessary to achieve the envisaged renewable energy targets of 11%7 in 2020 and 25% in 2030, are also listed in Table 2. In the target scenario considered here, these amount to 1 TWh in 2020 and 1.75 TWh in 2030 (and beyond).                                                              7 In the target scenario, the assumed renewable energy cooperation volumes (1 TWh) mean that the national minimum target (11%) will be exceeded in 2020  thus, taking into account renewable energy cooperation, a renewable energy share of 12% of gross final energy demand is achieved.
