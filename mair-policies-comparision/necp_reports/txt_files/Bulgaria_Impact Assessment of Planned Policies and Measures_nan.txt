5. IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF PLANNED POLICIES AND MEASURES 5.1 Impacts of planned policies and measures described in section 3 on energy system and GHG emissions and removals, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures (as described in section 4).  i. Projections of the development of the energy system and GHG emissions and removals as well as, where relevant of emissions of air pollutants in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/2284 under the planned policies and measures at least until ten years after the period covered by the plan (including for the last year of the period covered by the plan), including relevant Union policies and measures. Greenhouse gas emissions Projections under the WEM scenario indicate that by 2030 total greenhouse gas emissions will decrease by 47.85 % as compared to 1990. Under the WAM scenario an accelerated decrease has been projected, with emissions decreasing by 49 % as compared to 1990. This warrants the conclusion that the target will be achieved under both scenarios. In addition, under the WEM scenario in 2030 total greenhouse gas emissions (including from the LULUCF sector) are projected to reach 48 871 ktoe CO2 eq., decreasing from 54 656 ktoe CO2 eq, in 2015. Under the more ambitious WAM scenario, total emission will decrease to 47 553 ktoe CO2 eq. Under both scenarios in 2030 LULUCF sector removals are projected at -8 593 ktoe CO2 eq., which represents a small improvement compared to 2015 data (-8 489 ktoe CO2 eq.). With regard to CO2 capture by the LULUCF sector, both scenarios envisage a significant change in LULUCF removals in the following decades. In some cases, LULUCF sector removals are even projected to decrease, the arable land category being a case in point. This may happen due to intensifying human activity, which constrains land use for plant cultivation, and the average age of forests, which account for the greatest share of LULUCF removals).   233  Share of energy from renewable sources The national target of 27.09 % of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption by 2030 set under the WAM scenario is in line with the European recommendation for Bulgaria to raise the level of ambition for 2030 by setting a target of at least 27 %. Under the WEM scenario the possible share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption will be significantly lower (24.72 %). Furthermore, the shares of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption in 2030 compared to 2020 are projected to register a higher increase in all three sectors: electricity, heating and cooling, transport. A comparison of the share of energy from renewable sources under the two scenarios is set out in the table below. Table 54: Comparison between scenarios  2020 2030 WAM WEM WAM WEM Share of energy from renewable sources, % 20.20 20.18 27.09 24.73 RS-Heating and cooling, % 31.07 30.97 42.60 36.11 RS-E, % 21.40 21.43 30.33 29.60 RS- 9.89 9.89 14.20 11.87  Net electricity production under the WAM scenario will be 1.7 % higher compared to the WEM scenario owing to the planned increase in electricity generated by wind farms and power plants using biomass. The net electricity output of hydropower plants under the two scenarios is the same.  Figure 70 Structure of net electricity generation from renewable sources in 2030 by plant type under the WEM and WAM scenarios (GWh)  HPP PhvP WF Biomass-powered power plants Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling, Deloitte analysis    234  ii. Assessment of policy interactions (between existing policies and measures and planned policies and measures within a policy dimension and between existing policies and measures and planned policies and measures of different dimensions) at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, in particular to establish a robust understanding of the impact of energy efficiency/energy savings policies on the sizing of the energy system and to reduce the risk of stranded investment in energy supply Most planned (additional) policy measures envisaged in this Plan supplement existing the Energy Union thereby contributing to the achievement of targets at EU level. In this sense, existing and planned (additional) policy measures complement each other as the latter aim to primarily expand the scope of the former by building on them and enhancing their impact. With regard to energy efficiency, the analysis of key energy performance indicators, presented as primary and final energy savings and costed for the PRIMES 2007 scenario, show higher overall energy savings under the WAM scenario. In 2030, planned (additional) policy measures are projected to result in additional energy savings of 1 TWh as compared to the energy savings projected to be achieved under the WEM scenario. Energy savings [in some sectors] will be lower on account of the projected increase in demand as a result of robust economic activity. I other words, taking into account the energy savings projected under the WAM scenario, which are partially offset by growing economic activity, no significant impact on the scale of the energy system is expected. iii. Assessment of interactions between existing policies and measures and planned policies and measures, and between those policies and measures and Union climate and energy policy measures Both existing and planned policy measures are consistent and complement Union energy and climate policy measures. Furthermore, all existing and planned policy measures implemented across the five dimensions of the Energy Union are fully in line with EU law and/or contribute to the achievement of EU targets in the area of energy and climate.   235  5.2 Macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmental, employment and education, skills and social impacts, including just transition aspects (in terms of costs and benefits as well as cost-effectiveness) of the planned policies and measures described in section 3 at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures Both scenarios (WEM and WAM) have been developed on the basis of the same microeconomic data on GDP and GDP per capita in 2030. With a population of more than 6.6 million people and GDP of EUR 71.06 billion, in 2030 GDP per capital will reach EUR 10 775. Energy transformation With existing measures, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources will lead to a reduction in t % by 2030 compared to 2015.  Figure 71:  WE< scenario (left) and WAM scenario (right)   Despite this, WAM scenario implementation will lower this factor to 513.7 tonnes of CO2 per million EUR in 2030, which corresponds to a decrease by 47.4 % as compared to 2015. The implementation of the WAM scenario as opposed to existing measures will result in a decrease in carbon intensity by an additional 3.5 % in 2030.      236  Net import scenarios.  Table 55 Comparison between net import of fuels under the two scenarios  2020 2025 2030  0.08% -2.25 % -5.21 % Solid fuels -0.41 % -5.00 % -12.47 % Oil and petroleum products 0.45 % 0.55 % -0.44 % Natural gas -0.40 % -3.48 % -8.22 % Electricity 0.06 % 0.00 % 0.00 % Biomass and waste -3.14 % -40.06 % -36.68 % Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling, Deloitte analysis The comparison between the two scenarios shows that WAM scenario implementation will result in net imports decreasing by 5.21 % in 2030 compared to the WEM scenario. More specifically, net imports of solid fuels, natural gas, and biomass and waste will decrease by, respectively, 12.47 %, 8.22 % and 36.68 %. The export of electricity remains the same under both scenarios.  Dependence on imports Under the WEM scenario the overall dependence on imports increases by approximately 8 %  from 36.73 % in 2015 to 39.65 % [sic] in 2030. Figure 72: Change in dependence on fuel imports under the WEM scenario (left) and WAM scenario (right)  An analysis of the WAM scenario shows that in 2030 overall dependence on imports will register a lower increase by approximately 3 %.    237   Competitiveness Both existing and additional policy measures will have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the Bulgarian market. During the period covered by the analysis electricity and heat production will continue to develop, increasing the competitiveness of the sector and generating potential future benefits for final customers (for example lower prices). In connection with this, under the WAM scenario production capacity is projected to expand. Figure 73: Increase in heat generation capacity, WAM scenario (GW)  Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling, Deloitte analysis  Figure 74: Increase in electricity generation capacity, WAM scenario (GW)  Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling, Deloitte analysis  The expansion plans mentioned above will entail old equipment replacement and upgrading production base thereby increasing competitiveness. As regards electricity exports, Bulgaria will remain a net exporter of electricity, making available a stable net export volume of approximately 8 000 GWh of electricity under both scenarios (WAM and WEM), which will have a positive impact on the trade balance.   238  Furthermore, the liberalisation of the retail market in electricity  a process planned to commence at the beginning of the next regulatory period  will give an additional boost to market competitiveness. The use of dynamic pricing contracts and consumption aggregation and optimisation contracts will also enhance retail market competitiveness. In addition to gradual market liberalisation, Bulgaria follows a clear strategy for regional market coupling supported by the construction of the requisite enabling infrastructure. This will have a positive impact on competitiveness, enhancing stability in the market and facilitating trade in electricity. The Balkan Gas Hub project, for example, will lead to the establishment of a gas exchange to meet the needs identified by the High-level Working Group of the Central and South Eastern Europe energy connectivity (CESEC) initiative. The gas distribution centre complements the projects for building interconnectors to Turkey, Greece and Serbia and expanding existing infrastructure, including the planned construction of new gas transmission infrastructure in the near future. System costs In terms of social impact, projections indicate that the policy measures to be implemented under the WAM scenario benefit lower income households because total system costs are lower as compared to those under the WEM scenario. In the period 2020-2030, total system costs will be lower by EUR 17 million under the WAM scenario.  In the same period, system costs per sector under the WAM scenario will be as follows:  Industry: EUR 6 885 billion;  Households: EUR 13 303 billion;  Services: EUR 9 971 billion;  Transport: EUR 9 043 billion Social impact The WAM scenario leads to a more effective emissions reduction (including particulate matter and SOx emissions) as compared to the WEM scenario, which will have a positive impact on the quality of the living environment. The promotion of efficient energy use will lower consumption and therefore energy costs while having a positive impact on well-being and comfort. Efficient energy use will further enhance the competitiveness of the economy and boost investment. Savings in the energy sector will increase added value and create incentives for entrepreneurship. A high level of investments, particularly in the RES sector will boost job creation. In the area of RES development, Bulgaria will need high-skilled professionals with sound technical knowledge of solar panel manufacturing and installation. Decarbonisation policy poses significant social and economic challenges with a strong influence on emission-intensive sectors and regions. The latter are at risk of loss of wealth and jobs and therefore require targeted measures. The coal mining sector is currently concentrated in three provinces (Stara Zagora, Pernik and Kyustendil) but it   239  should be noted that 25 % of the workers and employees of the Maritsa Iztok Plant in Stara Zagora are residents of neighbouring municipalities with poorly diversified economies in the provinces Haskovo, Sliven and Yambol, which are closely integrated into the added value chain of the energy sector. Power plant decommissioning, a situation in which the respective capacities will no longer be part of the electricity system, may have serious social and economic implications.  The transition to a climate-All sectors with high levels of greenhouse gas emissions in gross industrial added value that are also major employers in the sectors mostly strongly affected by the transition will require support. This creates a need for a social and economic analysis of the consequences of transition and requires specific transition enabling policies. For this purpose, by a decision adopted in January 2020, the national Parliament approved Bulgaria's application to join the Mining Areas in Transition programme. Consultations are currently under way that will enable Bulgaria to join other EU support initiatives for coal regions in transition to a low-carbon economy. Opportunities to use financing from the EU Structural Funds, the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank and Innovations Fund and the Modernisation Fund are being considered. Improving the skills and knowledge of the workforce in the area of digital technologies will play an important role in promoting the widest possible deployment of ICT and ICT-based services and the achieving digital growth.  Environmental impact  An environmental impact assessment of the Plan will be conducted in accordance with national legislation. Impact on air quality  National and EU policies on air quality  National policy and regulatory framework for air quality, the current state of play and development projections, including the measures to be taken to improve the situation, are described in detail in the National Ambient Air Quality Improvement Programme 2018-2024 and the National Air Pollution Control Programme 2020-2030. Ambient air quality control is governed by the Environmental Protection Act adopted in 2002 and the Ambient Air Quality Act adopted in 1996. The latter is particularly important as it contains dedicated provisions on ambient air quality management and accession to the European Union ambient air quality policies and the relevant legislation have been largely shaped  law.  Directive 2008/50/EC on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe (CAFE Directive), which has the primary aim of protecting human life on the basis of expert guidelines published by the World Health Organisation, sets the maximum concentrations (limit   240  values, LV) for a number of pollutants, including particulate matter (and more specifically PM10) to be attained by 1 January 2005. The Directive also sets the maximum number of exceedances of the average daily PM10 limit value. It also sets out requirements for the monitoring of ambient air quality and, where the limit values for ambient air quality in agglomerations and other zones determined by the Member States fail to be attained by the 2010 deadline (or arplans set out appropriate measures so that the exceedance period can be kept as short  In 2013, the European Commission conducted a review of the effectiveness of air quality legislation, which led to the development of the Clean Air Package. The package includes four instruments, including a new Clean Air for Europe Programme (CAEP) and the recast Directive on national emission ceilings. The Clean Air for Europe Programme sets new policy objectives for air quality for the period until 2030 to achieve a substantial health improvement, among other benefits. Although it does not make a recommendation for a review of the CAFE Directive, the Programme states that policies should be focused on achieving compliance by 2020 at the latest. It should be noted that current data indicates that PM10 has an adverse effect on health, even in concentrations that are lower than current limit values.  Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants (recast Directive on national ceilings), also related to emissions of atmospheric pollutants and their adverse effect on health, [recast Directive] modifies the regime for the national emission ceilings established under the previous Directive 2001/81/EC, bringing it in line with the commitments undertaken by the EU and its Member States under international treaties. The recast Directive additionally lays down national obligations for reducing atmospheric emissions of pollutants, including particular matter (PM2.5), nitrogen oxides(NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2) non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and ammonia (NH3), with emission reduction to be achieved in the period 2020-2029. Member States are required to transpose Directive *EU) 2016/2284 into their national law by 1 July 2018 and produce national emission inventory reports and estimates. The revised national emission ceilings will become mandatory in 2020. As PM2.5 is a key component of PM10, the requirement for Bulgaria to reduce PM2.5 emissions creates an even greater need for prevention and control of PM10 emissions. (including sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, NMVOC, ammonia and PM25) is mostly based on EU law. Bulgaria has fully endorsed the objectives set out in Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 for air quality and cleaner air for Europe (Directive 2008/50/EC) and Directive 2004/107/EC.  closely linked to EU law, strategies and objectives.  The Ministry of Environment and Water is the national competent authorities for environmental matters, including the prevention and control of atmospheric pollutants.   241  Although certain responsibilities for environmental protection have been delegated to other sectoral ministries and government agencies, the main responsibility for the planning and implementation of measures for ambient air quality rests with municipalities. Bulgaria has designated three agglomerations (Sofia, Plovdiv and Varna) and three ambient air quality assessment and management zones (Southeast, North/Danubean and Southwest). Air quality monitoring shows that in one or several municipalities in each of the six [sic] air quality assessment and management zones the limit values for PM10 exceeded those set in the CAFE Directive. Such exceedances have been registered in a total of 28 municipalities, although three are currently considered to comply with 10 has triggered an infringement procedure, which is currently pending before the Court of Justice of the European Union.  Air quality monitoring shows that Plovdiv Municipality does not comply with the requirements for the limit values of nitrogen oxide (NOx) set out in the CAFE Directive. However, for most municipalities, particularly large ones, exceedances of the limit values for NOx exist as a mere probability. In contrast, all Bulgarian municipalities currently experience major problems with PM10 pollution. In view of the widespread challenge of PM10 pollution and the significant exceedances of PM10 limit values, a National Programme for Ambient Air Quality Improvement for the period 2018-2024 has been developed with the specific aim of reducing PM10 pollution thereby achieving compliance with the requirements laid down in the CAFE Directive. Bulgaria has developed a National Air Pollution Control Programme for the period 2020-2030 Historical overview  Bulgaria remained in full compliance with the national emission ceilings set out in Directive 2001/81/EC [on national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants] during the entire period throughout the period 20102016. Emission trends since 2005, as described in the national inventory of harmful atmospheric pollutants presented to the European Commission in 2018, largely reflect the policy measures implemented as a result of the transposition of EU law. In most cases, reported emissions, and more specifically sulphur dioxide emissions, decrease over time (see the charts below).   242  Figure 75: Sulphur dioxide emissions, ktoe  Sulphur dioxide emissions (ktoe) Energy Combustion processes in industry Household heating, etc. Road transport Other modes of transport Manufacturing processes, emissions from diffuse sources Use of solvents Livestock farming Agriculture  soils Waste Other  Source: National Air Pollution Control Programme 20202030  Figure 76: Nitrogen oxide emissions  Nitrogen oxide emissions (ktoe) Energy Combustion processes in industry Household heating, etc. Road transport Other modes of transport Manufacturing processes, emissions from diffuse sources Use of solvents Livestock farming* Agriculture  soils* Waste Other  Source: National Air Pollution Control Programme 20202030   243  Despite this, minimal progress has been reported in the reduction of the pollutants NMOS, ammonia and PM2.5. In 2016, six main sectors acted as emission sources. Residential heating was the main source of PM2.5 and NMVOC while agriculture was the main source of ammonia emissions. The other major polluting sectors in 2016 included the energy sector (sulphur and nitrogen oxides); road transport (nitrogen oxide and NMVOC); industrial processes and diffused emissions (NMVOC and sulphur oxides); and use of solvents (NMVOC). Combustion plants are the largest polluter in the energy sector. On 28 April 2017, the Commission adopted best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for large combustion plants in accordance with Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions. With regard to new plants, the reference document entered into force on 17 August 2017  the date on which it was published in the Official Journal of the European Union. It will enter into force four years after this date for operational plants. The adopted document introduces new, stricter emission limits for the sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, etc. released by coal-fired plants. In addition to having an impact on the coal-fired plants in the East Maritsa River complex, the new limit values will also affect other plants in Bulgaria, including factory power plants and district heating plants with installed elutriators generating both electricity and heat. The plants in question will therefore be required to upgrade in order to meet the new stricter requirement for the emission levels of certain pollutants stipulated in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/1442 of 31 July 2017 establishing best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, under Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, for large combustion plants. A derogation may only be applied when the assessment of a particular plant shows that the achievement of the new emission levels would generate costs that are excessively high compared to the environmental benefits achieved. The plants that applied for a derogation are listed in Annex B. The above warrants the conclusion that since 2005 significant progress has been achieved in terms of the number of Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management Areas (AAQAMA) without exceedances of the limit values for sulphur dioxide and the average hourly limit values for nitrogen oxides. Despite this, all six AAQAMAs continue to register exceedances of the limit values for PM10. Although flue-gas (SO2) desulphurisation systems have been installed by all electricity plants fired by indigenous coal, which has led to an overall improvement in compliance with the requirements for sulphur dioxide, the AAQAMA in which these plants operate are yet to achieve compliance with the air quality requirements for SO2 emissions. Projected development According to the National Air Pollution Control Programme 2020-2030 Bulgaria will need to put in place additional measures in order to be in a position to meet the ambient air quality requirements laid down in EU and national law.   244  Table 56: Projected emissions of air pollutants Pollutants  Emissions in ktoe according to 2016 inventory  % reduction in emissions as compared to 2005 Emission reduction commitment (%) 2005 2020 2030 2020 2025 2030 2020-2029 2030+ Nitrogen oxide 183.2  93.8 74.7 49 % 54 % 59 %. 41 % 58 % VOC* 80.7  62.1 46.3 23 % 34 % 43 % 21 % 42 % SO2** 771.3  79.6 83.4 90 % 90 % 89 % 78 % 88 % NH3 51.6  45.0 43.8 13 % 15 % 15 % 3 % 12 % PM2.5 30.9  22.2 7.8 28 % 57 % 75% 20% 41 % Date of emission assessment 27 January 2019 Source: National Air Pollution Control Programme 20202030 The implementation of additional measures will ensure the achievement of all commitments for air pollutants in the period after 2030. Therefore, the main focus should be on achieving the projected improvements in efficiency with existing policy measures and on the strict implementation of additional measures. In the following years, when emission projections are to be updated (progress will be reported every two years) and the National Air Quality Pollution Programme is to be revised (every four years), a need may arise for new measures to be identified and implemented to ensure that Bulgaria fulfils its commitments for emissions reduction, if the projected decrease in emission levels is not achieved.  The projected improvement of ambient air quality (AAQ) under the WAM scenario, and more specifically the significant reduction of emissions of PM2.5 by 75 % at national level to be achieved in the period 20052030 (from 30.9 ktoe per year to 7.8 ktoe per year), should ensure that all municipalities in which exceedances of the limit values for PM10 have been registered in recent years are able to achieve the requirements for particulate matter because PM2.5 reduction measures lead reductions of PM10. Therefore, with regard to PM10, the projected decrease in emissions is expected to be accompanied by AAQ improvement and quality parameter normalisation in all AAQAMAs. The consistent implementation of the full package of policy measures for the residential heating sector would even accelerate the process, enabling many municipalities and AAQAMAs to achieve compliance with the standards by 2025 at the latest. The projected reduction of emissions of other pollutants is expected to lead to AAQ improvement in Bulgaria and neighbouring countries and regions. Despite this, the   245  impact of such a reduction on the compliance of each AAQAMA cannot be measured perfectly accurately. According to the WAM scenario based on the plan implemented to date an analysis of the emissions of polluting substances shows that emission reductions will be achieved under both scenarios (with existing and with additional measures) over the next decade but that these reductions will be higher under the WAM scenario. ts for 2030 under the WAM scenario are set out in the table below: Table 57: Projected decrease in emissions, WAM scenario Emissions under NECP scenario17  % reduction compared to 2005 Emission reduction commitments compared to 2005 (%)  2005 2020 2025 2030 2020 2025 2030 2020-2029 2030+ NOx emissions (ktoe), of which 183.2 85.7 81.4 67.8 53 % 56 % 63 % 41 % 58 % from the Energy sector  19.8 19.3 15.4      outside the Energy sector  65.9 62.1 52.4      SO2 emissions (ktoe), of which 771.3 103.5 99.2 68.6 87 % 87 % 91 % 78 % 88 % from the Energy sector  71.9 62.1 45.1      outside the Energy sector  31.6 37.1 23.5      PM2.5 emissions (ktoe), incl. 30.9 23.6 14.4 8.8 24 % 53 % 71 % 20 %** 41 %** from the Energy sector  1.7 1.5 1.3      outside the Energy sector  21.9 12.9 7.5      NH3 emissions (ktoe), incl. 51.6 45.0 44.1 43.8 13 % 15 % 15 % 3 % 12 % from the Energy sector  n/a n/a n/a      outside the Energy sector  45.0 44.1 43.8      NMVOC emissions* (ktoe), incl. 80.7 62.8 53.9 47.0 22 % 33 % 42 % 21 % 42 % from the Energy sector  0.8 0.7 0.8      outside the Energy  62.0 53.2 46.2                                                 17Rounding may result in differences between total and aggregated emissions per sector.   246  Emissions under NECP scenario17  % reduction compared to 2005 Emission reduction commitments compared to 2005 (%)  2005 2020 2025 2030 2020 2025 2030 2020-2029 2030+ sector * Emissions from nitrogen oxides and 3B and 3D category non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) from agriculture have not been taken into account **Emission reduction commitments apply to PM2.5 emissions only Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling The charts below set out the developments in emissions in relation to each air pollutant.

The model relies on standard projection assumption that LCPs will be granted derogations under Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/144221. The WAM and WEM scenario projections set out in this Plan assume compliance with all applicable environmental requirements and regulations and the implementation of all measures set out in the National Air Pollution Control Programme2020-2030, the National Ambient Air Quality Improvement Programme 2018-2024 and planned changes in the energy system under WAM scenario modelling, such as transition to high-efficiency cogeneration plants. The air quality measures relevant to greenhouse gas emission reductions and to the energy efficiency dimension have been taken into account for the purpose of the modelling exercise.   Earlier entry into force of Regulation (EU) 2015/1185 [with regard to eco-design requirements for solid fuel for] local space heaters (Eco-Design Regulation 2015/1185 for stoves); and accelerated discontinuation of the use of traditional polluting solid fuel local space heaters (stoves);   Introducing a standard for the fossil fuels burned for heat (coal) at national level; surrogate measures to lower the content of humidity in firewood in the municipalities that do not meet the quality criteria for PM10 by introducing limit levels for the humidity content of firewood;                                            21For combustion plants with total rated heat capacity of more than 300 MW, relying exclusively on indigenous lignite coal for which it can be demonstrated that best available technique-associated emission level (BAT-AEL) is unachievable due to technical and economic reasons.   249   Households affected by the mandatory discontinuation of the use of traditional stoves and the transition to natural gas-fired heating systems (reconnection and building new branches of gas distribution networks); district heating (reconnection and building new branches) or use of eco-design compatible (Ecolabel) heating devices; The implementation of the above measures and stricter compliance with the ambient air quality requirements laid down in national and EU law will ensure a continued positive trend in the reduction of emissions of air pollutants as shown in the charts above. The significant increase in biomass use will not lead to higher emissions of PM10 on account of biomass being used in high-efficiency cogeneration. The generation of electricity from biomass fuels under both scenarios (WEM and WAM) has been projected by taking into account the requirements laid down in Article 29 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 according to which electricity is to be taken into account only if it fulfils one or more of the following requirements:  a. it is generated in installations with a total rated thermal input below 50 MW;  b. for installations with a total rated thermal input from 50 to 100 MW, electricity is generated applying high-efficiency cogeneration technology, or, for electricity-only installations, meeting an energy efficiency level associated with the best available techniques (BAT-AEELs) as defined in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/114222;  c. for installations with a total rated thermal input above 100 MW, it is generated applying high-efficiency cogeneration technology, or, for electricity-only installations, achieving a net-electrical efficiency of at least 36 %;  d. it is generated applying Biomass CO2 capture and storage. A direct comparison between the projections set out in the National Air Quality Control Programme 2020-2030 and WEM and WAM scenario projections cannot be made at this stage due to a lack of clarity as to the compatibility of the methods and assumptions underlying the projections set out in the National Air Quality Control Programme. Nevertheless, projections are similar and outline a trend of continued reductions in the emissions of air polluting substances.   RES development impact on Natura 2000 sites, biodiversity and natural resources, including waste  The restrictions on RES development in relation to the Natura 2000 network, other than renewable sources from biomass, are determined on the basis of the conditions set out in the opinion on the environmental assessment (EA) of the NPDEVI, the report setting out                                            22 Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/1442 of 31 July 2017 establishing best available techniques (BAT) conclusions, under Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, for large  L 212, 17.8.2017, page 1);   250  an assessment of the compatibility of the NPDEVI with the object and aims of conserving protected areas, and the prohibitions stipulated in River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) and in the orders on the designation of protected areas.  For the purpose of the INECP, the impacts assessed in the NPDEVI were reviewed and updated. The section below outlines only the impacts with a potential for significant long-term negative effects. The analysis set out below does not contain a comprehensive environmental assessment. It was conducted within the framework of the project with a view to informing decision-making on the potential impacts, restrictions and barriers to the development of certain renewable energy sources and outlining solutions to overcome, minimise, mitigate and manage these impacts at government level. The relevant recommendations set out in the NPDEVI have also been updated and further developed to ensure that they are better aligned with the aims of the INECP, where appropriate. As regards long-term effects, potential mitigation measures or restrictions may be applied at the planning and operational stages. The significant impacts that may have long-term negative effects on Natura 2000 sites, protected areas, biodiversity and natural resources during the period of renewable energy sources utilisation are mainly the following:  With regard to wind power:  Death of birds and bats among others (killed by wind turbines)  for rare or protected species (all bats are protected) at national and EU level and for species protected within the boundaries of Natura 2000 sites;  Disturbance of species, including those protected within the boundaries of Natura 2000 sites;  Impacts on the integrity and structure of Natura 2000 sites;  Loss and deterioration of the condition of protected natural habitats. Areas with proven wind potential along the Black Sea coast overlap with the Via Pontica migratory route. The same applies to the Via Aristotelis and other migratory routes. The analysis of RES potential must recognise these circumstances as legitimate restrictions.  According to WAM scenario projections between 2020 and 2030 the electricity output of wind farms will increase from 1 450 GWh to 2 049 GWh. This means that both new wind farms will be constructed and the capacity of existing ones will be expanded.  With regard to hydropower:  Changes in the hydromorphology and flow of water bodies that may lead to loss of feeding areas or natural habitats, and habitats or aquatic and other species;  Habitat deterioration;  Loss or deterioration of protected natural habitats in or along riverbeds;    251   Change and destruction of river habitats, aquatic and coastal fauna, destruction and fragmentation of habitats, barrier effect of riparian species; impacts on fauna due to river flow variations; disturbance during hydropower plant operation;  Changes in hydromorphology are drive change in the environmental status of surface water and the ecosystems related to them on account of the effect of water abstraction and river barriers in the absence of constructed and properly functioning fish passages. During the period 20152020, the electricity generated by hydropower plants is projected to decrease from 5 659 GWh to 4 707 GWh under both WEM and WAM scenarios. During the period 20212030, hydroelectricity is projected to stabilise at 2020 production levels. The INECP does not envisage the construction of new hydropower plants during the period. The uncertainty associated with water quantities and levels in the context of climate change places a constraint on the development of hydropower plants in Bulgaria until 2030. According to current projections no impact on biodiversity is likely to occur. Despite this, depending on the nature of each project, potential impacts on drinking water are projected, reflecting the priority given to water supply. Hydropower plants are susceptible both to the availability of water resources in the context of climate change and extreme events due to climate change, such as droughts, which may jeopardise water use for other purposes, i.e. water supply, irrigation, etc. in accordance with the priorities set out in Article 50 of the Water Act.  The impact on water and compliance with the requirements of Directive 2000/60/EC on the good environmental status of surface water, ground water and water protection areas (situated mostly but not only within the boundaries of the Natura 2000 network, for example protected areas for drinking water) should also be taken into consideration. Regarding solar power:  Fragmentation of natural habitats and habitats of species   Deterioration of natural habitats and habitats of species  Loss of flora and fauna species;  Change in permanent land use in large areas;  Loss of natural habitats and habitats of species. The impacts identified concern solar plants outside urban agglomerations. No negative impacts associated with solar roofs have been identified. There is an abundance of low-productivity agricultural land with poor, rocky and infertile soil outside Natura 2000, which is well suited to the construction of photovoltaic plants without any environmental restrictions that have a genuine potential to trigger positive regenerative effects.    252  According to the WAM scenario solar power use is projected to increase from 1 664 GWh in 2020 to 4 998 GWh in 2030.  As regards biomass:  Loss of natural habitats and habitats of species;  Changes in river hydromorphology and inflow on account of deforestation in water catchment areas;  Deterioration of forest ecosystems due to deforestation;  Deterioration of soil quality and fertility due to single-crop cultivation;  Soil erosion due to deforestation and loss of forestry waste;  Change of the environmental status of forest habitats: loss/deterioration of protected habitats and habitats of species subject to conservation;  Soil depletion and deterioration due to the cultivation of unsustainable energy crops and soil contamination resulting from the use of fertilisers and pesticides;  Destruction of natural habitats and the habitats of plant and animal species as a result of the clearing of pastures;  Biodiversity loss and biodiversity habitats (pastures, meadows and wetlands) conversion to energy crop cultivation;  Introduction of non-indigenous species;  Deforestation of water catchment areas leading to changes in the availability of water resources (the good environmental status of forests is an important factor for climatic conditions) and problems relating to floods and changes in water quality due to soil erosion in water catchment areas;  Water is also droughts and floods die climate change, with forest use having the potential to exacerbate this effect;  The use of surface waterbodies for the supply of drinking water from reservoirs and rivers is concentrated in mountain areas. This makes it imperative to preserve the associated catchment areas, which are traditionally covered by forests.  Gross domestic consumption of biomass and waste is expected to increase by 25 % by 2030 compared to 2020 figures and this higher demand will be covered by an increase in both primary production and import. Although no significant change in biofuel consumption is projected, there will be a significant increase in demand for conventional fuels (from 2 207 GWh in 2020 to 1 494 GWh in 2030), which will be offset by the growing consumption of new generation biofuels, with a projected threefold plus increase up to 1 100 GWh in 2030 compared to 2020 figures. A significant increase in energy production from biomass is projected under the WAM scenario. According to energy balance report data Bulgaria currently exports 1 188 GWh   253  of biomass and imports 750 GWh of (conventional) biofuels. This trend is projected to remain stable during the period covered by the forecast, with biomass exports decreasing against an increase in domestic consumption. The import of conventional biofuels and new generation biofuels during the same period is projected to increase in order to meet growing domestic demand. In parallel, domestic production capacity is also projected to increase.  In 2030, 2 589 GWh of total biomass will be intended for biofuels for the transport sector, including 1 650 GWh in imported biomass.  Table 58: Biomass and waste dynamic (GWh)  2020 2030 Gross domestic consumption of biomass and waste incl. 18 634 23 280 Biomass 15 072 17 684 Waste, incl. 826 2 326 Biodegradable waste 438 1 000 Non-biodegradable waste 388 1 326 Biofuels,  incl. 2 529 2 589 Conventional 2 207 1 494 New generation 322 1 095 Biogas and off-gases 207 681 Total supply of biomass and waste,  incl. 18 634 23 280 Primary production 18 576 22 751 Net import 58 529 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling The most intensive sector in terms of non-biodegradable waste utilisation is the cement industry, which is expected to utilise a total of 336 GWh of non-biodegradable waste in the process of conversion (or approximately 87 % of total consumption) in 2020. The corresponding projected amount for 2030 is 846 GWh (64 % of total consumption). The projected increase in biodegradable waste in the period 20202030 is also due to the progress in the implementation of the project for converting the Sofia district heating plant Toplofikatsiya EAD to refuse-derived fuel (RDF) utilisation. On the other hand, gross electricity generation from non-degradable bio-waste is set to have a negligible share of less than 0.3 % of gross electricity generation throughout the entire period 20202030. Gross electricity generation per type of waste is set out in the table below:   254  Table 59: Projected gross electricity generation from waste (GWh) Gross electricity generation (GWh) 2020 2025 2030 Non-biodegradable waste 12 123 152 Biodegradable waste 14 100 115 Total waste 26 223 267 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling In conclusion, the biomass necessary to achieve climate and energy targets in the energy sector may be obtained by unlocking the untapped potential for the use of large quantities of biomass from agriculture, aquaculture, livestock manure, etc. and biodegradable waste (with a projected total amount of 1 416 GWh in the period 20202030), which is also consistent with the principles of circular economy. An increase in new generation biofuels is also projected, with the necessary quantities to be supplied in line with the approach detailed in section 2.1.1. According to the projections for land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector the land intended for the cultivation of crops for biofuels will decrease in keeping with the significant decrease in demand for conventional biofuels.  Most impacts identified can be managed at the stage of conducting an environmental assessment of the INECP. Taking the relevant recommendations into account will facilitate the process of INECP environmental assessment approval and the implementation of the Plan in the future.  The measures and recommendations set out in the NPDEVI have been reviewed to ascertain their relevance to the INECP. The recommendations set out below are based on the results of the conducted EA, which have been incorporated into the NPDEVI. Regarding biomass, the National Action Plan for Energy from Forest Biomass for the period 2018-2027 has been developed in addition to the NPDEVI. The increase in the production of biomass for energy raises the question of how the necessary quantities will be obtained and what the link between biomass production and the forestry sector potential for GHG removals, which has been decreasing due to the slower rate of growth and the average age of forests, will be.  The NPDEVI, which will remain in force until the end of 2020, sets out the following targets for biomass:  Increasing timber production sawn up to 7 million m3 annually by 2020:  Utilisation of up to 50 % of straw  a resource that has only been used since 2008; utilisation of up to 90 % of oilseed cake  a waste product from the production of sunflower oil;  Consolidation of livestock farms in the next 3 to 5 years, which will enable the establishment of profitable biogas plants;  Increasing capacity for the production of briquettes and pellets from wood waste, which will enable automated combustion plant management;   255   Gradual replacement of conventional wood-burning stoves with heating devices using briquettes and pellets, which are more efficient.  The National Action Plan for Energy from Forest Biomass (NPDEGB) 2018-2027 is currently the only plan, which sets out estimates of biomass potential after 2020 at national level. The results of applying the three approaches for analysis and assessment of the potential of forest and off-cut biomass and waste biomass generated by the wood processing and furniture making industries used in the energy sector are set out in the table below: Table 60: Comparative table of the quantities of wood suitable for biomass and its energy potential by approach used to assess [energy generation] potential, average data for the period 20122016 Approaches used to assess forest biomass potential  Quantities of wood for forest biomass, m³ Energy equivalent (toe)* Energy equivalent (GWh)*  4 291 842 1 056 400  12 286  4 142 877 1 038 400 12 077  3 192 338 790 800 9 197 Calculated energy potential of biomass from wood waste generated by the timber processing and furniture making industry  244 300 2 841 Source: National Forest Biomass Energy Action Plan 20182027 * calculations converting toe into GWh  1 toe (tonne oil equivalent) + 11.63 MWh The NPDEGB 2018-2027 takes into account the quantity of forest biomass equivalent to 15 127 GWh, following an optimistic assessment approach and relying additionally on the calculated energy potential of wood waste from the furniture making industry.  The optimistic scenario projections set out in the NPDEGB (12 286 GWh) indicate a shortfall in the quantities of biomass necessary in 2020 and 2030 (15 989 GWh and 19 633 GWh, respectively). According to the NPDEGB there is a significant potential to increase forest utilisation in Bulgaria up to 8.5 to 10 million m3 of live tress by 2020 or up to 70 % to 75 % of the average annual forest growth.  The INECP considers this to be the only reliable source for providing the necessary quantity of biomass. In keeping with the assumptions set out in the INECP, in order to be counted towards the achievement of renewable energy targets, the entire quantity of biomass will have to conform to the sustainability criteria laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2001.  The WAM scenario is achievable in the current circumstances because the model does not rely exclusively on forest biomass for the total quantity needed. The model uses EU average values, taking into account the specificities of the different sectors of the Bulgarian economy and considers the possibility of unlocking the untapped potential of other sources of biomass, such as the biodegradable fraction of products, waste and   256  residues from biological origin from agriculture (including vegetal and animal substances), forestry and related industries, fisheries and aquaculture, and biodegradable waste fraction, including industrial and municipal waste of biological origin. Biodegradable waste (biodegradable fraction of industrial and municipal waste of biological origin), not included in the table above is also counted towards the achievement of renewable energy targets.  It is considered that these resources will comply with the sustainability criteria set out in Directive (EU) 2018/2001. The integrated approach is applicable here. It entails reliance on the circular economy and utilisation of biodegradable waste and waste generated in the sectors of the economy which, instead of being discarded as being of no use, can be mobilised and returned into the economy as a resource for the Bulgarian energy system.  The NPDEGB admits that the calculations of potential have certain flaws in terms of sustainability and the environment. For instance:  the plan recommends that biological and ecological studies of wood harvesting sites be conducted in order to determine the optimal share of harvested wood waste to be collected;  the waste wood potential, which has been estimated as significant, may lead to certain economic and environmental challenges. Furthermore, according to the conclusion set out in the Plan the comparison between total annual growth and actual use shows that during the period 20102015 the total quantity of harvested wood actually used varies between 46.8 % in 2010 to 60 % of total annual growth in 2015. This means that according to the optimistic scenario 40 % to 60 % of annual growth will account for 4 291 842 m³. Doubling annual yield from forests would therefore correspond to 80 % to 120 % of their annual growth. Such a percentage increase would be contrary to the principles set out in Section X of the Plan. The objective cited below is set in the strategic framework of the action plan for energy from forest biomass. It is relevant to Priority  of the use of wood in quantities that do not exceed the average annual growth of forests  Furthermore, the significant increase in biomass production projected on the NPDEGB is Inventory for the period 20212025 drawn up in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry in the 2030 climate and energy framework according to which neither a decrease nor a significant increase in forest yield can be expected in the next 10 to 15 years. The National Forest Inventory 2019 further contains a reference to the National Forestry Sector Development Strategy 2013-2020, which introduces a number of requirements and conditions aiming to ensure the protection of sensitive areas, including Natura 2000   257  sites, and shift the interest of investors to the use of wood biomass from areas where there is no risk of adverse effects for the environment. The requirements in question envisage, inter alia:  1) conducting a survey, analysis and assessment of the potential of afforested areas in Bulgaria in terms of their potential for the production of wood biomass; and 2) developing a national scheme for sustainable production and consumption of wood biomass to be used for energy generation, which contains a set of sustainability criteria.  The absence of a reference to the National Forest Inventory in the NPDEGB warrants the conclusion that estimates for land use, land use change and forestry set out in the National Forest Inventory do not take into account either the projections set out in the NPDEGB or those [set out in] point 1 above, which refers to an analysis that has not yet been fully developed.  The second recommendation mentioned above is similarly yet to be implemented. It is assumed that it will contain and take into account the sustainability criteria stipulated in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 23 so as to facilitate the government and investors in making decisions concerning projects for the production of biomass that satisfies sustainability criteria and can therefore be taken into account for the purpose of reporting on the achievement of renewable energy targets.  It is possible that the sustainability criteria in question were not taken into account during the course of developing the NPDEGB, meaning that the potential yield may not meet the criteria for being counted towards the achievement of renewable energy targets. Sustainability criteria include, but are not limited to  a requirement not to use biomass from: o forest areas with high conservation value and other habitats and high-value land that play a role in protecting biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem functions, including residual biomass; o forests with a high level of biodiversity and other afforested areas rich in species or identified as forests with a high level of biodiversity by the relevant competent body, unless evidence is provided that the production of the raw material does not jeopardise the aims and objectives of environmental protection; o protected areas, o etc.  The leading principle of forest management is sustainability;                                            23Articles 26 to 29 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (RED Directive) and Annex IX on the production of biofuels. Additional criteria for biofuels are set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/897 of 13 March 2019   258   According to various studies at least 5 % of deadwood should remain in forests after harvesting in order to avoid negative effects on biodiversity (deadwood is an important habitat or food substrate for certain species) and microclimate, including soil characteristics and the circulation of substances in nature. However, these matters should be examined in a separate study as envisaged in the NPDEGB;  Forest plantations for accelerated biomass production, including from non-indigenous and invasive species, for example paulownia, may have a negative impact on forest ecosystems. Forest resilience to risks associated with climate change should also be studied separately along with the respective sites in order to demonstrate compliance with the sustainability criteria,  etc. According to the projections for the LULUCF sector set out in the National Forest Inventory, large-scale afforestation is an unlikely development. This is the reason why the WAM scenario does not project an increase in the forest areas for biomass production.  With regard to forest management, the report on the forest sector set out in an annex to the National Strategy for Climate Change Adaptation, should be taken into account in the process of developing sustainability criteria at national level because it contains recommendations for measures to be taken to ensure that forest adaptation needs are taken into account in the planning of forest activities, such as timber harvesting and afforestation. It is essential that sustainability criteria take into account climate change considerations and, in light of the arguments set out above, the need for alignment between the various strategic documents on forest management and use, for example the forest sector report (which contains specific guidelines on the management of forests and species, which must be implemented to ensure the sustained growth and development of Bulgarian forests), the National Action Plan for Energy from Forest Biomass, the National Strategy for Forest Sector Development and the National Forest Inventory determining the reference level for forests for the period 20212025.  In addition, the Plan for energy generation from biomass will be revised, taking into account the sustainability criteria for production laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 in order to make a realistic assessment of the potential of biomass, which will be counted towards the achievement of renewable energy targets.  These considerations have been aligned with the modelling approach and require efforts to be focused on providing the additional quantities of biomass necessary from sources outside the forests sector and taking steps to adopt the circular economy approach in Bulgaria.  Hence the assumption set out in the section on the LULUCF sector that the biomass needed to achieve climate and energy objectives may be obtained by utilising the potential of using significant quantities of biomass from agriculture, aquaculture, livestock farming, etc., including biodegradable waste.    259  Furthermore, as already noted in the section on LULUCF, the total land necessary for bioenergy generation is not projected to increase by 2030. Changes will take place in forest land intended for biomass, with arable land used for the cultivation of energy crops for biofuels projected to decrease after the transition from conventional biofuels to new generation biofuels, which will require significantly less arable land.  This report builds on existing measures and commitments by introducing the holistic approach necessary to enable the implementation of the integrated plan and promoting transition to a low-carbon and circular economy at the same time. The main assumption is that Bulgaria is fully capable of a shift to using residual and waste biomass from agriculture and from biodegradable fractions of industrial waste and municipal waste, which will boost new circular business models and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from these sectors.  In this respect, incentives for the use of degraded land for the cultivation of single energy crops and the construction of renewable energy plants, including administrative and other incentives for the development of renewable energy sources in areas affected by human activity, including permanently degraded or contaminated (brownfield) land, may be introduced. Bulgaria can achieve additional progress in transforming waste into a resource for building a circular economy by reducing waste, stepping up recycling and decreasing the quantities of waste going to landfills. The EU has ambitious targets and rules aiming to transform all Member States into leaders in waste management. Bulgaria must take steps to significantly improve its waste management system and ensure that sufficient biodegradable waste is available for its energy system.  Until the above policy measures for studying, analysing and assessing the potential for sustainable biomass from all relevant sectors are implemented, the Bulgarian government may rely on the forthcoming report on the biomass potential in several EU Member States, including Bulgaria, which is currently being drawn up by Wageningen Environmental Research (an Institute under the auspices of the Stichting Wageningen Research) in the Netherlands, as part of the H2020 CELEBio project.  The project aims to strengthen the enabling environment for bio-based businesses in eight countries of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe that, according to the EU interest for the activities and opportunities offered by BIC and BBI-JU. This goal will be pursued by compiling and sharing fact-based information as well as by promoting networking among stakeholders in a broader regional and continental scope. The main objective of CELEBio is therefore to contribute to encourage the uptake of Bio-economy in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Slovak Republic and Slovenia through the elaboration of evidence-based Action Plans for each of the targeted countries, as well as through the dissemination of information on the opportunities offered by BBI. To this end, the CELEBio project team will support the setting-up of a network of BBI info points (BBI Ambassadors). In order to set the grounds for further   260  action in support of the uptake of bio-based technologies and facilitate matchmaking between stakeholders in research and industry, the CELEBio project team will map Bio-economy stakeholders. As an element of the project, a Report on Bulgaria will be published at the beginning of 2020. Chapters 2, 3 and 4 offer detailed information about biomass production and its current and potential additional use in agriculture and the waste sector. The first issue discussed is core traditional biomass production, the availability of biomass for food and feed, and forest biomass and wood products and their subsequent use in the processing industry and/or in the domestic market or export. The overview then focuses on the additional potential for biomass, which is currently unutilised or underutilised but nevertheless serves as a good basis for new opportunities for bio-based industries. If the national analysis of the potential for sustainable biomass from all sectors [to be developed] taking into account the sustainability criteria laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 reveals that insufficient quantities of biomass to be used for energy purposes are likely to be available, Bulgaria will have an opportunity to review and modify the policy measures implemented by 2023. The achievement of those renewable energy targets that are primarily dependent on biomass may necessitate biomass imports earlier than expected, if domestic biomass from agriculture and from the biodegradable fraction of municipal and industrial waste is insufficient to fill the gap between the biomass quantities needed and those than can be obtained from sustainable sources in accordance with the sustainability criteria laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Another approach would be to reallocate shares of biomass from renewable energy sources to solar and wind power as the measures set out in the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy Sources (NPDEVI) and confirmed as appropriate for the achievement of the above target have a greater potential to help overcome barriers to RES development than those put in place for biomass. With regard hydroelectricity generation, both scenarios (WAM and WEM) recognise the vulnerability of water resources and the risk of a decrease in availability as a result of climate change, correspondingly projecting a decrease in hydroelectricity generation in the period 20152020 by 17 % (from 5 660 GWh in 2015 to 4 707 GWh in 2020).  In the period 2020-2030, hydroelectricity generation is projected to remain at the same level. However, depending on future hydrological conditions, hydropower generation may need to be restricted with a view to guaranteeing that sufficient water is available to ensure uninterrupted supply of drinking water to the population. Such decisions will be made on a case by case basis following a careful review and appraisal by the relevant competent bodies, the MOSV imposing restrictions only where strictly necessary. Impact on health Since air pollution is a global health risk, the analysis of ambient air quality and emissions and the projections set out in the INECP, which take into account the policy measures introduced and compliance with EU environmental legislation, are used as an instrument for health impact assessment.   261  Air pollution is one of the top five risk factors for chronic diseases. According to estimates of the World Health Organisation in 2010 there were 11 787 premature deaths linked to ambient air pollution in Bulgaria. Ai pollution is the greatest environmental risk for the health of Europeans. Once released into the atmosphere, pollutants undergo various physical and chemical processes (transport, reactions, absorption, deposition on plant surfaces or into the soil with rainwater) that have an impact on ambient air quality and can be analysed by measuring the concentration of polluting substances. The main air pollutants that affect human health are particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ground-level ozone. Particulate matter emissions are the leading cause of pollution related deaths and have been proven to cause damage to the respiratory (lung cancer) and cardiovascular systems or brain problems (ischemic attacks). As regards ground-level ozone, although traditionally associated with damage to agricultural systems, O3 has also been demonstrated to have a significant impact on health linked to respiratory diseases.  According to WAM scenario projections the implementation of additional measures will enable Bulgaria to reduce both GHG emissions overall and the emissions of primary air pollutants such as PM and NOx in particular, which will lead to: (1) improvement in ambient air quality; (2) lowering the morbidity rate for respiratory, cardiovascular and other diseases linked to ambient air pollution; and (3) lowering the long-term economic costs for the healthcare system. Energy efficiency measures such as thermal insulation, heating (control), ventilation, humidity, fuel consumption, area taken up by and spatial orientation of glass panelling are key factors for lowering excessive cold or heat and reducing air pollution and the health risks associated with it. The most significant economic and social benefits of building stock renovation are set to be achieved through better heating systems and thermal insulation solutions.  Climate change adaptation The impact of climate change in Bulgaria and the opportunities for adapting to climate change were analysed as an element of the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan for the period until 2030. The macroeconomic analysis was developed on the basis of two climate scenarios  temperature increase by 2°C (optimistic scenario) and temperature increase by 4°C (pessimistic scenario) by 2050. Each climate scenario was tested for high and low vulnerability assumptions for each sector (as regards sensitivity to climate change and adaptability). Climate change may have a direct (or an indirect) impact on the cost and availability of materials and the industrial output of the economy, thereby affecting the quality and overall structure of the economy. The loss of real GDP growth in 2050 compared to baseline is estimated at 1 % in the optimistic scenario and 3.5 % in the pessimistic climate scenario. This would mean that the projected annual growth of approximately 1.7 percent until 2050 will be summarily cancelled in a scenario in which Bulgaria faces the full impact of a temperature increase by 2°C by 2050.   262  Taking into account the impact of climate change scenarios on the entire sector by 2050, the economic analysis shows that:  Climate change has a direct negative impact on agricultural sector productivity (primarily horticulture) projected to lead to a decrease in production under all scenarios. The most significant negative impact of climate change will be felt in the production of wheat, cereals and other crops in the four river basin management districts in Bulgaria. The Danube river basin, where agricultural productivity is the highest, is the sub-district most strongly affected by climate change.  Energy sector output is also projected to decrease under all scenarios. This is attributable to the lower economy side demand, translating into lower production.  Projections for the transport sector are likewise negative, with an overall drop in economic activity (negative changes in GDP) leading to a drop in demand for the output of these sectors.  Energy intensive sectors, including the chemical industry, the iron and steel and non-ferrous metals industries, and the cement and ceramic industries are projected to see an increase in output driven by the favourable environment for changes in trade, which facilitate an increase in export demand and are expected to mitigate lower domestic demand. The general conclusions in respect of other macroeconomic and social parameters are as follows:  The impact of climate change will lead to changes in the pattern of employment in Bulgaria, with workers shifting away from adversely affected sectors of the economy.  The overall structure of trade will also change. It will result in an increase in the import of goods previously manufactured domestically by sectors strongly affected by climate change.  The impact of climate change is projected to lead to an increase in price levels in the entire economy under all scenarios. These price increases may further lower real incomes and increase poverty on account of many households spending a significant share of their income on goods (including food products) the prices of which are projected to significantly increase.  Overall, income levels of both high-skilled and low-skilled workers are projected to decrease under all scenarios. This, in combination with rising prices and falling incomes, is expected result in a greater number of people falling below the poverty line. These climate scenarios are likely to increase the poverty rate in Bulgaria by 2050. It is furthermore commonly understood that climate change, including extreme weather events, has a disproportionately   263  stronger impact on lower income and vulnerable groups, compounding the impact of rising prices and lower incomes on them. The messages emerging from the analysis of climate change adaptation can be summarised as follows:  Adaptation carries potentially great benefits, particularly in a scenario of higher levels of climate change.  External resources, such as the European Union Funds or their successors, along with other bilateral or multilateral mechanisms focused on the financing of climate initiatives, may also be used for the purpose of adaptation, supplementing national resources.  With regard to the allocation of climate adaptation financing, the analysis concludes that gearing funding towards sectoral adaptation (but not exclusively vulnerable sectors) will bring more benefits for the Bulgarian economy and citizens as it will enhance capital availability in manufacturing sectors, expanding production and increasing added value  benefits that will at least partially outweigh the negative effects of climate change. 5.3 Overview of investment needs i. Existing investment flows and forward investment assumptions with regard to the policy measures planned This section sets out an overview of investment needs in the national energy system overall and disaggregated by sectors or investment area. The analysis shows that the achievement of the targets set in the INECP will require significant investment. During the period 2021-2030 total investment needs under the WAM scenario stand at EUR 42.7 billion  a figure that exceeds the estimates for achieving the targets under the WEM scenario over the same period by EUR 240 million This amount represents the investments needed in consumer sectors (industry, transport, services, households, etc.) and the need for investment in the sectors of electricity and heat generation in Bulgaria. Car fleet upgrade investments are planned in order to increase the number of less polluting vehicles, such as hybrid and electric vehicles. The investments needed to upgrade equipment and appliances in the household and service sectors, including direct investments to enhance energy efficiency, are estimated at EUR 11.8 and EUR 4.2 billion, respectively. Investments in the total amount of EUR 15.3 billion will also be needed in the sector of electricity and heat generation, including EUR 3 billion for the upgrade of renewable electricity plants and EUR 10 billion for the construction of two new nuclear power units. The table below sets out a summary of investment costs under the WAM scenario.   264  Table 61 Total investment costs under WAM scenario, million EUR    2021-2025 2026-2030 2021-2030 Consumption sectors Industry24 1 172.38 924.4 2 096.78 Households 5 523.30 6 308.62 11 831.92 Services 2 216.95 2 023.33 4 240.28 Transport 3 677.95 5 365.29 9 043.24 Non-energy consumption 141.66 91.84 233.50 Total 12 732.24 14 713.48 27 445.72 Generation of electricity and heat Electricity plants 1 141.50 11 780.01 12 921.51 Cogeneration plants and heating utilities 92.08 56.06 148.14 Storage facilities   620 620.00 Power to X   3.45 3.45 Investments in grid development 747.99 839.04 1 587.03 Total  generation of electricity and heat 1 981.57 13 298.56 15 280.13 Total 14 713.81 28 012.04 42 725.85 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling Investments in industry For modelling purposes, the industry sector has been divided into subsectors set out in the following table. Estimates show that during the period 2021-2030 a total of EUR 2.1 billion will be needed under the WAM scenario or EUR 24 million more as compared to the investment needed under the WEM scenario. Investment needs are mostly related to the generation of heat and electricity for own consumption and the processing and re-use of waste heat. The table below sets out a summary of investment needs under the WAM scenario for the industry sector: Table 62 Investment needs in the industry sector under WAM   2021-2025 2026-2030 TOTAL 2021-2030 Iron and steel industry 80.61 74.57 155.19 Non-ferrous metals 104.11 96.03 200.14                                              24 Investment costs for factory plants for heat and electricity cogeneration for own use are excluded.    265  Chemical industry 231.38 132.06 363.44 Construction materials 123.28 121.41 244.70 Paper and pulp industry 280.93 62.89 343.81 Food, beverages and tobacco 94.77 101.03 195.80 Machine building 67.51 67.98 135.49 Textile industry 18.91 12.70 31.61 Other  170.88 255.72 426.60 Total 1 172.38 924.40 2 096.78 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling Electricity plants As regards electricity power plants, investment needs during the period 2021-2030 stand at nearly EUR 13 billion under the WAM scenario or nearly EUR 35 million more as compared to the WEM scenario. Significant investments will be needed in technologies for electricity generation from renewable sources, such as wind farms and photovoltaic plants and biomass and gas fired combustion plants as shown in the table below: Table 63: Investments in electricity plants, WAM scenario, million EUR   2021-2025 2026-2030 2021-2030 RES, of which:  669.03 1 286.48 1 955.51 WF  56.65 213.01 269.66 PhvP 612.38 1 073.47 1 685.85 Combustion plants, of which:  472.46 493.54 966.00 2 capture and storage (CCS) systems   99.23 99.23 Combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) 2 carbon capture and storage (CCGT without CCS)   320.81 320.81 Open cycle gas turbine plants, combustion plants and gas turbine plants 190.08   190.08 2 capture and storage (CCS) systems 282.38 73.50 355.88 New nuclear power plants   10 000.00 10 000.00 Total 1 141.49 11 780.02 12 921.51 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling Cogeneration and heating plants Total investment needs relative to cogeneration and heating plants for the period 2021-2030 is estimated at EUR 148.15 million, the bulk of investment targeting gas and biomass cogeneration and heating plants. Under the WEM scenario the amount is lower by EUR 16.5 million During the period 20262030 approximately EUR 7 million will be invested in solar thermal plants.

During the period 2021-2030 investments under the WAM scenario will require a total of EUR 2.4 billion (almost EUR 75 million more as compared to the WEM scenario). According to estimates approximately EUR 1.7 million will be invested in the development of solar plants and approximately EUR 400 million in biomass plants. The table below sets out a summary of the investment needs for power plants generating electricity and heat from renewable sources for the period 20212030: Table 65: Investments in power plants generating electricity/heat from RES under WAM scenario, million EUR  2021-2025 2026-2030 2021-2030 Electric power plants WF 56.65 213.01 269.66 PhvP 612.38 1 073.47 1 685.85 2 CCS 282.38 73.50 355.88 Total electricity plants  951.42 1 359.98 2 311.39 Cogeneration and heating plants  Cogeneration plants  CHP Plant Biomass without CCS 36.14 9.44 45.58   267  Solar thermal plants - 6.97 6.97 Cogeneration and heating plants, total 36.14 16.41 52.55 Power plants  Power to X  Hydrogen power plants - 3.45 3.45 Total: 987.56 1 379.84 2 367.39 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling Investments in efficiency in the household and service sectors During the period 2021-2030 significant energy savings are required for the household and service sectors, which will necessitate significant investments. Energy savings will result from the use of appliances with better energy performance. Under the WAM scenario, as compared to the WEM scenario, more appliances are projected to be upgraded to ones with better energy performance (for example standard Class A or A+ appliances are expected to replace Class B appliances or ones with poorer energy performance) as a result of higher consumer awareness. Under the WAM scenario this corresponds to investments in appliances that exceed those under the WEM scenario by EUR 33.3 million Building renovation is expected to continue in keeping with the dedicated policy aiming to promote building stock renovation (for example, the implementation of ESCO contracts, which lower the risk for individual consumers) and therefore boost energy efficiency as a cost-effective solution. The necessary investments in the households and services sectors are projected at EUR 557.15 million and EUR 138.6 million, respectively. Under the WAM scenario this represents a total investment of EUR 695.75 million for the period 2021-2030, which exceeds WEM scenario projections by nearly EUR 145 million Table 66: Investments in efficiency under WAM scenario, million EUR  2021-2025 2026-2030 TOTAL 2021-2030 Households Equipment 5 289.37 5 985.39 11 274.76 Direct investments in efficiency 233.93 323.22 557.15 Total households 5 523.30 6 308.62 11 831.91 Services Equipment 2 133.42 1 968.26 4 101.68 Direct investments in efficiency 83.53 55.07 138.60 Total services 2 216.95 2 023.33 4 240.28 Total  7 740.25 8 331.94 16 072.20   268  Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling Overview of sources of funding A non-exhaustive list of the potential sources of financing is set out below. During the period covered by the next Multi-annual Financial Framework (20212027) Bulgaria intends to use financing from the Structural Funds for investments in energy sector decarbonisation with a view to enhancing climate change adaptation and ensuring a just transition. The priority investment needs identified are set out in Annex D to the Bulgaria Country Report. These include measures that promote energy and resource efficiency, waste management improvement and the transition to a circular economy. Bulgaria intends to gain access to financing under the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund. I. Structural funds European Regional Development Fund and Cohesion Fund  A total of EUR 273 billion will be available from the ERDF and the CF under the new Multi-annual Financial Framework for the period 2021-2027. The new MFF will have a thematic focus, with Policy objective 2 scenario. The Bulgarian energy sector is most comfortably accommodated within the framework of Policy objective 2, which promotes efforts to achieve a greener Europe with low-carbon emissions and a transition to clean and fair energy, green investment, the circular economy, climate change adaptation and risk prevention and management. Within the framework of Policy objective 2, the EFRD/CF seek to more specifically achieve the following goals: Boosting energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions In connection with this, the following investment priorities have been determined: 1. Measures to boost energy efficiency for green investments and low-carbon dioxide emissions in the whole economy and along the entire energy chain; 2. Support to upgrade the energy performance of public, industrial and residential buildings through renovation, including the integration of a component for seismic risk consolidation; 3. Support to boost the energy efficiency of SMEs and local authorities. Promoting energy from renewable sources With regard to this, the following investment priorities have been identified: development and upgrade of energy storage capacity and backup systems, support for decentralised distribution, transmission and distribution adaptation, increasing the adequacy of the electricity grid. Developing smart energy systems, grids and storage capacity outside TEN-E In connection with this, the following investment priorities have been identified:   269  a. Digitalisation of the national energy system in all segments relevant to transport, distribution and consumption of energy and deployment of smart management systems to support the step-by-step implementation of the smart city concept. b. Development of the transmission and distribution capacity of electricity grids to ensure that they have the requisite technical parameters to ensure reliable interconnectivity for trans-European electric energy infrastructure. The environmental sector is most comfortably accommodated within the framework of Policy objective 2. The EFRD/CF objectives for this sector are as follows: Enhancing adaptation to climate change, risk prevention and disaster resilience In connection with this, the following investment priorities have been determined: 1. Adaptation to climate change measures, prevention and management of climate risks, floods, landslides, fires, storms, etc. 2. Prevention and management of the risk of non-climatic natural disasters (i.e. earthquakes) and risks relating to human activity (i.e. technological accidents), including awareness raising systems, better infrastructure, civil protection and disaster management. Boosting transition to a circular economy In connection with this, the following investment priorities have been determined: 1. Municipal waste management: prevention, minimisation, sorting and recycling measures 2. Municipal waste management: residual waste treatment 3. Management of commercial, industrial or hazardous waste 4. Promotion of the use of recycled materials as raw material Improved conservation of nature and biodiversity, green infrastructure, particularly in urban areas, and reduction of environmental pollution. The transport sector is most comfortably accommodated within the framework of Policy objective 3. The following investments will be supported under this Policy objective:  Development of a sustainable TEN-T network that is well adapted to climate change, secure and intermodal;  Development and enhancement of sustainable, flexible and intermodal national, regional and local mobility, including better access to the TEN-T network and cross-border mobility.    270  II. InvestEU The InvestEU programme under the new MFF will provide an EU budget guarantee in the amount of EUR 38 billion The funds available under the programme will be invested via financial partners, including most prominently the EIB; Eligible investments will be made within the framework of several policy windows, the following being most closely linked to the INECP:  Sustainable infrastructure This area aims to boost the development of energy sector and transport sector infrastructure, innovative equipment and technologies, environmental protection and resource conservation and contribute to the development of digitally connected infrastructure. Eligible investments include:  Generation, supply and use of clean, sustainable and secure energy from renewable and other energy sources with near zero or low emissions;  Energy efficiency and energy savings;  Development and upgrade of sustainable energy infrastructure at the level of transport and energy distribution, storage and smart grids;  Development of innovative heating and cogeneration systems with low or zero emissions;  Production and supply of synthetic fuels from renewable or carbon neutral energy sources;  Enabling infrastructure for carbon dioxide capture and storage systems;  Alternative fuels infrastructure: electricity, hydrogen, liquefied gases and other low or zero emission technologies;  Projects targeting the efforts to combat or adapt to climate change;   Research, innovation and digitalisation This area aims to boost the digital transformation of EU companies, markets and Member States. It further aims to achieve a scientific, technological, economic and public impact by strengthening the scientific and technology base of the EU with the ultimate goal of innovative companies and deploying new technologies on the market.  Small and medium-sized enterprises This area aims to boost the global competitiveness of SMEs across the EU at each stage in their development.  Social investments The goals in this area are: reducing inequalities; enhancing inclusion and boosting social enterprises, social economy and social inclusion, improving the health, general well-being   271  and quality of life of Bulgarians, improving educational outcomes and supporting a just transition to a low-carbon economy. Sources of Financing other than the 2021-2027 MFF: III. Modernisation Fund  During the period 2021-2030, two percent (2 %) of total EU allowances will be auctioned off and the proceeds will be paid into an account of the Ministry of Finance in accordance with Article 10(1) of Directive (EU) 2018/410 amending Directive 2003/87/EC to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments, and Decision (EU) 2015/1814. At least 70 % of the funds will be disbursed in the following areas:  Generation and use of electricity from renewable sources;  Enhancing energy efficiency including in transport, buildings, agriculture and the waste management), except the production of energy from fossil fuels;  Energy storage;   Modernisation of energy grids, including the pipelines of district heating systems, electricity transmission grids, increasing interconnectivity between Member States;  Just transition of carbon-dependent regions with the aim of supporting their development and providing new employment opportunities to workers. The aid intensity for such priority projects will be up to 100 % of eligible expenditure. The aid intensity for other lower priority projects will be up to 70 % of eligible expenditure. No support will be provided for projects based on solid fossil fuels, except for thermal power plants in Romania and Bulgaria. The EIB, as a member of the Investment Committee, will [be responsible for] assessing project eligibility, asset management and the revenue from auctioning allowances. IV. Loans from the European Investment Bank   Investments in energy efficiency, taking into account the EU target of 32.5 % by 2030, particularly for residential buildings, until the deployment of the new instrument for European building stock renovation, which will also focus on the energy efficiency of SMEs;  Decarbonisation of energy supplies, taking into account the target for reduction of EU-wide emissions by 40 % compared to 1990 levels (in connection with this, the EIB will commit to supporting the integration of renewable energy projects and fostering stronger regional co-operation);  Support for investments in innovative technologies and novel energy infrastructure;   272   Security of energy infrastructure (the EIB continues to support projects of common interest in areas other than the use of fossil fuels). From 2022 onwards, the EIB will no longer finance investments related to fossil fuels, including natural gas, except those with emissions of up to 250 gCO2/kWh. The EIB will also co-operate with the European Commission in the development of the Just Transition Fund established to support regions encountering challenges in the transition to a carbon neutral economy. The EIB will fund up to 75 % of eligible costs. Projects will benefit from both financial support and project related consultancy services. V. Private investment It should be noted that currently available information about the financing from EU funds is provisional and subject to change because the INECP was developed while negotiations on MFF 2021-2027 were still ongoing. ii. Sector or market risk factors or barriers in the national or regional context The main potential sources of risk, which could hinder the achievement of the national targets and dampen the ambitious assumptions underlying the WAM scenario concern the timely and adequate implementation of planned policy measures. Bulgaria needs significant investments in both energy production and climate change, which are closely linked to the achievement of WAM scenario targets. With regard to the development of renewable electricity, Bulgaria plans to invest more in wind farms and solar plants and increase the use of biomass in electricity generation, which creates a need to ensure a stable supply. During the period 2021-2030 the transport sector will also play an important role in decarbonisation and the use of renewable energy. It will transition to the use of alternative fuels and new technologies such as hybrid and electric vehicles. Although these technologies are still expensive, their economic viability is expected to improve in the future. It is also necessary to meet the growing demand for travel, meaning that investment decisions in this area should not be delayed nor should they hinder the further development of the transport network and infrastructure. As the transition to vehicles using alternative fuel will require significant infrastructure changes, it will be particularly important for Bulgaria to develop infrastructure planning measures to enable the installation of charging stations for electric vehicles as well as LPG and hydrogen filling stations. iii. Analysis of additional public finance support or resources to fill identified gaps identified under point [...]  A number of EU financing mechanisms are available under which support is provided for the development of sustainable mobility in Europe, including the Connecting Europe Facility. Financial measures to promote private investment, particularly in the area of energy efficiency, will be promoted. The financing available for the implementation of   273  projects of common interest and EIB loans are also important sources of funding that support the achievement of WAM scenario targets. 5.4 Impacts of planned policies and measures described in section 3 on other Member States and regional cooperation at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures i. Impacts on the energy system in neighbouring and other Member States in the region to the extent possible ii. Where relevant, impacts on regional cooperation Electricity markets In accordance with Regulation (EC) 2009/714 and the accompanying network codes and guidelines co-ordinated allocation of cross-border capacity through non-discriminatory market-based solutions must be achieved. The Joint Allocation Office is a service company that facilitates the electricity market by organising auctions for cross border transmission capacity. On 1 October 2018, the JAO became the Single Allocation Platform (SAP) for all European Transmission System Operators (TSOs) in accordance with Article 59 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1719. The JAO is owned by twenty-five Transmission System Operators (TSOs) from 22 countries. ESO EAD acquired shares in the capital of the JAO at the end of 2019 and used the services of the company for the allocation of long-with Romania, Greece and Serbia. The national electricity system operator uses the services of the JAO for short-tand Serbia as well. Capacity allocation in the day-ahead time interval at the Romanian border is handled by the Romanian transmission operator. This arrangement will change following the coupling between the two trade zones at the end of 2020. At the border between Bulgaria and North Macedonia both long-term and short-term capacity is allocated by the Macedonian and Bulgarian transmission operators, respectively. At the Bulgarian-Turkish border, capacity is allocated by each operator for 50 % of the capacity agreed.  Since January 2019 daily explicit capacity allocation auctions have been conducted at the Bulgarian-Serbian border. These are arranged by the Serbian transmission operator. After 19 November 2019, i.e. after the launch of the market coupling between Bulgaria and Romania, daily capacity in the day-ahead market at the border between the two countries is allocated implicitly.  The Bulgarian independent electricity exchange administers the short-term day-ahead and intra-day market segments. The abolition of the export tariff for electricity in 2019 was an important step that will enable the forthcoming couplings between the Bulgarian electricity market and those of neighbouring countries.    274  Projects are currently under way for market coupling of the national day-ahead market with the markets of Romania and Greece. The coupling with Romania is expected to become operational by the end of 2020 and that with Greece at the beginning of 2021.  In 2020, the coupling in the day-ahead segment on the Bulgarian-Greek border in the framework of the LIP 14 local project is expected to be completed. As noted in the ENTSO-E recommendations set out in the Third report on day-ahead and intra-day coupling, the Bulgarian transmission operator (ESO) has signed a memorandum of understanding with North Macedonia and Albania. Bulgaria is currently implementing a project with North Macedonia, which is the most advanced compared to the projects implemented jointly with other third counties in the Western Balkans. Macedonia has amended its legislation to bring it in line with Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 and has established an electricity exchange company.  The CESEC Electricity Action Plan envisages a number of additional market coupling initiatives, including the day-ahead market couplings between Italy, Greece and Bulgaria and Croatia, Serbia and Bulgaria, respectively. Both projects are still at an early stage of implementation.  The intra-day markets of Bulgaria and Romania were coupled on 19 November 2019 within the framework of the LIP 15 local project, which was part of the second wave of intra-day market couplings. ENTSO-E estimates indicate that the need to transport continually growing renewable energy generation to the main customers will likely require s doubling of cross-border capacity by 2030. having a particularly strong interconnection with Romania. Significant investments are under way to upgrade the system and ensure more efficient use of cross-border   275  capacities in accordance with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/943. In addition to the investments in domestic grid upgrade, Bulgaria is currently building a second 400 kV interconnector with Greece (Maritsa Iztok 1Nea Santa), which will expand transmission capacity by a further 1 280 MW by 2021.  Natural gas markets The diversification of the sources and routes of natural gas supply is a very important objective. Its achievement will guarantee the security of gas supplies to Bulgaria, the region and the EU. The gas interconnector between Greece and Bulgaria (IGB) is of geostrategic importance for the diversification of supplies for Bulgaria and the region of South-Eastern and Central Europe. The IGB project will provide Bulgaria and other countries in Southeast and Central Europe with access to the Southern gas corridor and to the existing and planned new LNG terminal in Alexandroupoli, Greece.  The projects Bulgaria is currently implementing in the area of natural gas, notably the interconnector between Greece and Bulgaria (IGB), the interconnector between Bulgaria and Serbia (IBS), the LNG terminal in proximity to Alexandroupoli, the Balkan Gas Hub project, the expansion of the storage capacity of UGS Chiren and the project for the rehabilitation, modernisation and expansion of the Bulgarian gas transmission system are projects of common economic interest for the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EU) 347/2013 and contribute to the diversification of the sources and routes for supply of natural gas in Southeast and Central Europe.
