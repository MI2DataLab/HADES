 78   3.2 DIMENSION ENERGY EFFICIENCY  Policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national EE contribution for 2030 as well as other objectives presented in section 2.2:  Energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative policy measures under Article 7a and 7b of EED Figure 25 shows the final energy consumption per capita across all EU Member States. Malta has the second lowest final energy consumption per capita which is slightly more than half of the EU average.    Figure 25 - Final energy consumption per capita in 2017, GJ/capita (Source: Eurostat)   Figure 26 shows the sectoral consumption for the European Union for the year 2016 whilst Figure 27 of final energy consumption in transport is much higher than the EU average. This is mainly because:    Malta is an island at the periphery of the European Union, implying a larger than average share of aviation as a mode of transport;   Malta has no mass-transport infrastructure as studies have so far indicated that Malta does not have the necessary critical mass to justify the operating costs; and   Temperate climate, implying a lower heating demand i.e. heating percentage share of the final energy demand.   0.0050.00100.00150.00200.00250.00300.00350.00RomaniaMaltaBulgariaGreecePortugalCroatiaSpainPolandHungaryItalyLithuaniaUnited KingdomSlovakiaLatviaCyprusEstoniaEuropean UnionFranceSloveniaCzechiaIrelandDenmarkGermanyNetherlandsBelgiumAustriaSwedenFinlandLuxembourg 79  Figure 26 - Final energy consumption by sector in the EU in 2016, % (Source: Eurostat)   Figure 27 - Final energy consumption in Malta by sector in 2016, %     Transport  The transport sector is responsible for over half of the final energy consumption. Malta will be addressing energy efficiency in transport, through the measures identified in the 2025 Transport Malta Master plan as outlined in Section 3.1.3 iii on policies and measures to achieve low-emission mobility (including electrification of transport).  Furthermore, the transport scrappage scheme, also included in the aforementioned section, will incentivise owners to scrap old less efficient vehicles and replace them by new vehicles thus reducing the number of old motor vehicles on the road.  Industry and Services   also significantly lower than the EU average as Malta is not an industry-based economy and there are no energy intensive industries. Furthermore, the sector is already pulling its weight with regards to energy efficiency, as confirmed by an 8% growth in economic activity and a corresponding increase in energy consumption of 1.5% during 2017.    80  In contthe EU average reflecting the local service-based economy. Nonetheless, whilst the gross value added (GVA) of the services sectors increased by 9% its energy consumption increased by 4%.    Malta plans to address energy savings in these sectors by setting up a scheme in order to promote and address energy efficiency investment.  Enterprises will be encouraged to undertake energy efficiency projects which shall be supported by investment aid. This measure is estimated to result in  million over the period 2021-2030.  In this regard it is being assumed that the present state aid framework is extended until 2030.   Households  As per Figure 28, lowest among all EU Member States.    Figure 28 - Average consumption per dwelling (adjusted to EU climate) in 2016, toe/dw (Source: Odyssee-Mure)     Furthermore, as shown in Table 6, Malta has a considerably different consumption profile. While the European Union as a whole has the highest share of energy attributed to space heating, Malta has the highest share of energy used for lighting and appliances. In Malta, there is no gas distribution network or district heating/cooling networks. Construction of such networks has so far been deemed not feasible, mainly due to the limited demand for heating and widespread use of distributed alternative efficient cooling heat-pump technology. Furthermore, the installation of air conditioners employing heat pump technology does not require incentives and policy intervention for its 00.511.522.5AustriaBelgiumBulgariaCroatiaCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkEstoniaFinlandFranceGermanyGreeceHungaryIrelandItalyLatviaLithuaniaLuxembourgMaltaNetherlandsPolandPortugalRomaniaSlovakiaSloveniaSpainSwedenUKEuropean Uniontoe/dwConsumption per dwelling 81  deployment. This is confirmed by the significant growth in the number of installations which is scenarios of the NECP. Such a market driven development is a major contributor towards energy efficiency in households but cannot be accounted for under Article 7 as it is not a result of any direct government policy. In reflection of the temperate climate and the general preference to use natural ventilation when possible, households have typically low energy bills and so find it difficult to justify investment in the renovation of their building.   It is in this context that the most effective approach to reduce the sale of energy to end users, move away from the consumption of fossil fuels, benefit from utilization of ambient energy and drive savings, is to promote the installation of small-scale renewable energy technologies for own consumption. Malta will therefore launch new schemes post-2020 in order to incentivise the installation of solar water heaters, air to water heat pumps and photovoltaic panels for own consumption. As these schemes are cross-they are described in more detail under Section 3.1.2 of the Plan.    Table 6 - Share of final energy consumption in the residential sector by type of end-use in 2016, % (Source: Eurostat)      82  Government Leading by Example  The Government of Malta is committed to lead by example and will be implementing a number of projects/measures in order to promote energy efficiency and achieve energy savings.  Malta will continue its efforts in order to roll-out energy efficient street lighting. Malta is expected to replace over 33,000 lamps from the present lighting luminaries to LEDs.    Furthermore, post-2020, electricity tariffs shall continue to incorporate a built-in mechanisms which promotes end--reduction mechanism. These mechanisms incentivize end-users to reduce consumption below an established threshold and deter high consumption by applying higher tariffs as consumption increases.   Energy and Water Nexus The biggest challenge in the Maltese water sector is the scarcity of natural freshwater. Malta has the lowest freshwater availability per capita in the EU. Even if these natural water resources are used sustainably, they are still not enough to meet national demand and therefore the production of alternative (non- conventional) water resources is a necessity. In view of this, Malta has developed a water management framework based on the conjunctive use of water demand management and water supply augmentation measures.  At present, the provision of water services accounts for 6% of the total national electricity demand. This is mainly used for water production, particularly due to the use of sea-water desalination plants which account for around 60% of the total production of potable water. Malta is well aware of the interdependency between energy and water and that the provision of the two has to be considered in a holistic and economic manner if sustainability is to be achieved.  In this regard, the Water Services Corporation, the Government owned water utility, will be carrying out projects in the primary water network and the wastewater treatment plant to improve system efficiency and reduce the electricity consumed per unit of water delivered. These measures are estimated to result in an investment of   Water Demand Management (water efficiency) also leads to energy savings as it results in lower volumes of water moving in the urban water cycle. At national/regional level, distribution network leakage identification and control is the most effective measure to optimise the effective use of water. Leakage management in Malta resulted in a reduction of around 40% of municipal water demand over a 15-year period. Demand management measures are also important at the level of the user. Domestic water consumption in Malta stands at around 17 million m3 pa which amounts to an average daily consumption per person of around 115 litres. Well aware of this, the Energy and Water Agency has embarked on a nation-wide campaign to help raise awareness on the optimised and efficient use of communication methods are being used in order to reach the wide population including developing a campaign Branding Identity; advertising on conventional media; education through non-conventional media sources; organization of large events amongst others.    83  The Agency also carries out household visits (particularly in vulnerable households) where technical personnel are tasked with helping residents understanding energy and water usage and provide tailored energy conservation tips. Such households are also provided with water saving kits which provide all the necessary information on water conservation (also as part of the aforementioned campaign).   Long-term renovation strategy to support the renovation of national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private Malta is aware of its commitments to develop a long-term renovation strategy to support the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU. In line with these obligations, Member States are expected to submit the first long-term renovation strategy by 10 March 2020.    Description of policies and measures to promote energy services in the public sector and measures to remove regulatory and non-regulatory barriers that impede the uptake of energy performance contracting and other energy efficiency service models61 There are a number of private undertakings operating in Malta that provide an energy service, but the concept of financing investments through the energy savings (ESCO) model has not yet taken off. This is due to the generally low energy intensity of the various economic sectors, long payback periods associated with most measures, and the availability of alternative sources of finance.  The Government has explored the possibility of adopting energy service contracts in the public sector. A study was carried out on three typical public buildings, whereby it resulted that in view of their low energy consumption, the return on investment for energy savings measures was quite low. Except for investments in renewable energy projects, the payback time exceeded the expected lifetime of the measure itself or the building. The private sector is also facing a similar situation and, so far, no concrete results have materialised.  A public consultation on Energy Performance Contracting was also held in February 2017. Respondents highlighted that take up is restricted due to limited savings.  Furthermore, potential ESCO providers find it difficult to accumulate a sufficiently large portfolio of interventions to build a suitable business case. Malta is currently analysing whether the development of a financial Special Purpose Vehicle, which would provide off-balance sheet financing for ESCOs and their customers, offer attractive repayment options through low interest rates and have a higher risk tolerance than traditional financing instruments, would achieve the required effectiveness and leverage in the local scenario.                                                            61 In accordance with Article 18 of Directive 2012/27/EU  84   Other planned PAMs and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030  The energy consumption of the Maltese Islands has been under the spotlight of the administration in the past years and will continue to be in order to ensure long term decoupling between energy consumption and economic growth.  Section 3.2.iii gives an account of the actions envisaged to fulfil the obligations emanating from Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive, which will be at the core decarbonised economy. There are also a number of additional measures which are expected to contribute but are not listed under Article 7 measures due to them being difficult to quantify. These mainly target efficient transportation and include free public transport for youths and the elderly (over 75 years), support for bicycles and pedelec bicycles whereby a grant is given on the purchase of either of the two equivalent to a full refund of the VAT and additional sea transport routes around the island to increase connectivity.  Electricity Generation By 2017, Malta had closed its inefficient power generation units and was exclusively using natural gas for electricity generation62 which is delivered as LNG. However, plans are in progress for the construction of a gas pipeline to link Malta to the European gas grid in Sicily. At present, Malta is conducting detailed studies which include a marine route survey, an environmental impact assessment, the front-end engineering design and the financial engineering all of which are co-funded under the CEF. The plan is to obtain the permits and apply for EU co-funding for works by 2020 and, following a publication of an Engineering Procurement and Construction tender, proceed with construction for a target commissioning date of 2025. The gas pipeline project is described in more -in-class efficiency standards.  Electricity Distribution Enemalta plc is the only electricity Distribution System Operator in Malta. In the recent years, Enemalta has embarked on an extensive program to ensure an efficient distribution system that minimises losses, operating the system in an efficient manner in accordance with European and local legislation.  It must be noted that Enemalta has installed 99.6% of its consumers with smart meters and has adopted a tariff system that favours prudent energy use and energy efficiency, with the aim of fostering such behaviour in its final consumers. Enemalta plc is an enterprise with a majority shareholding by the Government and is committed to further develop and optimize its distribution network post 2020.     Industry and Services Sectors  The industry and services sectors were responsible for circa 29% of the total final energy consumption in 2017. A number of actions and schemes were designed to facilitate interventions in energy efficiency initiatives and promote the introduction of Energy Management Systems, e.g. ISO 50001.  In the period 2014 to 2020, the Energy and Water enterprises would report verified energy savings.  This scheme is expected to continue post-2020 and                                                            62 A diesel-powered plant is kept on standby to achieve the desired level of security of supply.  85  shall be a prerequisite for access to support schemes mentioned in section 3.2.iii. The Government is aware of the importance of standard energy management systems and shall enforce that, over a definite period, non-SMEs with an annual consumption exceeding 800 toe would need to implement an ISO certified Management system (EN ISO 50001, or EN ISO 14001 if an energy audit is included). In line with State Aid Regulations and in consultation with stakeholder organisations, a scheme will be available to support enterprises in acquiring ISO or EN certification. shall be allocated for five years to support this scheme. It is further envisaged that local legislation will require that non-SMEs also appoint an Energy Manager.    To further support the industry and services sector, the Government will develop information dissemination programmes that focus on providing better information to decision-makers and engineers in the sector. This campaign will create awareness on the need to invest in energy efficiency, the savings potential, the financial and/or operational benefits of energy efficiency measures, and how to build capacity in energy management. This task is expected to run over a two-year period and will be led by the Energy and Water Agency, with input from the appropriate educational facilitators and sectoral stakeholders. Any courses developed thereafter will be outsourced. The setting up of the dissemination programme will require a budget of 20,000 annually.   In 2019, the Malta Business Bureau63,  launched a business cluster on energy efficiency which brings together experts, suppliers, and clients in order to facilitate knowledge transfer, exchange of best practice and help identify solutions to challenges businesses encounter on energy efficiency projects. Challenges could include sourcing specific technical expertise, financing of larger projects, and administrative and bureaucratic hurdles.  Government is set to provide support in line with State Aid rules, in order that set ups such as Energy Clusters take shape. Energy Audits Non-SMEs  Regulation 10 of LN 196 of 2014 makes it mandatory for, and the responsibility of, non-SMEs registered and doing business in Malta to carry out energy audits to the established quality level and frequency. The first audits were submitted in December 2015 and will be repeated every 4 years henceforth. Such audits can only be carried out by internal or external energy auditors who are listed on the website of the REWS or by energy auditors eligible in other Member States. These auditors must have an MQF Level 6 or higher qualification in an applied science discipline and have followed an appropriate training course as per G.N. 13024. The Agency and the Regulator have regularly published a guidance note addressed to enterprises which qualify for the statutory energy audit to assist in the discharge of this responsibility. This guidance note is updated periodically as it benefits from and builds upon the experience of previous audit programs.  The main objective of the Agency is to build on lessons learnt from previous cycles so as to ensure that future Energy Audits performed by non-SMEs attain a higher quality. To take the audits a step further,                                                            63 The Malta Business Bureau represents the Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise and Industry and the Malta Hotels and Restaurants Association (MHRA) in Brussels and Malta. It does so by liaising directly with the European institutions, the Maltese Permanent Representation and with umbrella organisations such as BusinessEurope, EUROCHAMBRES and HOTREC on all policy and funding issues affecting Maltese business interests.  86  the Agency shall create an online tool through which enterprises can submit their audit outcomes. Using such a tool, the data from the audits can be automatically uploaded and thus facilitate the Agency policy decisions reflecting the needs of the local industry. The tool is budgeted to cost 50,000 and is expected to be developed in 2020.     SMEs   A scheme was setup in 2018 whereby Small and Medium sized enterprises can benefit from grants to help them carry out Energy Audits of their premises/processes/plants/transport fleet.  It is planned to continue the scheme post 2020 (subject to state aid regulations) with an annual budget of 25,000. Such enterprises would also be eligible to schemes mentioned in section 3.2.ii. Households    Malta has one of the lowest energy intensity figures for households within the EU. Even so, Government has, over the last decade, invested heavily in promoting and fostering energy efficiency. In the case of households and other small consumers, the Government will continue incentivising the uptake of new technologies, as well as fostering behavioural change where necessary. Information campaigns will be run by the Government and these will be coupled by the free service offered by the Energy and Water Agency whereby technical personnel visit households, hold discussions in order to understand energy usage and, as a result, provide tailored energy conservation tips. An annual budget of 10,000 will be required to support this action.  Special focus will be given to vulnerable and energy poor households. Energy efficiency schemes and grants will specifically address vulnerable households including the elderly and will also address the shift to technologies which require significant capital outlay, or which result in relatively long payback periods. Malta already has in place an annual budget of approximately 200,000 to support a scheme for vulnerable and energy poor households under which old appliances are replaced by new efficient units.   Other Actions Regular training sessions and seminars for energy auditors have been organised whereby best practices are shared with the aim to continue to ensure capacity building of national expertise and higher quality audits.  These events also target the analysis of grey areas of expertise observed from the ex-post assessments of past audits. Auditors will be encouraged to work together as teams, building a pool of expertise, to provide more comprehensive audits which cover the various aspects of energy use. Training sessions for industry employees on energy efficiency measures shall be organised to target both their place of work as well as the This will be part of a holistic campaign to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy, starting in 2019.    The Energy and Water Agency will also be undertaking initiatives to help raise awareness amongst the public on behavioural changes which can help save energy. These include studies as well as educational and social media campaigns in order to increase energy efficiency in households.   87   Description of measures to utilise energy efficiency potentials of gas and electricity infrastructure Enemalta dispatches the available generating plant and interconnector in a manner to meet demand at minimum cost. The dispatch strategy continually adapts to the hourly prices of the energy available from the European Day-Ahead and Intra-Day markets, eight in all, which may be imported (or exported) over the Interconnector. The main elements  i.e. Delimara 4, Delimara 3, and the Interconnector  are dispatched each hour of the day in a manner which is most economical and least costly.    Regional cooperation in this area actively participating within the Concerted Action of the Energy Efficiency Directive (CA-EED) project since its initiation in 2008. Malta considers the CA-EED a useful regional cooperation forum for the sharing of best practices and dissemination of knowledge on the implementation of the Energy Efficiency Directive. Malta has been fostering a working relationship with all CA-EED members, in particular with other Member States with similar geographical specificities, which tackle comparable challenges in implementing energy efficiency measures. In this sense, the CA-EED has proved to be a useful structure for knowledge-sharing bet-EED is currently in research and innovation programme. Maltese authorities will continue their involvement within this into force.  ODYSSEE-MURE project funded by Horizon 2020. National experts actively contribute to and ensure that the ODYSSEE database is regularly updated with the most recent and detailed national energy-related data. Malta is also taking full advantage of the MURE database, which focuses on the collection and evaluation of all energy efficiency measures implemented in Member States and at EU level.  The database contains detailed energy efficiency indicators, including specific data and policy tools which can be used by decision-makers in the area of energy efficiency.   Financing measures, including EU support and the use of EU funds in this area at national level funds.  National authorities responsible for implementing specific energy efficiency measures and carrying out specific projects are responsible for their financing. Nevertheless, the use of EU funds is and will continue to be used as a complementary financing tool to national funds for energy efficiency measures.  Fostering a competitive and sustainable economy to meet our challenges for the 2014-2020 period, aims to enable the shift towards a more low-carbon and environmentally-friendly society. Within the Operational Programme, emphasis is placed on  88  environmental sustainability, increasing RES, energy efficiency in buildings as well as promoting a shift to a low-carbon transport sector. Priority Axis 4 of the Programme, tasked with shifting towards a low-carbon economy, enables the allocation of EU funds for specific energy efficiency measures and category of Energy Efficiency renovation of public infrastructure, demonstration projects and supporting measures. These projects focused primarily on the retrofitting of street lighting and upgrading and retrofitting of public buildings.   For the next programming period 2021  2030, Malta shall seek to secure funding to continue to support the deployment and integration of RES and energy efficiency-measures in households, industry and services, and Voluntary Organisations.  As explained earlier, several EE measures are not deemed as financially viable which leads to a significant funding gap. A similar situation exists for small scale RES such as Solar Water Heaters (SWH) and Heat Pump Water Heaters (HPWH).  The uptake of the former has dwindled over the past years, and the latter technology has yet to take off. Furthermore, thousands of solar water heaters are expected to reach their end of life in the next 5 years.  In order to meet the renewable energy contribution as well energy efficiency targets under article 7, it is estimate that around 800 households would need to be supported to purchase either a SWH or a HPWP each year until 2030.  Government support would need to be leveraged by EU funding if this figure is to be achieved.   The budget for this measure is estimated at 14 million Euros. Malta is also banking on EU Funds to support Energy Efficiency actions by Voluntary organisations, industry and services sectors.  The total budget for the aforementioned is set at 5 million euros and 17.5 million euros respectively.   The conclusions of an ex-ante assessment carried out by the EIB on behalf of the Managing Authority in connection with the design of a financial instrument to support EE and RES confirmed the above, and found that the main existing demand came from the commercial sector. It was made clear that there is a need for a dedicated technical assistance package together with a culture shift. Flexibility is also needed from an eligibility point of view. The nature of the instrument to be offered to the market will need to be confirmed after the results of the ex-ante assessment are discussed with the relevant stakeholders and an investment strategy is drafted to address the identified needs. The form and type of support will be analysed and the calls for Financial Intermediaries that will be responsible for making the instrument available both to residential and non-residential sector will be issued.    [Where applicable] Description of policies and measures to promote the role of local energy communities in contributing to the implementation of policies and measures in points ii, iii, iv, and v With respect to renewable energy communities, there is limited potential for their development and for establishing targeted policies and measures, mainly as a result of the structure of the electricity distribution and supply system and related derogations for Malta under Directive 2009/72/EC and Directive (EU) 2019/944.   89    - -framework of the Governance Regulation, including the requirement to take into account -principle, as stipulated in Article 3(3)(b) of the Regulation.  The Energy Efficiency-first principle has aand investment decisions. Energy efficiency was treated as a priority element in recent investment energy mix from one based on heavy fuel oil to a more sustainable energy mix based on gas, electricity imports through the Malta-Italy interconnector and renewable energy sources (gasoil is used as a backup fuel). The principle is further strengthened in the Malta-Italy gas pipeline project that will connect Malta to the Trans--whereby it remains an underlying principle during the identification and design of policies and measures aimed at achieving cost-effective energy savings in end-use sectors. The implementation of the principle is in itself implicit in the way measures are selected and policies adopted, and would therefore not feature as an explicit measure to be identified under each of the five dimensions of .  There are, however, other factors that need to be equally considered principle in energy planning, policy and investment decisions which need to give due importance to security of supply and cost-efficiency. In cases related to national security or national heritage projects, the energy efficiency first principle can therefore only be implemented within constrained parameters.
