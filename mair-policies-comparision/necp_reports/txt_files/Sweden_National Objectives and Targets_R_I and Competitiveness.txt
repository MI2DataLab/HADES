2.5 Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness  2.5.1 National objectives and funding targets for public and, where available, private research and innovation relating to the Energy Union, including, where appropriate, a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met.                                                                                                                                                                                                electricity and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003. 39 (199) Answers given in Section 2.5.2.  2.5.2 Where available, national 2050 objectives related to the promotion of clean energy technologies and, where appropriate, national objectives, including long-term targets (2050) for deployment of low-carbon technologies, including for decarbonising energy and carbon-intensive industrial sectors and, where applicable, for related carbon transport and storage infrastructure. The overall objective for energy research and innovation is to contribute to meeting energy and climate targets, the long-term energy and climate policy and the energy-related environmental policy objectives described in Section 2.  Energy research and innovation must67:   develop the scientific and technical knowledge and competence required to use new technologies and new services to make the transition to a sustainable energy system in Sweden in the long term, combining sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply;   develop technologies and services which can be commercialised by Swedish businesses, hence contributing to sustainable growth and the transition and development of the energy system both in Sweden and on other markets, and contribute to and make use of international cooperation on energy.  Energy research and cooperation must also contribute to achieving the general research policy objective68 to make Sweden a world leader in research and innovation and a leading centre of knowledge, where high-quality research, higher education and innovation contribute to social development, welfare, competitive businesses and respond to the challenges facing society, both in Sweden and worldwide.  The public funding available for the National Energy Research and Innovation Programme for the next four years was announced in the 2017 draft budget; the funding increased from 1.3 billion krona in 2017 to 1.6 billion krona in 202069. The areas covered are described in Section 3.5. Beneficiaries in the private sector are expected to contribute private funding equivalent to at least half of the public funding they receive.                                                       67 Government bill 2016/17:66 Forskning och innovation på energiområdet för ekologisk hållbarhet, konkurrenskraft och försörjningstrygghet. 68 Government bill 2016/17:50 Kunskap i samverkan  för samhällets utmaningar och stärkt konkurrenskraft. 69 Government bill 2016/17:1 expenditure area 21 and prop. 2016/17:66 Forskning och innovation på energiområdet för ekologisk hållbarhet, konkurrenskraft och försörjningstrygghet. 40 (199)  Sweden is actively engaged in international negotiations and discussions to spread the message about its transition to a fossil-free welfare state, in which climate work creates innovations, increases competitiveness and improves health. Sweden must become a permanent global showcase for sustainable innovation in transport.  2.5.3 Where applicable, national objectives with regard to competitiveness The commercial policy is designed to create jobs and encourage companies to grow, by fostering entrepreneurship and innovation and ensuring effective competition70.  In its climate policy framework71 the Riksdag states that Sweden must show that climate transition is compatible with welfare and good competition.  3. POLICIES AND MEASURES  3.1 Dimension decarbonisation  3.1.1 GHG emissions and removals  3.1.1.1 Policies and measures to achieve the target set under Regulation (EU) 2018/842 as referred in point 2.1.1 and policies and measures to comply with Regulation (EU) 2018/841, covering all key emitting sectors and sectors for the enhancement of removals, with an outlook to the long-term vision and goal to become a low emission economy and achieving a balance between emissions and removals in accordance with the Paris Agreement. The above climate goals are affected by many European Union policy areas and measures, such as the EU ETS, the Fuel Quality Directive, emission requirements for new vehicles, the Fluorinated Greenhouse Gases Regulations, the Landfill Directive and the Common Agricultural Policy. These will not be discussed here.  They are also affected by many policy areas and measures for renewable energy and energy efficiency (see Section 3.1.2 and 3.2) and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in Sweden. Table 7 summarises the key policies for achieving climate goals.  Table 7. Summary of key policies and measures for achieving the 2030 climate goals (EU policies are in bold type).                                                       70 https://www.regeringen.se/regeringens-politik/naringspolitik/. 71 Government bill 2016/17:146 Report 2016/17:MJU24, Riksdag communication 2016/17:320.
