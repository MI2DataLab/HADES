Industrial competitiveness measures Measure Scope and results/effect envisaged A national industry digitalisation platform for collective leadership  Key objectives of the platform: (i) to facilitate concerted cooperation between industry, business, academia and public authorities in order to increase the added value of the industrial sector, encourage the introduction of digital processes in industry, ensure the international competitiveness of Lithuanian industry and contribute to faster growth of the Lithuanian economy; (ii) to ensure that every company in Lithuania can take full advantage of the benefits of digital innovation by improving products, enhancing processes and adapting the existing business models to the needs of the digital age; Guidelines and action plan for digitisation of Lithuanian industry in 20192030 have been developed. The aim is to encourage the digitisation of industry. Deployment of digital technologies and processes by enterprises will optimise energy efficiency through resource use and waste volumes, thus contributing to national energy and climate targets. A project has been prepared to in 20192020. Within the framework of the European Commission's project on industrial transformation in the regions, the Ministry of Economy and Innovation aims to facilitate business investment in new zero-waste technologies, and stimulate widespread industrial modernisation by exploiting the opportunities offered by European programmes. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 174   Corporate income tax relief (P5) There are 3 corporate tax incentives for companies investing in RDI and 1 for companies investing in technological upgrading: - triple deduction of R&D expenditure; - accelerated depreciation of fixed assets used for R&D; - a reduced corporate income tax rate of 5% on profits from the commercialisation of R&D assets; - a reduction of the taxable profit by the full amount invested in technological upgrading. With a view to a more robust development of R&D activities, additional attention will be paid to simplifying administrative procedures for companies seeking a corporate tax incentive, as well as to raising awareness of the incentives.

The most active energy research institution in Lithuania, which is also a member of the SET-Plan, is the Lithuanian Energy Institute (LEI). The Lithuanian Energy Institute is a technical research centre dedicated to research in the areas of security of energy supply analysis, development of energy planning methods, fuel cells and hydrogen, renewable energy sources, thermal physics and fluid mechanics, nuclear safety, assessment of structural integrity of components and structures and simulation of complex energy systems. The LEI participates in the SET-Plan Action (theme) 10: and associated fuel cycles during operation and decommissioning, while improving the joint research programme for Energy System Integration of the European Energy Research Alliance (EERA) established at the initiative of the SET-Plan, thereby cooperating with authorities in other countries within the scope of the said initiatives. In addition, the Institute has extensive experience in international projects, including work for the IAEA, Horizon 2020, FP5, FP6, FP7, Phare, Intelligent Energy Europe, COST, Eureka, Leonardo da Vinci, INTERREG III, the Baltic Sea Region Programme , South Baltic Cross-border Co-operation Programme and the Nordic Energy Research Programme.
