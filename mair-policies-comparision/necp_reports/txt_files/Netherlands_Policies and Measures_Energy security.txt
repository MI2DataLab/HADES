3.3 Energy security dimension i. Policy and measures related to the elements in point 2.3 Natural gas As previously mentioned, with regard to natural gas, in relation to the phasing out of gas extraction from the Groningen gas field, steps will be taken to reduce the consumption of low-calorific gas:  Encouraging large-scale industrial users to switch from low-calorific gas to other forms of energy;  Phasing out natural gas as a heating source from the built-up environment, starting with new construction projects;  Reducing foreign demand for low-calorific gas in consultation with Belgium, Germany and France.  The construction of a new, large-scale nitrogen plant that will allow 5 to 7 billion mÂ³ of high-calorific gas to be converted into low-calorific gas every year.88 Independently of the development of gas extraction from the Groningen field, the Netherlands is taking steps to boost the extraction of natural gas from small fields in the North Sea. The intention is to replace the current conditional investment deduction of 25% by a generic investment deduction of 40% for all new investments for the exploration and extraction of small gas fields in the Dutch part of the North Sea.89 As described in Chapter 2, there is no specific policy aimed at the diversification of gas suppliers from third countries. The Netherlands namely has a very open and liquid gas market (TTF), on which many parties are active and which has absorbed the sharply falling Dutch production in recent years without any problem. Both the traded volume and the physically delivered volume have risen sharply in recent years (source: GTS):                                                   88 Letter to Parliament on Gas Extraction in Groningen, Parliamentary document 33 529, no. 457. 89 Letter to Parliament on gas extraction from small fields - Parliamentary document 33 529, no. 469.

The suppliers then provide the consumers (businesses and households) with gas. On the TTF, gas is traded based on energy content rather than quality (high-calorific or low-calorific gas). The Dutch grid operator, GTS, ensures that the correct quality is supplied at the exit points. This effective, efficient and very liquid gas market, with the corresponding gas exchange (ICE Endex), combined with an extensive transport network, ensures that international gas flows are attracted, which has a favourable effect on the security of supply, even when domestic gas consumption decreases. With regard to diversification, the Netherlands believes it is important to maintain the required infrastructure (including with regard to the rise of LNG). The Netherlands also has sufficient gas transport and storage capacity, which has allowed it to prepare for the decline in domestic production. In order to prevent small consumers from having their gas cut off during an extremely cold period as the result of a shortage in production and transport capacity, the grid operator GTS has a statutory obligation to reserve volume and capacity to supply small consumers.90 In October 2019, the Gas Preventive Action Plan was presented to the House of Representatives.91 The plan outlines the measures taken to prevent any problems occurring with the gas supply. Therefore, the plan precedes the Gas Protection and Recovery Plan (BHG) that has also been presented and that deals with the measures that can be taken if there is a serious disruption of the gas supply.92 Just like the BHG, this plan also arises from the European Security of Gas Supply Regulation. The Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy is the competent authority under this EU regulation and drafted the plan in collaboration with Gasunie Transport Services (GTS), the operator of the national gas transport grid, and after consultation with stakeholders. Oil There are no specific measures for diversification for oil. The oil market is an unregulated global market that in itself is highly diversified in terms of sources. As long as the market continues to operate, security of supply is guaranteed and the market determines the price and allocation of the available oil around the world. Electricity The Netherlands has major potential for generating renewable electricity. An important aspect of energy security for the Netherlands involves the possibilities for large-scale and long-term storage of renewable electricity. The development of "power to gas" is crucial to continue to meet a large part of its energy needs and the storage of renewable electricity in the form of a gas thereby offers flexibility for the electricity system and a renewable energy carrier for the sustainability of transport and mobility, industry and the built-up environment. The Netherlands does not intend to reduce electricity imports as such. The Netherlands is of the opinion that the further integration of the European electricity market specifically can contribute to continuing to guarantee security of supply in an energy system that is in transition to a climate-neutral energy supply. There are no objectives to increase the diversification of energy sources and suppliers from third countries for electricity. The targets for decarbonisation and expansion of the share of energy generated from renewable sources will nevertheless inevitably lead to a further diversification of generation techniques on the electricity market. See Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 on this matter. The analyses of the NEV 2017 (adopted and proposed policies) roughly show a doubling of the number of petajoules of electricity generated by solar power and wind energy.93 [PM CHECK]. In addition, the intended expansion of the interconnection capacity between the Netherlands and other European Member States will lead to the expansion of the supply of electricity from other Member States. In the next ten years, interconnection capacity is expected to double from 5.55 GW in 2016 to 10.8 GW in 2025. See Chapter 4 for more information. As far as increasing the flexibility of the system is concerned, regulation of the electricity market will be organised over the next few years by the legislative agenda, so that investments in the use of flexibility (also by/from small consumers) will be rewarded in accordance with the market. To this end, small consumers must get better access to the short-term electricity market and be supplied with an aggregator.94                                                   90 Security of Supply Gas Act Decree, Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 2004, 170. 91 Letter to Parliament on Preventative Action Plan 2019 - Parliamentary document 29023 no. 253 92 Letter to Parliament on the Gas Protection and Recovery Plan - Parliamentary document 29023 no. 252 93 NEV 2017, Table 13, page 230. 94 Legislative agenda, Parliamentary document II, 2017-2018, 30 196, no. 566.    94 ii. Regional cooperation in this field In respect of natural gas, the government is working closely with Belgium, Germany, France and Luxembourg through the Pentalateral Gas Platform. This Platform is supported by the Benelux Secretariat and is also home to the risk group for low-calorific gas that was created under Regulation (EU) 2017/1938. In addition, collaboration takes place through and in the following risk groups that were created pursuant to the Regulation cited above: Belarus, Baltic Sea, Norway, Denmark and the UK. In view of the specific problems related to gas extraction in Groningen and the conversion of low-calorific gas consumption in Belgium, France and Germany, it was recently decided to set up a task force consisting of representatives of the governments, grid operators and energy regulators of these countries who will report semi-annually on the progress of conversion operations. As far as electricity is concerned, the Netherlands works closely with Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, Austria and Switzerland at the regional level through the Pentalateral Energy Forum, in the field of market coupling, security of supply and market flexibility. iii. If applicable, financing measures in this area at a national level, including European Union support and the use of EU funds Not applicable. 3.4 Internal energy market dimension 3.4.1 Electricity infrastructure i. Policy and measures to achieve the targeted level of interconnection established in Article 4(d) The 15% interconnection target has already been achieved. Interconnection with Germany, Belgium and Denmark will be expanded between now and 2030. We do not consider a higher, generic interconnection target to be of use. The added value of additional interconnection differs per border. Levels of price differences between regions are the most significant indicator of the expected added value of new investments in interconnection. Efforts to make more efficient use of existing interconnection or the achievement of better cross-border agreements are valid alternatives to new, physical interconnection. In this context, the Netherlands, as a participating country in the Pentalateral, has actively contributed to the implementation of the flow-based market coupling system. In principle, the Netherlands is in favour of new interconnectors, on the condition that the socio-economic and ecological cost-benefit analyses indicate positive outcomes. ii. Regional cooperation in this field Regional cooperation with neighbouring countries is based on the optimisation of flows and capacity through so-called flow-based market coupling. This cooperation takes place between the countries of the Pentalateral Energy Forum. In addition, grid operators collaborate by sharing information through RSCs (Regional Security Coordinators). Grid operators work closely when planning infrastructure projects (through ten-year development plans), including through the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E). In the context of the new market design, there are proposals to expand the role and tasks of the RSCs. iii. If applicable
