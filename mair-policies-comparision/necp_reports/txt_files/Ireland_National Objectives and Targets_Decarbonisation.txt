2.1. Dimension Decarbonisation 2.1.1. GHG Emissions and Removals i. The elements set out in point (a)(1) of Article 4  Effort Sharing Regulation The "Effort Sharing Regulation" (ESR), sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for Member States for each year for the period 20212030. These targets cover sectors of the economy that fall outside the scope of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). These sectors, including transport, buildings, agriculture and waste management, account for almost 60% of total EU emissions and 74% for Ireland. The Regulation is the follow-up to the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD), which established national emissions targets for Member States in the non-ETS sectors between 2013 and 2020. For the ESR, targets have been assigned to Member States based on GDP per capita and the cost-effectiveness of domestic emissions reductions within individual Member States. The ESR enshrines a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for Ireland of 30% by 2030 relative to 2005 levels.  There are no individual targets for each sector in the ESR. The 30% reduction target that has been set for Ireland covers all non-ETS sectors, including transport, buildings, agriculture and waste management.    30 Use of ESR Flexibilities Flexibility options built into the ESR agreement allow Ireland to transfer 4% of credits from the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and to account for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) credits equivalent to a maximum of 26.8 Mt CO2 equivalent over the period 2021-2030.  ETS flexibility: Eligible Member States have to notify the Commission by the end of 2019 of the amount of this flexibility they will use over the period. Since the transfer is strictly limited in volume, and decided beforehand, predictability and environmental integrity are maintained. Ireland will be able to avail of a transfer of 4% of its 2005 emissions to be used for compliance under the ESR, for every year in the 2021-2030 period. The modelling and trajectories set out under this plan do not assume use of the ETS flexibility.  LULUCF (Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry) flexibility: All Member States are eligible to make use of this flexibility, while access is higher for Member States with a larger share of emissions from agriculture (Ireland received highest %- 5.6% - this equates to a maximum amount of 26.8 Mt to be taken from the LULUCF sector). In line with EU guidance, this recognises that there is a lower mitigation potential for emissions from the agriculture sector. Ireland will use this flexibility.  Ireland28 represents only 10% of EU-28 emissions. As a portion of the non-ETS sector (for which the State is responsible under EU law), agriculture represents over 45% of non-ETS emissions in Ireland, but only 18% of EU-28 non-ETS emissions. This high proportion of agriculture emissions reflects the importance of the agriculture sector to the Irish economy, the biological nature of agricultural emissions and the lack of heavy industry in the Irish economic make-up. Therefore, recognition of the unusually large contribution of agriculture to our national emissions is vitally important to Ireland. The EU has already recognised (including in European Council conclusions) the multiple objectives of the agriculture and land use sector with their lower mitigation potential.  Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) The LULUCF Regulation sets out the accounting rules for emissions and removals from the categories of afforested land, deforested land, managed cropland, managed grassland, managed forest land and managed wetland. The inclusion of LULUCF is seen as reflective of the recognition in the Paris Agreement of the role of balancing sources and sinks in climate action and the lower mitigation potential of   31 agriculture. Final agreement of the LULUCF Regulation was reached at COREPER (Committee of Permanent Representatives in the European Union) in December 2017. Key targets and commitments for Ireland to achieve the 26.8 MtCO2eq. abatement through LULUCF actions over the period 2021 to 2030 include:  an average of 8,000 ha per annum of newly planted forest, and sustainable forest management of existing forests (up to 21 MtCO2eq. cumulative abatement)   at least 40,000 ha per annum of reduced management intensity of grasslands on drained organic soils (4.4 MtCO2eq. cumulative abatement)   better management of grasslands, tillage land and non-agricultural wetlands (1.4 MtCO2eq. cumulative abatement)  National Policy Position In June 2019, the Irish government agreed to support the adoption of a net zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050 at EU level, and to pursue a trajectory of emissions reduction nationally which is in line with reaching net zero in Ireland by 2050, and to evaluate in detail the changes which would be necessary in Ireland to achieve this target at national level. The Climate Action Plan 2019 puts in place a decarbonisation pathway to 2030 which would be consistent with the adoption of a net zero target in Ireland by 2050. Action 1 under the Plan has also committed to evaluating in detail the changes required to adopt a more ambitious commitment of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, as part of finalising Is long-term climate strategy as per the advice of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action. -term Strategy identifies additional measures and pathways beyond 2030, towards decarbonisation to 2050 underpinned by analysis of transition options across all key sectors of the economy, including energy, buildings, transport, enterprise, waste, agriculture and land-use. The Long-Term Strategy will inform future policy making, business investment decisions and household, community and citizen action. It builds on the decarbonisation pathway to 2030 detailed in the Climate Action Plan 2019 and reflected in this National Energy and Climat-term Strategy is in fulfilment of our EU obligation to prepare and submit to the European Commission a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy with a perspective of at least 30 years.

The NAF identifies 12 key national sectors under the remit of 7 Government Ministers where sectoral adaptation plans were required to be submitted to Government for approval by 30 September 2019. The NAF will be reviewed in line with statutory requirements at least once before January 2023. The sectoral plans were approved by Government in October 2019.

Local Authority Adaptation Strategy Development Guidelinesof Communications, Climate Action and Environment. Circular Economy n the waste hierarchy: waste prevention; preparing for reuse; recycling; and energy recovery; with disposal, namely landfill, being the least desirable option. The current strategic national waste prevention plan (2014 -2020) is called Towards a Resource Efficient Ireland and is backed by three Regional Waste Management Plans (2015-2021). As part of a series of measures included in the Climate Action Plan 2019, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment plans to transform the national approach to waste in line with modern, circular economy principles. This will involve a mind-set change from accepting waste as a fact of life, to demanding the highest level of protection for our natural and man-made resources and the environment. A revised national policy will be delivered in 2020 to lead the necessary transformation from waste management to circular economy practices. ey objective in this regard is to lead the transformation from waste management to circular economy practice through delivery of our new national policy.      35 A public consultation was launched at the end of 2019 focussing on a number of key areas including:  Measures to tackle fast fashion   Better labelling for recyclable goods  Targets to ensure correct bins are used, providing clearer information on what goes into each bin  Measures to halve food waste  Ending the use of non-recyclable plastic  How to further crack down on illegal dumping  Incentivising the use of recycled materials in the construction industry  Working with other EU Member States to design the structure of an EU wide plastic packaging tax to encourage the further prevention of plastic packaging.  How we can raise awareness among individuals and businesses on how best to manage their waste. This will include consideration of making waste prevention/recycling part of the school curriculum. Biodiversity Biodiversity provides us with clean air, water, food, materials, medicines and health benefits. It supports pollination and soil fertility, regulates climate and protects us from extreme weather and other impacts arising from climate change. Biodiversity contributes to health, wellbeing and sustainable development as set out in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Despite the important role that biodiversity plays in underpinning our economy, health and resilience to climate change, we are losing biodiversity at a rate seen only during previous mass extinctions. By the end of the century, climate change is likely to become the most significant driver of biodiversity loss. Increases in temperature will change the timing of life cycle events and the distribution of species. The physical impact of more intense storms and increased winter/spring rainfall will accelerate the degradation of habitats that are already compromised by unsustainable practices. The conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity needs to be escalated. Actions within this Biodiversity Sectoral Climate Change Adaptation Plan build on the foundations of the National Biodiversity Action Plan (2017- 2021) and are aimed at improving sustainable agriculture and fisheries, better soil and land management and, most urgently, the restoration of natural systems. The Biodiversity Adaptation Plan also emphasises the need to consider biodiversity as an adaptation tool for other sectors.   36 The primary objective of the Biodiversity Adaptation Plan is to protect biodiversity from the impacts of climate change and to conserve and manage ecosystems so that they deliver services that increase the adaptive capacity of people and biodiversity while also contributing to climate change mitigation. Bioeconomy -term strategy outlines the bioeconomy as one of the strategic priorities in the road to a climate neutral economy. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment co-chair the national Bioeconomy Implementation Group promoted and action scaled up. A National policy statement on the bioeconomy was published in 2018, and the First Progress Report of the Group was published in September 2019. The importance of the bioAction Plan and other cross-sectoral policies including Future Jobs Ireland. The Government recognises that the bioeconomy is crucial for sustainability while also providing an impetus to rural development and employment. The Action Plan for Rural Development (2017) underlines how the bioeconomy can contribute to decarbonisation, sustainable growth and job creation in the agricultural, industrial and technological sectors in rural areas. With 80% of the agri-food sector based in rural Ireland, the potential for the bioeconomy to boost employment in regions is clear.   be a global leader for the bioeconomy through a co-advantage and that fully exploits the opportunities available while monitoring and avoiding unintended consequences. Our goal is to move Ireland beyond simply a target compliance and carbon mitigation focus to integrating sustainable economic development into our economic model as we transition to a low carbon and circular economy. Peatlands Strategy  In recent years, along with increased understanding and concern over climate change, scientific research has established the importance of peatlands as carbon stores and potential buttresses against some of the projected effects of climate change. As they develop, peatlands slowly remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the form of peat. By taking the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over long periods and by emitting other greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4), natural bogs affect and regulate the global climate.  was published in 2015 and will be revised in 2020 in light of the priority being given to climate crisis adaptation and the importance of peatlands in this regard.   37 Air Quality in this area is to reduce harmful emissions and improve air quality and public health in a manner which meets current and future EU and international Clean Air Strategy with the aim of promoting clean air policies to enhance and protect the quality of the air we breathe. The Clean Air Strategy will provide the strategic policy framework necessary to identify and promote the integrated measures across government policy that are required to reduce air pollution and promote cleaner air. Our emissions are measured on an annual basis and Ireland has specific responsibilities and targets under a number of international and European agreements. The most notable of these being the international Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) and the EU National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive (EU) 2016/2284). The Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) Directive underpins our responsibilities for our ambient air quality and this sets maximum concentration levels for a range of priority pollutants that impact on human health. There are a number of air pollutants that Ireland has been monitoring and reducing over the last few decades, and details of all these can be found in the EPA inventory report. However the priority air pollutants are as follows:  Nitrogen oxide (NOx)  Ammonia (NH3)   Fine particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10)  Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs)  Sulphur dioxide (SO2) The latest emissions data shows that we are in compliance with our 2010 emissions targets for all pollutants except ammonia. (NAPCP), was completed in July 2019 as required under NEC Directive (transposed by the European Union (National Emission Ceilings) Regulations 2018 (Statutory Instrument (S.I) No. 232/2018)). An updated version of the NAPCP is currently being prepared for submission in September 2020 to reflect the policies and measures set out under the Climate Action Plan and this Plan. It will also include a number of additional programmes and measures in relation to agriculture which are expected to bring our emissions levels into compliance. Ireland recognises the significance of clean air to the health and well-being of its citizens and its environment and is aware of its international obligations in this area. As the population and economy grow, and as sectors develop, there are both challenges and opportunities to   38 be recognised in regard to managing future air quality. In this regard Ireland is fully committed to developing and deploying further measures and initiatives to enhance and protect air quality in parallel with broader national policy priorities of relevance.  2.1.2. Renewable Energy i. The elements set out in point (a)(2) of Article 4 Tables 4 and 5 set out the estimated trajectory for the overall share of renewable energy for two scenarios:  With Existing Measures (WEM), low oil price with fixed carbon tax  With Additional Measures (WAM), low oil price with variable carbon tax The tables also provide a comparison between the estimated trajectory and that set out in the Governance Regulation and set out the evolution of RES-E, RES-H and RES-T over the two scenarios. The modelling indicates Irelangross final energy consumption across the three energy sectors, for 2018, for a projection over the decade between, 2020 and 2030 and also a snapshot look for 2040). The impact of planned policies and measures can be observed by comparing the WEM with the WAM described in further detail section 5.

This is primarily due to the fact that large projects, particularly offshore wind projects, cannot be constructed in shorter timeframes and will not become operational in Irish waters until mid-decade. ii. Estimated trajectories for the sectoral share of renewable energy in final energy consumption from 2021 to 2030 in the electricity, heating and cooling, and transport sector The tables at section 2.1.2(i) set out the estimated trajectories for the share of renewable energy by sector for each of the two scenarios. The figures provided for RES-T are based on actual energy share and do not include the use of multipliers as set out in the Renewable Energy Directive. In order to promote the use of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector, in line with Article 23.1 of the 2018 Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (recast), Ireland intends to adhere to the indicative 1.1 percentage point increase (i.e. without the inclusion of waste heat and cold).  District heating and cooling in Ireland is at a very low level and is estimated at most at about 0.8% of heat consumption. dispersed settlement structure with low population density. Table 5 illustrating the annual trajectories for the WAM scenario assumptions for renewable energy, 2018-2040, shows an increase in the percentage of renewables in heating and cooling (not including waste heat and cooling) rising from a figure of 7.8% in 2020 to 9.7% in 2022, 15.1% in 2025, 18.6% in 2027, and to 24.0% in 2030.    40 These trajectories would indicate that the requirements to endeavour to increase the share of renewable energy in heating and cooling by an indicative 1.1% as an annual average for the period 2021 to 2025 and 2026 to 2030, will be fulfilled. The increase in the first period is forecast to be 7.3% and the increase in the second period is forecast to be 8.9%. Measures to deploy energy from renewable sources in the heating and cooling sector le Heat which has the primary objective of increasing the level of renewable energy in the heat sector. Heat pump uptake through building regulations and support schemes will also drive the growth of renewables.  Use of the structures established under the national energy savings obligation set out in Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU will be considered when deciding on the further implementation and monitoring of the measures referred to in Article 23.3 of the Renewables Directive. iii.
