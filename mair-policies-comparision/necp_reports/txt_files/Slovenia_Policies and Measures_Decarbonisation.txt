It also provides the basis for the preparation of the Strategic Plan for the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). It is a response to the specific CAP objectives, which are addressed in the document in four groups of objectives, namely:   resilient and competitive food production and processing,    sustainable management of natural resources and the provision of public goods,    raising the quality of life and economic activity in rural areas,    horizontal objective: enhancing knowledge design and transfer. 66  The Member States will have to draw up strategic plans for the implementation of the CAP, which will cover the first pillar (direct payments, sectoral measures) and the second pillar (rural development measures The contents of the strategic plans will be laid down in regulation. One of the general objectives of the proposal for a regulation is also to strengthen efforts to achieve climate change (Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules on support for strategic plans to be drawn up by the Member States under the Common agricultural policy (CAP Strategic Plans) and financed by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council  Revised Presidency drafting suggestions, 7 June 2019). 67  Based on the analysis of the state and development of forests and the assessment of forest management, the area plans identify the main problems in forest management. The objectives of forest management include, in particular, the fundamental effects (forest roles) that are to be achieved through forest management and are reflected in particular in increasing timber production, preserving biodiversity and nature conservation, securing CO2 sinks and enhancing the social role of forests in major cities and towns and cities and tourist resorts. The plans shall, as far as possible, take account of the guidelines of the national forest programme. The basic strategic orientations and priorities in forest management are, above all, to ensure the sustainability of forest yields and all their roles, to preserve forest biodiversity at landscape, ecosystem, species and genetic levels, to preserve the health and vitality of forests, to increase the utilisation of production potential of forest habitats, to increase openness of forests with forest roads and the introduction of modern technologies. The planned harvest is determined on the basis of stand conditions, the ratio of developmental stages, goals and cultivation conditions in the individual growing classes. 68 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Measures and policies in agriculture Table 17: A review of existing instruments in agriculture  Name of instrument Strategic basis Type of instrument Responsibility Activities and deadlines PROMOTING THE REDUCTION OF GHG EMISSIONS IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR Public advisory service OP TGP education/ training MKGP/KGZS Continuation and upgrade of implementation [2020-2030]:  to increase the volume of work of the advisory service in the feeding of cattle and sheep and direct it to farms and categories of animals that are not yet achieving adequate results in the area of efficient breeding.
