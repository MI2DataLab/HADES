2.3 Dimension energy security  2.3.1 The elements set out in point (c) of Article 4  2.3.1.1 National objectives with regard to  increasing the diversification of energy sources and supply from third countries, the purpose of which may be to reduce energy import dependency  increasing the flexibility of the national energy system, and  addressing constrained or interrupted supply of an energy source, for the purpose of improving the resilience of regional and national energy systems, including a timeframe for when the objectives should be met. Besides the requirements and criteria in European Union legislation, there are no national targets for reducing dependence on importing energy from third countries. Instead, the energy supply is secured by properly functioning energy 29 (199) markets, where energy is traded freely as far as possible, both within Sweden and between Sweden and other countries.  See Section 2.3.4 for national objectives for increasing the flexibility of the national energy system.  Responsibility for a secure energy supply, and hence for objectives to address constrained or interrupted supply, is shared among many different operators. A secure energy supply, together with sustainability and competitiveness, is the overall objective of Swedish energy policy. It is also an integral part of the general guidelines for crisis management and civil defence. The energy markets, which are largely international, provide a means of preventing interruptions and shortages or reducing their severity. The energy supply can be adapted to new requirements on market conditions. The public authorities have an important role in designing frameworks and monitoring the energy markets to ensure that they are functioning well.  Electricity supply There is currently no specific target for the security of the electricity supply. The revised Electricity Market Regulation42 requires all Member States that have a capacity mechanism to define a supply security target in the form of a reliability standard. An action plan to identify remaining market failures and distortions as a result of legislation to improve the operation of the market was drawn up during the preparation of this standard. In its 2020 appropriation directive, the Government commissioned the Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate to submit proposals for a reliability standard. Sweden has had a capacity mechanism in the form of a power reserve since 2003 to manage winter peaks in electricity consumption (see Section 3.3 for more information). In a notice to the Government in May 2019, the Riksdag asked it to develop an electricity supply security target for Sweden43. The Government intends to develop an accounting method for electricity supply security in future draft budgets.  A rapid rise in electricity consumption in some metropolitan areas, mainly as a result of increased urbanisation and new industry, combined with the length of time needed to increase the capacity of the grid, can increase the risk of regional capacity shortages, particularly if the scarcity is not reflected in the price. The Government has therefore commissioned the Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate to investigate the extent of the capacity shortage in the grid, investigate the history of the problem and analyse conditions and measures linked to the problems identified. It must submit                                                       42 Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electricity. 43 Report 2018/19:NU12, Riksdag communication 2018/19:210. 30 (199) its final report to the Swedish Government Offices (Infrastructure Department) by 1 October 2020 and an interim report by 30 April 2020.  Under Article 10 of the Risk-Preparedness Regulation44 the competent authority of each Member State must establish a risk-preparedness plan for electricity. A risk-preparedness plan must be adopted by 5 January 2022 and must be updated every four years. As Sweden does not have a competent authority for electricity, there is currently no Swedish risk-preparedness plan for electricity.  The national grid is planned and operated according to the (n-1) principle, which means that a fault in a single component should not affect the electricity supply. In the event of a fault, the effects must be remedied within 15 minutes and the electricity system must then be prepared for any new fault. This requires rapid access to an active fault reserve45. If the grid is damaged, the necessary repairs must be started without delay.  The objective for power cuts is expressed as an obligation for network owners to ensure that they do not last for more than 24 hours, unless the   Section 3.3 discusses shortages of electricity and capacity in more detail. Section 4.4 analyses the adequacy of future capacity.  Oil supply Under the IEP Agreement46 and the Oil Stocks Directive47, Sweden is Section 3.3 provides more information about this.  Gas supply Security of Gas Supply Regulation48 requires protected customers to have access to gas for at least 30 days if the gas supply is disrupted. Sweden has decided that only households connected to the Western Swedish gas network should be defined as protected customers; they account for 2% solidarity protected customers may include, under specific conditions, certain essential social services and district heating installations.                                                       44 Regulation (EU) 2019/941 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector and repealing Directive 2005/89/EC. 45 A generation failure or a fault in the grid disrupts the operation of the electricity system. If the balancing power market does not have the capacity to deal with the problem, the state-owned enterprise Svenska kraftn√§t activates the reserve capacity to restore the balance in the system. The reserve capacity is currently provided primarily by gas turbines located in the southern bidding zones (SE3 and SE4). 46 The International Energy Agencys Agreement on an International Energy Programme. 47 Council Directive 2009/119/EG of 14 September 2009 imposing an obligation on Member States to maintain minimum stocks of crude oil and/or petroleum products. 48 Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2017 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and repealing Regulation (EU) No 994/2010. 31 (199)  2.3.2 National objectives with regard to increasing the diversification of energy sources and supply from third countries for the purpose of increasing the resilience of regional and national energy systems.

To achieve this, we must continue to promote demand response, for example by removing regulatory obstacles to new business models.  In its bill The Focus of Energy Policy 49 the Government states that the role of the network operator may have to be broadened to take full advantage of the benefits of smart grids, energy storage and demand response for the electricity system.  Emergency oil stocks are based on the target for minimum stocks in the Oil Stocks Directive50 and the Agreement on an International Energy Program, which requires members of the International Energy Agency to hold oil   For demand response, see Section 2.4.3
