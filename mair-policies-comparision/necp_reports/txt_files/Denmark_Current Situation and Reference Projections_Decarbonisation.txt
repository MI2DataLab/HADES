Greenhouse gas emissions and removals (i) Trends in current GHG emissions and removals in the EU ETS, effort sharing and LULUCF sectors and different energy sectors The trends in current Danish GHG emissions and removals from 1990-2017 are shown in Figure 23 below A key result is that total GHG emissions without LULUCF have decreased 32% since 1990.  Figure 23. GHG emissions by gas 1990-2040 [kt of CO2eq]  Other highlights are:  total GHG emissions with LULUCF have decreased 32%  CO2 emissions without LULUCF have decreased 35%  CO2 emissions with LULUCF have decreased 36%  CH4 emissions without LULUCF have decreased 9%  CH4 emissions with LULUCF have decreased 9%  N2O emissions without LULUCF have decreased 32%  N2O emissions with LULUCF have decreased 31%          139  Figure 24 shows the GHG emissions reductions achieved, distributed between emissions covered by the EU ETS system and non-ETS emissions. As the EU ETS did not exist until 2005 the split of total emissions into ETS and non-ETS 1990-2004 is based on proxy estimates and not on reported ETS emissions.   From 2005, where the reporting of ETS emissions began, until 2017:   EU ETS CO2 emissions have decreased 43%   non-ETS GHG emissions without LULUCF have decreased 17%   Figure 24. GHG emissions in the ETS and the non-ETS (ESD, ESR) sectors 1990-2040 [ktCO2eq]            140  Emissions have been particularly reduced in the energy sector and in energy industries, which is shown in Figure 25 below. Highlights of GHG emissions reductions by IPCC energy sector from 1990-2017 are:  energy sector emissions decreased 36%  energy industry emissions decreased 57%  manufacturing industry emissions and construction decreased 26%  transport emissions increased 23%    Figure 25. GHG emissions by IPCC energy sector 1990-2040 [ktCO2eq]               141  Figure 26 shows the total GHG emissions by IPCC main sector from 1990-2017:  energy sector decreased 36%  industrial processes and product use decreased 14%  agriculture decreased 16%  land use, land-use change and forestry decreased 40%   waste decreased 36%  Figure 26. GHG emissions by IPCC main sector 1990-2040 [ktCO2eq]             142  Figure 27 shows that:  LULUCF net emissions decreased 40% from 1990-2017  KP1 net credits accumulated to 8.865 kt CO2eq  Figure 27. GHG emissions and accounting quantities in the LULUCF sector 1990-2040 [ktCO2eq].               143  (ii) Projections of sectoral developments with existing national and Union policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) The previous section showed the past and current emissions, i.e. the development from 1990-2017. This section describes the projections from 2017-2040, shown in the figures presented in the previous section.   Figure 23 above shows the development of GHG emissions by gas from 1990-2040. A key result of the projection is that total GHG emissions without LULUCF are expected to decrease 46% from 1990 to 2030 and 49% from 1990 to 2040.  Other results of the projections are:   total GHG emissions with LULUCF decrease 45% from 1990 to 2030 and 47% from 1990 to 2040   CO2 emissions without LULUCF decrease 51% from 1990 to 2030 and 56% from 1990 to 2040    CO2 emissions with LULUCF decrease 50% from 1990 to 2030 and 53% from 1990 to 2040   CH4 emissions without LULUCF decrease 13% from 1990 to 2030 and 14% from 1990 to 2040   CH4 emissions with LULUCF decrease 12% from 1990 to 2030 and 13% from 1990 to 2040   N2O emissions without LULUCF decrease 36% from 1990 to 2030 and 35% from 1990 to 2040   N2O emissions with LULUCF decrease 36% from 1990 to 2030 and 35% from 1990 to 2040   Figure 24 shows from 1990-2040 emissions in EU ETS and non-ETS. As the EU ETS did not exist until 2005 the split of total emissions into ETS and non-ETS 1990-2004 is based on proxy estimates and not on reported ETS emissions.   From 2005, where the reporting of ETS emissions began, the projection shows that:  EU ETS CO2 emissions decrease 68% from 2005 to 2030 and 69% from 2005 to 2040   non-ETS GHG emissions without LULUCF decrease 25% from 2005 to 2030 and 30% from 2005 to 2040. The non-ETS projecti-ETS greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 by at least 39 percent relative to emissions in 2005. Additional policies and measures to meet the objective are to be decided after the submission of the NECP, including climate action plans. For more information on this, see section 2.1.1.  Figure 25 shows from 1990-2040 the total GHG emissions by sector. The projection shows that:   energy sector emissions decreases 53% from 1990 to 2030 and 58% from 1990 to 2040         144   emissions from energy industries decrease 82% from 1990 to 2030 and 84% from 1990 to 2040  emissions from manufacturing industries and construction decrease 33% from 1990 to 2030 and 35% from 1990 to 2040    transport emissions increase 19% from 1990 to 2030, but will be fading from already around 2022, due to energy efficiency and increased share of renewable energy in the transport sector, reaching a level of 5% above 1990 levels in 2040   other sectors emissions decrease 66% from 1990 to 2030 and 70% from 1990 to 2040  Figure 26 shows from 1990-2040 the total GHG emissions by IPCC sector. The projection shows that:  energy sector emissions decreases 53% from 1990 to 2030 and 58% from 1990 to 2040  industrial processes and product use emissions decrease 12% from 1990 to 2030 and 9% from 1990 to 2040    agricultural emissions decrease 17% from 1990 to 2030 and 15% from 1990 to 2040  land use, land-use change and forestry emissions decreases 31% from 1990 to 2030 and 25% from 1990 to 2040  emissions from waste decreases 52% from 1990 to 2030 and 63% from 1990 to 2040  Figure 27 shows the LULUCF emissions and net credits from 1990-2040. The projection shows that:   LULUCF emissions decrease 31% from 1990 to 2030 and 25% from 1990 to 2040   KP2 net emissions accumulates to 23.806 ktCO2eq  EU/LULUCF (2021-2030) net emissions accumulate to at least 14.600 ktCO2eq  Projections of air pollutants  In response to a recommendation from the Commission to the draft of this NECP, information about projections of air pollutants is included here.

Renewable energy  (i) Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in each of these sectors Figure 28 shows that from 2005-2017 the overall Renewable Energy Share increased from 16% to 34% and the Renewable Energy Share of Electricity increased from 27% to 64%.  Figure 28. Overall Renewable Energy Share (RES), Renewable Energy Share in Heating/Cooling (RES-H/C), Renewable Energy Share in Electricity (RES-E), Renewable Energy Share in Transport (RES-T), 2005-2040 [%]              146  Figure 29 shows the sources of renewable energy in the respective sectors in 2017. It is worth noting that:  bioenergy accounted for almost two thirds of overall Renewable Energy in 2017 (21 percentage points of 34 % overall RE share in energy), mainly due to its large role in heating/cooling. In electricity, bioenergy has a smaller share. onshore and offshore wind power together accounted for two thirds, i.e. 43 percentage points out of the 64% RE in electricity. The remaining part is almost entirely bioenergy.   biofuels accounted for the 5% of the RES-T  Figure 29. RES, RES-H/C, RES-E, RES-T year 2017 [%]             147  (ii) Indicative projections of development with existing policies for the year 2030 (with an outlook to the year 2040) This section refers to the projection part of the figures presented in the previous section.  Figure 28 on shares of Renewable Energy in various sectors shows the expected development from 2017-2040. A key result of the projections is that overall Renewable Energy Share increases from 34% in 2017 to 54% in 2030. This brings the renewable energy share very close to the 55% ambition of the Energy Agreement from June 2018, see section 1.  Another remarkable result of the projection is that the share of Renewable Energy in electricity is expected to increase from 64% in 2017 to 109% in 2030, which implies that Danish consumption of electricity from 2028, on average over a year, is projected to be covered entirely by renewable energy. This projection should also be seen in context with the Energy Agreement, in which initiatives agreed upon are expected to lead to a renewable energy share in electricity above 100% of consumption in 2030 (see section 1).   The projection also shows, however, that without new initiatives, consumption of electricity assumption that electricity consumption will continue to grow, mainly from data centres and there are currently no decisions on the establishment of new production capacity beyond 2030.   In terms of heating/cooling, the RE share is expected to increase from 44% in 2017 to 60% in 2030, whereas in transport the RE share is expected to grow from 7% in 2017 to 19% in 2030.             148  Figure 30 shows the share of various technologies in the overall RE mix from 2017-2040. The projection shows that while biomass continues to play a major role due to its share in heating, the increase of renewable energy in the overall mix is almost entirely due to other RE sources, notably offshore wind, ambient heat for heat pumps and solar PV:   The share of offshore wind power increases from 3 pct.-point in 2017 to 12 pct.-point in 2030 to 10 pct.-point in 2040   The share of onshore wind power increases from 5 pct.-point in 2017 to 8 pct.-point in 2030 to 10 pct.-point in 2040  The share of bioenergy decreases from 21 pct.-point in 2017 to 23 pct.-point in 2030 and then falls to 21 pct.-point in 2040  The share of solar energy increases from 1 pct.-point in 2017 to 4 pct.-point in 2030 to 6 pct.-point in 2040  The share of waste (bio-degradable) is 3 pct.-point in 2017 and in 2030, and it decreases from 3 pct.-point in 2030 to 2 pct.-point in 2040  The share of ambient heat for heat pumps increases from 1 pct.-point in 2017 to 5 pct.-point in 2030 to 7 pct.-point in 2040  Figure 30. RES by technology 2017-2040 [%]                149  Figure 31 shows RES-H/C by technology from 2017-2040. A key result of the projection is that the share of bioenergy increases from 36 pct.-point in 2017 to 42 pct.-point in 2030, but then falls to 39 pct.-point in 2040, largely due to heat pumps penetrating the market. In the projection, the share of ambient heat for heat pumps increases from 3 pct.-point in 2017 to 12 pct.-point in 2030 to 17 pct.-point in 2040  Other results are:  The share of solar energy increases from 1 pct.-point in 2017 to 2 pct.-point in 2030 to 3 pct.-point in 2040  The share of waste (bio-degradable) is constant with 5 pct.-point in 2017 to 2030 and to 2040  Figure 31. RES-H/C by technology 2017-2040 [%].             150  Figure 32 shows RES-E by technology from 2017-2040. Overall, it is worth noting that the increase in the RE share of electricity towards 2030 is particularly due to an increase in wind and solar. For example, the share of offshore wind power increases from 15 % in 2017 to 48 % in 2030, and the share of solar energy increases from 3 % in 2017 to 13 % in 2030.   Other results of the projection are:    The share of onshore wind power increases from 29 pct.-point in 2017 to 33 pct.-point in 2030 to 34 pct.-point in 2040  The share of bioenergy decreases from 15 pct.-point in 2017 to 13 pct.-point in 2030 to 9 pct.-point in 2040  to 17 pct.-point in 2040  The share of waste (bio-degradable) is constant with 2 pct.-point in 2017 to 2030 and decreases to 1 pct.-point in 2040  As also mentioned above, the reason why overall RE share of electricity drops below 100 % o growing electricity consumption from new production capacity beyond 2030. Figure 32. RES-E by technology 2017-2040 [%]             151  In terms of RE in transport, the development is very much dependent on how fast Electric Vehicles will penetrate the market. With the current knowledge, and the existing policies and measures, it is expected that this development takes off in the mid-2020'es. With that assumption, Figure 33 shows the share of Renewable Energy in transport by technology from 2017-2040.   The projection shows that:   The share of biofuel first generation is constant with 5 pct.-point in 2017 to 2030 and decreases to 4 pct.-point in 2040   The share of biofuel second generation increases from 0 pct.-point in 2017 to 2 pct.-point in 2030 and in 2040  The share of electricity rail increases from 1 pct.-point in 2017 to 3 pct.-point in 2030 to 4 pct.-point in 2040  The share of electricity road increases from 0 pct.-point in 2017 to 8 pct.-point in 2030 to 36 pct.-point in 2040  Figure 33.
