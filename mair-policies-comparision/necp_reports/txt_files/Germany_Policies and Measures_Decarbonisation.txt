62  3. Policies and measures 3.1. Decarbonisation dimension 3.1.1. GHG emissions and removals 3.1.1.i. Policies and measures to achieve the target set under Regulation (EU) 2018/842 as referred to in Section 2.1.1 and policies and measures to comply with Regulation (EU) 2018/841, covering all key emitting sectors and sectors for the enhancement of removals, with an outlook to the long-term vision and goal to become a low-emission economy and achieving a balance between emissions and removals in accordance with the Paris Agreement  Enshrining of climate goals into law  3.1.1.i.1. Federal Climate Protection Act  2030. Germany has also committed to pursuing greenhouse gas neutrality by 2050 as a long-term objective. In 2025, annual emissions will be set for subsequent periods after 2030. These emission volumes must be in line with the climate protection goals of the Act and with European requirements. By 2030, greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced by at least 55%, in accordance with the goals of the Climate Action Plan 2050. For this purpose, the Act lays down annual emissions for the sectors energy, industry, transport, buildings and agriculture, and reviews these levels each year. For the energy sector, where a steady, continuous decrease in emissions is aimed for, the years 2022 and 2030 are crucial in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Growth, Structural Change and Employment. Progress in the individual sectors will be assessed annually and monitored by an independent panel of experts on climate issues. If a sector deviates from its reduction trajectory, the Federal Government will readjust without delay. The federal ministry that is mainly responsible for that sector by dint of its portfolio will put forward a contingency programme within 3 months. On the basis of that programme, the Federal Government decides what measures it will take to achieve the climate targets.  Carbon pricing  3.1.1.i.2. Carbon pricing in the heating and transport sectors  Introduction of a national fuel emissions trading system On 15 November 2019, the German Bundestag passed its law on the national fuel emissions trading system (Fuel Emissions Trading Act, BEHG). After referral to the Bundesrat, the Act was promulgated on 19 December 2019. The Act introduces a national emissions trading system for sectors that are not covered by the European emissions trading system, thereby creating a basis for carbon pricing in those sectors. In principle, all fuels are included in the national emissions trading system, regardless of the sector in which the fuels are used. In a start-up phase during the first 2 years, however, only the main primary fuels  petrol, gas oil, fuel oil, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas  will initially be included.  In the heating sector, the system covers the emissions produced by heat generation in the buildings sector and from energy and industrial complexes outside the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). In the transport sector, the system also includes all fossil fuel emissions, but not air transport, which is subject to the EU ETS. The companies that place the fuels on the market are obliged to participate in the emissions trading system. Companies are required to purchase and surrender allowances for the fuel emissions attributed to them through the placing of the fuels on the market. As a result, future fuel prices will also include an incentive to reduce CO2 emissions.  In an introductory phase, allowances will be issued at a fixed price that increases from year to year. This creates a reliable price trajectory that enables the general public and industry to adjust to the progression. Because of the varying points of contact between fuel emissions trading and EU emissions trading, double counting of emissions from plants under the EU emissions trading scheme and fuel emissions cannot be entirely ruled out. As far as possible, double burdens resulting thereby are to be prevented well in advance. In the event of unavoidable double entries, financial compensation is provided to avoid a dual burden on plant operators.  The Act provides for the setting of annual emission levels (caps), which decrease from year to year and which contribute to meeting the sector targets under the Federal Climate Protection Act and to the reduction obligation under the EU Climate Protection Regulation. The annual budgets under the EU Climate Protection Regulation are the decisive factor in determining the emission levels. When setting the total amount of emissions, double counting of fuel emissions that are also covered by the EU ETS will be avoided by means 63  of a system of forecasting of the pro rata emissions to be deducted, as well as retroactive correction in the following years. If more allocations are issued in a given year than are equivalent to the annual emission level set and the annual budget under the EU Climate Protection Regulation is not met as a result, the additional need for allocations will be covered by government use of options to increase flexibility under the EU Climate Protection Regulation, including the purchase of a corresponding amount of emission allocations from other Member States. This restriction on the balancing options ensures that any excess quantities will only ever be offset within the limited total emissions level under the EU Climate Protection Regulation. The overall structure of the national emissions trading system has thus been geared towards an emission budget that is limited in total from the outset. The use of flexibility options is not unusual in other emissions trading systems; in the EU ETS, for example, this takes place via the possibility of using emission credits from international climate protection projects. The emission allocations are transferable and can be traded. After the introductory phase from 2021-2025, the emission allocations will generally be issued by way of an auction process. The relevant authority will periodically offer the available auction volume in equal subsets. The price of the emission allowances essentially follows the market. During the introductory phase, however, a fixed-price system will be introduced in which the emission allocations are sold to those responsible for the emissions. This creates a reliable price trajectory that enables the general public and industry to adjust to the progression. In the first year, the price is to be EUR 25 and will then increase to EUR 55 by 2025 (2021: EUR 25/t CO2, 2022: EUR 30/t CO2, 2023: EUR 35/t CO2, 2024: EUR 45/t CO2, 2025: EUR 55/t CO2). These prices reflect the laration on record to the Bundesrat in December 2019. The declaration on record was implemented in the first law amending the Fuel Emissions Trading Act, passed by the Federal Government in May 2020. During this phase, emission allocations cannot be transferred across one year into emissions allocations and trading. A price corridor with a minimum price of EUR 55 per emission allocation and a maximum price of EUR 65 per emission allocation is to be set for 2026. The price corridor was also set down in the declaration on record and is now being implemented by the first law amending the Fuel Emissions Trading Act. The certificate price generally follows the market, unless the maximum price is exceeded, or the minimum price undercut.  The introduction of carbon pricing in the heating and transport sectors is accompanied by other measures to reduce the burden on citizens and industry. These measures are set out in Section 3.4.3.iv.  Agriculture  3.1.1.i.3. Reduction of nitrogen surpluses including reduction of ammonia emissions and targeted reduction of nitrous oxide emissions as well as improvement in nitrogen efficiency The Federal Government has already achieved a great deal through the legal changes that have been made and are proposed in fertiliser legislation. This will achieve a further reduction in nitrogen surpluses, including in emissions of ammonia and nitrous oxide. The fertiliser package will also be supported by the promotion of gas-tight, low-emission slurry storage and emission-reducing spreading techniques. The Federal States also have a responsibility here.  Reduction of nitrogen surpluses in agriculture:  Implementation and consistent enforcement of the Fertiliser Ordinance by the Federal States  Evaluation of material flow results by the end of 2021, based on an evaluation plan developed jointly by the Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety and the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture  As from 2021, further refinement of the material flow results with mandatory introduction to other enterprises (amendments to the Fertiliser Act).

Support for the fermentation of farmyard fertilisers derived from animals and agricultural residues The measure concerns the use of farm manure of animal origin and agricultural waste materials for energy in biogas plants. The increased use of farm manure in biogas plants and the gas-tight storage of digestate will be promoted using current and new instruments.  Promotion of the fermentation of farm manure in biogas plants:  New support scheme for new systems  Examination and removal of barriers to the fermentation of farm manure  Creation of options for follow-up use through the development of new funding and implementation models  Funding for the fermentation of farm manure, focusing on livestock farming on farms at a ratio of up to two livestock units per hectare (owned and leased land).

Development of organic farming Increasing the area devoted to organic farming is also a climate measure. The Federal Government will further develop the legislation with the aim of promoting particularly environmentally friendly methods such as organic farming or other sustainable methods of agricultural management, and optimise legal and financial support:  Expansion of support for organic farming  Provision of the necessary subsidies for conversion in the state budgets and at national level  along the entire value creation chain (indirect funding)  Consolidation and further development of research promotion for organic farming, e.g. in the form of the BÖLN programme (Federal Programme for Organic Farming and Other Forms of Sustainable Agriculture).  3.1.1.i.6. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in livestock farming The Federal Government will realise further savings potential in livestock farming and animal feeding. In addition to research and breeding, the future growth of animal populations will also be addressed. Subsidy an animal welfare label), taking into account the environmental impact and the savings in emissions.  Overall, animal improvement and land management will become more closely integrated. The Federal Government is progressively focusing its funding efforts on ensuring that livestock is kept on farms at a ratio of a maximum of two livestock units (LU) per hectare  Focus of funding measures on animal welfare, taking into account the environmental impact and the savings in emissions  Examination of the extension of the animal welfare label to all production sectors and the EU-wide introduction of a standardised animal welfare label  Introduction of a target quota for conversion rates per production sector along the same lines as organic farming (at least animal welfare level 2) 65   A higher level of funding where animal welfare is coupled with climate protection (e.g. red nitrate areas, moorland, ammonia-contaminated areas) in conjunction with improved husbandry standards (more land per animal and minimum share of pasture for ruminants)  Support measures for the collection and assessment of feedstuffs from operational production, feedstuff consumption, and the determination of requirements taking into account the environmental impact and prevention of emissions  Comprehensive labelling of the farming techniques used for all animal foodstuffs  Elaboration of an overall strategy by 2021 to reduce emissions from livestock farming  Development of a model for livestock farming, taking into account the 2050 climate targets of the Paris Agreement  Development of mandatory targets  qualitative animal welfare and quantitative environmental objectives  as well as a plan for their implementation (mix of instruments)  Integration of the national livestock husbandry strategy into the overall strategy to reduce emissions from livestock farming  Revision of the requirements under construction and planning legislation for the approval of new or upgraded livestock farming facilities and biogas plants, combined in a mandatory fashion with high standards of animal welfare  Gas-tight storage of unfermented farm manure  Feasibility study of gas-tight storage of farm manure in conjunction with the installation of gas flaring using demonstration projects / pilot plants, and launch of implementation if assessment is positive  Introduction of regulatory requirements for the gas-tight storage of farm manure in large-scale animal husbandry systems.  To support the measures set out above, the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture envisages promoting sustainable food consumption on the demand side.  Development of a master plan for sustainable and healthy nutrition, taking into account the climate targets of the Paris Agreement for 2050 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, including research on dietary recommendations  Consolidation and expansion of education and guidance on sustainable, climate-friendly and healthy nutrition (e.g. public canteens)  Reinforcement of the sustainability criteria (minimum standards) for the dining options in the federal   Optional labelling of t  Quality campaign for marketing animal welfare products through information and advice  Research on and development of pricing instruments to control consumption (e.g. to establish alternative sources of protein).  3.1.1.i.7. Energy efficiency in agriculture The methods used in agriculture and horticulture can be further improved in terms of their energy requirements. The federal programme for increasing energy efficiency in agriculture and horticulture will be continued and further developed for that purpose, and the use of renewable energies promoted.  Reduction of GHG emissions from stationary use by increasing energy efficiency and the share of renewable energies in the provision of heating / cooling  increasing energy efficiency, including switching to renewable energies (e.g. utilisation of waste heat and geothermal energy), in agriculture and horticulture  Regular evaluation of the entire federal programme  Improvement of the information basis for reporting on energy consumption from stationary use (direct recording of energy consumption)  Increase in the efficiency of biogas plants by reducing uncontrolled methane losses through regular leakage checks and the introduction of a documentation requirement with regard to the frequency of pressure relief devices being activated  Advice for farms on the use of alternative funding programmes (KfW) in relation to buildings  Reduction of GHG emissions from mobile use  Establishment of funding with two linkable programmes for small mobile systems: o Energy efficiency in the mobile sector o Establishment of a funding programme for private electricity supply from renewable energies on farms (particularly the substitution of site-dependent agricultural diesel use by renewable electricity); the eligibility conditions should comply with the EEG (Renewable Energy Sources Act); cultivated biomass will not be funded beyond the existing level   Training and advice on the energy-efficient operation of heavy agricultural machines and supportive 66  funding for the use of suitable technology   Integrated energy and climate advice for agricultural enterprises, covering all energy consumption including the optimised operation of biogas plants and thus specifically addressing the areas of greatest potential.  Land use, land-use change and forestry  3.1.1.i.8. Preservation and accumulation of humus on arable land We must intensify activation of the carbon storage potential of the soil. Measures for carbon enrichment are to be taken into account, among other things, in the cultivation strategy that is currently being developed. The expansion of organic farming also contributes to carburisation. The planting of hedges, hedgerows and avenues of trees, for example, also helps with humus formation. Forested strips on agricultural land improve soil quality and reduce the CO2 and contaminant load. The Federal Government therefore supports the planting of hedges, hedgerows and avenues of trees, for example with fruit trees, especially on field boundaries. Decisions on possible legal requirements in the context of good professional practice will be made in the mid-2020s, after evaluation of the Thünen Instimeasures are intended to promote humus formation and preservation:   Promotion of crop rotation guidelines designed to increase humus levels and encourage humus-retaining management practices in enterprises that have already practised sustainable humus formation and have achieved a high humus level on their land, and at least maintain that level   Expansion of funding for the planting of belts of woodland, field copses, hedges, hedgerows and avenues of trees, e.g. with fruit trees, especially on field boundaries, and support for agroforestry systems   Voluntary certification as part of operational audits of management measures aimed at increasing humus levels, and corresponding support: farmers who commit to the sustained use of management practices that maintain humus levels, on compliance with certain conditions, receive an annual base payment for the implementation of the measure that includes an incentive component   Development of consulting tools for farming practice for the precise determination of soil carbon content.  3.1.1.i.9. Conservation of permanent grassland High levels of carbon are stored in grazing land. The conservation of permanent grassland is thus also an important climate protection measure. The Federal Government aims to develop a grassland strategy to safeguard and step up permanent grassland utilisation.  3.1.1.i.10. Protection of bog soil including reduction in use of peat in growing media Drained peat soils are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. The protection of moorlands is therefore a climate-relevant measure and will be given greater support.  For moorland protection:  Adjustments to the current legal and funding framework with the aim of ensuring the most effective protection for moorland and peat bog areas   Advocacy for the GAEC standards envisaged in the current CAP proposal for adequate protection of wetlands and peatland, including an ambitious structure   Creation of new funding instruments, including the necessary financing for programmes to permanently re-wet peat soils   Intensification of research and development measures.  Federal programme for peat reduction to reduce peat use:  Creation of a subsidy for a default insurance, limited to 10 years, to alleviate the conversion risk   Establishment of funding instruments for the cultivation of peat substitutes in addition to the measures    Support for experimentation work on plant suitability   Intensification of research into substitutes   Creation of advisory options for enterprises 67    Information for the general public about alternatives to peat potting soils   Education of special usage groups.  3.1.1.i.11. Conservation and sustainable management of forests and timber  Major carbon sinks, particularly forests and moors, are at risk of releasing their stored emissions. There is enormous climate protection potential in conserving and sustainably managing forests and timber usage. It is vital that forests and their sustainable management are conserved and safeguarded in the long term. This calls for appropriate measures for the reforestation of deforested areas, as well as measures for the more effective overall adaptation of forests to climate change in the context of a climate-robust forest restructuring approach. The Federal Government will therefore be funding the protection of these carbon sinks. The extreme weather of the past year has shown that the forest needs help to enable it to continue to fulfil its climate protection function. At the same time, the Federal Government will promote the sustainable and resource-efficient use of timber. This includes, for example, increased use of wood as a climate-friendly building material. The following measures are intended to help conserve and manage forests sustainably:   greater support for measures aimed at the development of climate-tolerant mixed forests (including contractual nature conservation measures with an impact on climate, such as measures aimed at improving the carbon reservoir in the forest or the structural diversity of the forest) through the joint scheme, Improvement of agricultural structures and coastal protection. Taking into consideration ecological and climate impact concerns, these efforts are aimed at o reforestation of deforested areas (180,000 hectares, as at September 2019) o stepping up the process of adapting forests to climate change   accompanying measures (e.g. optimised monitoring, optimised wildlife management, increased international cooperation in ensuring sustainable forest management world-wide and strengthening wood competence centres to avoid displacement effects, and intensification of silviculture research)   increased funding for research and development projects, specialist and consumer information, competitions of ideas, model / demonstration projects aiming at o climate-friendly and innovative timber usage, especially in the area of building with wood, and in relation to the re-use of hardwood timber, the circular economy and cascading use o promoting climate-conscious consumer behaviour.  Further measures for the removal of greenhouse gases  3.1.1.i.12. Funding programme for the expansion of landfill aeration and the optimisation of gas collection emissions under this heading, are landfill aeration, which converts the methane normally generated into biogenic carbon-based carbon dioxide (thus making it greenhouse gas-neutral), and the optimisation of gas collection.  3.1.1.i.13.  campaign  Members of the general public are concerned about how they can personally contribute to climate protection. The Federal Government will support this widely felt willingness to take action by providing an information portal which advises on the possibilities for action for citizens and companies. In addition, a comprehensive information campaign will be launched across all relevant media with target group-specific information to   3.1.1.ii. Where relevant, regional cooperation in this area  3.1.1.ii.1. Minimum price in EU emissions trading The Federal Government will work in close cooperation with the EU Commission to introduce Europe-wide certificate trading for all sectors. In a first step, the existing European emission trading (for energy and industry) is to be augmented by a moderate European minimum price. The minimum price ensures that the certificate price will no longer fall arbitrarily, even when demand is low. This will create planning security for climate investments in the ETS sectors.  3.1.1.ii.2. European Climate Initiative In 2017, the Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety launched the European Climate Initiative with a view to stepping up cross-border cooperation and the transfer of experiences in the field of greenhouse gas reduction in the non-governmental arena. Funding is available for projects which promote the exchange of best practices between sub-state players, civil society, industry and 68  science. The Federal Government, however, also engages in various other regular exchanges of information with other EU Member States. Bilateral arrangements have long been established with a great many Member States for this purpose.  3.1.1.ii.3. Meseberg Climate Working Group In the Meseberg Declaration of 19 June 2018, Germany and France agreed to set up a cross-departmental high-level working group on climate-related issues (Climate Working Group). The Climate Working Group supports implementation of the Paris Agreement. Measures to achieve this goal include the development of joint approaches to the energy transition, sustainable financing instruments, and financial incentives, including issues relating to carbon pricing. The constituent meeting of the Climate Working Group took place on 6 September 2018 in Paris. The Climate Working Group reports on its work to the German / French Ministerial Council. It meets at least once a year and is chaired by the secretaries of state responsible for climate change.  3.1.1.iii. Without prejudice to the applicability of State aid rules, financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds, in this area at national level, where applicable  3.1.1.iii.1. National Climate Initiative Under the National Climate Initiative, the Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety has funded many climate protection projects since 2008, making an important contribution to achieving the national climate protection objectives. Its programmes and projects cover a broad range of climate protection activities: the National Climate Initiative is aimed at embedding climate protection at grassroots level through the development of long-term strategies, support for professional climate management and investment funding. Its main target groups include municipalities, industry, consumers, schools and educational institutions. A total of around EUR 220 million was spent in 2018.  3.1.1.iii.2. Development and implementation of a Sustainable Finance Strategy The development of a sustainable finance strategy aims to further develop Germany into a leading sustainable finance location, to facilitate the discussion and implementation processes at national, European and global level and to contribute to a structured, focused stakeholder dialogue. On 25 February 2019, the State set up a sustainable finance advisory committee with members from the financial sector, the real economy, civil society and science, with the aim of advising the Federal Government on the development of a sustainable finance strategy, monitoring the European process, improving the knowledge base, pooling existing strengths and providing new impetus (the constituent meeting was on 6 June 2019), 2. to continue the established exchange of experiences within the Federal Government, in order to integrate issues of sustainability into federal investments, 3. to examine whether the issuing of green or sustainable federal bonds in Germany within the intended respective follow-on investments is economically advantageous (the Federal 4. to develop a communication strategy to make sustainable finance more widely known among consumers and the financial industry.  3.1.1.iii.3. Further development of the KfW into the transformative promotional bank for supporting the transformation of sectors of the economy and the financial market for a GHG-neutral future  The KfW is being further developed as a sustainable promotional bank to support the transformation of economic sectors and the financial market for a greenhouse gas-neutral future. Proposals for specific implementation are being put forward in accordance with the sustainable finance strategy, within the limits of Federal Government will press ahead with corresponding transformation processes in multilateral development banks through its influence on the relevant bodies within those banks. The discussion on the EU taxonomy and its results are to be taken into account.  3.1.1.iii.4.  In future, the government will be issuing green federal securities in the context of the sustainable finance strategy currently under development, thereby supporting the development of sustainable financial markets.  and following up of the issuing of green federal securities is an interministerial measure. Tasks include, among other things, the selection and evaluation of suitable green investments and the subsequent reporting on the results achieved, which must be effected within the relevant competent department (e.g. for energy, transport, research, etc.). The issue of green federal securities is intended to position Germany internationally as a sustainable finance location.    69  3.1.2. Renewable energies 3.1.2.i. Policies and measures to achieve the national contribution to the binding 2030 Union target for renewable energy and trajectories as referred to in Article 4(a)(2), and, where applicable or available, the elements referred to in Section 2.1.2 of this annex, including sector- and technology-specific measures  Electricity  3.1.2.i.1. Renewable Energy Sources Act Since 2000, the Renewable Energy Sources Act has been the primary instrument for controlling the expansion of renewable energies in Germany. As its statutory objective, the Renewable Energy Sources Act currently aims to increase the share of renewables in the power supply to at least 80% by 2050. It therefore represents the main foundation for achieving the relevant goals in the electricity sector. The Federal Government introduced the concept of mandatory direct marketing back in 2014 in the amended version of the Renewable Energy Sources Act. Plant operators must sell their own electricity on the market; in return, they receive a work operators.1 This market premium compensates for the difference between the fixed feed-in payment and the monthly average trading price for electricity.2 The level of funding therefore drops as soon as electricity prices rise. Use of the monthly average as a reference value also incentivises plant operators to respond to electricity prices.  During the first few years after the Renewable Energy Sources Act came into force, the main priority was to increase the volume of renewables in the electricity mix. Since 2014, however, it has been possible to achieve an increasingly dynamic reduction of funding costs. In the case of free-standing photovoltaic panels, the costs dropped from 9 cents/kWh in 2015 to 4 to 5 cents/kWh in 2018 (having been approx. 40 cents/kWh in 2005, i.e. many times higher).  The switch to the sliding premium also heralded a move to the market integration of renewable energies. Under the 2017 version of the Renewable Energy Sources Act, competitive calls for tender are now the main basis for determining the level of funding. The respective amounts of onshore and offshore wind power, photovoltaic energy and biomass which the Federal Government wishes to fund will be tendered out. Small facilities are exempt from these rules. This will ensure that the growth of renewables in Germany continues on the basis of competitive prices.  The Renewable Energy Sources Act 2017 outlines targets for renewables growth, tendering quantities and deadlines, and terms and conditions for tendering procedures for the relevant technologies and segments. The terms and conditions for tendering procedures for offshore wind power are regulated by the Offshore Wind Energy Act (see below). The Federal Network Agency publishes calls for tenders for all of the above technologies at varying intervals. It is expected that many projects will only come online towards the end of the implementation deadline. Comprehensive monitoring forms an integral part of the process.  The tendering quantities stipulated in the Renewable Energy Sources Act 2017 for each technology between now and 2030 are as follows:   Onshore wind: 2 800 MW a year for 3 years from 2017, 2 900 MW a year from 2020; the Omnibus Energy Act provides for special calls for tendering covering an additional 4 GW over the period 2019-2021.  Offshore wind: 3 100 MW in total between 2021 and 2025 (500 MW a year in 2021 and 2022, 700 MW between 2023 and 2025) and an average of 840 MW a year in 2026 to 2030.  Photovoltaic plants from 750 kW: 600 MW a year. The overall goal for photovoltaics is an expansion corridor of 2 500 MW a year; the Omnibus Energy Act provides for special calls for tender covering an additional 4 GW over the period 2019-2021.  Biomass plants: 150 MW a year between 2017 and 2019, 200 MW a year from 2020 to 2022.  The Renewable Energy Sources Act will be amended in 2020. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy will submit a draft for this. In addition to adjustments to the funding system, increased flexibility of the electricity market (see Section 3.4.3.) is a vital tool for the market integration of renewable energies.  3.1.2.i.2. Expansion of the use of renewable sources of energy to account for a 65% share of gross electricity consumption by 2030  The purposeful, efficient and increasingly market-oriented expansion of renewable energies, synchronised                                                            1 Derogations are in force for small facilities generating less than 100 kW. 2 The premium is optional for old facilities and small new facilities. The latter can continue to request a fixed payment instead.  70  across grids, is, along with the replacement of coal-fired by gas-fired power plants and the reduction of coal-fired power generation, a key element in achieving the climate objectives in the energy sector. The Federal Government has set a goal of achieving a 65% share of renewable energies in electrical energy consumption in 2030. In 2018, the share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption was approx. 38%. The expansion of renewable energies in power generation will be substantially supported and regulated by the Renewable Energy Sources Act. The following goals are currently laid down in the Renewable Energy Sources Act:   40 to 45% by 2025  55 to 60% by 2035 and  at least 80% by 2050.  The share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption is heavily dependent on the development of electricity consumption (inter alia efficiency and sectoral coupling), as are the expansion trajectories. As outlined in the Climate Protection Programme, further measures are planned in relation to the expansion of renewable energies to a 65% share in gross electricity consumption by 2030. These measures will be put into concrete form in legislative proposals.  3.1.2.i.3. Offshore Wind Energy Act The terms and conditions for tendering procedures for offshore wind power have been regulated in the Offshore Wind Energy Act since 2017. Regions and sites for offshore wind energy are designated and preliminary inspections carried out by the government. In addition, the timings for the bringing into service of offshore wind farms and offshore grid connection cables are coordinated. Like the Renewable Energy Sources Act, the Offshore Wind Energy Act will also be amended in 2020. Any changes will be communicated at the earliest opportunity, possibly in the NECP progress report.  3.1.2.i.4. Closer synchronisation between the expansion of renewable energy sources and grid expansion The focus of the current phase of the Renewable Energy Sources Act is the network and system integration ise and optimise existing grids. Consideration will also be given to optimisation and further development of grid management, including re-dispatching measures. This is essentially a Europe-wide challenge: if electricity is to be generated in the most cost-effective locations, adequate capacities must be available to transport this is particularly visible here. In order to align renewables growth in the electricity sector more closely with grid expansion, the former is controlled directly (alongside grid-related measures). The Renewable Energy Sources Act will be amended in 2020. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy will submit a draft for this.  3.1.2.i.5. Review of regional control of renewable energies in the power sector  growth, on grid development plans and on public acceptance of renewables growth, and is therefore highly relevant in political terms. It therefore also results in closer synchronisation between renewables growth and grid expansion. A great deal of flexibility is available when it comes to regional control of renewables growth: whereas with large power plants, the flexibility lies in the generation itself, the generation capacity of renewable energies can be controlled geographically in the short and medium term if the need for grid relief is identified and the necessary political framework is in place. The level of renewables growth in South Germany has been around 25% in recent years. In a first bidding round held in 2017, only around 10% of the contracts awarded went to wind projects in South Germany. Tighter regional control could ensure that at least 25% of the quantity tendered out (around 750 MW) went to South Germany (i.e. a proportion which reflects real renewables growth in the region). Regional control resulting in lower installed wind capacity in Northern Germany could also minimise curtailments, since less electricity would need to be transported to Southern Germany. Against this backdrop, the ruling parties agreed in the 2018 coalition agreement that steps should be taken to control renewables growth by setting a minimum percentage (across all energy generation types) for tendering procedures south of the grid bottleneck.  3.1.2.i.6. Pilot project relating to technology-neutral and innovation-focused procurement As part of the State aid approval procedure under the Renewable Energy Sources Act 2017, the Federal Government approved the publication of cross-technology calls for tender within the framework of an experimental pilot project set to run between 2018 and 2020. Joint calls for tender which cover both photovoltaic systems and onshore wind farms mean that the different technologies are forced to compete against each other. The Regulation on Joint Tendering Procedures for Onshore Wind and Solar Energy has been in force since August 2017. Under this Regulation, 400 MW a year are being tendered out on a technology-neutral basis for onshore wind and photovoltaics respectively between 2018 and 2020. The results are being evaluated openly, also in comparison with the technologyspecific auctions. New pricing 71  mechanisms and tendering procedures intended to promote competition and deliver grid and system benefits will be tested out in innovation-focused procurement procedures. The power to enact statutory instruments relating to innovation-focused procurement which is enshrined in the Renewable Energy Sources Act 2017 has been amended to this end; a corresponding regulation has now been adopted. A total of 650 MW will be tendered out in 2020 within the framework of these procedures, followed by 500 MW in 2021. These figures will be deducted from the standard tendering quantities for onshore wind and solar energy. The Renewable Energy Sources Act will be amended in 2020. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy will submit a draft for this.  3.1.2.i.7. Special tendering procedures for onshore wind and solar energy In the coalition agreement for the 19th parliamentary term, the Federal Government agreed to introduce special tendering procedures in the field of renewables with a view to achieving the 2020 climate goals and reducing carbon emissions. The special tendering procedures were introduced through an amendment to the Renewable Energy Sources Act 2017 within the framework of the Omnibus Energy Act of 17 December 2018. In the years 2019-2021, 4 GW of onshore wind and photovoltaic energy are being additionally put out to tender each year. These special calls for tender are intended to accelerate progress towards the national climate goals and the binding goals under the Renewable Energy Directive for renewables growth. In order to increase competition, the tendered quantities for onshore wind and solar will increase from 1 GW per technology in 2019 and 1.4 GW per technology in 2020 to 1.6 GW per technology in 2021.  3.1.2.i.8. Further development and extensive modernisation of cogeneration Cogeneration will be promoted for electricity and heating in a way that is compatible with the expansion of renewable energies. Modern cogeneration systems, increasingly incorporating heat from renewable energies and use of waste heat potential, will replace fossil fuel cogeneration plants, secure the electricity and heating supply and support the integration of renewable energies through a flexible mode of operation that is appropriate for the system. The promotion of cogeneration in public service provision will also be developed further and extended up to 2030.  Heating and cooling  Measures in the buildings sector to implement the Energy Efficiency Strategy for Buildings are set out in the long-term renovation strategy (see heating- and cooling-related measures in the buildings sector in Section 3.2. on energy efficiency). At the same time, many of these measures also encourage progress buildings and the Renewable Energies Heat Act.  Transport  Strategies and measures relating to low-emission mobility are described in Section 3.1.3.iii.  3.1.2.ii. Where relevant, specific measures for regional cooperation, as well as, as an option, the estimated excess production of energy from renewable sources which could be transferred to other Member States in order to achieve the national contribution and trajectories referred to in Section 2.1.2   Increased regional cooperation with other Member States is another driver of market integration for renewables. The Federal Government intends to focus on this area in the years to come.  3.1.2.ii.1. Opening up of calls for tender in the electricity sector In accordance with the State aid approval procedure under the Renewable Energy Sources Act, since 2017 the Federal Government has been obliged to open up procurement in the field of renewable electricity to providers located in other EU Member States (up to a total of 5% of the capacity to be installed). The aim is to achieve greater regional cooperation, ultimately leading to a shared understanding of market integration as well as funding of renewable energies and closer convergence of national funding systems. Crucial factors in cross-border procurement include the principle of reciprocity, a cooperation agreement with the partner country and physical imports of the funded electricity into the partner country. Cross-border procurement can be implemented either through calls for tenders which are open to bidders from two or more countries, or through joint calls for tenders with one or more partner countries. The Cross-Border Renewable Energies Regulation provides the legal basis for cross-border procurement in the field of onshore wind and photovoltaics. Experience has already been accumulated in the field: to cite but one example, a pilot cooperation project implemented with the Kingdom of Denmark in 2016 involved calls for tenders which were open to bidders from both countries. The only contracts awarded in this open tendering procedure were to free-standing photovoltaic systems in Denmark. The Federal Government is also proactively seeking further cooperation partners, with the current focus being on Luxembourg and France.  72  order to increase the transparency of cross-border procurement procedures for stakeholders in other Member States. The concept is designed to encourage governments and companies in other Member States to participate in cross-border procurement procedures organised by the Federal Government, and to clarify the terms and conditions of tendering which would apply if the parties agreed to cooperate.  3.1.2.ii.2. Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP)  Working Group on Renewable Energy The BEMIP Working Group on Renewable Energy serves as a platform for the exchange of experiences between the Member States involved in relation to renewables growth, particularly as regards planning and states in respect of renewables growth, especially offshore wind, and identifying potential cooperation exchanging information on the relevant parts of their National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) within this framework. Synergy effects with North Sea energy cooperation projects (see below) will be leveraged in the process. Potential cooperation projects in the Baltic Sea area include the shared use of electricity infrastructure for the construction of additional offshore wind capacity.  3.1.2.ii.3. Cooperation with other North Sea coastal states in the area of renewable energy This cooperation focuses on increasing offshore wind capacity, expanding grid infrastructure and maritime spatial planning in the North Sea. The relevant EU North Sea coastal states (including the Federal Republic of Germany) have also started to exchange information on the relevant sections of their NECPs within the framework of the initiative. The focus of North Sea cooperation is on the coordination of goals and expansion strategies, including individual procurement timelines for offshore wind, and the exchange of experience in relation to the growth of offshore wind capacity (funding systems, spatial and grid planning, etc.). Aggregate planning for the expansion of offshore wind in the North Sea will be carried out within the framework of NECP cooperation, along with a project pipeline which is as well-coordinated and smooth as possible. North Sea Energy Cooperation is also being used as a basis by the relevant Member States (including the Federal Republic of Germany) for concept-stage work on potential joint projects for offshore wind energy use and simultaneously as an interconnector and to discharge the electricity generated. The Federal Government plays an active role in North Sea cooperation (inter alia through its leadership of Working Group 3 on the Funding and Financing of Offshore Wind Power). The Federal Government also regards North Sea Energy Cooperation as a major opportunity for further integration of the internal energy market, and will continue to advocate for more frequent exchanges of best practices, improved coordination of energy use and grid expansion in the North Sea and the preparation and development of specific joint projects. Germany has been actively involved in the joint section relating to the North Sea cooperation. The Federal Government supports the continuation of the initiative beyond 2019, and in January 2020 will assume the presidency of the North Sea cooperation group.  3.1.2.ii.4. TARES project in Greece A strategic partnership has existed between the Federal Government of Germany and Greece since 2013 in the area of renewable energieStructural Reform Support Service (SRSS), the Federal Government funds technical support in Greece in connection with reform of the renewable energy and efficiency sector (TARES-, TARES+ and TARES4 project). This support is implemented on the ground in Berlin and Athens in the form of advice provided by the German Corporation for International Cooperation (GIZ). The advice focuses on the promotion of reform measures aimed at the achieveme-term strategy for energy and climate policy by 2050, particularly with regard to the further growth in renewables national electricity market in order to achieve a rising share of renewable energies. The project also supports exchanges of experience between the Federal Republic of Germany and Greece in relation to the drafting of National Climate and Energy Plans (NECPs) for 2030. The development and implementation of specific pilot projects relating to renewable energies, for example in public buildings or on a Greek island, also falls under the heading of technical support. The aim is to illustrate by means of concrete examples the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of implementing renewable-heavy projects in Greece.  3.1.2.ii.5. Concerted Action on the Renewable Energy Sources Directive The Concerted Action on the Renewable Energy Sources Directive (CA-RES) forum was founded in 2010 and pursues the goal of allowing experts from the Member States to engage in informal exchanges of experience on implementation of the Renewable Energy Directive. Germany has played an active role in the forum since its inception by taking on the leadership of thematic subgroups. As part of the current CA-RES  subgroup; this means that it is responsible for preparing for and following up on related topics discussed at the twice-yearly plenary meetings, and for organising and supporting task forces between plenary meetings. In this role, Germany attaches great importance to improving the coordination of the national energy policies in the field of renewable energies. For example, during the plenary meeting held in Warsaw in April 2018, a 73  uding Germany) presented the first key points of the renewables section of their NECPs at this meeting.

System of surcharges under the Renewable Energy Sources Act Minimisation of the risks faced by renewable plant operators on the basis of the Renewable Energy Sources Act also ensures very good access to the capital market in Germany. As a central funding instrument for renewable energies in the electricity sector (see Section 3.1.2.i.), the Renewable Energy Sources Act safeguards funding (guaranteed compensation, priority feed-in) and the financing of any extra costs incurred as a result of the surcharge under the Renewable Energy Sources Act. The Renewable Energy Sources Act is updated on an ongoing basis. This updating process is based on periodic evaluations of the law. On 30 June 2018 the Federal Government presented a progress report on the Renewable Energy Sources Act 2017 to the Bundestag, in which in particular the progress made in relation to individual technologies and their current level of market integration, experience in the field of procurement and cost trends were evaluated. Under §97 of the Renewable Energy Sources Act 2017, the evaluation will be repeated every 4 years. The Renewable Energy Sources Act will be amended in 2020. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy will submit a draft for this.  3.1.2.iii.2. Investments in energy storage technology In its coalition agreement for the 19th parliamentary term, the Federal Government confirmed its intention to invest in energy storage technologies and smart marketing concepts in order to continue safeguarding the reliability of supply in all parts of Germany and minimise system costs and costs under the Renewable Energy Sources Act.  3.1.2.iii.3. KfW Renewable Energies Programme The programme facilitates the long-term low-interest financing of measures aimed at the generation of electricity from renewables, measures aimed at the generation of electricity and heat in combined heat and power (CHP) plants and measures aimed at the integration of renewable energies into the energy system. Eligible investment costs are funded up to a level of 100% and a ceiling of EUR 50 million per project.  Heating and cooling  Measures in the buildings sector to implement the Energy Efficiency Strategy for Buildings are set out in the long-term renovation strategy (see heating- and cooling-related measures in the buildings sector in Section 3.2. on energy efficiency). At the same time, many of these measures also encourage progress  Programme for  for renewable local and district heating systems. This funding programme is described in more detail below in this Section 3.1.2. The programme will be amended to provide financial support in particular for the transformation of the hitherto mostly fossil fuel-supplied existing heat networks, which are able to undergo the process of transformation into modern low-temperature heat networks with high shares of renewable energies and waste heat only in progressive stages.

It provides basic information and answers questions on grid expansion.  Summary of the policies and measures under the enabling framework Member States have to put in place pursuant to Article 21(6) and Article 22(5) of the Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources to promote and facilitate the development of self-consumption and renewable energy communities.  3.1.2.v.5. Regulatory framework for the expansion of self-sufficiency with renewable electricity Consumption of self-supply. It is estimated that approximately 4 TWh a year is generated and consumed by renewable self-suppliers. The recast Renewable Energy Directive gave a boost to the consumption of self-generated renewable electricity throughout the EU. At the same time, however, it is important to ensure that the consumption of self-generated electricity contributes in an appropriate way to the financing of the energy transition. Against this backdrop, Germany has already created a regulatory framework for self-supply which, firstly, promotes and facilitates the expansion of renewable electricity self-supply, and also ensures that consumers of self-generated electricity participate appropriately in the costs of the overall system. The following measures have been taken so far:  In Germany, consumers of self-generated electricity benefit from exemptions and caps in relation to various taxes, levies and fees. For example, electricity which is generated in small facilities (under 10 kW) and consumed on site is entirely exempt from levies, grid fees and the electricity tax, provided that the electricity is not transported through a grid. As a basic principle, consumers of self-generated electricity with facilities which are rated over 10 kW or which produce more than 10 000 kWh a year are also entitled to exemptions. Consumers of self-generated renewable electricity and consumers of self-generated electricity from certain very efficient cogeneration plants are granted a partial exemption from the obligation to pay surcharges under the Renewable Energy Sources Act (60% exemption). Consumers of larger amounts of self-generated electricity in particular thus make a contribution to the financing of the Renewable Energy Sources Act.  tion underwent a legislative revision process on 1 regulatory framework for self-generation has proven in principle to be a reliable instrument. In implementation of Article 21 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, the Federal Government is assessing whether measures in the regulatory framework will be adjusted.  3.1.2.v.6. Regulatory framework for the development of renewable energy communities  Renewable energy communities have great potential for the successful expansion of renewable energies at national and European level. Germany has also created a regulatory framework for renewable energy communities that supports and drives forward the development of such communities. This regulatory framework so far covers the following key aspects: Access to renewable energy communities is open to end consumers in Germany in a non-discriminatory manner, as is the access of renewable energy communities to the existing support schemes.  area of onshore wind energy. If selected, these renewable energy communities receive funding not just on the basis of their own bid value but based on the bid value of the highest bid accepted on the same bid date (uniform pricing). The Federal Government is assessing whether changes to the existing regulatory framework are required for the implementation of Article 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. 75   3.1.2.vi. Assessment of the necessity to build new infrastructure for district heating and cooling produced from renewable sources  Measures in the buildings sector to implement the Energy Efficiency Strategy for Buildings are set out in the long-term renovation strategy (see heating- and cooling-related measures in the buildings sector in Section 3.2. on energy efficiency). At the same time, many of these measures also encourage progress sion, in particular the expansion of renewable heating -related investments (see Section 3.2.).  3.1.2.vi.1. Heating Network Systems 4.0 Increasing the share of energy from renewable sources and the waste heat and cold in the heating and cooling sector can only be accomplished with large-scale additional construction of low-temperature networks and the transformation of existing heat networks into networks with a high share of renewable energy and waste heat. However, these measures are very expensive. The Federal Government is therefore specifically supporting the further expansion of low-temperature networks, and in the near term also the transformation of existing heating networks, with the aim of progressively preparing and converting them for the supply of a high share of renewable energies and waste heat. Fourth-generation heating network-for flexibility within the electricity market. The funding arrangements for low-temperature networks represented the first ever use in Germany of system-based funding (i.e. funding whole systems rather than individual technologies and components) in the heating infrastructure sector. The systems developed within the framework of this project are remarkable for their very low temperature and very high share of renewable energies and waste heat; they often feature large seasonal heat reservoirs as a key component. Incentivisation of the market launch of fourth-generation heating networks for commercial-scale technical use represents a huge leap forward in terms of the heating transition, since Heating Network Systems 4.0 represent tangible progress towards the climate protection goals and greater integration of renewable energies into the heating sector, and can offer increased flexibility to the electricity sector on a cost-effective and energy-efficient basis.  It is proposed that the high share of energy from renewable sources and of waste heat and cold in district heating and cooling systems will be achieved, as a first step, through the amendment of the existing funding  construction of new district heating networks with a high share of renewable energy and waste heat, but in particular for the transformation of the large-scale, hitherto mostly fossil fuel-supplied existing heating networks, most of which will progressively undergo the process of transformation into modern low-temperature heat networks with high shares of renewable energies and waste heat. The programme also contributes to the implementation of the Energy Efficiency Strategy for Buildings (see Section 3.2.).  3.1.2.vi.2. Increasing conversion of heating networks to renewable energy sources and unavoidable waste heat Heating networks are becoming more efficient and are being converted to work with renewable energies and unavoidable waste heat. This has further positive effects in the buildings sector. With smart control, heating networks and heat storage systems, low-carbon and carbon-free heat sources such as renewable energies and unavoidable waste heat can be interlinked, allowing for a secure, largely fuel-free heat supply. This measure is closely linked to the efficiency measures on the demand side. In the most recent legislative term, Networks -generation heating networks that provide heating and cooling in a highly efficient and eco-friendly way. The main measures are: In the 19th legislative term, a funding programme is to be developed, taking into account the price trend of the fuels used, which additionally creates incentives for the transformation of existing heat networks.  The following are accompanying measures and/or support the transformation to a low-carbon heat supply (centrally via heating networks, and locally, close to the building):   Heating levy: pay-as-you-go, market-oriented funding   Carbon pricing   In addition, the legal framework for the expansion and optimisation of heating networks with a high share of renewables may be adjusted where necessary    76   3.1.2.vii. Where applicable, specific measures on the promotion of the use of energy from biomass, especially for new biomass mobilisation, taking into account:  biomass availability, including sustainable biomass: both domestic potential and imports from third countries  other biomass uses by other sectors (agriculture and forest-based sectors) as well as measures for the sustainability of biomass production and use  3.1.2.vii.1.  A new direction for the funding programme was introduced in 2015. It prioritises practical solutions in the form of demonstration or pilot projects which increase the flexibility of biomass-based systems for the generation of electricity and heat. In order to improve sustainable energy use in the (coupled) heat and electricity sector, the programme aims to tap into the potential of biomass residues and waste.  3.1.2.vii.2.  The aim of this programme is to promote research, development and demonstration projects relating to the use of renewable raw materials to generate energy. Alongside research and development projects, it focuses in particular on practical demonstration and pilot projects in the area of process optimisation.  3.1.3. Other elements of the dimension 3.1.3.i. Where applicable, national policies and measures affecting the EU ETS sector and assessment of the complementarity and impacts on the EU ETS  3.1.3.i.1.

Shutdown of power generation capacities In cases where electricity generation capacities are taken offline as a result of additional national measures, Article 12(4), second sentence, of the ETS Directive gives Member States the option to cancel allowances rather than auctioning them at national level. In its bill on amendments to the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Act, the Federal Government provides for transposition of this option into national law in line with the requirements set out in Article 12(4) of the ETS Directive and leaves any related decision to the discretion of the Federal Government. These decisions must take particular account of the fact that the reduction in surpluses will be partially addressed by the MSR when it starts operating in 2019. A decision by the Federal Government is required for any cancellation of allowances. A cancellation decision of this kind must comply with the relevant provisions of budgetary law.  3.1.3.ii. Policies and measures to achieve other national targets, where applicable  3.1.3.ii.1. Sectoral coupling Direct use of electricity from renewable energies makes it possible to tap into efficiency potentials and reduce the use of fossil fuels. Electricity-based technologies on the basis of renewable energies are also an important method for achieving energy and climate goals in cases where other GHG reduction options are difficult to implement through the direct use of electricity (e.g. in the air and maritime transport sectors or some industrial processes). Many different funding measures, projects and programmes exist in the field of sectoral coupling. Detailed descriptions of these measures can be found in the relevant sections, e.g. heating network systems in Section 3.1.2.v., low-emission mobility in Section 3.1.3.iii., the Market Incentive Programme for heating and the CO2 Building Modernisation Programme in Section 3.2.ii., market integration in Section 3.4.3.i., and real-life laboratories and SINTEG in Section 3.5.1.  3.1.3.iii. Policies and measures to achieve low-emission mobility (including electrification of transport)  The and climate-friendliness. Increased penetration of electric vehicles based on renewable electricity, and the use of zero-carbon and carbon-neutral fuels are the key pillars for low-emission mobility with a view to achieving the climate goals in the transport sector.  3.1.3.iii.1. Introduction of low-carbon passenger cars to the roads 77  The aim is to have 7 to 10 million electric vehicles registered in Germany by 2030. In addition to fleet adjustment, additional measures are required in order to significantly increase the percentage of vehicles with alternative drive systems in sales of new vehicles and to significantly reduce the carbon emissions of passenger car traffic. These measures are intended to significantly reduce the extra costs associated with electric cars compared to cars powered only by combustion engines, and to help make the filling and charging ctive. At the same time, they will stimulate the supply and demand for alternative drive systems. With the law on tax incentives to promote e-mobility, the company car regulation for the use of a battery-powered electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid vehicle has been extended until 2030, among other measures. In addition, up to a price of EUR 40 000 the private use of purely electric vehicles will not, as has hitherto been the case, be valued on half the assessment basis, but on a quarter of the assessment basis. The tax exemption under §3d of the law on motor vehicle tax will also be extended until 31 December 2025. The 10-year tax exemption period will be limited to 31 December 2030 at the latest. In a further step, for passenger cars with electric, hybrid and hydrogen / fuel cell drive systems the purchase premium paid by the Federal Government and manufacturers has been extended until 2025 at the latest, with retroactive effect from 5 November 2019 inclusive, and increased for cars under EUR 40 000. The Federal Government will be gearing motor vehicle taxes more strongly towards carbon emission levels and will also be putting forward a law on the reform of the motor vehicle tax for passenger cars, in the expectation that these taxation aspects will exert a much stronger steering effect towards low-emission and zero-emission systems for new car purchases. For new registrations from 1 January 2021, the assessment basis for the tax will depend primarily on the CO2 test value per km and will be increased in stages above 95 g CO2 / km.  3.1.3.iii.2.  Expansion of publicly accessible charging infrastructure is a prerequisite for public acceptance and an increased use of e-mobility options. The Feaccessible charging infrastructure, and to have a total of 1 million charging points available in Germany by 2030. To that end, the Federal Government is funding the installation of public charging stations with appropriate programmes up to 2025. In addition to the funding, other measures are required to expand the charging infrastructure. In its Cabinet sitting on 18 November 2019, the Federal Government therefore approved the masterplan for charging infrastructure. The Federal Government will work together with state and local governments, the automobile industry and the energy sector to move ahead with implementing the package of measures for public und non-public charging infrastructure for passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles. In addition to further monetary measures for the funding / financing of charging infrastructure, this also includes legislative measures to improve the legal framework (changes to tenancy and residential property laws, law on buildings and e-mobility infrastructure, amendments to the Charging Stations Regulation), strategic and coordinating actions for nationwide expansion as well as inputs from the commercial sector, especially as regards the provision of necessary information for the tailored development of charging infrastructure and as regards consumer-friendly charging. The consumer is at the heart of the implementation of all measures. E-mobility will only be successful if users accept and are happy with the charging infrastructure available. The sufficient availability of charging infrastructure is a decisive factor in the decision to buy, and as a result the Federal Government aims to provide for an initially disproportionate development of charging infrastructure to prepare the market for anticipated growth. In appropriate exceptional cases of regional market failure, as provided for under European law, distribution network operators will be permitted to construct publicly accessible charging infrastructure. The Federal Government will examine whether a supply obligation could be introduced requiring that charging points also be offered at all filling stations in Germany, and how binding any such regulation could be. Consideration will be given as soon as possible to the issue of whether the construction of rapid charging stations can be treated as a decarbonisation measure by the petroleum industry. Anyone who is unable to offer the 24/7 access condition for publicly accessible charging infrastructure can apply for funding with reduced funding rates via the fifth call for funding (application period 29.4.2020  17.6.2020) to the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital benefit from this. In addition, the vast majority of charging will take place at home or at work. For this reason, a funding programme for shared private and commercial charging infrastructure (e.g. in apartment blocks and in employee car parks) will be puand the provision of necessary charging infrastructure to the employee are tax privileged, i.e. they need not be taxed as a salary component. Changes to residential property laws and tenancy rights are intended to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure. Apartment owners and tenants are in principle to be granted an entitlement to the installation of charging facilities, which the remaining apartment owners and the landlord can refuse only in certain limited circumstances. Further regulatory obstacles to the expansion of charging infrastructure will also be removed (among other things, by provision of accelerated grid connection of charging infrastructure in the ordinance regulating grid connection, legal certainty when calculating shares in the costs, controllability / load management of charging infrastructure for grid-appropriate charging, and user-friendly charging and charging infrastructure in the public sphere). In 2019, the National Charging Infrastructure Control Centre (Nationale Leitstelle Ladeinfrastruktur) was set up to oversee the coordinated ramp-up of public charging infrastructure at the various levels (federal / state / local governments).  3.1.3.iii.3. Introduction of low-78   The Federal Government aims to support the purchase of heavy goods vehicles with alternative, climate-friendly propulsion systems including hydrogen technologies and to fund the development of a needs-based filling and charging infrastructure. The goal is that by 2030 approximately one third of vehicle mileage in the heavy road transport sector will be electric or based on zero-carbon or carbon-neutral fuels. A system of carbon-differentiated truck tolls favouring climate-friendly propulsion systems, and the necessary amendment of the Eurovignette Directive, will also be pursued. The Federal Government aims to introduce a carbon surcharge on the truck toll, effective from 2023, utilising the legal scope. The European regulatory framework for any such carbon surcharge and any differentiation is currently being worked out in the competent Council working groups on the amendment of the Eurovignette Directive. The present infrastructure charge for carbon-neutral alternative drive systems is to be reduced by 75%. The adoption of the revised Directive necessitates a subsequent transposition into German law. With the carbon fleet regulation for commercial vehicles, a powerful regulatory instrument has already been adopted at European level. It seeks to ensure that fleet- and Europe-wide carbon emissions will be reduced by 30% (for heavy commercial vehicles) and by 31% (for light commercial vehicles) by 2030. To achieve the GHG reduction targets of the transport sectors overall, however, there must be an even higher rate of reduction for commercial vehicles. The fleet regulation must therefore be supplemented by further measures. These accompanying measures set out to address, firstly, the extra costs associated with commercial vehicles with alternative propulsion systems: The development of market-ready commercial vehicles with hydrogen fuel cells will continue to be supported for all segments, so that vehicles with this technology can be offered by the mid-2020s at the latest. Commercial vehicles running on methane gas (CNG, LNG) also have a prominent role in climate-friendly freight transport, particularly if regeneratively produced biomethane and methane generated on the basis of electricity are used instead of fossil natural gas.  3.1.3.iii.4. Expansion of filling, charging and overhead contact wiring infrastructure (field of action:  The organisation of the filling, charging and overhead cable infrastructure for alternative drive systems must be geared to the intended transport and logistical applications. This involves having in view an approach that encompasses the entire system, from the use of renewable energies to customer-related aspects for zero-emission logistics. The Federal Government is developing concepts for: charging options for battery-powered commercial vehicles and overhead cables for commercial vehicles and for hydrogen refuelling stations.  3.1.3.iii.5. Increase in the proportion of electric vehicles (pursuant to §2 of the E-mobility Act) and of biogas- Agreed objectives: Increase the percentage of vehicles with alternative and environmentally friendly drive technologies in new purchases and replacements ideally to 40% by 2025 and to 100% by 2030. This includes battery-powered electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, externally chargeable hybrid electric vehicles that meet the minimum criteria under §3 of the E-mobility Act, and vehicles that are verifiably 100% run on biogas. In 2030, the proportion of plug-Special-purpose vehicles and heavy goods vehicles are exempted from this quota, but if technically feasible these too will be progressively replaced by electric vehicles within the meaning of §2 of the E-mobility Act or by other, at least equivalent, vehicles with alternative and environmentally friendly drive technologies, taking into consideration the relevant functional needs. Vehicles that serve the national and Alliance defence and corresponding international obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany are not taken into account due to their specification and their particular capability requirements.  3.1.3.iii.6. Automation, connection and fluidification of the transport sector, facilitation of innovative forms of mobility  Digitalisation can significantly improve existing transport operations such as traffic flow and parking facility management through automation, networking and artificial intelligence. Digitalisation can also create completely new possibilities: for instance, digital services with user-friendly, app-based operating concepts enable simplified sharing options both for passenger cars and for bicycles and e-scooters, and allow for the integration of public transport services. Digital interconnectivity also allows pooling of journeys and the selection of a vehicle size suitable for an individual trip. Amendment of the Passenger Transport Act will lay the foundations for new digital mobility services. The Federal Government will continue and intensify the practical testing of automation, networking and the use of artificial intelligence for sustainable mobility on digital test fields and demonstration projects. The expansion of fast broadband and mobile networks will continue to be supported. With an eye on emerging application scenarios for digital mobility, computing infrastructure is increasingly considered an integral part of digital networks for the gigabit society. Digital working models (for instance, increasing the use of home offices and video conferencing) also help cut down on journeys. Establishing experimental clauses and amending the Passenger Transport Act will lay the foundations for extensive networking, automation and the use of artificial intelligence for sustainable mobility.  3.1.3.iii.7. E-mobility tax incentives (Act on Further E-mobility Tax Incentives and the Amendment of Further Tax Provisions)  79  Company car taxation  extension of the special scheme for electric vehicles currently in force: If a company car is also used privately, this benefit is generally taxed at 1% of the domestic list price (the list price method). In 2018, this assessment basis was halved for electric and externally chargeable hybrid electric vehicles. To create a long-term, legally certain planning framework for the market ramp-up of e-mobility, this special scheme has been extended until 31 December 2030 (§6(1)(4) second sentence, (3) and (4), and third sentence (3) and (4) Income Tobjectives are given proper consideration in the longer term, the technical requirements of the special scheme were tightened up in two stages: from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2024, a minimum range (when using solely the electric drive unit) of 60 km will apply. from 01 January 2025 to 31 December 2030, a minimum range (when using solely the electric drive unit) of 80 km will apply. The maximum CO2 emissions of 50 g / km remain unchanged for the entire period. For the use of vehicles that have no carbon emissions / km and whose gross list price does not exceed EUR 40 000, only one quarter of the assessment basis is taken into account.  Special depreciation allowances for electric commercial vehicles and electric cargo bikes: Subject to approval for State aid being granted by the European Commission, under §7c of the Income Tax Act special depreciation allowances amounting to 50% of the acquisition costs can be claimed for the purchase of new, purely electric commercial vehicles (vehicles of vehicle class N) and for the purchase of new electric cargo bikes in the period from 2020 to the end of 2030, in the year of purchase, in addition to the normal linear depreciation for wear and tear. To claim a special depreciation allowance, the commercial fixed assets.  Trade tax relief for the rental and leasing of electric vehicles: assets are added to the profit from the business operation for trade tax purposes. The addition amounts to 5% of the expenses (1/4 of 1/5). In deviation from this, rental and leasing expenses for electric vehicles and externally chargeable hybrid electric vehicles that meet certain exhaust emission or operating range criteria, and for rented bicycles that are not motor vehicles, are only added at 2.5% (1/4 of 1/10), provided that they are based on contracts that were concluded after 31 December 2019 (§8(1)(d), second sentence, of the Trade Tax Act). This measure is scheduled to apply until 2030.  Extension of the tax exemption for charging current and the flat-rate taxation scheme for the transfer of ownership of charging equipment: Benefits granted by the employer in connection with the charging of an electric vehicle or hybrid electric  those of an affiliated undertaking, and for in-plant charging equipment temporarily provided for private use, are exempt from tax (§3(46) of the Income Tax Act). The tax exemption was scheduled to apply until 31 December 2020. The employer can also levy a flat-rate of 25% on the payroll tax for the above non-cash benefit (§40(2) first sentence, number 6, of the Income Tax Act). The flat-rate taxation scheme was also scheduled to apply until 31 December 2020. To further promote e-mobility, both measures have been extended until 31 December 2030.  Tax-exempt job ticket and introduction of flat-rate taxation for job tickets: using regular scheduled public transport services between home and main or primary place of work, granted in addition to normal pay already owed, are tax-free (e.g. job ticket). The services received tax-free are to be credited against the distance allowance; the deduction for professional expenses is reduced accordingly. The regulation applies for an unlimited period. The introduction of a new flat-rate 25% taxation option, with no concomitant reduction of the distance allowance deductible as professional expenses for the employee, is intended to increase the acceptance of job tickets among those employees who are not able to use public transport at all or who can do so only on a very limited basis (§40(2), sentences 2 to 4 of the Income Tax Act). It also applies for the emoluments referred to in §3(15) of the Income Tax Act that are not provided in addition to the normal pay already owed (but through deferred compensation) and that therefore do not meet the requirements for tax exemption. The regulation applies for an unlimited period.  Extension of the tax exemption for the provision of a company bicycle or electric bicycle to the employee: If the employer provides the employee with a company bicycle free of charge or at a reduced rate, from 2019 the non-cash benefit from private use is tax-free (§3(37) Income Tax Act). The prerequisite is that the bicycle is provided in addition to the normal pay already owed anyway. This is intended to acknowledge the fact that the employer is providing a real additional service and does not reduce the The tax-free non-cash benefit is not credited against the distance allowance; the deduction for professional expenses remains. The measure, which was limited until 31 December 2021, is to be extended until 31 December 2030.  Extension of the tax exemption for the private use of a company bicycle or electric bicycle: If the owner of an enterprise uses a company bicycle for private purposes, this is not taken into account in the 80  profit calculation (§6(1)(4), sixth sentence, of the Income Tax Act). The benefit does not have to be taxed. The measure, which was limited until 31 December 2021, has been extended until 31 December 2030.  3.1.3.iii.8. Automotive industry: industrial production for mobile and stationary energy-storage devices (battery cell production) The demand for mobile and stationary electricity storage is growing internationally at a rapid pace. The Federal Government aims to tap into the enormous value creation potential of this key technology in Germany and Europe, by pushing ahead with the development of industrial and research-based battery cell production. To this end, in the 2019 budget allocation process the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy was given up to EUR 1 billion until 2022 under Energy and Climate Fund account 893 04 for investments in in the automotive supply industry will be supported with appropriate instruments in the upcoming transformation of their industry.  3.1.3.iii.9. Specific measures for reducing urban traffic emissions On 28 November 2017, at the Second Municipal Summit, the Federal Government presented a package of  1 billion has been earmarked for this programme. It includes measures for urban transport electrification, the construction of charging infrastructure, the digitalisation of transport systems and the retrofitting of exhaust after-treatment systems in diesel buses used within local public transport networks. At the Third Municipal Summit on 3 December 2018, the Federal Government agreed to make available additional funds for the emergency programme. A total of up to EUR 1.5 billion is therefore available for affected municipalities. In addition, a further EUR 432 million in funding was approved for the funding guidelines for retrofitting light and heavy l measures will take effect by 2020.  3.1.3.iii.10. Procurement of electric vehicles  information campaign The Federal Government plans to implement an information campaign together with the federal states aimed at increasing the share of electrically powered vehicles in publicly owned fleets.  3.1.3.iii.11. National Strategic Framework for the Expansion of Alternative Fuel Infrastructures The Strategic Framework covers charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, natural gas supply infrastructure (compressed and liquefied natural gas) and hydrogen supply infrastructure for fuel cell vehicles. In implementation of Directive 2014/94/EU, the National Strategic Framework sets goals for publicly accessible filling and charging infrastructure and backs them up with corresponding measures.  3.1.3.iii.12. Further development of the National Innovation Programme for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology (NIP 2) Further development of the National Innovation Programme for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology (NIP 2) not only guarantees a solid technological basis, but also supports the market ramp-up phase. Particular attention is paid to fuel cells for electric powertrains, filling station infrastructure, hydrogen generation from renewable energies, integration into the energy system and fuel cells for stationary energy supply. The Federal Cabinet adopted a decision regarding a framework programme by the Federal Government in this area on 28 September 2016. The programme will run until 2026.  3.1.3.iii.13. Funding of alternative drive systems for local public transport The Federal Government is funding multiple projects concerning the technological development or procurement of electric, hybrid and biogas-powered buses under the corresponding funding guidelines published by the Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety and the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure.  3.1.3.iii.14. Further development of the Mobility and Fuels Strategy 2013 The Mobility and Fuels Strategy adopted by the Federal Cabinet in June 2013 plays an important part in the energy transition in the transport sector. In its present shape, it provides an overview of energy and fuel options and technologies for the different modes of transport. Alternative drive systems and the use of liquid and gaseous renewable fuels with a view to decarbonisation of transportation play a key role in this respect.  3.1.3.iii.15. Development of electricity-based fuels The fuel cell will also play a significant role in the mobility of the future, particularly for heavy goods vehicles and other heavy vehicles. In the longer term, Power-to-X (PtX) fuels will also play an increasingly important role. The Federal Government aims to establish a framework for the development and large-volume scaling-up of the electrolysis and refinery processes for the production of electricity-based climate-neutral gases and fuels. This enables the use of climate-friendly base materials and fuels, particularly in the industrial and chemicals sectors, and in air transport, heavy goods transport and sea transport. Furthermore, alternative drive systems on railway routes will be promoted to a greater extent, where this makes economic and 81  environmental sense and where electrification is not economically efficient. In the medium and long term, hydrogen-based fuel cell technology can also be widely used in the mobility sector. The Federal Government will develop a national hydrogen strategy. An industrial policy initiative by the European Union to develop an efficient e-fuel supply is also being launched. The extent to which these efforts can be appropriately supported when implementing RED II for the transport sector needs to be examined.  3.1.3.iii.16. Support of advanced biofuels The use of biofuels in the fuel mix reduces the fossil content, and thus also the level of the carbon pricing, of the fuel. The development of liquid and gaseous renewable fuels from biomass and their large-scale production in biogas and synthesis plants will be supported, to enable their use in some segments of the transport sector in the medium and long term. There will be no additional support for first generation biofuels based on food crops and fodder crops. The future production of bioenergy is to be based more comprehensively on waste material and residues. It is therefore important that all waste material and residues actually be collected. There are no plans to expand the cultivation areas for bioenergy and no expansions are being considered because of land surface area restrictions. The sustainability criteria of RED II must also be used for imports (from the internal market and from third countries). As a supporting measure, in the context of the national implementation of RED II a sub-quota for advanced biofuels will be introduced, taking into account environmental and economic considerations and technical feasibility. Advanced biofuels are already on the market and are already making a contribution to GHG reduction in the transport sector. Taking all aspects into consideration, the maximum biomass available for bioenergy in Germany is currently around 1 000 to 1 200 PJ / annum (domestic potential). Existing gaps in research and development on innovative advanced biofuels (for instance, fuels made from straw) will be filled through projects and demonstration projects, to enable large-scale production in the medium term.  3.1.3.iii.17. Funding of natural gas mobility The Federal Government has demonstrated its intention to bring about growth in natural gas mobility through the adoption of tax incentives for natural gas as a fuel until 2026 and a temporary exemption from road tolls. This can provide a significant opportunity for potential carbon savings, if biomethane gas and, in future, renewable, synthetic methane are used.  3.1.3.iii.18. Strengthening of rail passenger transport The focus of this bundle of measures is carbon reduction by shifting transport to the railways, which need to be strengthened significantly for this purpose. Decarbonisation can also be further promoted through the electrification of additional rail links and the use of alternative drive systems (hydrogen, battery).  Up to 2030, the Federal Government and Deutsche Bahn will be investing around EUR 86 billion to modernise the railway system. This will further enhance the efficiency of the railway infrastructure. Capacity will also be substantially increased through the introduction of digital command and control technology on central axes Federal Government aims to introduce a synchronised timetable for Germany (Deutschlandtakt). The electrified network will also be expanded and densified. The regionalisation funds, which also serve to strengthen public transport, will be continuously increased over the next few years.  The development and introduction of further technologies for digitalised railway operation will also lead to substantial improvements in rail system efficiency. Capacity increases in the available infrastructure can also be achieved by operating trains at shorter intervals, without having to accept compromises on safety. Despite an increase in rail traffic, this reduces the need for new development and expansion.  This additional expansion of capacity places high demands on planning and building capacities, also given the replacement investment measures necessary at the same time. These measures are financed through the service level and funding agreement, which is to apply from 2020 for a term of 10 years. Consideration will be given to how greater planning and investment security can also be made possible through capacity expansion and the introduction of digital command and control technology and the digitalisation of signal boxes. From 2020 to 2030, the Federal Government will provide additional federal funding in the amount of EUR 11 billion to strengthen the railway system, of which EUR 5.5 billion is additional equity capital for DB AG. This will enable the company to invest additional capital in the modernisation, expansion and electrification of the rail network and the railway system.  Flights are often cheaper than travelling by train to the same destination. In terms of climate protection, this is the wrong incentivising message. The VAT on long-distance rail tickets was therefore decreased from 19% to the reduced VAT rate of 7 % as of 1 January 2020. Conversely, the air transport tax was increased as of 1 April 2020. In the course of amendments to the air transport tax law, dumping prices for air tickets will be prevented by ensuring tickets cannot be sold at a price lower than the applicable taxes, surcharges, fees and charges.  3.1.3.iii.19. Increase in appeal of public transport 82  The aim of this package of measures is to increase the use of local public transport. Statutory jurisdiction for this lies with the states and municipalities. Due to the high energy efficiency and the high degree of electrification, public passenger transport is associated with substantially lower GHG emissions per passenger-kilometre than private motorised transport. The focus of this field of action is therefore carbon reduction by shifting passenger travel to local public transport. In addition, decarbonisation can also be boosted in public passenger transport (by using alternative drive systems, for example) in buses and local passenger rail transport.  The system development and network expansion for surface urban railways, underground rail and trams will be moved ahead. The use of public transport should also be made more attractive by improving the quality of the services offered. To this end, reliability will be improved, more frequent connections introduced, and comfort and safety will also be enhanced.  With the increase in federal funding under the Municipal Transport Financing Act for the development of the public transport system to EUR 1 billion a year from 2021, the Federal Government has laid the foundations for enhancing the attractiveness of public transport. The rail-based local transport system can also be expanded. The terms of the Municipal Transport Financing Act are to be focused more strongly on the objectives of climate-friendliness of public transport. To ensure that additional expansion measures can be specifically planned in the next few years, the Federal Government has increased the funding to EUR 2 billion a year as from 2025.  The modernisation and climate-friendly retrofitting of bus fleets will continue to be encouraged by stepping up the support of buses with electric and hydrogen-based drive systems and buses running on biogas. In addition, up to 50% of city buses are to be electric by 2030. This requires a substantial increase in funding measures. The Federal Government will additionally support 10 pilot projects aimed at enhancing public transport, such as the introduction of EUR 365 annual tickets. In an early minor amendment to the Passenger Transport Act, it is clarified that states and municipalities can set emission requirements for buses, taxis and rental cars.  3.1.3.iii.20. Expansion of cycle lanes and bicycle parking options as well as improvement of general conditions The Federal Government will increase the attractiveness of cycling by further improving road safety and road traffic conditions for cyclists. The development of express cycle paths and cycle tracks along main roads will ogramme will deliver equal opportunities for bicycle traffic, e.g. by providing secure and modern parking facilities and expanding the infrastructure for cargo bikes. For this purpose, grants for investment measures by the states and municipalities are to be made available for the first time, for the creation of cycle traffic networks (creation and expansion of cycle highways, conversion of traffic lanes into protected bike paths, construction measures to speed up cycle traffic, traffic measures such as the green wave where appropriate, intuitive road guidance measures through signage and markings and safe system alterations, in particular of intersections etc.), for secure and modern parking facilities and bicycle parking garages, for the construction of cycle paths along main roads, and for developing the necessary infrastructure and creating favourable conditions for cargo bikes. The specific content of the programme is currently being fleshed out.  The various infrastructural improvements will also support the trend towards an increasing use of electric bicycles or other new forms of mobility.  In addition, cycling has been improved by the creation of more bike-friendly conditions. This includes, for instance, a universal ban on motor vehicles stopping on protective cycle strips, higher penalties (for unlawful stopping on protective strips and in the second row, and for parking on footpaths and cycle lanes), a mandatory minimum overtaking distance for motor vehicles, the universal requirement for walking speed for right-turning motor vehicles over 3.5 t in urban areas, facilitating the establishment of cycle zones, the extension of the ban on parking in front of junctions and junction areas, the introduction of new traffic signs (green arrow for right turn on red for cyclists only, express cycle path, cycle zone, ban on overtaking of single-track vehicles such as bicycles by multi-(trials of traffic-regulating or protective measures irrespective of the danger situation) and the opening up of more one-way streets for cyclists in the opposite direction. If the implementation of the special programmes necessitates further regulatory amendments, the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure will consider their implementation within the framework of a law on bicycle traffic.  3.1.3.iii.21. Strengthening of rail freight transport Rail freight transport will also benefit considerably from the modernisation and capacity improvement on the rail network. This will make the transport of goods by rail faster and more attractive. With the promotion of Combined Transport, more goods will be put on the rails. To encourage the shift of goods to the rails, wagonload freight will be supported as an alternative to heavy goods vehicles through relief arrangements for 83  the system prices. The current European standard train length of 740 metres for freight trains is not being achieved at present on many routes in Germany. By expanding the 740-metre network for freight trains, the Federal Government aims to change that and thereby achieve improvements in capacity, quality and costs. There will also be a modern system of command and control technology. In the area of Combined Transport, this bundle of measures is aimed at increasing efficiency and lowering costs (e.g. by reducing process and waiting times, optimising resource utilisation at the terminal and in pre- /post-processing), by digitalising information processes and preparing information and by having digitally controlled handling facilities. The of rail freight -friendly, will increase the attractiveness of rail for the transportation of goods. In addition  subject to a positive evaluation in 2021  a continuation of funding for route prices in 2023 should help further enhance the attractiveness of this option. There is also funding for the reduction of plant prices, in particular to boost wagonload freight. The bundle of measures thus follows on from key interim results   3.1.3.iii.22. Modernisation of domestic navigation and use of shore power at ports An increase in the share of inland navigation to carry goods will be achieved through the implementation of climate protection measures from the Master Plan for Inland Navigation (May 2019). The funding programme for the sustainable modernisation of inland navigation vessels will be developed further. Infrastructure improvements at bottlenecks (measures aimed at the urgent need to eliminate bottlenecks) are to be implemented more rapidly and an interim law brought in, in which the plans for subsequent laws on measures will be identified. In addition, the phasing out of shipping fees, as already decided and in effect since 1 January 2019, is to be retained. To enable seaports to switch to electricity and low-emission, low-pollutant fuels, levies for shore power will be reduced and more low-emission, low-pollutant fuels supported on a temporary basis. In the long run, regulatory legislation will also have to apply here. In the case of seaports, an initiative will be launched for the EU-wide introduction of an obligation to use shore power; national regulations are being considered for inland ports.  3.1.3 iv. Where applicable, national policies, timelines and measures planned to phase out energy subsidies, in particular for fossil fuels  3.1.3.iv.1 G20 peer review process In 2009, the G20 states agreed that inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels should be phased out in the medium reduce our energy security, impede investment in clean energy sources and undermine efforts to deal with voluntary peer review process. Germany submitted a self-report on the relevant German subsidies in September 2016.  3.1.3.iv.2 Federal Government report on subsidies sustainability check on a regular 2-year basis. These checks involve determining the long-term economic, ecological and social effects of the relevant subsidies, for example in relation to economy prosperity, provision for the future, climate protection, conservation of resources or the protection of jobs, and the outcomes are documented in the report on subsidies. The current 27th Subsidy Report for the period 2019 to 2021 was approved by the Federal Government on 6 November 2019 and can be found on the following site: https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Downloads/Broschueren_Bestellservice/2019-11-06- Subventionsbericht.htm  Measures to subsidise energy, including fossil fuels, are set out in detail in Section 4.6.iv.  3.1.3.iv.3 Extensive evaluation of tax benefits In line with the subsidy policy guidelines, all subsidies taken into account in the Subsidy Report must be periodically evaluated with regard to the extent to which targets have been achieved, and in terms of their efficiency and transparency. At present, the Federal Government has had a total of 33 tax concessions listed in the Subsidy Report examined in a systematic evaluation as part of a research report with particular regard to the achievement of targets, efficiency, suitability as instruments and also, for the first time, their sustainability. The research project thus makes a worthwhile contribution to an evidence-based budgetary and taxation policy. Another key evaluation priority was in the area of energy and electricity taxes. The results of the evaluation reflect the opinion of the independent experts and were made public on 30 October 2019. In their recommendations, the experts note in summary that divergent criteria often argue for and against changes to tax concessions, and it is for the legislative authority to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of possible reforms. With this in mind, the Federal Government will examine the findings of the report with regard to the need for action or optimisation for the individual measures. 84   3.1.3.iv.4 Phasing out of hard coal subsidies The phasing out of subsidies for the promotion of hard coal is currently the most important measure being -coal mining industry is not competitive, in particular because of the geographical factors which lead to high extraction costs. In order to ensure that the phasing out of hard-coal mining complies with the principles of social justice, Germany has granted subsidies for the sale of domestically produced hard coal to cope with the decommissioning measures required, and bridging allowances for employees leaving the industry. The subsidies for the sale of domestic hard coal were paid for the last time in 2018; hard-coal mining was then discontinued. Post-decommissioning measures will be subsidised up to the end of 2022. The granting of subsidies for the early retirement of employees leaving the hard-coal mining industry will be discontinued at the end of 2027
