version 4.1 of 18 December 2019  3  1. Overview and the process of developing the National Energy and Climate Plan for 2021-2030 This document along with annexes has been developed in fulfilment of the obligation set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council and will be submitted to the European Commission in connection with Article 3 of the above regulation. This draft National Plan is an effect of the work of an inter-ministerial working team coordinated by the Ministry of State Assets1. The working team consisted of representatives of2: the Ministry of Climate, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Development, the Ministry of Development Funds and Regional Policy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Ministry of the Maritime Economy and Inland Waterways, the Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy, the Government Plenipotentiary for Strategic Energy Infrastructure, - URE), the Central Statistical Office - Bilansowania i ami - KOBiZE). The National Plan presents an integrated approach to the implementation of the five dimensions of the Energy Union.  Figure 1. Pillars of the Energy Union This document presents the national assumptions and goals (chapter 2), as well as policies and actions (chapter 3) concerning the above five dimensions. An analysis of the impacts of the planned policies and measures is presented in Annex 2 to this document, whose structure corresponds to the scope and numbering of Annex I to Regulation 2018/1999. The baseline scenario (i.e. with no policies and measures in place) is presented in Annex 1. The final version of the National Plan was prepared taking into account the conclusions derived from inter-ministerial work and public consultations, updates of national sectoral development strategies following from the Strategy for Responsible Development until 2020 (with an outlook for 2030), as well as from regional                                             1 The Ministry of Energy changed its name to the Ministry of State Assets with effect from 15 November 2019. 2 The names of ministries have been adapted to reflect the situation in November 2019, in correspondence to the reallocation of powers among the individual ministries. version 4.1 of 18 December 2019  4  consultations and Commission Recommendation C (2019) 4421 of 18 June 2019 on the draft integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of Poland covering the period 2021-2030. The draft is based on applicable national development strategies approved by the central government and draft strategic documents, which are at an advanced stage of preparation. The links between the National Plan and key sectoral strategies relevant for this document are presented in the graph below.  Figure 2. Links between the NECP and development strategies following from the SRD The above strategies identify the entities responsible for the implementation of individual activities/tasks, and define the funding framework. In the event of changes of the goals or strategic directions envisaged by the national development policies, draft strategies (e.g. by the draft Energy Policy of Poland until 2040), and new developments in the EU medium- and long-term climate and energy policies, the National Energy and Climate Plan for 2021-2030 will be adjusted accordingly, if necessary. The NECP presents the key tools and measures, which do not represent an exhaustive and closed list of implementation activities. Given the dynamics of economic developments (including in the energy sector), the list may be expanded to reflect the economic conditions and the effects of measures achieved. The NECP is a response to the EU legislation adopted to date. As a consequence, the National Plan can be updated in the future as per Article 14 of the abovementioned Regulation 2018/1999, or it can be revised to reflect modifications of the goals or strategic lines of intervention envisaged by the national development policies. 1.1. Consultation of the National Plan with national and EU entities The draft National Energy and Climate Plan was widely consulted between 14 January and 18 February 2019 wEnergy (currently the Ministry of State Assets), who invited the general public to submit opinions. Responses from stakeholders were being received until the end of March 2019. The Ministry received approx. 1100 comments from ca. 80 parties, i.e. ministries and offices (7 ministries: the Ministry of Investment and Economic Development, Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of Maritime Economy and Inland Navigation, Ministry of version 4.1 of 18 December 2019  5  Infrastructure, Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy, Ministry of National Defence) and 4 offices, including the Energy Regulatory Office, General Directorate for Environmental Protection), all major energy sector State Treasury companies (including PGE S.A., Energa S.A., Tauron Polska Energia, Enea S.A., LOTOS S.A., PKN ORLEN), transmission system operators (i.e. PSE.S.A., PERN S.A., Gaz-System S.A.), industry associations wo Gospodarcze Polskie Elektrownie (Polish Power Plants Association), Konfederacja Pracodawc√≥w Lewiatan Towarzystwo Nukleoniczne (Polish Nucleonic AssociatElektrowni Wodnych (Association for Small Hydropower Development)), NGOs (including WWF Poland, Client Earth  Prawnicy dla Ziemi foundation, Stowarzyszenie Energii Odnawialnej  SEO (Renewable Energy Association), Forum Energii (Energy Forum), Instytut Spraw Obywatelskich INSPRO (Civil Affairs Institute), wing Provinces  Kujawsko-Pomorskie, -and Poviats)) and individuals interested in the subject. Most of the comments were detailed, expert or technical development of renewable energy sources. Other frequently addressed areas of the National Plan included energy efficiency, the role of the heating sector and cogeneration, inter alia in energy security, network infrastructure (especially that of distribution networks) and the use of alternative fuels in transport, including electromobility, hydrogen propulsion, and energy storage. Between 8 and 30 August 2019, regional consultations were held on the draft National Energy and Climate Plan, as required by Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action. Requests for written comments on the draft NECP were sent to 8 countries, including the V4 (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary), countries with which Poland has a transboundary connection (Germany, Sweden, Lithuania) and Denmark (in connection with the Baltic Pipe investment), as well as Romania consultation process, Hungary expressed an opinion in which it considered the goals set by Poland realistic. Hungary expressed its interest in the creation by Poland of a gas transmission and trading hub and in the construction of the North-South corridor, and welcomed the plan to deploy nuclear energy in Poland, emphasizing that this will increase the security of energy supply. Hungary is open to exchange of experience in this area. In addition, minor remarks were made on decarbonisation calculations in the ETS sector by 2030, which have been fully taken into account. The Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania communicated that they had no comments. The other countries invited did not submit any comments. Issues regarding draft national plans and regional consultations were also addressed in 2019 by the BEMIP High Level Group, of which Poland is a member. On 18 June 2019, the European Commission issued Recommendation C(2019)4421 on the draft integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of Poland covering the period 2021-2030, which contains 10 recommendations. Given the wide range of issues they address and their impact on the economy in strategic individual dimensions of the Energy Union, taking into account the domestic conditions, forecasts for the development of the economy and individual sectors, the potential for the development of individual technologies, as well as the evolutionary process of just energy transition and its socio-economic considerations. It must be emphasised that pursuant to Regulation 2018/1999, the Commission recommendations are not binding. At a request made pursuant to the Act of 8 October 2010 on the cooperation of the Council of Ministers with the Sejm and the Senate in matters relating to Laws [Dziennik Ustaw] No 213, item 1395), the draft Position of the Polish Government on the above European Commission recommendations was prepared. The draft was prepared jointly by: the Ministry of Energy (leader), Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of Infrastructure, Ministry of Investment and Development, Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Ministry of Maritime Economy and Inland Navigation, and Ministry of National Defence. On 15 October 2019, the Position was adopted by the Committee for European Affairs. The position contains an indicative response to the recommendations. The conclusions of the national and regional consultations, as well as of the Commission recommendations were taken into account in the preparation of this version of the document. version 4.1 of 18 December 2019  6  1.2. National and EU energy system and policy context of the national plan The Polish energy system is among the largest in the European Union. It is one of the top ten systems in terms of the main macro energy indicators. This corresponds to the potential of the Polish economy, which ranks eighth in the European Union in terms of the GDP (EUR 496.4 billion in current prices in 2018), and sixth in terms of population (37.9 million). As regards the volume of primary and gross final energy consumption in 2018, Poland ranks sixth in the EU. The total global energy consumption in 2018 was 4490.7 PJ. Gross domestic energy consumption per capita amounted to around 116 GJ, slightly diverging from the European average of 137.1 GJ. In 2018, direct energy consumption amounted to 3551.8 PJ. Industry was the sector of the economy that had the largest share in direct energy consumption (34.5%). The transport sector, with a share of 27% in 2018 and rising steadily in recent years, ranked second. In 2018, households consumed 23% of energy, agriculture 4.6%, and other consumers 9%3.  Figure 3. Dynamics of primary and final energy intensity of GDP in the period 1990-2017 (kgoe/euro00) The primary and final energy intensity of GDP decreased in 2017 compared to 1990 by 61.5% and 57.3% respectively, with the rate of improvement slightly higher after the climate adjustment. Poland has seen a steady decrease in energy intensity, with periods of slight rises in 2010, 2016 and 2017. The decline in primary and final energy intensity is attributable to energy-efficiency measures, improved efficiency of industrial processes, and the fact that the GDP has been growing faster than energy consumption. Historically, there has been a growing divergence between the increase in GDP and the emission of greenhouse gases in Poland over the last three decades (1988-2018). The rising GDP does not lead to an increase in emission levels, which is shown in the graph below. In 1988-2018, GHG emissions declined by 32%, while GDP grew nearly 3 times.                                             3 Fuel and Energy Economy in 2017 and 2018 (Gospodarka paliwowo-energetyczna w latach 2017 i 2018), Central Statistical Office, 2019 version 4.1 of 18 December 2019  7   Figure 4. GDP dynamics relative to greenhouse gas emissions (1988-2018) The sectors of production and supply of electricity, gas, steam and hot water, as well as the mining and extraction sector account for approx. 4.5% of the gross value added of Polish GDP (with approx. 258 thousand employees4). As regards the added value dynamics in the sector in 2018, the industry sub-and previous year. In 2018, the volume of production in the Polish electricity sector amounted to approx. 170 TWh, while domestic electricity consumption reached approx. 175.7 TWh5. Electricity imports in the year amounted to 13.8 TWh, while exports to 8.1 TWh. Thus, the annual balance of cross-border electricity exchange was about 5.7 TWh for Poland in 2018. The figure below shows the production structure by carriers.                                             4 Statistical Yearbook of Industry, GUS, 2018 5 Polish Energy Statistics 2018, ME/URE/ARE S.A., 2019 version 4.1 of 18 December 2019  8   Figure 5. Electricity production structure by carriers in 2018 The above data shows that electricity production is based on coal and that coal provides Poland with an appropriate level of energy security and production stability. The coal mining sector in Poland (lignite and coal) also plays a very important social role. In 2018, the Polish coal mining industry employed directly approx. 135,000 people (compared to 175,000 in 2010). The ongoing energy transition leads to changes on the labour market, which results in miners moving to other industries. Developments in the Polish power sector lead to an increase in the share of RES in the structure of installed capacity within the National Power System (NPS) and in electricity production. In 2018, the share of RES in electricity production was 12.7%. In 2018, installed RES-based generation capacity increased to ca. 8.5 GW of total installed capacity within the NPS of ca. 44.3 GW in 2018. In 2010-2018, installed RES capacity increased 4 times and RES electricity production doubled. In 2018, Poland was ahead of 16 EU countries in terms of installed RES capacity volume6. In the context of the structure of electricity production, of which coal remains an important component, as well as bearing in mind the transformational nature of the present developments, the relationship between emissions from the electricity sector and the dynamics of electricity production, as shown in figure below, should be highlighted. The data shows that the upward trend in electricity production continuing in Poland since 2011 has not resulted in a growth in CO2 emissions in this sector. On the contrary, emissions from this sector were reduced by approximately 7% in the years 2011-n gradually decreasing.                                             6 Renewable Energy Statistics, IRENA, 2019. version 4.1 of 18 December 2019  9   Figure 6. Dynamics of electricity production against GHG emissions from the commercial thermal power plant sector (2006-2018) Regarding the development of renewable energy sources, their share in gross final energy consumption in 2018 was about 11%, with the nationwide 2020 target at 15%. The graphs below present progress towards the national RES targets for individual Member States. Attaining these targets is a challenge for a number of countries, even those pursuing the most ambitious climate and energy policies, such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany or the UK. Only 11 out of 28 EU countries have already achieved their national targets concerning the share of renewable energy sources in the gross final energy consumption set for 2020.  Figure 7. Attainment of 2020 RES targets in individual EU Member States version 4.1 of 18 December 2019  10   Figure 8. Difference between the share of RES in 2018 and the 2020 target The deceleration of the increase in the share of RES in gross final energy consumption in recent years has been partly attributable to an increase in final energy consumption, resulting from the good economic situation in Poland and a high increase in the official consumption of diesel and gasoline connected with a decline of illegal trade in these fuels. The temporary stagnation of renewable energy development has been caused, inter alia, by a change in the regulatory environment through the Act of 20 May 2016 on investments in wind farms, and by the introduction of a new mechanism of auction-based support. Owing to weather conditions, despite an increase in installed capacity of RES, 2018 saw a decline in electricity production. The above factors slowed down the growth in the share of RES in gross final energy consumption. Given the large share of domestic energy resources in the national energy balance, Poland is among the most energy-independent EU countries. The energy dependency rate for Poland was 38% in 2017, with the EU average at 55%.  Figure 9. Energy dependency rates in the EU in 2017, Eurostat version 4.1 of 18 December 2019  11  At present, there are two strategic framework documents that define the state energy policy. They are: The Energy Policy of Poland, which is currently being updated (the public consultation of the draft Energy Policy of Poland until 2040, hereinafter EPP2040, as part of a strategic environmental assessment has ended), and the Responsible Development Strategy 2020  with an outlook for 2030 (adopted in 2017, hereinafter: Strategy for Responsible Development, Strategy or SRD). The main objective of the Energy Policy is to ensure energy security while safeguarding the competitiveness of the economy and energy efficiency, reducing the impact of the energy sector on the environment and making the optimum use of own energy resources. The draft EPP2040 envisages eight strategic directions, namely: (1) making the optimum use of own energy resources, (2) expanding electricity-production and network infrastructure, (3) diversifying the supply of natural gas, oil, and liquid fuels and expanding the associated network infrastructure, (4) developing energy markets, (5) deployment of nuclear power, (6) developing renewable energy sources, (7) developing the heating and cogeneration sector, (8) improving energy efficiency of the economy. With respect to the structure of energy carriers, the leading role of coal is planned to be maintained, but given the anticipated increase in the demand for energy, the need to reduce CO2 emissions and the rule of rational management, which includes, inter alia, analysing the cost or resources, CO2 emissions and use of state-of-the-arts technologies, the percentage share of this fuel in the energy mix will decrease gradually, down to approximately 56-60% in 2030. The above trend will continue in the following decade, i.e. until 2040. At the same time, Poland will prioritise diversifying energy carriers by successively increasing the share of RES (the role of which in electricity generation will be mainly enhanced by wind power and photovoltaics) and by including nuclear power in the energy balance starting from 2033. Increased use of natural gas will play an important role, too. Access to diversified sources and ease of obtaining gas as a commodity at a price acceptable to the final consumer will allow its wider use in the national economy for heat and electricity production. This will reduce the emissivity of the economy while, at the same time, providing an effective tool in fighting for clean air. The latter of the above documents, i.e. the Strategy for Responsible Development, has a more general nature. In accordance with the Strategy, the main mission of the energy sector is to safeguard stable energy supplies for the economy, institutions and citizens, adapted to their needs as much as possible and at a price acceptable from the economic point of view. According to the SRD, this should be pursued through reasonable and effective use of locally available resources, waste-to-energy, and RES, while exploiting the potential of innovation in the generation, transmission and distribution of energy. At the operational level, the Strategy proposes increasing the share of stable RES, including energy clusters, cooperatives, etc. and giving continued priority to improving the energy efficiency of the economy, which includes eliminating emissions harmful to the environment. It is also essential that energy storage technologies be developed, along with the introduction of smart energy networks, the development of electromobility and the introduction of energy-saving and high-efficiency technologies. The strategy also includes projects supporting its implementation, which include: a capacity market, a regional gas transmission and trading hub, an electromobility development programme, the hard coal mining sector, The provisions of the above national documents are consistent with the energy policy principles formulated by the European Union. They include enhancing energy security, improving energy efficiency, building a stable and efficient internal market, reducing carbon emissions, increasing renewable energy generation and developing innovation in the energy sector. The strategic directions of development introduced successively to date from the beginning of the current decade, along with the 2030 policy targets, are materialising through the Energy Union. The Union -term energy policy until 2050. The Energy Union contributes to integration of efforts and promotes their uniform management, evaluation and assessment. 1.3. Current climate and energy policies and measures across five dimensions of the Energy Union Poland pursues an active climate and energy policy and undertakes measures across all dimensions of the Energy Union. The priority within the framework of the five Energy Union dimensions  from the perspective of the  is 'energy security'. Two main components of version 4.1 of 18 December 2019  12  energy security must be analysed, i.e. electricity generation and gas and crude oil supply. In the former area, Poland undertakes measures to ensure the stability and continuity of electricity generation  based on domestic energy carriers  in order to satisfy internal demand. This includes regulatory measures and measures relating to investments in the generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure. As regards measures supporting electrical power security, attention should be drawn to the introduction of capacity market, which is to guarantee funding for the maintenance of additional capacity at times of increased demand and in peak periods (winter-summer) and secure intermittent energy sources (RES). This mechanism will enhance the stability of the entire electricity system. Additionally, activities are carried out to support the development of high-efficiency cogeneration and renewable energy sources, as well as to deploy nuclear power. Investments in these technologies aimed at restoring and increasing capacity in the electricity system ensure that energy security will be achieved consistently with the horizontal targets of the Polish energy sector, i.e. reduction in the emission of pollutants from the electricity sector, enhancement of energy efficiency and improvement of the competitiveness of the economy. Additionally, in order to safeguard security of supplies the electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure must be upgraded and expanded. The above will make it possible to evacuate power from existing generation sources and to connect new capacity, to improve the certainty of supplies to consumers, to create safe working conditions for RES, to ensure the possibility of reducing unscheduled power flows from the electricity systems of neighbouring countries and thus also to increase international power exchange capabilities, and to implement a uniform electricity market throughout the EU. In 2017, the EU adopted two legislative acts which have now become the central regulatory pillars of European energy security, i.e. Regulation concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply (2017/1938) and Decision establishing an information exchange mechanism with regard to intergovernmental agreements and non-binding instruments between Member States and third countries in the field of energy (2017/684). The former document addresses directly the security of the natural gas market, while the IGA Decision provides for the exchange of information on intergovernmental agreements related to natural gas and oil. In Polish legislation, the security of resource supply is regulated by the Energy Law. The Diversification Regulation1 (in force since 10 May 2017) is the latest legislative act relevant for the security of supply. It defines the maximum share of natural gas to be imported by an energy company from a single source in a given calendar year. This share may be 70% until 2022, but must not exceed 33% from January 2023 onwards. Poland and Denmark across the Danish territory with gas deposits on the Norwegian continental shelf, known infrastructure initiative referred to as the North-South Corridor7. In addition, two-way interconnections are planned with Slovakia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic and Ukraine. The above projects will enable Poland to establish a gas transmission and trading hub for Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic states in Poland. Energy security activities will be gradually complemented by further diversification projects and intensified gas extraction by domestic gas companies from foreign deposits. Poland does not have substantial crude oil reserves and mainly covers domestic demand by imports (approx. 96%). For the most part, Poland imports crude oil used by the refining industry from the east, but recently there has been a major shift in the structure of import directions as a result of an effective trade policy, but above all, rder to secure supply, further measures are needed to ensure real diversification of directions and supplies. Such measures are provided for by Resolution on the Policy of the Polish Government for logistics infrastructure in the oil sector, which was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 28 November 2017. The main purpose of the Policy is to define actions to improve the fuel security of Poland. In light of the above, the Policy defines the following specific objectives: 1. Construction and development of logistics infrastructure in such a way as to ensure the supply of hydrocarbons to customers in crisis situations and secure smooth trading conditions for trading companies. 2. Construction and development of logistics infrastructure towards diversification of the sources and routes of crude oil supply to Poland. 3. Ensuring that companies fully owned by the State Treasury control the hydrocarbon transmission and  4. In addition, both in relation to crude oil and fuels, as well as natural gas, the security of Poland is ensured by a developed system of intervention reserves based on the Act on reserves of crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas and on measures to be applied in response to threats to national fuel security and version 4.1 of 18 December 2019  13  disruptions on the crude oil market. The diversification of the structure of the Polish energy balance while increasing the role of low- and zero-emission and high-efficiency technologies and solutions in all economy sectors will help to achieve positive results in the area of 'decarbonisation'. With respect to the 2020 reduction targets, the Effort Sharing Decision their emissions by 14% as compared with 2005. In the above context, attaining the 2030 national reduction target in non-ETS sectors, which is set at -7% in the 2018 Effort Sharing Regulation, will be an ambitious challenge. Attaining the reduction goals ensuing from EU legislation, i.e. mitigating greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% compared to the 1990 level, requires taking suitable actions also in non-ETS sectors, i.e. transport, where the 2030 EU reduction target is set at 30% relative to 2005. In order to meet the reduction goals and satisfy the projected increase in demand for fuels, Poland will support low-carbon transport, inter alia by developing alternative fuels, primarily electricity, as well as LNG and CNG, which will contribute to both reddependency on oil imports and to limiting the harmfulness of the transport sector to the environment. The generation of renewable energy constitutes an important element of measures aimed at decarbonisation, as well as at energy diversification and the satisfaction of increasing energy demand. It reflects care for the natural environment and is an answer to the need to promote sustainable development as well as to strengthen regions and local communities in the European Union. The green energy sub-sector is tasked with supporting the energy security of the country without engaging excessive budgetary resources in a way divergent from real benefits for the public and the economy and the entire energy system. Poland supports the development of renewable energy defined in this way by undertaking a number of specific measures. These measures are implemented on the basis of the Act on renewable energy sources, which has been revised in 2016, 2017, and 2019. The legislation envisages a number of solutions aimed at creating a stable environment for the growth of production in the renewable energy sector. They are: energy clusters, energy cooperatives, an auction system for most of the key RES technologies, interim solutions for the green certificate system, support for prosumers and a range of rules and conditions for conducting activity in the field of electricity generation, agricultural biogas, heat and bioliquids, as well as instruments intended to support them in a systemic fashion. Additionally, the Polish Government supports, by means of legislative acts, distributed energy generation, especially clusters and energy cooperatives, which are designed as a technologically neutral tool available to any local community, which, by self-organising, has an opportunity to safeguard energy independence within the region where cooperation is developed. The main value of such a bottom-up approach to RES lies in its contribution to the development of specific regions and local economies and stimulation of the labour market, which is achieved through the utilisation of resources available locally in the form of energy substrates, energy carriers, and human and financial capital and leads to their most effective use. At the same time, as a result of measures in the form of regulatory facilitations, as well as the allocation of additional funding, the number of emerging clusters is growing gradually. Ultimately, the energy cluster formula is to be the basic form of developing distributed renewable energy in the sector of medium-sized and partly large installations (selected technologies). Since February 2019, the Ministry of State Assets (formerly the Ministry of Energy), as part of the MENAG scientific consortium together with the AGH University of Science and Technology and the National Centre for Nuclear Research, has been pursuing implements the provisions of Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2. Energy efficiency is another pillar of the Energy Union. The crucial act of Polish legislation in this area is the Energy Efficiency Act, which requires obliged entities to implement projects increasing energy efficiency (or to purchase white certificates, subject to a limit). The Act covers both the private and public sectors and imposes savings obligations on all entities. It enumerates energy efficiency improvement measures which can be employed by public bodies, including energy performance contracts. In accordance with the Act, the private transposes EU legislation into Polish law. Its main task is to achieve the goal of increasing energy efficiency by 20% in 2020 for the entire EU. For Poland, the target is set at 13.6 Mtoe in 2020 relative to the reference value for Poland calculated on the basis of the baseline scenario in a forecast prepared for the European Commission (PRIMES - Baseline 2007). In absolute terms, the target translates into primary consumption at a level of 96.4 Mtoe and final consumption reaching 71.6 Mtoe in 2020. The 2020 revision to the Act will transpose the provisions of Directive (EU) 2018/2002 of 11 December 2018 amending Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency. Since 2019, this National Energy and Climate Plan has replaced the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan. version 4.1 of 18 December 2019  14  Another dimension of the Energy Union in which measures are undertaken is the internal energy market, which is being created through actions in the electricity and gas sectors. The area of EU internal electricity market requires a two-track approach and synchronisation. This implies undertaking measures ensuring energy sufficiency as well as expanding and intensifying cooperation as part of the pan-European system. The responsibility for the transmission infrastructure in the Polish power system lies with Polskie Sieci Energetyczne PSE S.A., whose activity thus determines, to a large extent, the security of the entire energy system of Poland. The investment plans of the Polish transmission system operator are defined in short-, medium- and long-term perspectives. They have been formulated in several documents, including: Annual Tangible Investment Plan (IP)   horizon, Transmission Grid Development Plan (TGDP)  izon; Forecast concerning the security status of energy supplies  prepared for fifteen years. In the 2030 perspective, improving flow in the synchronous system of interconnections between Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and the full synchronisation of the transmission systems of the Baltic states will be particularly important. The incorporation and synchronisation of the power systems of associated countries, which are on the track towards closer relations with the EU, should be within the area of interest of the Members States, which are building the Energy Union. In 2019, pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943, an Action Plan was drafted to fulfil the obligation to provide market participants with cross-zonal capacity of at least 70% of the transmission capacity (CEP 70% target). With the application of the Plan, the deadline for achieving the CEP 70% target is 31 December 2025. The Plan applies to one synchronous area (borders: Poland - Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia) and one asynchronous border: Poland - Sweden. The Action Plan does not apply to the second asynchronous border: Poland - Lithuania. Therefore, on the Poland - Lithuania border, the CEP 70% target will be attained as from 1 January 2020, which stems from international obligations. The programme for building a smart power network is a major project for the next years in Poland. It encompasses work on organisational and legal solutions which will enable the deployment of new technologies such as smart metering. Only then will it be possible to implement electricity demand management mechanisms and, as a result, to use electricity in a more sustainable manner. This will be possible by bridging the gap in knowledge about measures and preferences between energy consumers and its producers and suppliers. -SYSTEM S.A. is the natural gas transmission infrastructre accordance with EU guidelines and Article 16.2 of the Energy Law, GAZ-SYSTEM draws up a 10-year national development plan. The activities related to gas supply source diversification presented in the 2018-2027 Development Plan assume that the principal new sources of imported gas will be located in the north-west of the country and will include the Baltic Pipe with the capacity of the interconnector of up to 10 billion m3 per year, 3 annually. The operator also and Ukraine, and the expansion of domestic transmission infrastructure. Poland actively participates in the legislative work of the Council of the European Union and its auxiliary bodies on legislative projects related to electricity and natural gas markets. It also partners up with neighbouring countries and international organisations, including the International Energy Agency, the Energy Community, the Energy Charter Treaty, and the Eastern Partnership, to create a secure energy environment. The Energy Regulatory Office, which is the Polish electricity and gas market regulator, cooperates with its counterparts through the Agency for tcreate an efficient and transparent internal market for electricity and natural gas in the EU. Polish electricity and natural gas system operators are also members of European associations influencing the EU energy market. PSE S.A. is a member of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), while GAZ-SYSTEM S.A. is a member of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSO-G). Immediately after the establishment of the ACER, i.e. in 2011, ENTSO-E proposed the Electricity Target Model. Poland has been engaged in the implementation processes of this model. At present, cooperation is coordinated at the regional level and then a project covering the entire EU is to be launched. By virtue of a decision of the ACER, a central macro-region has been created for coordinating cooperation for the implementation of the market model adopted in 2011. At present, Poland belongs to the recently expanded CORE area that brings together energy systems of thirteen centrally located European countries, working jointly to establish a common energy market. An analogous analysis was carried out by the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) for the natural gas market, which resulted in the creation of the Gas Target Model version 4.1 of 18 December 2019  15  in 2011. The study was devoted to access to infrastructure on the wholesale market and development needs. In 2014, ACER updated the analysis to promote the introduction of flexible regulatory frameworks on the gas wholesale market in order to increase its liquidity and develop tools to support its integration. As a result of the analysis, work was started on the gas network codes adopted in previous years, to regulate inter alia the following issues: congestion management, capacity allocation mechanism in transmission networks, gas balancing rules in transmission networks, transmission tariff structures, interoperability, and information exchange. research, innovation and competitivenessThe energy sector sees an ever increasing need for developing a new approach, the most important tools of n policy is being focused on own funds. The pro-innovation activity of energy companies is a trend that supports the innovation-oriented approach. An ever increasing tendency is developing in Poland   consisting in offering incubation schemes to start-up businesses which create ideas and develop their activity in the energy sector. Leading Polish energy companies have established their own acceleration centres for newly established companies (incubators) and joint venture companies. The newly established entities include: PGE Ventures (a company set up by PGE S.A.), InnVento  a technology incubator (an entity set up by PGNIG S.A.), Tauron Magenta (established by Tauron S.A.), Enea Innovation (a venture capital company set up by Enea S.A.), ORLEN Innowacje&Startupy (a platform and incubator of ORLEN). The activity of Polish energy companies in the area of incubation and acceleration of new projects, as well as the visible role of the state in stimulating R&D activities in the energy sector, is expected to result in a growing level of innovation of the Polish energy sector over the next few years. The electromobility development project is a flagship initiative in the field of innovative solutions strongly related to the energy sector. It is being developed with a strong participation of the state  in regulatory and funding terms  but it is to become reality through intense cooperation with energy companies, transport sector companies and other players representing the private sector. At present, the direction for the electromobility project is set by the Strategy for Responsible Development, and in more detail by the Electromobility under the Act on electromobility and alternative fuels, adopted on 22 November 2018, as well as under a number of supporting legislative acts. The objective of the project is to create conditions for the development of electromobility. This is to be achieved through support for expanding the core infrastructure network and the system of incentives encouraging potential buyers to purchase electric vehicles, and for developing industry towards the use of vehicles with alternative drives. For 2025, the programme sets an indicative target of a million electric-drive vehicles. The programme also envisages an increase in the number of LNG or CNG fueled vehicles, including the construction of 4 installations for gas bunkering for vessels on the Polish coast. Stabilisation of the electricity network will be another positive effect for the Polish power system. Using it to charge so many vehicles, while providing the right incentives to create the desired behaviour on the part of electric vehicle users (e.g. night tariffs for recharging electric vehicles), will help flatten the electricity demand curve and thus stabilise it, which will be beneficial in terms of the operating characteristics of the key power generation units in the Polish energy system. The above-described programme is one of the main strategic development programmes aimed at improving the innovation of the energy and transport sector, changing it to electromobility. 1.4. Administrative structure of the implementation of national climate and energy policies The National Enerhorizontal development strategy, i.e. the Strategy for Responsible Development, and its integrated sectoral strategies, which were updated in 2019 or are currently being updated, in particular with draft Energy Policy of Poland until 2040, the draft State Environmental Policy 2030  strategy for development in the area of environment and water management, the Sustainable Transport Development Strategy 2030, and the Strategy for Sustainable Development of Agriculture, Rural Areas and Fisheries for 2030. The responsibility for implementing measures aimed at meeting the targets set in the National Plan rests on a number of public bodies, depending on their scope of competence, as well as  at the operating level  on private entities. The graph below presents the structure of entities engaged in the preparation of the draft NECP along with the version 4.1 of 18 December 2019  16  chart showing the process of developing it to date.  1.5.

Executive summary The National Energy and Climate Plan has been prepared with a view to establishing a stable framework forming an environment for a sustainable, economically effective and just transition towards a low-carbon economy. This document is to produce synergy through the delivery of activities in the five interrelated of the document describes the national assumptions and goals of Polathird the policies and measures designed to implement them. Because some goals, as well as policies and measures, aim at strengthening more than one dimension, they are assigned to those where they are expected to have the greatest impact. In order to add clarity to the document, the assumptions and goals, as well as policies and measures, are marked with the colours assigned to the individual dimensions of the Energy Union. mate policy which are identified in this document and constitute the future measure of its implementation are presented in the graph below. It should be noted here that the renewable energy use target is conditional, i.e. attainable at 23% if Poland is granted additional EU funds, including those allocated for just transition. The national targets contribute to the joint fulfilment by the EU of its climate commitments under the Paris Agreement and to the pursuit of climate neutrality.  Figure 2030 climate and energy goals Decarbonisation The decarbonisation dimension addresses issues related both to emission and removal of greenhouse gases and air pollution, as well as those regarding the use of renewable energy sources. Given the ever more frequent extreme weather phenomena, the adaptation to climate change is also taken into account. The reduction target for Poland in terms of greenhouse gas emissions in sectors not covered by the ETS is set at -7% in 2030 compared with 2005; The declared target is to be achieved by reducing emissions in transport, construction and agriculture, taking into account the beneficial effects of the absorption of CO2 by ecosystems and the flexibility associated with land use, change to land use, and forestry. In this context, crucial importance is also attached to improving the quality of life for people living in Poland, notably the protection of their health and living standard, having regard to environmental protection. In particular, this means solving the problem - version 4.1 of 18 December 2019  19  As part of meeting the EU-wide 2030 target, Poland declares to achieve a 21%-23%* share of RES in gross final energy consumption (aggregate consumption in the electricity sector, heating and cooling sector, and in transport) by 2030. By 2030, the share of RES in the heating and cooling sector is estimated to grow on average by 1.1 percentage points annually. In transport, a 14% share of renewable energy is expected to be achieved by 2030. In order to attain the above targets, RES is planned to be supported through existing and new support and promotion mechanisms. There are also plans to use advanced biofuels, develop offshore wind energy, and add momentum to the development of RES-based microinstallations. Energy efficiency The PRIMES 2007 forecast sets the 2030 national target for improving energy efficiency at 23% for primary energy consumption, which corresponds to primary energy consumption at 91.3 Mtoe in 2030. Actions aimed at reducing energy consumption are given priority since they simultaneously lead to further reduction of emissions and contribute to achieving the energy and climate goals. In this context, developing eco-friendly and effective heating systems, cogeneration, smart grids and mechanisms stimulating energy end-use savings and pro-saving behaviour come to the fore. Both as regards energy efficiency and improvement of the housing conditions for residents, it is considered important to develop a long-stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private ones, as provided for by revised Directive 2010/31/EU. Actions are also planned to increase energy efficiency in transport, by promoting more sustainable methods of transporting goods (e.g. intermodal transport, rail transport) and passengers (e.g. public transport). The document provides for increasing energy efficiency through the creation of a coherent, sustainable, innovative and user-friendly transport system at the national, European and global level. Energy security Energy security is treated as a priority in Poland. In this dimension, satisfying the growing demand for fuels and energy in connection with the forecast economic growth and ensuring uninterrupted energy supplies are of utmost importance. Maintaining far-reaching energy independence, diversifying the energy mix and directions of imported fuel supplies are a central focus in this context. This pertains to both crude oil and natural gas, which means that there is a need for infrastructure development in these sectors. In order to satisfy the growing demand for electricity, adding more electricity generation capacity will be needed. The National Plan highlights the deployment of nuclear power in Poland as crucial for ensuring stable supply of electricity and for diversifying energy sources. The first unit (with a capacity of ca. 1-1.5 GW) of the first nuclear power plant is expected to be commissioned in 2033, with another five units to be launched every 2-3 years (with a total capacity of approx. 6-9 GW). Given the availability of domestic hard coal and lignite deposits, domestic coal production is expected to be maintained at a level capable of satisfying the demand of the energy sector. However, the share of coal in electricity production will gradually decline. In 2030, it is bound to reach 56-60%, with the downward trend maintained until 2040. Internal energy market In developing its internal energy market, Poland will strive to enhance the availability and capacity of existing power interconnections and to integrate the national natural gas transmission system with the systems of Central and Eastern European countries and the Baltic region. In this context, further investments in internal gas and electricity networks that will ensure security of energy supply will also be necessary. As regards production of energy from renewable sources, measures will be taken to guarantee an appropriate level of flexibility of the energy system. In order to drive the development of a competitive market, the aim is to increase arket, while curbing energy poverty and protecting vulnerable groups. Research, innovation and competitiveness                                             * The 23% target is achievable only if Poland is granted additional funds, including those allocated for just transition. version 4.1 of 18 December 2019  20  Research, innovations and actions enhancing the competitiveness of the economy will be crucial for delivering the objectives and policies outlined in the NECP since this dimension intertwines with others by providing new technologies and solutions conducive to energy transition. The central aim in this dimension is to bridge the civilization gap between Poland and developed countries, and to improve the living standards for Polish society. Poland also intends to boost the competitiveness of the economy through a more complete use of social and territorial resources and automation, robotisation and digitisation of enterprises. By supporting the development of energy innovations, Poland intends to enhance the competitiveness of the Polish energy sector and thereby maximize the benefits for the Polish economy. Another goal is to accelerate sales of technologies by Polish companies on foreign markets, which is associated with adding international importance and competitiveness to Polish science. The objectives in this respect will be delivered through increased expenditure on R&D in Poland (from 0.75% of the GDP in 2011 to 1.7% in 2020 and 2.5% in 2030) and new rules for using such expenditure, better suited for present conditions. In order to maximise benefits, it is reasonable to further cooperation with the European Commission and EU Member States regarding the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan. One of the main research goals will be to determine the potential for production, use and development of hydrogen technologies in Poland.
