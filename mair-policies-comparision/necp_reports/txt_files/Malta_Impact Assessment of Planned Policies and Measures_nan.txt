Therefore, reference is made to Section 4.1 of the Plan for further details related to exogenous factors such as macroeconomic assumptions.  Furthermore, as a complement to this analysis, scenarios in which certain key assumptions varied from those adopted for the NECP were analysed in order to explore other possible medium- to long-term responses of the energy system in reaction to such circumstances. The identification of these diverging assumptions was informed by uncertainties surrounding independent factors which may have an impact on the energy system and on the effect of the efficacy of PAMs outlined in the NECP. In this regard, two factors emerged as predominant: (i) the rate of efficiency increase, as a result of market factors; and (ii) the rate of electrification, as a result of market factors and behavioural change. Outcomes from the modelling of these two sensitivities are thus also outlined in this section. Indicators relating to the dimensions of the Energy Union were tracked in order to analyse the potential range of results under these different visions of the evolving energy system.  Definitions relevant to the Analytical basis of the NECP:  ·      Energy/emission modelling framework: combination of tools, data, expert judgment, institutional arrangements, used for different purposes, for and beyond energy/emission projections aiming to support decision makers (e.g. for energy planning). ·      Energy/emission projection system: combination of tools, data, expert judgment, institutional arrangements used specifically for energy and emission projections. ·      Integrated projections:  projections based on an holistic approach which addresses simultaneously as many perspectives or dimensions of the energy and climate dynamics as possible, and takes into account the cross-cutting nature and interactions between those dimensions; in the context of this integrated projectionsive dimensions of the Energy Union (Decarbonisation, Energy efficiency,  Energy security, Internal energy market, Research, innovation and competitiveness). ·      Storyline of a scenario: narrative description of a scenario, highlighting the assumptions and drivers which characterize a scenario and make it different from other scenarios.  169  ·      Sensitivity analysis/ sensitivities: modelled WEM and WPM scenarios in which a number of key assumptions diverged from those adopted for the purposes of the NECP.

To avoid repetition, these are not reproduced hereunder.  Projections in the ESR sector The aggregated effect of the WEM scenario in comparison to the WPM scenario is illustrated in Figure 77, providing for a comparative analysis between the WEM against WPM scenario for the non-ETS emissions sectors. The WEM scenario is denoted in the background with the stacked emissions of all non-ETS emissions sectors (energy, IPPU, agriculture, waste and LULUCF. The red dotted line shows the total effect of the WPM scenario, which as expected shows a reduction in emissions when compared to the WEM scenario, as a result of the implementation of domestic policies and measures. This reduction in emissions in the non-ETS emissions sectors under the WPM scenario, however is projected to still result in emissions generation above the ESR target for 2030, which is shown as a blue dotted line. The gap between the dotted lines has to be bridged either by means of additional domestic policies and measures to be committed to and reported in subsequent iterations of the NECP or by resorting to the flexibility mechanisms in line with the provisions of the ESR regulation.   171  Figure 77 - ESD/ESR projections by sector98   Projections of emissions of air pollutants The projected emissions of air pollutants provided hereunder were produced by the Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) in accordance with the National Emissions Ceilings Directive (EU) 2016/2284. It is to be noted that these emissions were calculated primarily based on energy projections of primary and final energy consumption for the projected period up to 2040. Therefore, as a disclaimer, it must be pointed out that the projections of air emissions presented below do not WPM scenario. The National Inventory for Emission Ceilings will be updated in the next reporting cycle based on the most recent energy consumption projections used for the Final NECP.  The National Emissions Ceilings Directive sets national emission reduction commitments for Member States and the EU for five air pollutants:  - nitrogen oxides (NOx),  - non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs),  - sulphur dioxide (SO2),  - ammonia (NH3) and  - fine particulate matter (PM2.5).  Malta also calculated the projected black carbon (BC) emissions. These pollutants have a negative impact on air quality, human health and the environment. Emissions are provided for the latest                                                            98 Note: Base year emmissions used to estimate 2021-2030 trajectory equivalent to base year used in the 2013-2020 trajectory; base year emissions shall be amended once the implementing acts derived from article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parlamament and Council enter into force.   020040060080010001200140016001800201720182019202020212022202320242025202620272028202920302031203220332034203520362037203820392040WasteLULUCFAgricultureIPPUEnergyWPM totalESD Trajectory 2015-2020 (ESR trajectory2021-2030 projected) 172  emission inventory year (2017), and projections for 2020, 2025 and 2030. The projections presented within this section  and therefore the measures Malta is committed to implement and are modelled and reported in the NECP. These emission projections were largely developed using the same models and activity drivers used for the development of the NECP.  The NEC Directive requires that Member States draw up a National Air Pollution Control Programme (NAPCP), which should contribute to the successful implementation of air quality plans established Draft NECP and NAPCP processes was ensured, whereby the assumptions and outputs of one exercise fed into the other and vice-versa. ERA is the government body responsible for the development of the NAPCP. In addition, expert assistance was also provided through the capacity-building project on emission projections, funded by the European Commission. This capacity-building project specifically provided support in developing emission projections for road transport and national navigation sectors. Figure 78 shows the national total emissions of air pollutants on the Maltese territory split by the five main pollutants, including black carbon. It is projected that apart from ammonia all other air pollutants are expected to decrease in the projected period until 2030 compared to 2017, the latest emission inventory year.  Figure 78 - National total air pollutant emission projections, kt   Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) are expected to decrease in the projected period as a result of the implementation of measures under the WPM scenario. Nitrogen oxide emissions are most prevalent in the road transport sector  it is expected however that NOx emissions in road transport should decrease by 42% by 2030, based on 2017 emissions, as a result of newer vehicle technologies, increased electrification and a number of sustainable mobility measures in transport. To calculate NOx emissions in the road transport sector, the outputs of the vehicle profile model and vehicle kilometre projections were used as input to COPERT. The largest NOx level increases, compared to 2017 emissions, are expected in the waste sector, as a result of the commissioning of the new Waste-to-Energy facility in 2024, followed by the manufacturing and construction sector. NOx levels are also 0123456NOxNMVOCSOxNH3PM2.5BCktProjected air emissions, kt2017202020252030 173  expected to increase in the other sectors category, which includes the commercial, institutional, residential and agriculture & fishing sectors as well as in the aviation and maritime transport sectors. Figure 79 shows the projected NOx emissions by sector.  Figure 79 - NOx emission projections by sector, kt   Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) are expected to decrease by 25% in the projected period compared to 2017, in particular due to the road transport sector, where it is expected that NMVOC emissions will decrease by 66% by 2030. On the other hand, NMVOC levels are expected to rise in all other sectors with the exception of waste. NMVOC emissions will remain stable in the category solvent and other products and animal husbandry. Projected NMVOC levels are shown in Figure 80.   00.511.522.533.5Projected NOxemissions by sector, kt2017202020252030 174  Figure 80 - NMVOC emission projections by sector, kt  Sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions are projected to decrease, primarily in the power generation sector. Since 2017, local generation plants at the Delimara Power Station are fired by natural gas. Gasoil-based generation capacities are available as back-up in case of emergencies or when other sources are not available. It must be pointed out that the energy system modelling tools assume that electricity will be generated by the natural gas-fired units and therefore gasoil consumption is projected to remain 0 until the end of the projected period. In reality, a situation where gasoil-fired units are utilized as standby capacity in the event of an emergency is possible in the next decade. Therefore, while SO2 emissions are expected to decrease drastically in the energy industries sector, they are expected to continue increasing in the aviation and maritime transport sectors as well as waste after the commissioning of the new waste to energy facility.   00.20.40.60.811.21.41.6Projected NMVOC emissions, kt 2017202020252030 175  Figure 81 - SO2 emission projections by sector, kt   Projected ammonia (NH3) levels are relatively high primarily in the animal husbandry and plant production and agriculture soils sectors. As highlighted above, ammonia emissions are the only air pollutant which is expected to increase in the projected period up to 2030, although only by 5% compared to 2017 levels. This is largely due to slight increases in animal husbandry by 2020 as well as the 7% increase in NH3 emissions in the plant production and agriculture soils sector. Future projects implemented by the Governance of Agricultural Bioresources Agency (GAB) are expected to reduce NH3 emissions. However, due to lack of information available at the time of the compilation of these projections, GAB projects are not included in the projected emissions levels. NH3 emission projections are provided in Figure 82.  Figure 82 - NH3 emission projections, kt  00.10.20.30.40.50.6Projected SO2emissions, kt201720202025203000.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.9Projected NH3emissions, kt2017202020252030 176   Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions are expected to decrease only slightly in the projected period, as shown in Figure 83. The projected decrease which will be registered in the road transport sector will be off-set by increased emission levels in off-road transport, which will surpass emissions of the road transport sector by 2030. Other sectors, such as commercial, residential and institutional, will increase slightly, as will manufacturing & construction and waste.  Figure 83 - PM2.5 emission projections, kt   For the WPM scenario, Malta had also projected the emission levels of black carbon (BC) in sectors where such information was available. The projected emission level of black carbon in 2030 compared to 2017 will decrease by 22% due to decreasing emission levels in the road transport sector. Nevertheless, BC emissions will continue increasing off-road transport, manufacturing & construction and the commercial, residential and institutional sectors, as shown in Figure 84.  00.020.040.060.080.10.120.140.160.180.2Projected PM2.5emissions, kt2017202020252030 177  Figure 84 - Black carbon emission projections, kt   Dimension Decarbonisation  Renewable energy  2030 represented as a RES share in total gross final consumption of energy is presented in Section 2.1.2 of this plan.

RES credits  The projected evolution of RES-share in final energy consumption under the WPM scenario from 2021 to 2040 is provided in Figure 86. An assumption is made whereby all planned policies and measures supporting the deployment of RES are discontinued post-2030. This would imply a significant decline in RES technologies reliant on government support, such as solar PV, biofuels in the transport sector and solar water/heat pump water heaters; this is indicative of the financial barriers which are foreseen to continue to inhibit the deployment of RES in the absence of Government intervention. The consumption of ambient heat from air-to-air heat pumps and electric and plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles would continue to increase post-2030 as their uptake is not dependent on continued government support. The assumption taken for the period post-2030 should not be interpreted as itional policies and measures for the period post-2030 will be outlined and included in the next NECP reporting cycle.  0.9%7.3%7.5%7.1%9.3%11.0%11.5%8.8%10%10.3%0%2%4%6%8%10%12%14%201020162018202020222024202620282030RES share in gross final energy consumption (incl. credits)2020 RES targetWEMWPMRES credits 179  Figure 86 - RES technology consumption under WPM in 2021-2040, GWh   RES Heating & Cooling Air-to-air heat pump technology is projected to have the most significant contribution. The affordability of this technology combined with the continual rise in expectations of thermal comfort ensures sustained growth, also reflecting demographic changes. For instance, the number of heat pumps imported in 2016 and 2017 was above average due to increased activity in the construction sector in response to a significant influx of inwards migration. Split-unit heat pumps in the residential sector are projected to increase from 204,500 at the end of 2017 to 461,000 in 2030 and 556,000 in 2040.  This increase is driven by a growth in the number of households, and the number of units per dwelling. Projections take into account current trends of installation and average unit size, as well as a saturation level with regards to the number of air-to-air units per household, depending on the type and size of dwelling. In the non-residential sector, installation of new heat-pumps is also expected to onomic activity. The construction of new or modernisation of office spaces, hotels, and other commercial spaces will create a sustained demand for the importation of air conditioning systems employing heat pump technology. In all sectors, it is assumed that units will be replaced once they reach their end-of-life. As it is difficult to gather information on the efficiency of new units, a conservative approach is being taken when calculating consumption of ambient heat by assuming a minimum level of 2.7 SPF (SCOPnet)99.  For the Final NECP, Malta also analysed the existing and projected capacity of VRF systems. A conservative approach was taken in this respect whereby VRF systems installed pre-2009 were not taken into account when calculating the contribution of ambient heat from VRF systems due to uncertainty on the share of  units imported pre-2009 having a SCOP level of 2.7, that is, the minimum level set out in Commission Decision 2013/114/EU on calculating renewable energy from heat pumps.                                                             99 This is in line with the default values outlined in Commission Decision 2013/114/EU which established the guidelines for Member States on calculating renewable energy from heat pumps. 01002003004005006007008009001000202120222023202420252026202720282029203020352040GWhRES technologies under WPM, 2021-2040BiofuelsHeat pumpsWaste-to-EnergyBiomassSolar PVSWH/HPWHEV 180  In contrast to air-to-air heat-pumps, solar water heaters (SWH) and heat pump water heaters (HPWH) are unlikely to be installed if grant schemes to promote uptake are not maintained.  Due to their high capital cost (compared to alternatives such as electric boilers) and long payback period, it is assumed that no new or replacement units will be installed without Government intervention. Indeed, in recent years, Malta has observed a downward trend in the sales new SWH installations despite the availability and promotion of grants. Post-2020, Malta is planning to launch new schemes to incentivise the installation of SWH/HPWH in the residential sector, amounting to 800 units/year until 2030.   Biomass imports, used for space heating by a small number of households, is not projected to increase significantly; capital costs for such infrastructure is relatively high, and heating by LPG heaters and heat-pumps is likely to remain the preferred mode of space heating. Bioliquid use in industry in the period 2011-2017 was rather low and is projected to be negligible in the post-2020 period.  Generation of renewable energy in the form of heat from waste treatment is projected to remain largely constant.  It is assumed that waste treatment plants reaching their end-of-life will be replaced by ones having a similar capacity.  RES-Electricity  -to-energy plants is expected to remain largely stable in the projected period, amounting to approximately 14 GWh/year until 2040. However, this will continue to constitute only a small percentage of RES-E in Malta.  The projected capacity of solar PV from 2021-maintain increased penetration of solar PV through financial support schemes and other measures to facilitate uptake was already presented under Section 2.1.2. Under the WPM scenario, solar PV is expected to reach its technical potential of 266 MWp by 2030, as shown in Figure 87. Although not modelled, additional PV capacity post 2030 could be achieved through repowering.  Figure 87 - PV capacity for WEM vs WPM scenarios, 2010-2030, GWh    - 50 100 150 200 250 300PV Capacity (MW)WEMWPM 181  RES-Transport The transport sector is dependent on policies and measures, namely the substitution obligation on fuel importers to achieve the sectoral RES-T target. As the substitution obligation on fuel suppliers does not extend beyond 2030 under continue to import biofuels which are generally more expensive than their fossil fuel counterparts per unit of energy content. Therefore, contribution of biofuels in transport from 2030 onwards is expected to be nil under the WPM scenario. National strategies and action plans in the transport sector are committed to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles in Malta, while the new regulations on CO2 emission standards post-2020 imposed on vehicle manufacturers is expected to result in a higher uptake of electric vehicles in Malta.   Dimension Energy Efficiency Under the WPM scenario, both the primary energy consumption as well as the final energy consumption achieve lower levels as compared to the WEM scenario outlined in Section 4. This is a Figure 88 below shows projections for primary energy consumption and final energy consumption for all sectors. The transport sector will retain the largest share in final energy consumption, remaining at more than half of the total consumption throughout the projected period. Transport is split into road transport and other transport which includes aviation and navigation. Due to the geographical isolation of Malta and the importance of the services sector, including tourism, the potential for decreasing energy consumption in the aviation and inland navigation sectors remain very low. The charts that follow show an in-depth analysis of final energy consumption in each of the sectors.

The increase in the share of electricity in transport is due to a projected increase in the share of electric vehicles in the road transport vehicle fleet. This is a result of the Regulations imposing CO2 emission standards on vehicle manufacturers for passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles post-2020, the impact of which is expected to be reflected in the profile of new vehicles imported in Malta. National strategies and action plans in the transport sector are also expected to encourage and incentivise the uptake of electric vehicles in Malta. The stock of electric and plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles is expected to increase from just above 1,000 in 2020 to almost 26,000 by 2030, comprising 6% of the projected total fleet. 0.0050.00100.00150.00200.00250.002017201820192020202120222023202420252026202720282029203020352040Road Transport, ktoeBiofuelsDieselElectricityPetrol 183  Figure 90 - Final energy consumption in aviation sector under WPM scenario, ktoe  Figure 90 illustrates the projected final energy consumption for aviation under the WPM scenario. The increase in aviation kerosene is in line with the projected increase in tourism, set to continue over the upcoming two decades. This increase is expected to be steeper between 2018 and 2023 and then start to plateau from 2024 onwards.  Figure 91 - Final energy consumption in inland navigation sector, split by fuel under WPM scenario, ktoe  Figure 91 provides projections for final energy consumption under the WPM scenario for navigation by fuel type. In 2020, the Gozo-Valletta fast ferry is set to start operations, leading to a sudden increase in gasoil consumption between 2019 and 2020. The sharp reduction projected to occur between 2026 and 2027 is due to the expected completion of the Malta-Gozo tunnel which will have a direct impact on the number of trips carried out by vessels operating between Malta and Gozo. From 2027 onwards, it is assumed that the current ferries will be substituted with one vessel having 1/6 of the current total vessels' capacity and double today's vessels' fuel efficiency.

Economic Sectors Figure 92 - Final energy consumption in industry, split by fuel under the WPM scenario, ktoe  Figure 92 includes projections for final energy consumption by industry under the WPM scenario. Whilst most fuels are projected to remain largely constant, electricity and gasoil consumption is projected to continue increasing. Figure 93 - Final energy consumption split by fuel for services sector under WPM scenario, ktoe  Figure 93 illustrates projections for final energy consumption under the WPM scenario for the services sector. Electricity consumption in this sector is projected to increase until 2030, along with certain key fuels such as gasoil and LPG; the consumption of other conventional fuels is set to remain largely constant.  0102030405060024681012141620182020202220242026202820302040ktoe electricityktoe fuelIndustry, ktoe Biogas (thermal)DieselFuel OilGasoilLPGKeroseneElectricity0204060801001201401600246810121416182020182020202220242026202820302040ktoe electricityktoe fuelServices, ktoeDieselFuel OilGasoilKeroseneLPGPetrolElectricity 185  Figure 94 - Final energy consumption split by fuel for agriculture sector under WPM scenario, ktoe  Figure 94 shows final energy consumption under the WPM scenario in the agriculture sector. As agricultural output is expected to remain largely constant, no significant change is expected in terms of its energy consumption. A slight decrease is observed over the time horizon, largely owing to the natural replacement of technologies with more efficient ones, owing to availabilities on the market. As energy consumption of this sector is minimal, the effect of any planned measures is expected to be negligible.  Residential Sector Figure 95 - Final energy consumption split by fuel in residential sector under WPM scenario, ktoe  Figure 95 displays projections for final energy consumption under the WPM scenario for the residential sector. The consumption of electricity in this sector is set to continue increasing, owing to a projected increase in the number of dwellings, as a result of population growth, as well as an increase in the average consumption per household. The latter is a result of expected changes in lifestyle and expected thermal comfort, particularly in terms of the installation and use of new devices, such as 0.000.501.001.502.002.5020182020202220242026202820302040ktoeAgriculture, ktoeBiodieselDieselElectricityGasoilKeroseneLPGPetrol02040608010012002468101214161820182020202220242026202820302040ktoe electricityktoe fuelHouseholds, ktoeAmbient heatBiomassGasoilLPGSolar thermalElectricity 186  white appliances and air-to-air heat pumps. The slow decline in solar thermal energy, more evident from 2030 onwards, is a result of a significant number of these units reaching their end-of-life and not being replaced at a sufficiently fast rate until 2030; after 2030, no additional SWH are installed and no replacements take place without policy support.  The increase in ambient heat is a result of a growing installation rate of air-to-   Dimension Energy Security   Power Generation the need for more energy in the coming decade and beyond, which in turn will require more generation capacity and/or imports over the interconnector, as well as a more flexible electricity system. These developments will have a direct impact on how Malta shall continue to ensure the desired level of security of supply. It is also expected that towards the end of the next decade Malta will find it increasingly challenging to meet its electricity demand with the current and projected (under WPM) power generation infrastructure. In these projections, it was assumed that any existing infrastructure reaching its end-of-life before 2040 will be replaced by a system with a similar generation capacity and technical profile. The projected electricity generation by source, split into conventional gas-fired power plants, net imports over the electricity interconnector, renewables and the projected waste-to-energy facility are shown in Figure 96. Figure 96 - Electricity generation by source under the WPM scenario, 2018-2040  Figure 97 portrays the energy mix used to generate electricity in Malta in terms of primary energy consumption under the WPM scenario for 2017 and projections for 2020, 2025 and 2030. The energy mix in 2017, based on natural-gas, electricity imported over the interconnector and renewables will be largely sustained over the projected period. An increased penetration of renewables, i.e. solar photovoltaics, in the electricity generation mix is expected, as well as the introduction of a thermal Waste-to-Energy facility in 2024. 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,000201820192020202120222023202420252026202720282029203020352040GWh/annumElectricity generation by source (WPM)ConventionalNet interconnectorRenewablesWaste 187  Since 2017, local generation plants at the Delimara Power Station are fired by natural gas. Gasoil-fired capacities are available as back-up in case of emergencies (having black-start capabilities), for use during maintenance of main plants and to meet exceptional peak loads. Energy system modelling tools demand needs to be met by the main power plants, electricity imported over the interconnector and renewable/distributed energy sources. Backup plants are not included when determining the order of merit by the dispatch model, and therefore gasoil consumption post-2017 is projected to be zero until the end of the projected period. In practice, there will be situations where the use of gasoil-fired units is required such as in emergency situations or in cases where other sources are not available. However, the amount of gasoil consumed is expected to be negligible. Figure 97 - Energy mix for electricity generation under WPM scenario (%)   Primary Energy Consumption primary energy consumption is shown in Figure 98. Increasing energy demand will lead to higher consumption of natural gas (by power plants).  On the other hand, a decreasing share of oil products in the energy mix is mainly due to the increasing number of electric vehicles on the road which will slowly shift the demand away from petrol and diesel.  WPM projections also show an increasing share of renewables until 2030. Policies and measures focusing on the deployment of RES, outlined in the renewables section of the Plan, have a time-horizon until 2030 as they are expected to contribute to the 2030 RES target as stipulated in the Renewable Energy Directive. No further policies are assumed post-2030 (support for RES is discontinued at end of 2030). projections, whereby the share of renewables after 2030 starts decreasing, due to the discontinuation of the biofuels substitution obligation and the end-of-life of Solar PV and SWH technologies within remaining committed to implement measures for the promotion of RES after 2030 and the long-term goal of decarbonisation.  Policies and measures in the area of RES for the period after 2030 will be included as part of the next NECP cycle.  0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%2017202020252030Energy mix for electricity generation (WPM)Gasoil/fuel oilNatural gasRESElectricity (interconnector)Waste 188  Figure 98 - Projected energy mix as a share in PEC under WPM scenario (%)  Net import dependency  net import dependency is expected to remain high under the WPM in the whole projected period, although decreasing slightly due to the continuous deployment of renewables, which constitute the sole indigenous source of energy.

Natural gas demand will increase to meet the expected growth in electricity demand required to satisfy a thriving economy. Due to the absence of district heating and cooling networks in Malta, the consumption of LPG by the residential sector for heating purposes is assumed to remain stable throughout the projected period as it is expected that new dwellings will be equipped with electric heating systems using heat pump technology. This also reflects the inherent difficulty in offering a viable alternative to households and other users of LPG for cooking purposes, and is one of the major barriers to further decarbonise the heating and cooling sector in Malta. Figure 100 - Projected consumption of imported energy sources (WPM), GWh  The energy market concentration is likely to remain high in the projected period. Due to the size of and the small number of actors and fuel suppliers operating on the Maltese market, the concentration of market suppliers will remain high in Malta.  The projected evolution of primary energy consumption of domestic energy sources is portrayed in Figure 101. The consumption of domestic sources, all of which are renewable except for electricity generation from waste incineration, is expected to grow in the period until 2030 and beyond. The figure shows the expected increase in the consumption of ambient heat, which is linked to the increased deployment of heat pump technology, especially in households. Electricity and heat produced from biogas in existing CHP waste-to-energy plants is expected to remain stable. Solar PVs will remain the largest domestic energy source.   02,0004,0006,0008,00010,00012,0002018201920202021202220232024202520262027202820292030GWh/annumProjected consumption of imported energy sources (WPM), GWhBiofuelsBiomassDieselGasoilFuel oilNatural GasKerosenePetrolAviation KeroseneLPG 190  Figure 101 - Projected consumption of domestic energy sources (WPM), GWh   Dimension Internal Energy Market  As repeated under the relevant sections of the Internal Energy Market dimension, there are no wholesale electricity or gas markets in Malta. Enemalta performs the functions of a DSO and constitutes the sole electricity supplier to final consumers. There is no electricity transmission system in Malta and hence no transmission system operator (TSO). Malta was also granted derogations from the application of provisions on unbundling of DSO, third party access and free choice of supplier under the new Electricity Market Directive (EU) 2019/944. Under the energy system modelling framework used for the development of the NECP, these factors are taken into consideration and assumed to continue to apply throughout the projected period. Projections of electricity interconnectivity, including the indicators of urgency of action are already outlined in Section 2.4.1. of the NECP, while the key relevant indicators for natural gas, such as gas demand and supply, the electricity generation mix and energy mix are included under the Energy Security dimension of the Plan. The sole use of natural gas in Malta is in the power generation sector.  The projected installed power generation capacity by source under the WPM scenario is shown in Figure 102. This amounts to the current and expected operational capacity in Malta, excluding gas-oil fired stand-by capacity. The currently existing power generation capacities running on natural gas at the Delimara Power Station, as well as the stand-by generation capacity running on gas-oil is expected to remain largely the same. In the projected capacities, it is assumed that any power generation facility reach its end of life would be replaced by an equivalent plant.  Solar PV capacity will increase throughout the projected period until 2030, reaching 266 MW under the WPM scenario. Under post-2030 is not continued, therefore RES deployment wanes significantly after 2030. In 2024, it is also expected that the waste incinerator plant comes into operation.   02004006008001,0001,2001,4001,6001,8002018201920202021202220232024202520262027202820292030GWh/annumProjected consumption of domestic energy sources (WPM), GWhAmbient heatBiogas (electricity + heat)Solar PVSolar thermalWaste 191  Figure 102 - Installed capacity by source under WPM scenario (MW), 2018-2040  Projections of peak electricity demand100 and annual gross consumption of electricity, based on an average climatic year101, under both the WEM and WPM scenario are portrayed in Figure 103. It is expected that peak demand, expressed in MW, will continue to increase throughout the projected period, in line with increased population and economic activity, as well as a result of uneven grow rates of certain end-use services, such as the projected increase in electric consumption for space cooling. Likewise, gross electricity consumption will increase in the projected period. As illustrated, peak demand and gross electricity consumption are expected to be lower under the WPM scenario as a result of implementation of policies and measures. Gross electricity consumption under the WPM scenario is projected to be higher than under a WEM scenario from 2035 onwards, primarily as a result of electrification in transport.                                                                    100 Includes final electricity demand, distribution losses and electricity consumed on-site at power station.  101 Projections were made assuming seasonal variations in temperature correspond to the thirty-year average, thus, the impact of yearly changes to temperatures were not taken into account (eg. a warmer than average year will result in an increased demand for space cooling). 0100200300400500600700800900201820192020202120222023202420252026202720282029203020352040MWInstalled Capacity by fuel (WPM)Gas-fired unitsDual-fuelInterconnectorSolar PVWaste incinerator 192  Figure 103 - Peak load (MW) and gross electricity consumption (GWh) under WPM and WEM scenario, 2018-2040  A preliminary assessment of the impact of temperatures on electricity demand was undertaken, with the scope of quantifying the potential increase in hourly peak demand in the case of deviations from the climatic norm, particularly on peak days. Based on an analysis of thirty-years of temperature data, three daily temperature profiles were defined: (i) climatic norm; (ii) high temperatures with a 2.3% probability of occurring in thirty years; and (iii) high temperatures with a 0.1% probability of occurring in thirty years. In Malta, temperature extremes are bound to occur during the summer months.   Should these temperature extremes coincide with the day of annual peak demand (normal year), the hourly peak demand has been estimated to increase by 15-20% (2.3% probability) or up to 30-35% (0.1% probability). Annual estimates are shown in Figure 104. It is to be noted that this is a preliminary assessment which is subject to revisions and updates. A separate assessment of the potential variation in projected peak demand as a result of temperature will also be undertaken through the ongoing Electricity Supply Study.     350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 2,000 2,200 2,400 2,600 2,800 3,000 3,200 3,400 3,600 3,800 4,000201820192020202120222023202420252026202720282029203020352040MWGWhHourly Peak Demand and Gross Electricity Consumption, WEM and WPMWEM Gross electricity consumption (GWh)WPM Gross electricity consumption (GWh)WEM Peak load (MW)WPM Peak load (MW) 193  Figure 104 WPM Annual Peak Demand (MW) under different temperature conditions: (i) normal climate; (ii) extreme temperature with a 2.3% probability; and (iii) extreme temperature with a 0.1% probability.  Projections of electricity imports and exports over the interconnector with Sicily are presented in Table 34. Although the interconnector provides for the option of bi-directional flow, it is expected that Malta would be a net importer of electricity from Italy, with electricity exports reaching only approximately 2-6 GWh/annum, similar to current levels of exports, throughout the period, which can be considered as negligible. The imports of electricity through the interconnector are expected to decrease in 2025 due to the projected commissioning of the gas pipeline whereby, based on the assumed ENTSO-G prices of natural gas, domestic generation of electricity by the gas-fired power plant facilities would be higher in the order of economic merit more frequently than the interconnector (whose prices fluctuate on an hourly basis)(Figure 105). As a result, import volumes over the interconnector in 2030 are projected to be similar to those expected in 2020.

Under the WEM scenario, Malta would be expected to start experiencing challenges meeting its peak demand starting from 2027, while under the WPM scenario Malta would face such difficulties in the period post-2030 (Figure 106). This is due to the additional generation capacity provided by the waste-to-energy incinerator and the deployment of solar PV facilitated by Government policies.  In the case of variations from the climatic norm, shortfalls in meeting the electricity demand are likely to be exacerbated as a result of increased load and these may be experienced earlier than 2027 (WEM scenario) or 2030 (WPM scenario). In the case of high temperature extremes with a 2.3% probability in a thirty-year period occurring on a day of peak electricity demand, it is estimated that there is the potential for slight hourly shortfalls to occur from 2021 onwards. The potential of experiencing shortfalls under a scenario of high temperature extremes with a probability of 0.1% exists from 2018, the first year of modelling (Figure 107).  However, it must be noted that the shortfalls (Figure 106) were projected assuming that back-up capacity (circa 190MW derated gasoil-fired OCGT/CCGT units) is not utilized.  In extreme situations it is also possible to overload the interconnector with an additional 100 MW for short periods.  However, relying on either of these sources to meet peak demand would be in breach of the N-1 system adequacy standard. The Electricity Supply Study will assess possible solutions to tackle any future shortfalls, and shall also validate and update as necessary the methodology used to estimate these peak events.  -10001002003004005006007008009001,000201820192020202120222023202420252026202720282029203020352040GWhElectricity imports and exports (WPM)ExportsImports 195  Figure 106 - Peak electricity demand shortfall expressed in MW and total number of hours, WEM and WPM  Figure 107 - Shortfalls (MW) at peak hours under different temperature conditions: (i) normal climate; (ii) extreme temperature with a 2.3% probability; and (iii) extreme temperature with a 0.1% probability.  In addition to the above, Malta will begin to face potential instances of grid stability issues and imbalances in light of the projected increasing share of renewable production in the electricity generation mix. Figure 108 compares the projected minimum load on Sundays (as the weekday with the lowest hourly peaks) and the concurrent PV generation. Hourly PV generation is expected to make up more than half of the electricity generation during these hours by 2021, increasing to more than there may be instances where Enemalta would have to cater for the unforeseen loss of more than half the generation capacity at certain hours. This would have serious implications on interconnector imbalances, as well as load shifting and the required start-up of conventional generating power plants.   - 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 - 20 40 60 80 100 120Total number of hoursMWShortfalls in MW and hours, WEM and WPMWEM peak shortfall (MW)WPM peak shortfall (MW)WEM hours of shortfallWPM hours of shortfall050100150200250300350201820192020202120222023202420252026202720282029203020352040MWShortfalls at peak hours under different temperature conditionsWEM 2.3% probWPM 2.3% probWEM 0.1% probWPM 0.1% probWEM ShortfallWPM Shortfall 196  Figure 108 - Projected minimum Sunday load and concurrent PV generation under WPM scenario (MW)   Projected development of energy prices   the impact of increased PV installations, the commissioning of the planned waste-to-energy incinerator, and projected natural gas and EU ETS prices.  Figure 109 illustrates the projected trends in electricity prices under the WEM and WPM scenarios, as well as gas prices. The projected increase in wholesale electricity prices in nominal terms is driven by the projections of regional gas prices provided by ENTSO-G at the Italian Virtual Trading Point PSV102. With the commissioning of the Malta-Gela pipeline by 2025, connecting Malta to the Trans-European Gas Network, it is assumed that Malta will be subject to the same wholesale gas prices within the region from 2025 onwards. The projected EU ETS carbon price provided to Member States by the European Commission was incorporated into future wholesale electricity prices based on the efficiency of local generation plants. The effect of the growing EU ETS carbon price becomes more pronounced post-2025 and 2030, when a substantial increase in carbon price is expected (Table 35).  Based on current projections of gas and EU ETS prices, wholesale electricity costs are projected to 2016 2016 0.075/kWh in 2024, after which they would decrease to 2016 0.063/kWh in 2025 should the MTGP pipeline come into operation. A higher penetration of solar PV and the commissioning of a waste-to-energy plant, as expected under the WPM scenario, will result in the wholesale price of electricity 2016 0.060/kWh in 2025 and remaining below the WEM trend throughout the policy period. In 2030, the impact of these policies manifests as a projected 2016 0.003/kWh. The projected wholesale prices should not be considered a forecast.                                                             102 PSV - Punto di scambio virtuale.   - 50.00 100.00 150.00 200.00 250.00 300.00 350.002018201920202021202220232024202520262027202820292030MWMinimum electricity load vs. concurrent PV generationMinimum Sunday loadConcurrent PV generation 197  Figure 109 -  Projected wholesale electricity and gas prices from 2018-2040, EUR (2016)/kWh.

It is expected that the proportion of households with heat pumps will continue increasing until 2040, without the need for any policy intervention incentivizing the deployment of heat pumps in the residential sector. It is also expected that the share of households using air-to-air heat pumps for both cooling and heating purposes will continue increasing.   - 10.00 20.00 30.00 40.00 50.00 60.00 70.00 80.00201820192020202120222023202420252026202720282029203020352040WEMWPMGas 198  Figure 110 - Share of households with heat pumps by end-use and households with no heat pumps under WPM scenario (%)  The typical annual electricity consumption profile of households with heat pumps for both heating and cooling purposes, split by type of end-use is provided in Figure 111. The representative household in this category is expected to consume on average slightly more than 5,000 kWh/year, with space cooling and space heating contributing to 24% and 18% of the total consumption of the household in 2030, respectively. Appliances and lighting will remain the highest consuming end-use for all three types of households. The total electricity consumption of households with heat pumps used for cooling purposes is expected to reach just under 5,000 kWh/year by 2030. Space cooling is expected to be the second most-important end-use for this type of household (Figure 112). Figure 113 shows the electricity consumption of households without heat pumps, which remains in the range between 3,000  3,500 kWh/year per representative household. In this type of household, electricity is used predominantly for lighting & appliances and water heating, while electricity used for space cooling and space heating is almost negligible; it is assumed that space heating in these households is exclusively LPG-based.  0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%201820192020202120222023202420252026202720282029203020352040Share of households with heat pumps (WPM)HH with heat pumps for H&CHH with heat pumps for cooling onlyHH with no heat pumps 199  Figure 111 - Typical annual electricity consumption of households with heat pumps for heating and cooling under WPM (kWh/year)   Figure 112 - Typical annual electricity consumption of households with heat pumps for cooling only under WPM (kWh/yr)   - 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000201820192020202120222023202420252026202720282029203020352040kWh/hh/yearTypical annual electricity consumption of HH with heat pumps for H&C (WPM)Water HeatingSpace HeatingSpace CoolingCookingAppliances & Lighting - 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 4,500 5,000201820192020202120222023202420252026202720282029203020352040kWh/hh/yearTypical annual electricity consumption of HH with heat pumps for cooling only (WPM)Water HeatingSpace HeatingSpace CoolingCookingAppliances & Lighting 200  Figure 113 - Typical annual electricity consumption of households with no heat pumps under WPM (kWh/yr)   Sensitivity analysis As mentioned in the introduction to this section, two sensitivity scenarios were modelled to highlight the potential resulting range of outcomes of key indicators in the case of different exogenous factors, namely: (i) higher than expected levels of energy efficiency of technologies on the market; and (ii) higher than expected rates of electrification.  The first scenario diverges from that outlined in the NECP in its assumption of the rate of overall efficiency increase in all sectors due to exogenous market factors. This was simulated using the   In the industrial and services sector, it was assumed that additional or replaced technologies such as those used for space heating and water heating, as existing stock is likely to be relatively old and therefore the increase gained in efficiency from these new appliances would be greater.  In the residential sector, a gradual increase in the efficiency of all appliances and lighting was assumed from 2018 onwards, reaching a moderate 10% overall increase by 2040.   It was assumed that imports of air-to-air heat pumps from 2021 onwards had a COP of 3.5, increasing to a COP of 4 in 2031. Thassumed by European Commission. This assumption was adopted as the COP of heat-pumps on the Maltese market has tended to be high in recent years and this trend is likely to continue. As a result, the efficiency of the overall stock of heat-pumps in the residential and non-residential sector increases by a factor of 18% by 2030 and 36% by 2040.  - 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000201820192020202120222023202420252026202720282029203020352040kWh/hh/yearTypical annual electricity consumption of HH with no heat pumps (WPM) Water HeatingSpace HeatingCookingAppliances & Lighting 201   Under the WEM and WPM scenarios of the NECP, no improvements in the efficiency of ICE vehicles and EVs were assumed post-2020; the rates of improvement assumed by the European Commission were deemed to be highly optimistic according to national experts. The rates of hybrid vehicles within the fleet was increased by 10%. The stock of vehicles in each category was otherwise kept the same as under the NECP WEM and WPM scenarios. The factors outlined above were introduced in both the WEM and WPM of this sensitivity scenario as the changes are solely a result of a more optimistic view of the market as opposed to the introduction of additional PAMs. The second scenario tested impacts on the energy system as a result of faster rates of electrification for certain end-uses in all sectors, particularly for space heating, water heating and cooking. Projections of the energy system outlined in the NECP are based on a largely constant (and minimal) rate of electrification stemming from national historical trends. A faster shift towards electrification would have implications for a number of key areas of the energy system, and thus was introduced as a sensitivity by adopting the following assumptions:  In the industrial and services sector, it was assumed that additional load from 2018 onwards for space heating, water heating and cooking was met by electric appliances (heat-pumps for space heating and electric boilers for water heating) as opposed to fuel-based technologies. Existing stock reaching its end-of-life was replaced by these electric appliances. Fuel consumption for water heating in laundries, whether in hotels or specific entities such as dry cleaners, was excluded from electrification as it is assumed that current technologies would continue to be used in view of the high temperatures required for such processes.  In the residential sector, the rate of electrification of space heating (from individual gas heaters to heat pumps) and cooking (gas cookers to electric cookers) was assumed to occur at a higher rate than current trends, at an average of 2% per annum. In this scenario and the WEM and WPM of the NECP, it is assumed that all new dwellings exclusively use electric devices (heat pumps or resistance heaters) for space heating.   higher percentage of electric vehicles in the fleet.  The factors outlined above were introduced in both the WEM and WPM of this sensitivity scenario as such changes could result from a combination of unforeseen market factors and behavioural trends.  The sensitivities modelled show there may be a range in terms of the RES-share achieved by 2030, as displayed in Figure 114. However, deviation from the WPM scenario described in the NECP is minimal, with the highest RES-share reaching 12% in 2030 under a scenario of higher efficiency of new technologies.    202  Figure 114 - Share of RES in gross final consumption of energy (GFCoE) under the different sensitivity scenarios, %  Under all three scenarios, the indicative increase in RES-H&C by an annual average of 1.1% is not achieved (Figure 115). As noted in Section 2.1.2, this is a challenging sector to address. This is perhaps further highlighted by Sensitivity Scenario 2; even assuming a faster and more significant shift towards electrification of end-uses such as space heating, water heating and cooking, Malta will still fall short of its indicative trajectory for RES-H&C during the second half of 2021-2030. In particular, the expected and population growth, outstrips the effect of decarbonisation of the heating and cooling sector through increased electrification and thus its effect on RES-H&C. A higher than expected rate of efficiency in new and replaced technologies is not projected to have a significant impact on RES-H&C.    5%6%7%8%9%10%11%12%13%201720202025203020352040RES Share in GFCoE (%)NECP WPMScenario 1 (EFF)Scenario 2 (ELEC)2020 MT Target 203  Figure 115 - The trajectory of increase in RES-H&C under the different sensitivity scenarios, %  Figure 116 shows the peak load under the different sensitivities and it can be noted that both scenarios show a resulting significant impact. Under a scenario with higher levels of efficiency, peak load increases at a slower pace and even decreases slightly after 2030, as a larger portion of the stock of technologies is replaced (through natural turnover) with systems of higher efficiency. As a result, it is projected that there will be no hours where installed generation capacity cannot meet national demand. By contrast, under a scenario of increased electrification, the peak load is projected to be higher than that of the WPM scenario presented in the NECP. Similarly, shortfalls in meeting peak electricity demand will occur earlier and with a higher level of frequency.  It must be noted that these projections do not take into account the effect of deviations from average temperatures. In years when temperatures are cooler or warmer than the climatic average, the additional impact on electricity demand for space heating and cooling can be significant, particularly during the summer months where electricity demand is consistently high as a result of seasonal factors (such as tourism) and high levels of electric space cooling.   Furthermore, the dispatch model does not account for the requirement of maintaining the power system to the desired level of adequacy (N-1) and therefore an assessment to determine when the system is effectively under stress would need to take into account not only any unmet demand but also the available backup capacity, any demand flexibility as well as the adopted system adequacy possible options which shall be considered to ensure that future electricity demand is duly met. 20%22%24%26%28%30%32%34%20202021202220232024202520262027202820292030RES-H&C Trajectory (%)NECP WPMScenario 1 (EFF)Scenario 2 (ELEC)NECP Indicative Target 204  Figure 116 - Projected peak load and number of hours with electricity shortfall under the different sensitivity scenarios    Assessment of policy interactions at least until the last year covered by the plan in particular to establish a robust understanding of the impact of energy efficiency/energy savings policies on the sizing of the energy and to reduce the risk of stranded investment in energy supply Projections indicate that, notwithstanding the planned implementation of a number of energy efficiency measures, energy demand shall continue to rise.  The plan does not envisage investments in additional conventional power plants over the 2021-2030 time window, although more detailed options, and subsequent decisions would be taken once the Electricity Supply Study is completed (Q3/2020), and the capability of the electricity demand model to account for unusual climatic effects (deviating from the normalized year) is validated. Investments in renewables also need to take into the similarity between the local demand profile and that of Sicily, towards which excess electricity could potentially be exported.   The only significant energy supply investment being proposed is the gas pipeline linking Malta to Sicily.  The project is at the design stage, and elements are being included to ensure that the pipeline would be able to cater for the transmission of biogas and alternative gases such as hydrogen in the future.   decarbonisation strategy and provide the basis for conversion of conventional plants to run on green gases.  Assessment of interactions between existing and planned national PAMs and Union climate and energy policy measures  ncluded under the WEM and WPM scenarios are aligned to the Union energy and climate acquis.

This can also be said for energy efficiency policies and the Energy Efficiency Directive, including policy measures in the remaining dimensions, such as obligations stemming out of the Gas Security of Supply Regulation.  Table 36 below shows the relevance of individual policies and measures of the WPM scenario within each Energy Union dimension. Most policies and measures featured under the WPM focus on the decarbonisation dimension largely due to the large scope of this dimension, which comprises of policies falling under the climate acquis, as well as renewable energy.  The energy security, internal energy market, and R&I and competitiveness dimensions all form new reporting obligations under the Energy Union Governance framework. In view of this, it can be said that there is some disparity between the number of measures affecting the decarbonisation and energy efficiency dimensions, and the other three dimensions of the Plan. The R&I dimension is comprised of one policy: E.2.10 Development of R&I Strategy for Energy & Water. It must be noted that this sector-specific strategy in itself entails further sub-measures which will boost R&I in the area of energy and water. This is also relevant for PAM E.2.9 Gas Security of Supply within the Energy such as the risk assessment and other preventive and emergency measures; and policy documents related to decarbonisation such as the T.2.17 National Bicycle Strategy, the Electromobility Plan, or the Waste Management Plan.

In particular, the assessment was designed and approached like a strategic assessment (at plan/scenario level) with the aim to evaluate the integrated/combined responses of the planned measures against a number of additional relevant criteria (economic, social, and environmental impacts) which are not included in other sections of the impact assessment and the NECP. The impact assessment framework has been designed and shared with the different departments/ministries which are owners of the policies and measures included in the NECP and are responsible for the decision-making process. The Ministries are also represented on the Inter-Their specific feedback  207  (collection of data and information) have formed the basis for the comprehensive analysis of the impacts presented in this chapter. The ultimate objective of such assessment is to control and verify the robustness of the package of planned measures against their impacts thus providing analytical evidence of the trade-offs related to adopting and implementing the measures as well as the barriers and complexities with respect the implementation of the planned policies and measures.  Criteria and Metrics The approach in the preparation of the IA has been driven by a number of goals and conditions. In particular, the method employed for the IA aimed:  - to be able to inform local decision makers about relevant impacts of the projected energy/climate system; - to be transparent and unbiased by construction, so to make clear potential benefits and drawbacks of the evolution of the Maltese system, while providing a space for a simple 103wider learning process; - to provide an instrument for further applications through a quantitative-oriented and/or qualitative); - to be fully consistent with the modelling approach used for the analysis and projection of the energy and climate variables in section 4 in terms of overall rationale outlined in the figure below;                                                              103  Step 1WEMAnalysis of the evolution of energy and climate variables under a predefined socio-economic storyline, including the "existing" PaMs only.Step 2WPMAnalysis of the evolution of energy and climate variables under the same predefined socio-economic storyline, including the "planned" PaMs (together with the existing).Step 3IA (WPM)Analysis of the impacts of the evolution of the system under the WPM.Figure 117 - NECP modelling rationale  208  Figure 117 indicates that the WEM and WPM scenarios are modelled in a cascading fashion. No feedback from the IA is explicitly returned to step 2 for redesigning or adjusting the planned measures, or for changing the key underlying assumptions104.   This section provides an -in a manner that identifies the key causalities; the outcomes of the analysis; and the coherence of the IA results with the key elements and assumptions taken to model the WPM scenario.  Impacts and Definitions  Following the NECP template requests and based on the elements emerged during the problem structuring and the discussion with the experts, six criteria have been selected for the impact assessment105.  Some of the identified relevant impacts can be expressed in quantitative terms (out-of-model calculations), while others are more semi-qualitative by nature. The inclusion of semi-qualitative metrics (performances based on expert judgments) provides additional space for a comprehensive evaluation of the causalities.  Table 37 - Impacts Assessed: Economic (ECO), Social (SOC), Environmental (ENV), Others (OTH). Impacts/Criteria Brief Description Theme Economic impact Effect of PAM on the local economy, including business development, competitiveness and inward investment. ECO Technical constraints Level of technical issues associated with PAM, including complexity and skills required for implementation. OTH Social acceptability Acceptability of PAM to local citizens. SOC Legal issues Legal and regulatory issues which may constitute a barrier to the implementation of PAM. OTH Quality of life issues The effect of the PAhealth, comfort, social and environmental impacts. SOC/ENV   Engagement Process   In order to collect all qualitative and quantitative data necessary to carry out an Impact Assessment of the WPM, -specific information related to each criterion outlined in Table 37. This matrix included a section designed to collect data feeding into quantitative metrics and a section designed to collect data feeding into semi-qualitative metrics through a five-points Likert scale.                                                            104 d therefore no GDP / GVAs changes are taken into consideration as response to the simulation of the planned measures. 105 Including quantification of the social cost of carbon was discussed. However, it was determined that the period covered by the plan (short to medium-term) and the geographic scope (national) were incompatible with the period of impact (long term) and geographic area of impact (global).  209   For all the semi-qualitative questions, a short explanation of the metric being assessed was provided to assure improved clarity and transparency. For the semi-qualitative portion of the assessment, short meetings were scheduled with Government ministries responsible for individual PAMs that make up the WPM scenario. These meetings were used to present the Impact Assessment data collection process and to explain how the Impact Assessment matrix should be filled-in. Technical officers were given the opportunity to seek assistance is interpreting and completing the data collection task. Following an iterative process, the final set of PAM-specific data was used to compile an analysis of   Impacts and Metrics  In order to measure the expected impacts of the chosen criteria, the following data was collected:  Economic Impact: a. Quantitative: Job creation (based on annual labour units106) divided into temporary (construction, installations) and permanent (maintenance, operation). b. Semi-Qualitative: Effect of PAM on local economy, incl. business development, competitiveness and inward investment - 5-points metric (from desirable to non-desirable state): Major improvement to economic development / Significant improvement to economic development / Minor improvement to the national economy / No economic impact / Reduced economic development. Technical Constraints: a. Quantitative:  Time-to-realisation (months, years) b. Semi-Qualitative: Two sets of 5-points metrics to define technical constraints will be used (from desirable to non-desirable state):  Level of technical issues associated with PAM measured in terms of complexity of the project: No technical difficulties / Minimal technical difficulties / Some technical concerns / Significant technical issues / Major technical obstacles.  Level of technical issues associated with PAM measured in terms of level of skills required: Only standard skills required/ Mainly standard skills required/A mix of standard and medium skills required/ Significant high skills required/Major high skills required. Social Acceptability:                                                            106 Full-time equivalent (FTE) = number of full-time equivalent workers required per year to fulfil the workload introduced by the PAM. When using FTE a full-time employee working a 40 hour week for the whole year would be equivalent to 1, whereas a person working 20 hours per week would be equivalent to 0.5.  210  a. Semi-Qualitative: Acceptability of PAM to local citizens - 5-points metric (from desirable to non-desirable state): very high societal acceptance / high societal acceptance / Average societal acceptance / Low societal acceptance / Very low societal acceptance.  Legal Issues: a. Semi-Qualitative: Legal and regulatory issues which may constitute a barrier to the implementation of the PAM  5-points metric (from desirable to non-desirable state): No legal issues / Minimum legal issues / Minor legal issues / Significant legal issues / Major legal and regulatory issues. Quality of Life Issues: a. Semi-Qualitative: the effect of the PAM on the citizens' quality of life in terms of health, comfort, social and environmental impacts - 5-points metric (from desirable to non-desirable state): Major quality life improvement / Significant quality life improvement / Minor quality life improvement / No effect on quality of life / Decrease quality of life. Prior to the analysis of results, it is important to clarify that Section 5.2 results apply to a sub-set of Primarily, several PAMs were excluded from this analysis because the current suite of models used to generate Maltsimulate their effect. This allowed Section 5.2 to remain consistent with the results presented in Section 5.1. Table 38 identifies which sub-set of PAMs were modelled.   211    Table 38 - Modelled WPM PAMs PAM number Name of Policy or Measure PAMs modelled in Section 5.1 E.2.1 Financial support schemes for Solar PV  E.2.2 Solar Water Heaters / Heat Pump Water Heater Scheme   E.2.3 Energy efficiency: electricity tariffs   E.2.4 Support Scheme for Services and Industry  E.2.5 Energy Efficient Street Lighting  E.2.6 Projects in primary water network and wastewater treatment plant  E.2.7 Biofuels Substitution Obligation (2021-2030)  Methodological Note In order to model the way decision-makers who were engaged in the analysis perceived the measurement and semi-qualitative scale of the criterion, a so-called preference function was associated to each criterion. The key idea was to transform the collected inputs (performance of the PAM, from 1 to 5) through a normalisation of the preference levels measured from 0 to 1, so to make them additive and calculate an overall (unique) indicator of performance of the PAM against all the criteria.   normalised 0 to 1 preference level:    each criterion).   0.00.20.40.60.81.0P(D)DGAUSSIAN (GENERIC) 212  E.2.8 Acquisition of renewable energy credits from other Member States  C.2.2 WtE Facility   C.2.3 Waste Management Plan 2020 - 2030  T.2.1 Removing traffic bottlenecks and reducing severance between urban communities - Marsa Road Project   T.2.2 Remove traffic bottleneck at Addolorata junction, Marsa  T.2.3 Road and infrastructure projects  T.2.4 Malta - Gozo Tunnel  T.2.5 Implement Public Transport Quality Corridors (PTQC)  T.2.6 Improvement of Ferry Landing Places   T.2.7 Introduction of a low-emission zone (LEZ) in the 'hub'  T.2.8 Smart Parking System for Valletta  T.2.9 Fast passenger ferry link between Malta and Gozo  T.2.10 Free Transport for Youths, Students, and school children  T.2.11 Increase use of Intelligent Transport Systems in traffic management   T.2.12 National bicycle sharing scheme    Key findings This section of the text summarises the key findings of the impact assessment process. It provides a summary of the results and findings of the analysis of semi-qualitative data (economic impact, technical constraints, social acceptability, legal issues, and quality of life) as well as the analysis of quantitative data (economic impact).  Semi-Qualitative Analysis  The Semi-qualitative data was compiled into a single score which encapsulates the overall performance of the package of WPM PAMs in terms of economic, social, environmental, and other impacts.  Figure 118 indicates that average overall ranking. This indicates that although policy-makers should expect some challenges when implementing the measures under the WPM scenario, the overall outlook is positive and that after accounting for potential impact trade-offs, implementing the entire set of PAMs will bring about a net-positive effect.   213  Figure 118 - Overall semi-qualitative score of modelled WPM PAMs  Figure 119 shows a representation of PAM-specific multivariate scores generated through the data collected from the Impact Assessment Matrix where for each criterion, 1 is the best and 5 is the worst score. This figure presents the scores of the best performing and worst performing (critical) PAM and visualise the presence of trade-offs, even for the best performer. Based on the compilation of the multivariant analysis score, the measure which is most likely to have a negative impact is E2.8, the acquisition of renewable energy credits from other Member States to reach and maintain the national RES target as required by the Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC). This representation of collected data allows policy-makers to identify impact trade-offs for each PAM. Taking PAM 2.8 as an example, the data clearly indicates that although the measure is simple to implement due to very low levels of technical complexity, it performs poorly in terms of social acceptability. This reinforces credits as a measure of last resort; opting to prioritise measures which, irrespective of their increased levels of technical or legal complexity, would generate direct net-positive benefits for Malta.    0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%All Modelled PAMsWPM IMPACT -MODELLED PAMS 214   Figure 119 - Individual PAM semi-quantitative score  Figure 120 transfer agreements not be utilised. In fact, only a marginal improvement in performance is achieved. This minor effect is due the impact trade-offs associated with each PAM. Having said that, the removal of PAM 2.8 brings about the highest improvement in the overall score.

In conclusion, the expected benefits from the sub-energy and climate trajectories. Moreover, a dedicated multi-criteria analysis of unmodeled PAMS (Figure 121) shows that their implementation is expected to generate significant benefits in economic, social, and environmental terms with very limited trade-off effects between the six semi-qualitative criteria assessed.  Figure 121 - Semi-Qualitative Score of all Unmodelled WPM PAMs   Quantitative Analysis Macroeconomic projections used as exogenous variables within the energy and climate-system models designed to output results for the WEM and WPM scenarios of this Plan do not explicitly account for the PAMs designed in the WPM scenario but account for the overall (aggregate) trajectories expected. Having said that, government expenditure as a percentage of ex-ante projected GDP is expected to peak around 1.7% in 2021 (see Section 5.3). Therefore, given the low magnitude of this metric, it is reasonable to assume that aggregate macroeconomic projections capture the effect of the WPM.   In order to capture the effect of the WPM on the macroeconomy, the Impact Assessment Matrix was used to collate information on the number of jobs created as a result of implementing the WPM scenario. In terms of job creation, -collected. Officers in charge of individuals PAMs were asked for estimates split into temporary work created, such as construction and installation), and permanent work created, such as operation and maintenance. Although several simplifying assumptions had to be taken in order to determine the number of additional jobs created over the period covered by the NECP, a general finding is that none of the PAMs are expected to generate job losses. Thby higher levels of domestic demand, partially due to higher levels of disposable income resulting from a strong labour market.  Figure 122 indicates that once the initial boom of temporary work associated 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%All Unmodelled PAMsWPM IMPACT -UNMODELLED PAMS 216  with the WPM PAMs levels-off, the WPM is expected to generate approximately 200 permanent jobs (work created in terms of full-time equivalent) towards the end of the upcoming decade.  Figure 122 - WPM Impact on job creation   In order to gauge the effect of the expected increase in jobs created by the planned measures, values presented in Figure 122 were expressed as a percentage of cumulative projections for the year-on-year increase in the number of gainfully employed workers in Malta between 2021-2030 (obtained by a third study, and used as a driver for some sectoral projections). By utilising the cumulative effect of additional jobs created in Malta in the denominator, the metric accounts for the effect of jobs which were created in one period and which remain existing in other periods of the numerator. It is important to note that projections for the number of gainfully employed do not account for part-time workers whereas the data collected through the Impact Assessment Matrix is the full-time equivalent of both full-time and part-time workers. Having said that, this ratio shows that although the initial boom of temporary jobs created by modelled WPM PAMs has a significant effect when compared to the overall jobs created in that year, the overall effect of jobs created vis-à-vis the cumulative jobs created is low.  This provides further justification as to why the macroeconomic indicators feeding into the models used to project the WEM and WPM scenarios were estimated ex-ante rather than iteratively.     Conclusions The analysis of semi-bring about an overall positive effect in terms of impacts on Malta and its citizens; even when accounting for their potential detrimental technical, legal, and environmental effects. In fact, estimates of overall scores is always closer to the ideal positive point of (100%) than to the worst-case scenario (0%)-approach where the impact of the PAMs on job creation is positive for each projected year.

The analysis also indicates that PAMs which could not be captured in the analysis presented in Section 5.2 are in fact the best performers in terms of overall economic, social, and environmental impact. climate performance. However, there is uncertainty as to the scale of this expected improvement over and above what is presented in Section 5.1 of the Plan.     Strategic Environmental Assessment Following the completion of the Draft NECP in December 2018, it was deemed necessary to subject the NECP to a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). In line with Subsidiary Legislation 549.61, which transposes EU Directive 2001/42/EC, an SEA is required when a policy or programme is expected to have a significant effect upon the environment. The Energy & Water Agency, responsible for the system (EWA/TD/2/2019) to carry out the task of conducting the SEA.  The SEA process was initiated in 2019; however, it is not expected to be completed before the second quarter of 2020. Therefore, there is a misalignment between the timeframes for the completion of the Final NECP (end of 2020) and the SEA process, and thus the integration of the outcomes of the SEA in the Final NECP.  At the time of drafting of the Final NECP, the scoping stage of the SEA, including a period of consultation, was completed and work on the environmental assessment was initiated. The finalised SEA report will be made public in line with the SEA Regulations upon completion.  The scoping stage identified the environmental factors to be assessed in relation to the NECP. During the reviewing process, the following key environmental themes were identified:  - Air quality;  - Biodiversity;  - Climate change;  - Cultural heritage - Energy & water; - Human health;  - Landscape;  - Transportation and infrastructure;  - Waste and resource management;  Research will first be conducted to establish an environmental baseline, following which the effects of the NECP policies and measures on the environmental baseline will be assessed qualitatively vis-à-vis the relevant themes. Monitoring schemes will be proposed for each of the environmental factors in the baseline. Public and stakeholder consultation are considered an important element of the SEA process and are given the appropriate attention during the SEA analysis.   218  5.3 OVERVIEW OF INVESTMENT NEEDS  Existing investment flows and forward investment assumptions -qualitative metrics used in Section 5.2 was used to collect information related to the costs borne by Government under a WPM scenario.

Therefore, technical experts responsible for the design and implementation of individual WPM PAMs submitted the following information for each PAM under the WPM:  1) Investment costs (capital expenditure); 2) Operating and maintenance costs (operating expenditure); and 3) Replacement costs (when applicable).  When aggregated, the total undiscounted cost borne by Government amounts to approximately EUR 1.66 billion for the period between 2018 and 2030. Figure 123 depicts how costs would be distributed between 2018 and 2030. When estimating the cost as a percentage of GDP, the expenditure is expected to peak at approximately 1.7% of real GDP in 2021. As portrayed by the figure, costs borne by the Government as a result of the implementation of the package of policies and measures under the WPM is most prevalent during the first 5 years of the next decade. This implies a short-to-medium term implementation period of the WPM scenario, which, however is expected to be supplemented by long-term oriented measures once the  Low Carbon Development Strategy is completed.  Figure 123 - Costs borne by Government under a WPM scenario  0.00%0.20%0.40%0.60%0.80%1.00%1.20%1.40%1.60%1.80%-2018201920202021202220232024202520262027202820292030WPM Costs Borne by Government (2016=100)Undiscounted Investment Cost as a % of GDPUndiscounted Cash Flows 219  Although the graph indicates that Government expenditure will decrease towards the end of the decade, it is important to note that this analysis does not include PAMs which fall under the WEM and which might have a significant impact on Government expenditEuropean gas grid through a pipeline with Italy. Therefore, the cost borne by Government is expected to be significantly higher than what is reported here. Furthermore, PAMs financed privately due to planned concession agreements, such as the Malta-Gozo fixed link, are excluded as these are not costs borne by the Government. It is also envisaged that additional policies and measures would be -2025.   Financial burden as a result of the WPM Scenario  As part of the analysis of investment needs, estimates of the expected direct financial and voluntary financial burden of three energy-related PAMs was carried out (Table 39). This is dependent on the affected agent107 for each PAM. A direct financial burden is a burden imposed on an agent as a result of the PAM while a voluntary burden is a burden which the agent chooses to bear as a result of the PAM.  Malta intends to reach its renewable transport target of 14% by 2030 via the implementation of an obligation on fuel suppliers to blend biofuels with diesel. Since the blending obligation will be reflected in higher fuel prices, this direct financial burden will be borne by the vehicle owners purchasing the fuel. As shown in Table 39, the burden of this measure per vehicle owner per annum is expected to remain rather low, while allowing Malta to meet its obligations under the Renewable Energy Directive.   technology. In the analysed sub-set of PAMs below, the voluntary financial burden was estimated for the deployment of solar PV and solar water heater/heat pump water heaters, technologies which the government is committed to support in the period from 2020 to 2030. The expected costs borne by the residential sector (i.e. household/individual investing in a PV system) and the non-residential sector (i.e. entity investing in a PV system) are expected to maintain a decreasing trend in the projected period, in line with the assumed decreasing CAPEX costs attributed to residential and non-residential PV systems in the upcoming decade. As regards the financial support scheme for Solar Water Heaters/Heat pump Water Heaters, the household/individual investing in such a system will be required to finance 20% of the cost of such a system, which is assumed to be constant until 2030.

This analysis was conducted for both the WEM and WPM scenarios, which provides insight into both absolute and relative investment needs, i.e.  the  (WEM) scenario is considered to be unrealistic due to the assumed expiry of policies and measures and government support in the period post-2020 and does not correspond to the designated scenario for the period post-2020. By virtue, emphasis is placed on quantifying the investment needs of the WPM scenario, which is reflective of the expected evolution in the period until 2030. This analysis does not aim to provide a precise estimate of the total cost associated to technology change, but rather assess the order of magnitude of the expected scenario be carried out. It shall also serve as a signal to policy-makers and investors alike whereby it illustrates the degree of expected investment needs in the various end-use sectors and within pre-defined technology clusters.  A modelling-based approach was adopted to deliver this assessment. It employs directly sectoral bottom-up models to generate the impact assessment to assess current technology stocks and future requirements. The resulting investment needs account for:   Natural replacement rate of existing technologies (i.e. technology substitution);   New stocks due to increasing energy demand;   Policy-driven technology stocks, namely investments driven by specific policies accelerating substitution or technology options; Key assumptions were made regarding technology purchasing costs, average technical lifetime, and in some cases, the annual average load factors. The assumed technology costs are generally in line with European Commission assumptions, however, when available, few adjustments on specific technologies were made (i.e. heat pumps) as to better capture the specificities of the Maltese market. These costs assumptions also consider a certain level of efficiency uptake, which are consistent with projections under the WEM and WPM scenarios. This analysis is limited to energy-related technologies, while other investments, such as planned road infrastructure projects, the gas pipeline project, etc. are not included within the assessment.   221  Reported results assumes that the whole investment take place at the exact time of which a new capacity is installed (overnight). This representation is not in line (hence not fully comparable) with the methodology employed by other modelling analyses, which generally assume annualised investment cash flows, but was preferred as to explicitly track financing requirement streams and identify possible peaks which may constitute barriers to the implementation of planned policies. When relevant, discount rates of 3.5% are applied for discounting. The assumed technology costs are described in more detail under Section 4.1.iv. of the Plan.    Figure 124 - 2016  Total annual investment costs as a result of WEM and WPM scenarios are presented in Figure 124. While the average annual investment costs of the WEM scenario in the period between 2018 and 2030 would amount to 562 mil. 2016, the average estimated investment costs of the WPM scenario in the same period would reach 597 mil. 2016. Annual investment costs are relatively stable throughout the projected period under both scenarios, with the first half of the decade experiencing levels of increased investment.   010020030040050060070020182019202020212022202320242025202620272028202920302031-20352036-20402016millionsInvestments by scenarioWEMWPM 222  Investment costs by sector  Figure 125 - 2016   Figure 125 provides a visual representation of the investments under the WPM scenario split by end-use sectors and the waste management sector. The transport sector is expected to maintain the largest share in terms of estimated investments due to the expected high substitution rate of vehicles is expected that the number of electric vehicles would reach approximately 26,000 by 2030. The average annual investment costs taken up by the transport sector between 2018 and 2030 are estimated at around 343 mil. 2016. In terms of order of magnitude of investment costs, the transport sector is followed by the services and residential sectors, which fall on average just below and just sector and the absence of heavy industry, the annual average investments in industry in the period between 2018 and 2030 are estimated at 36 mil. 2016 per annum. Under the WPM scenario, investments in the waste management sector are envisaged to arise in 2024 as a result of the commissioning of the new waste-to-energy facility.  In 2019 we are estimating higher investment costs due to increased deployment of solar PV systems primarily in the services sector complemented to a lesser extent by additional PV installations in the residential sector. Increased investment in 2030 is an outcome of the installation of new appliances linked to the growth of the services sector, as well as the replacement of an increased number of appliances in the services sector which were installed in 2018 and which have reached the end of their lifetime. This analysis does not take into account the estimation of investment costs related to maintaining the Government, it is foreseeable that investments will be required to ensure system adequacy and to 01002003004005006007002016millionsWPM investments by sectorTransportServicesResidentialIndustryWaste 223  further integrate solar PV systems, which are projected to reach a capacity of 266 MW by 2030. The degree of investment needs covering this aspect would be estimated upon completion of the study.  The investments as a share in the various sectors taken as snapshots in 2020, 2030 and 2040 are illustrated in Figure 126. The share of investment costs in the various sectors will remain largely -scenario and therefore the share of investment in the services and residential sectors starts dwindling due to the lack of uptake of solar water and heat pump water heaters and solar PVs. However, this policies and measures focusing on the period post-2030 will be included in the next NECP cycle.  Figure 126 - Investment shares by sector under the WPM scenario (%)   Additional investments in WPM compared to WEM  Additional investments under the WPM scenario as compared to the WEM are presented per sector in Figure 127. The largest investment corresponds to the development of the Waste-to-energy facility in the period until 2024. In the short-term, investments are also envisaged in the residential, services and industrial sectors, while the element of electrification of the road transport vehicle fleet will be intensified towards the end of the next decade and beyond. Increased investments in the industrial sector in 2021 and subsequent years can be attributed to envisaged projects in the primary water network and wastewater treatment plants carried out by the government water utility company.  53%57%67%21%21%17%15%16%13%5%5%4%6%0%20%40%60%80%100%202020302040Investment share in WPMTransportServicesResidentialIndustryWaste 224  Figure 127 - Additional investments under the WPM scenario  The figure above is supported by the overall discounted investments in the period 2018  2040 between the WEM and the additional investments in the various sectors in the WPM, which is illustrated in Figure 128.

The investment costs for heat pumps are expected to remain significant and largely stable throughout the projected period. Investments in solar PV technologies are expected to be most prevalent in the first half of the next decade, as towards the end of the decade solar PV will begin to reach its technical potential. In line with the expected total investments split by sector, electric vehicles are expected to assume the role of the largest technology type with respect to investment flows.   Figure 129 - WPM investments split by technology type, 2018-2040   Another element of the analysis of investment costs included observing the expected flow of investments by technology clusters. This required pre-defining the technology clusters, which were split into the following four categories:  - Renewables - Energy efficiency  - Electrification  - Waste  The net increased investment costs in the WPM split by technology clusters is reported in Figure 130. The spike of net investments under the energy efficiency cluster in the first examined years is attributed to projects in the primary water network and wastewater treatment, complemented by additional investments for the roll-out of more efficient street lighting, expected to be finalized in 2021. The large investment costs in the waste sector is attributed to the development of the Waste-to-energy facility. Renewable technologies will be driven by the availability of financial support and limited towards the second half of the decade by the assumed technical potential.

Figure 130 - Net increased investment in the WPM scenario split by technology cluster  The exploration of investment costs also enabled the comparison of investments in contrast with specific macroeconomic indicators. The share of investment costs as a percentage oGDP for the WEM and WPM scenarios is presented in Figure 131. While at the beginning of the next decade the share of investments will amount to approximately 5% of GDP, it is projected that this share will have a decreasing trend. This should not be read as a decreasing trend in investments in technology change, but rather as continued annual increase in economic growth throughout the projected period.

The average investment per household in the period 2018-2030 under the WPM scenario is estimated to be at 500 2016. Households are expected to invest in the installation of new and replacement of old appliances. As expected, the average annual investment of a representative household will be higher in the WPM scenario when compared to the WEM. This is a result of the uptake of solar PV technology and solar water and heat pump water heaters. The annual investment in households also includes investments in heat pump technology, which remain constant between the WEM and WPM scenario as their uptake is not policy-driven.   Figure 132 - 2016/household)  In the transport sector, the estimated average investment made by a vehicle owner in the period 2018  2030 under the WPM scenario amounts to almost 850 2016. This level of investment cost in the transport sector is expected to be to a large extent sustained in the projected period, primarily as a result of the expected increase of the number of vehicles.    Sector or market risk factors or barriers in the national or regional context Other than budgetary constraints which might arise when allocating national funds for the implementation of WPM PAMs, no significant risks or barriers are foreseen in terms of the expenditure needed for Government to implement the WPM PAMs. The lack of risks or barriers foreseen should be seen in light of the bottom-up approach Malta has undertaken for the identification of policies and measures falling under the WPM scenario of the NECP. In this sense, the package of WPM measures indicates the projected attained levels in 2030 (in terms of energy consumption, share of renewables, GHG emissions, etc.), as opposed to applying an approach where the setting out of targets in the relevant dimensions would precede the identification of measures to reach this target. Therefore, due to the nature of planned measures which are realistic and considered attainable under current and foreseen conditions, significant barriers or risks posing challenges to their implementation are not expected. Nevertheless, situations might arise where national funding streams would not be sufficient 010020030040050060020182019202020212022202320242025202620272028202920302031-20352036-20402016/householdAnnual investment in householdsWEMWPM 228  to ensure the implementation of certain measures or projects and would need to be complemented by EU funding mechanisms.   With regards to the assumed costs related to the natural rate of changes of technologies, it is important to note that Malta is a technology-taker and is therefore highly dependent on how markets operate without having a significant effect to either the demand or supply side. It is therefore worth noting that although how markets are expected to evolve was factored into the assumptions taken when modelling the WPM scenario, Malta has and foresees no power in manipulating markets related to present and future technologies.  Analysis of additional public finance support or resources to fill identified gaps identified under (ii) Please refer to above.   5.4 IMPACTS OF PLANNED PAMS ON OTHER MEMBER STATES AND REGIONAL COOPERATION measures, described in Section 3, on other Member States is considered to be practically negligible.   The measure under the WPM scenario with the most significant regional importance is the Malta-Italy gas pipeline project. Should Malta become connected to the Trans-European Gas network via the gas pipeline, Malta would be affected by the application of harmonised transmission tariff structures for gas and thus any developments in the European gas market would affect gas and  for the development of the NECP it is assumed that the Malta-Italy gas pipeline is put into operation in 2025. The impacts of the gas pipeline are described in further detail under the Energy Security and Internal Energy Market dimensions of the Plan.   Given that Malta imports electricity from Sicily through the interconnector, the convergence of electricity prices between Sicily and that of the PUN108 would ultimately have an effect on electricity prices in Malta. Furthermore, since the Maltese vertically integrated DSO is responsible for both acquiring electricity from local generation capacity and the electricity market in Sicily as well as balancing the Maltese electricity grid, further deployment of solar PV in Malta will also depend on the possibility for the DSO to bid as close as possible to gate closure time.                                                             108 National Single Price in Italy
