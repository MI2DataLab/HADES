 101  3.4 DIMENSION INTERNAL ENERGY MARKET 3.4.1 Electricity infrastructure  Policies and measures to achieve the targeted level of interconnectivity  As indicated in section 2.4.1. on the national objectives and targets in the area of electricity interconnectivity, the level of interconnectivity is expected to remain well above the EU-wide target of 15%, as required under the Governance Regulation.    Regional cooperation in this area Cooperation between the Maltese and Italian authorities on issues of electricity interconnection has always been very strong. Since 2015, continued coordination between Enemalta and the TSO in Italy has ensured the optimal functioning of the electricity interconnector.    Financing measures in this area at national level, including EU support and use of EU funds There are currently no plans for a second electricity interconnector. However, this is subject to the outcome of an ongoing in-depth Electricity Supply Study commissioned by the Government for the period 2019-2035. There are no electricity transmission systems and electricity transmission system operators in Malta. Enemalta continues to perform the functions of the DSO and that of the sole supplier of electricity to final consumers. Financing measures in the area of electricity infrastructure are handled by the DSO, which in view of its obligation to supply electricity to all consumers allocates internal funding as required. Should the outcome of the aforementioned study suggest the need for an additional electricity interconnector, Malta would consider EU support and the use of EU funds to supplement national funding.  3.4.2 Energy transmission infrastructure  Policies and measures related to elements set out in 2.4.2 The delivery of PCI 5.19, the Malta-Italy gas pipeline, including the regional cooperation aspect and financing measures are described in detail under the Energy Security dimension, in particular in section 3.3.i outlining the policies and measures to reach the objectives and targets established under the Energy Security dimension.    Regional cooperation in this area Currently, regional cooperation on energy transmission infrastructure is mainly related to cooperation on the Gas Pipeline Project, identified as a Project of Common Interest.    102   [If applicable] Financing measures in this area at national level, including EU support and use of EU funds Financing measures for the Gas Pipeline Project are covered under the Energy Security dimension.  3.4.3 Market integration  Policies and measures related to elements set out in 2.4.3  The commissioning of the Malta-Italy gas pipeline shall not only lead to the designation of a gas TSO, but also open the possibility for commercial operators to gain access to natural gas supplies.  As the main client is expected to be the power generation sector, it is being projected that this will drive average local generation costs to align with those prevalent in Sicily/Italy, while taking into account the additional transmission costs. Following ongoing studies with regards to cost-effective options for the deployment of electricity storage units, it is expected that these are supported (either through regulation, financial support measures, or both) to allow for better integration of small-scale renewable, peak shaving and potentially delaying additional generation capacity requirements and contributing towards the desired level of system adequacy. Enemalta is required to apply economic dispatch which would also include aggregation, demand response and storage subject to technical requirements.  Public Service Obligations The electricity distribution system covering Malta remains under the responsibility of one distribution system operator which forms part of a vertically integrated company, Enemalta plc. Enemalta is the only undertaking which is licensed to carry out all the three activities of generation, distribution and supply.    ElectroGas Malta Ltd (EGM) owns and operates the combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) at D4 running on natural gas. The licence to generate electricity from this plant was issued by the Regulator (REWS) to ElectroGas Malta Ltd in 2017. The CCGT plant was constructed as part of a single electricity and natural gas supply project, the scope of which was to enhance the security of supply of electricity, replace inefficient generation plants and switch to natural gas as the main source of local power generation. The project and underlying agreements were subject to an assessment by the European Commission under the Services of General Economic Interest (SGEI) framework which led to the State Aid Decision SA 45779 (2016/NN)  Malta Delimara Gas and Power Energy Project. In its Decision, the European Commission recognised the importance of the project for the security of electricity supply in Malta. The Commission concluded that ElectroGas Malta Ltd has been entrusted with a Public Service Obligation (PSO) to make available electricity and gas to Enemalta when dispatched and nominated by Enemalta, and this entrustment constitutes a SGEI in terms of Article 106 of the Treaty       103  The project involves the following contractual structure:   I. Security of Supply Agreement (SSA)  agreement between the Government of Malta, Enemalta and EGM to ensure that, should any circumstances arise which is capable of leading to the termination of the other contractual agreements, or in the event that Enemalta is unable to continue procuring electricity and/or gas from EGM, the Government will be able to assume  obligations under the relevant supply arrangements.   II. 18-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)  supplying up to 215 MW of energy every hour from D4 CCGT. The PPA is an agreement between EGM and Enemalta, whereby EGM agrees to make available electrical energy to Enemalta, and to supply electrical energy when dispatched by Enemalta. In turn, Enemalta agrees to pay for availability of D4 and the electrical output delivered by EGM to electricity distribution network.  III. 18-year Gas Supply Agreement (GSA)  providing the volume of gas required to meet demand to both D3 and D4. The GSA is an agreement between EGM and Enemalta, whereby EGM agrees to make gas available to Enemalta, and to supply gas to D3 when nominated by Enemalta. In turn, Enemalta agrees to pay for the availability of the LNG facility and the gas delivered by EGM to D3. The GSA agreement will expire on the same date as other transaction agreements, subject to early termination at the option of Enemalta, knoclause, which is designed to safeguard the envisaged future gas interconnector with Sicily.   As part of the agreements, EGM also agrees to procure LNG on a fixed and indexed price basis for consumption as gas in D4 and delivery as gas in D3, and to procure and maintain the FSU for the term.   In 2014, by virtue of a public service agreement and pursuant to Recital 5 and Article 3(2) of Directive the public service obligation (PSO) to provide and maintain a reliable source of supply of electricity in Malta. By contracting with EGM for the supply of gas and electricity to Enemalta, the latter delegated part of its PSOs to EGM in compliance with Article 3(5) of the 1977 Enemalta Act.    As regards the existence of a genuine and clearly defined SGEI, the measures are indispensable to ensure security of supply, which is an objective which justifies PSOs. In particular, the measures guarantee system reliability and adequate generation capacity at all times, as per the N-1 requirements. As regards the amount of compensation for the SGEI, D4 and the Gas facilities will be entirely dedicated for the attainment of the PSO. Payments under the Transaction Agreements constitute the compensation for the provision of the PSO. The PSO has been set up with the aim of ensuring security of supply and contributing to environmental protection and energy affordability.    The European Commission noted that the PSO complied with Article 3(2) of the Electricity Directive based on the following conclusions:    They are justified in the general economic interest as they aim to ensure security of supply, which is specifically recognized in the Directive as a legitimate objective for imposing PSOs in the electricity sector;    They are proportionate since the use of a CCGT plant sourced by a local gas terminal, was found to be the best available option in the context of Malta to ensure security of supply;   They are clearly defined, transparent, non-discriminatory and verifiable;    104   Measures to increase the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production  Thus far, the intermittent nature of renewable electricity sources has been mitigated by relying on the interconnector to provide balancing services and to a lesser extent on local conventional facilities. Distribution system secondary node reinforcements have been implemented to address issues related to system current carrying capacity and voltage drop. However, further installation of renewable energy capacity, particularly large-scale installations, will necessitate the implementation of different mitigating strategies, namely storage, dispatching, and curtailment, which shall be dealt with in the study being commissioned by the Government mentioned previously.  Mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment gulator in 2013 does not discriminate between renewable and conventional generators. Generators less than 5MW are not subject to dispatch (automatically dispatched), although there are no renewable energy installations larger than 5MW in Malta. Enemalta is required to dispatch different generation sources on an economic basis and aim to minimize the overall system costs. Enemalta has invested in dispatch optimisation software to improve its capabilities. No planned measures are envisaged for the establishment of real-time price signals and dynamic prices, largely in view of there being no liquid wholesale market.     [If applicable] Measures to ensure the non-discriminatory participation of RES, demand response and storage, including via aggregation in all energy markets  The legal framework has up to now provided priority dispatch for RES but this shall be aligned with Regulation (EU) 2019/943 on the internal market for electricity. Enemalta is obliged to dispatch electricity based on their order of economic merit, irrespective of whether this is from local generation plants, from the interconnector or from storage.   Policies and measures to protect consumers, especially vulnerable and where applicable energy poor consumers, and to improve the competitiveness and contestability of the retail energy market Vulnerable electricity consumers are catered for within the social policy framework. The Department of Social Policy has established criteria whereby certain categories may be eligible to receive energy benefiinclude families with low income, households on social assistance, persons in receipt of unemployment benefits, pensioners or the disabled.66 In 2017, 20,488 individuals received the energy the number of energy poor households is further described in section 4.5.4.                                                             66 https://socialsecurity.gov.mt/en/Short-Term-Benefits/Pages/Energy-Benefit.aspx  105   Description of measures to enable and develop demand response including those addressing tariffs to support dynamic pricing No planned measures are envisaged for the establishment of real-time price signals and dynamic prices due to the absence of a liquid wholesale electricity market in Malta, limited demand, and relatively flat on-island production costs. Demand-side management is currently limited to differentiated night and day tariffs for non-residential consumers with an annual consumption of 5 GWh (5.5GVAh) or more.  3.4.4 Energy poverty  Policies and measures to achieve the objectives set out in 2.4.4  Strategic Policy for Poverty Reduction and for Social Inclusion 2014-2024, which acknowledges that poverty is multidimensional and thus comes in many forms. To establish a better understanding of poverty, this strategic policy document sets out to present the key indicators of poverty, namely, absolute poverty and relative poverty. One way of measuring the latter is through the material deprivation rate (MDR) which is defined as the number of persons living in households who are not adequately warm in the Energy Poverty Observatory.  povwhether a household can afford the necessary energy services to meet its basic daily living requirementsinability of households to keep their homes adequately warm is the indicator being used to assess the level of energy poverty in Malta.  106  Figure 29 - Percentage of households unable to keep their home adequately warm in Malta compared to EU average, % (Source: Eurostat)   Figure 29 illustrates the great strides made in Malta in recent years with regards to the percentage of households unable to keep their homes adequately warm in winter. This has fallen from its peak of 23.4% in 2013, to 6.6% in 2017, and has been lower than the EU average for the last two consecutive years. This significant decrease is a result of national policies and measures being implemented by the Maltese Government (outlined below) and complemented by the recent substantial reduction in energy bills following the significant investments in energy infrastructure.  The Energy Benefit scheme administered by the Department of Social Security within the Ministry for the Fnational energy policy which also resulted in significant reductions in electricity and water tariffs for both citizens and businesses.  The Eco-reduction scheme under which households that consume either: (i) less than 2 000 electricity units per year in a single household; or (ii) less than 1,750 electricity units per person in a two or more-person household, receive a direct rebate on 15-25% of their electricity bills. This policy incentivises efficiency and lower consumption, while also having a positive effect on the bills of low-income households who fall within the consumption limit.   The provision of professional advice, free-of-charge, by the Energy and Water Agency to vulnerable and low-income households on energy efficient appliances and behaviour.   Financial schemes aimed at reducing energy and water consumption in low-income/vulnerable households through the replacement of old and inefficient appliances, the result of collaboration between the Energy and Water Agency and the LEAP centres within the Foundation for Social Welfare Services.  In line with the requirements of the revised Energy Efficiency Directive, the Governance Regulation and the Electricity Market Directive, efforts in addressing vulnerable and energy poor households will 0.05.010.015.020.025.020102011201220132014201520162017%EUMalta 107  be continued through policies developed in conjunction with the Ministry responsible for Social Services. The energy efficiency schemes and grants addressing this sector of society will continue and will be adapted to increase their effectiveness. In recent years, Malta allocated an annual budget of rable households under which old appliances are replaced by new, more efficient units. Furthermore, plans are being developed to also extend these schemes to include elderly citizens that could also be considered as vulnerable persons. Moreover, the Energy and Water Agency will continue working with Agencies such as LEAP67 to reach out to vulnerable communities through the Home Support scheme.  In this scheme the Agency will be offering services such as households visits where an officer from the Agency will explain the concept of energy and water savings at the household level.
