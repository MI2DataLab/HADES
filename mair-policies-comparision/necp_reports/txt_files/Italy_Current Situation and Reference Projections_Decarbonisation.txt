INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 237   3.7 Dimension decarbonisation   3.7.1 GHG emissions and removals  i. Trends in current GHG emissions and removals in the EU ETS, effort sharing and LULUCF sectors and different energy sectors  The following table summarises the projections of greenhouse gas emissions up to 2040 with the associated European targets, for the ETS and ESD/ESR sectors. For the latter, the emissions target for 2020 is 291.0 Mt CO2eq. Taking the emissions of the scenario into has already been achieved and the emissions forecast for 2020 are in line with the target for 2020 being achieved, but the target for 2030 is some way off from being achieved.

The target for 2025 is merely indicative, since it will depend on the emission levels actually recorded during the 2016-2018 period. Emissions of NF3 are included in the post-2020 ESD/ESR targets.  ii. Projections of sectoral developments with existing national and Union policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)  On the basis of the macro-economic parameters mentioned above, the TIMES model used calculated demand for energy and CO2 emissions, while the other greenhouse gas and emissions from non-energy sectors are calculated based on the estimated changes of the associated activities, with average emission factors. Emissions up to 2015 are to be inventoried as having been notified to the UNFCCC in 2017. The data show a marked reduction in emissions from 2005 up to 2015, and a subsequent decrease at more modest reduction rates. The reduction in emissions is down to many factors, some being structural and others contingent. The most important of these are: - a greater-than-expected renewable energy share in primary consumptions, following the strong development of photovoltaic energy production and the increased use of biomass for heating; - an increase in the efficiency of electricity generation, with a large number of combined-cycle (and in most cases cogeneration) power plants fuelled by natural gas entering into operation, together with the gradual phasing-out of obsolete steam plants powered by fuel oil; - a reduction in transport consumption levels, owing to the joint initiative for raising INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 238   fuel prices and low levels of activity; - a rapid reduction in final consumption levels in the industrial sector, following the financial crisis and the structural changes made to manufacturing activities; - an increase in the efficiency of the items of equipment actually using the energy generated. The following table and graph show how the scenario is predicted to evolve up to 2040. Emissions are divided by sector.

[Source: ISPRA]  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 239    The sectoral analysis for the 2015-2030 period shows that:   there is a significant reduction in emissions from the energy industries (down 23%), mainly due to the reduction in emissions from the electricity sector. The emissions produced by the latter sector are directly linked to the production of electricity from fossil fuels. The significant rise in electricity production from renewable sources and the increase in thermoelectric efficiency since 2008 have played a part in reducing emissions, which has also contributed significantly to the increase in thermoelectric efficiency. The projected reduction in emissions over the years ahead is due to a further increase in thermoelectric efficiency and in the share of energy from renewable sources, and to an increase in the share of fuels containing low levels of carbon;  in the transport sector, the projections show a reduction in emissions of 9% following the implementation of the measures in force, despite there being an increase in transport demand;  in the civil sector, emissions are down by 11%, mainly due to increased efficiency; the increase in emissions recorded over the past few years is essentially down to the expansion of the building stock in the tertiary and residential sector (second and third homes); in addition, the increase in the average size of homes and the greater demand for heating have both played a decisive role. The policies planned for the years ahead are expected to have a significant impact for reducing emissions;  emissions from the industrial sector, concerning both energy consumption and processes, decreased dramatically between 2005 and 2015 (down 36%), due in part to the financial crisis and in part to the structural changes made to the activities and the greater efficiency of manufacturing processes, the effects of which are also clear as regards the reduction in emissions anticipated over the years ahead. Indeed, emissions from the industrial sector are expected to remain fairly stable over the 2015-2030 period, despite an upturn in production levels;  emissions from waste are expected to reduce the most between 2015 and 2030 (down 31%), mainly due to less waste being sent to landfill sites.  agriculture is the sector showing the most stable progress, with the measures already put in place not having a great impact on the sector, the total emissions of which are forecast to decrease by around 8% over the period under examination, although increases might be   The following table shows emissions by type of gas in terms of CO2eq. CO2 constitutes around 84% of all emissions. It is worth pointing out that, although other gases have played a part in reducing overall emissions, their role has tended to gradually increase over time, passing from 15% in 2005 to more than 17% by 2015. As has already been noted, the reduction in methane is due first and foremost to the waste sector. The reduction in HFC and SF6 emissions is mainly down to the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 on F-gases.

Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in each of these sectors  The following table shows how the overall RES target (share of gross final consumption of energy covered by renewable sources) has evolved over time, calculated by applying the criteria set by the RED I. In 2017, energy generated from RES increased to 22 Mtoe, giving a share of total gross final consumption of 18.3%; the contribution from the electricity sector increased to 44% of total RES, while those of the thermal sector and the transport sector stood respectively at 51% and 5%.

The greater RES contribution was provided by the consumption of solid biomass (mainly firewood and pellets used in the residential sector) and the use in winter of heat pumps.

In 2017, the sectoral consumption of energy from RES thus calculated amounted to slightly less than 2 Mtoe; the associated impact on total consumptions neared 6.5%.

Indicative projections of development with existing policies for the year 2030 (with an outlook to the year 2040)  In terms of RES development during the 2020-2040 period, the following tables show, respectively, how the current policies concerning the total RES target, the RES-E target, the RES-H target and the RES-T target will evolve over time. According to the trends up to 2030, RES will contribute 21.1% of final gross energy consumption, three percentage points up from the historical data for 2017 (18.3%). As regards the outlook to 2040, the share in RES is expected to increase by a further percentage point to 22.2%.

Analysing the individual sources, the significant residual potential that is technically and financially exploitable and the reduction in costs in the photovoltaic and wind sectors also point towards progress being made to current policies in respect of those technologies. Still within the same time span, a contained increase in the additional geothermal and hydroelectric power is expected, along with a slight drop in bioenergies, not including bioliquids for which, conversely, a gradual rolling-out of power plants for incentive purposes is anticipated. As regards the outlook to 2040, the share in RES-E is expected to increase up to 40.6%.

In 2030, the thermal sector will make use of thermal solar and geothermal plants and bioenergies32 (for a total of 7.8 Mtoe), heat pumps (3.5 Mtoe) and cogenerated heat produced from RES (0.7 Mtoe). In 2030, the share in RES-H will reach 23.8%, as opposed to 20.1% in 2017. As regards the outlook to 2040, the share in RES-H is expected to increase up to 25.4%.

A RES share of 11.3% is expected to be reached in the transport sector in 2030 (calculated according to the criteria laid down by the RED II), which may be put down to an increased consumption of both biofuels and electricity by road and rail transport. As regards the outlook to 2040, the share in RES-T is expected to increase up to 12.6%.                                                               32 Including biomethane and biogas
