4.4. Dimension energy security 4.4.1. National energy resources Hard coal The documented anticipated economic resources (Polish zasoby bilansowe) of hard coal totalled 58,578 million tonnes as at 31 December 2016. Nearly three-fourths of all resources are formed by thermal coals, one-fourth by coking coal, with other types of coal accounting for approx. 2% of all coal resources. At 22,222 million tonnes,  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  51  exploited deposits currently account for 37.9% of anticipated economic resources. Economic resources (Polish ) totalled 2,983 million tonnes. According to data from the Polish Geological Institute, hard coal production amounted to 66.5 million tonnes in 201626. Despite the fact that hard coal mining has been declining since the beginning of the 1990s (figure below), no restrictions in the supply of this raw material are expected in the present analysis. At the 2016 production level, economic resources will last for approx. 40 years. It is assumed that future demand will, insofar as possible, be met by domestic coal production and supplemented by imports. Due to the location of resources in areas free of armed and political conflicts, high efficiency of the logistic network, options for opening new deposits and the availability of highly developed mining technologies, hard coal appears set to remain available in the long term and its price is expected to be stable.

Natural gas According to data from the Polish Geological Institute, the recoverable resources of natural gas totalled 120 bcm as at 31 December 2016. Total recoverable resources of developed natural gas fields amounted to 98 bcm, or 82% of the total volume of recoverable resources. Economic resources of natural gas amounted to 52 bcm in 2016.

Source: Polish Geological Institute Zasoby [mld m3] Resources [bcm] Wydobycie [mld m3] Mining [bcm] Zasoby Resources Wydobycie Production Domestic natural gas resources are an important complement to gas imports from the point of view of security of supply, but their significance is limited for the economy as a whole. The domestic demand for natural gas is largely met by supplies from abroad. The total imports of natural gas to Poland in 2016 amounted to 13.9 bcm [157,086 GWh], including: - imports of natural gas from the East (including through the Yamal-Europe pipeline)  10.3 bcm [116,671 GWh] (74.3% of total imports); - intra-Community acquisition of natural gas from Germany  2.5 bcm [28,299 GWh] (18% of total imports);  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  54  - intracommunity acquisition of natural gas from the Czech Republic  0.049 bcm [55.5 GWh] (0.00035% of total imports); - imports of natural gas from Qatar  0.963 mcm [11,134 GWh] (7.1% of total imports); - gas imports from Norway  0.078 bcm [927 GWh] (0.59% of total imports). Exports of natural gas from Poland in 2016 totalled 839.3 mcm [9,248 GWh]. Due to the unpromising results of the exploration of unconventional gas deposits, the broader use of unconventional gas is not included in the forecast. The analysis prepared by the Polish Geological Institute considers the range of 346-768 bcm to be the most likely for shale gas resources in Poland. At the current stage of development of shale gas production technology, economic considerations are a limiting factor. Nuclear fuel these deposits is not excluded in the future. On the global market, nuclear fuel is widely available (this includes both uranium ore and uranium hexafluoride conversion capacity, as well as the capacity of plants specialising in the enrichment and production of reactor fuel elements). Therefore, it is assumed that nuclear fuel resources would not limit the pace of development of nuclear power over the timescale of the forecast and that the price of nuclear fuel would remain relatively stable. Biomass It is assumed that the supply of this raw material will not limit the development of technologies based on biomass fuels, although in reality such a situation cannot be entirely ruled out, as the development of this sector in the country is conditioned by, and closely linked to, the operation of a specific support system. Biomass in Poland has the greatest technical potential from among all domestic renewable energy sources. The annual technical potential comprising forest solid biomass, biomass from agriculture (energy crops and plant waste) and food processing, and biogas is estimated at approx. 610 PJ in 2020 and 910 PJ in 203027. The actual economic potential of biomass in Poland is estimated at over 600 PJ in 2020 and the market potential at 533.1 PJ (according to data from the Renewable Energy Institute)28. The market potential consists of the following types of biomass: - solid waste 149,338 TJ, - wet waste (for biogas) 72,609 TJ, - firewood 24,452 TJ, - energy crops 286,718 TJ. Agricultural biogas The domestic wet waste biomass resources of agricultural origin, which can be used locally for electricity production in agricultural biogas plants, will support production of approx. 4.4 TWh in 2030 and up to 5.1 TWh in 2040. The domestic wet biomass resources are also sufficient to enable a significant development of agricultural biogas plants producing thermal energy in cogeneration. The capacity for heat production towards 2030 is estimated at 45 PJ and at 105 PJ in 204029.                                             27 wych technicznie i ekonomicznie do wykorzystania w celu produkcji energii elektrycznej [Assessment of the renewable energy resources technically and economically feasible for electricity production].

Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  55  Other biogas The potential for the use of biogas from landfills and sewage treatment plants in electricity production is estimated at approx. 1.3 TWh by 2030 and 1.7 TWh by 2040. The potential of other biogas for heat cogeneration is estimated at 6.2 PJ by 2030 and 8.2 PJ by 204038. Geothermal energy Theoretically, geothermal energy resources in Poland are unlimited, but there are relatively few locations where the use of geothermal energy makes economic sense. The capacity for production of heat from installations other than heat pumps using deep rock heat was assessed taking into account significant economic limitations in their use. This capacity was determined at 45 PJ in 2030 and 105 PJ in 2040. Heat pumps As with geothermal energy, the use of heat pumps for thermal production is primarily limited by economic considerations. This study assumes that the potential for use of heat pumps is high at 45 PJ in 2030 and 105 PJ in 2040. However, it will be very difficult and, above all, costly to exploit this potential, and subsidies will be the main driver of the development of this technology in the country30. Water Hydropower resources in Poland are estimated at approx. 12 TWh31 per year (technical resources), of which only 2.1 TWh per year is currently used. The utilisation rate of these resources is much lower than in a country with a similar geomorphological structure such as Germany, which uses 19 TWh of its annual capacity of 25 TWh. Wind GW of onshore wind farm capacity. However, the assessment of actual potential must take into account the existence of systemic, social, environmental, infrastructure and regulatory constraints. The actual potential for the construction of offshore wind farms, as determined by EY, is based on the opportunities existing at the Polish Baltic coast and the analysis of the pace of and prospects for the development of wind technology in other countries. According to these data, the actual potential of wind units will be approx. 5 GW by 2030 and 10 GW by 204032. Solar On the basis of an analysis of the development of large PV installations in other European countries and the observed cost trends, the actual potential for the development of this technology is estimated at 5 GW by 2030 and 10 GW by 2040. A larger potential for PV technologies exists in relation to small rooftop installations. According to EY's estimates, it is approx. 7 GW by 2030 and 12.5 GW in 204033. National energy mix 2005-2016 Primary energy production has remained at approx. 66-67 Mtoe since 2010. A significant drop in production, by over 10%, occurred in 2005-2010. Primary energy production is dominated by coal, but its output is decreasing faster than total primary energy production. The share of coal in total primary energy production fell from 88% in 2005 to 78% in 2016. Renewable energy is the only group of energy carriers where production increased                                             30 Ibidem. 31 Data from the Polish Association for Small Hydropower Development. 32 Ibidem. 33 Ibidem.  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  56  significantly between 2005 and 2016. RES production doubled in that period, and its share in total primary energy production increased from 6% in 2005 to 14% in 2016. Net energy imports doubled between 2005 and 2010 and remained stable, at approx. 30 Mtoe, between 2010 and 2016. Its increase was significantly influenced both by an increase in imports of oil and liquid fuels (by over 15%) and natural gas (by 35%) and by a decrease in hard coal exports. The import/export balance of hard coal has been close to zero after 2010, but Poland remains a net exporter of solid fuels thanks to high coke exports. Gross inland energy consumption varied between 92 and 101 Mtoe from 2005 to 2016, the main reasons for this volatility being: the uneven GDP growth, energy efficiency improvements and changing weather conditions. As far as the breakdown of gross inland energy consumption in 2005-2016 is concerned, there was an increase in the share of liquid fuels (from 24% to 27%), natural gas (from 13 to 15%) and renewable energy (from 5 to 9%). On the other hand, the share of solid fuels fell from 59% to 49% over that period. Final energy consumption fluctuated in the period of 2005-2016, similarly to gross inland consumption, and its share in gross consumption has been approx. 66% in recent years. Poland's dependency on energy imports increased significantly between 2005 and 2010, with net imports doubling, and has remained at a level close to 30% since 2010. Import dependency is highest for liquid fuels (approx. 97%  stable over multiple years) and high for natural gas (over 70%  a mildly growing trend). Overall import dependency is reduced by significant net exports of solid fuels, mainly coke. Table 44.

Inland production by fuel type The table below illustrates the volume of domestic supply of the particular fuels and energy carriers until 2040. The following conclusions can be drawn from the obtained results: - Hard coal production (excluding coking coal) declines moderately between 2015 and 2030 from 32.1 Mtoe to 30.6 Mtoe (or 59.2 million tonnes and 56.4 million tonnes, respectively, in natural units). Between 2030 and 2040, the expected level of hard coal production is significantly reduced to 21.8 Mtoe (40.1 million tonnes). The downward trend is associated with the decreased demand across the sectors of the national economy. The decommissioning of end-of-life generation units is expected to accelerate after 2030. The construction of new coal-fired units (except for those in relation to which the investment decision has already been made) is not economically justified in view of the increasing prices of CO2 emission allowances, ever tighter environmental requirements anfitted with CCS can only be competitive if prices of CO2 emission allowances are high, i.e. over EUR 50/t. The decrease in demand for coal in industry will be mainly due to the modernisation of production processes. In the household and services sectors, as part of anti-smog efforts, inefficient manually fed boilers will gradually be replaced by boilers meeting higher environmental standards (high energy conversion efficiency) and coal-based technologies will be replaced by more environmentally friendly ones (RES, gas, district heating). - Coking coal production will remain stable at approx. 10 Mtoe (and is closely related to coke production). In view of the volatility of the coke market, the actual level of production may deviate considerably from the forecasts. - The supply of lignite will decrease considerably after 2030. It is assumed that open-that no new units will be built other than the one already under construction in Turów (450 MW). The development of new lignite open-pit mines that enable the commissioning of new units before 2040 (similarly to hard coal) does not turn out to be competitive in relation to other sources, such as nuclear power, RES or gas. - The level of crude oil production will remain stable (relatively low  at approx. 1 Mtoe), as will domestic natural gas production (approx. 3.6 Mtoe or 5-5.3 bcm). - The inland production of biofuels (mainly first-generation HVO/COHVO) is expected to increase, driven by  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  58  the growing demand in the transport sector and the fact that, thanks to their properties, these substances can replace conventional fuels without any significant technical constraints. - In 2015-2040, solid biomass production is expected to increase by approx. 34%, a moderate growth that builds to a limited extent on the domestic potential. The demand for biomass is bound to grow in all sectors. Along with an increase in prices of CO2 emission allowances, the profitability of biomass utilisation in dedicated boilers, hybrid systems and installations co-firing coal will be increasing in the power and heating sectors. In the household and services sectors, intensified use of biomass will be associated with the replacement of outmoded coal-burning boilers with modern pellet-fired ones. - Uranium ore mining and processing into nuclear fuel is not expected.

Net imports by fuel type The import-export balance plays an important role in determining the ways of meeting demand and selecting the electricity production mix, as well as influencing the price of this carrier on the wholesale market. Since 2014, a clear upward trend in the share of electricity imports has been observable in the National Power System (NPS). This is a result of the growing import and export capacities and intensive subsidisation of RES, which are unstable energy sources, in neighbouring countries. By around 2023, Poland is expected to become a net importer of electricity, unless extraordinary circumstances arise that will change the current price relationships at interconnections. The analysis shows that net imports will total approx. 129 ktoe (1.5 TWh) in or around 2020. The planned completion of the decommissioning of German nuclear power plants in 2023 and the general reduction in overcapacity in Central and Western Europe as a result of the shutdown and replacement of conventional energy sources will drive up prices on European commissioning of new investment projects (Opole, Jaworzbalance of electricity imports and exports is close to zero in the remaining period of the forecast. However, it must be emphasised that the accurate determination of future volumes of exchange at existing and planned interconnections is bound to be characterised by high uncertainty, especially as regards the anticipated electricity prices on wholesale markets in neighbouring countries, which determine the directions and volume of transboundary trade, given that they are largely dependent on weather conditions, the legislative and regulatory environment, and many other fortuitous factors.

The challenge in the coming years will be to diversify the sources of supply of this raw material in order to reduce dependence on supplies from a single direction. The situation is similar for oil, where almost 100% of imports comes from a single supplier (from outside the EU). Options for the diversification of oil supplies are much more limited.

Main sources of imports (countries) With respect to the main sources of imports, use is made of an expert approach that is based on an analysis of current directions of supply and prospects for the emergence of new sources. Therefore, no significant changes in the key sources of imports are expected in relation to the majority of fuels and energy carriers under analysis (directions of imports are largely determined by global developments, which are difficult to predict). The exception is the supply of naturstrategy seeks to diversify gas supplies through the completion of an investment project facilitating the transport of gas from Norway and the intensification of purchases of liquefied gas from the United States.

Gross inland fuel and energy consumption The gross inland consumption of the particular fuels and energy carriers are presented in the table below34. The following conclusions can be drawn from the presented data: - Inland electricity consumption will increase by 29% between 2015-2030 and by 34% between 2015-2040. The average annual growth rate for this category is 1.2% over the entire forecast period. Electricity consumption will increase in all sectors. Services, as the fastest growing sector of the economy, will be characterised by the highest rate of growth of electricity consumption. Saturation with appliances, including air conditioning units, will be increasing along with the development of commercial services. - The moderate increase in the consumption of electricity by households is a consequence of the growing level of welfare of the society (as measured by disposable income), the growing number of dwellings and the increasing saturation and usage of appliances, although the fact that appliances use less and less electricity will slow down the pace at which energy consumption is increasing. - The increase in electricity consumption in industry will be mainly driven by the growth in production of industrial products, and by the modernisation and mechanisation of manufacturing plants. - More electricity is also expected to be utilised in transport. In rail transport, this will be mainly driven by improvements in the quality of rail passenger transport and its growing popularity, while in road transport by the development of e-mobility. The forecast assumes that there will be approx. 870,000 electric vehicles on                                             34 Gross inland fuel and energy consumption is calculated according to the following algorithm: (+) Final consumption (+) Consumption in the electricity sector (+) Consumption in the energy transformation sector (-) Transmission and distribution losses (+/-) Statistical differences (=) Gross inland energy consumption  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  61  Polish roads by 2030 and approx. 2,400,000 by 2040, consuming respectively 1.2 TWh and 3.0 TWh.

The decline in coal consumption in the power and heating sectors will accelerate considerably in 2030-2040. - The consumption of oil and petroleum products is expected to increase further. Economic growth is the driving force behind the growth of demand in this sector. On the other hand, this growth is hampered by efficiency improvements resulting from technological progress, measures taken to improve the organisation of transport services (implementation of integrated traffic management systems, intermodality, collective transport), and the development of transport infrastructure (motorway and expressway networks). - A further gradual increase is anticipated in demand for renewable energy carriers, such as biomass, biogas, biofuels and renewable municipal and industrial waste.

Electricity and heat production Table 53 and Figure 29 show data on the gross electricity and district heat production in Poland. As shown by the results of projections, domestic electricity production is expected to grow from 164.9 TWh in 2015 to 204.9 TWh in 2030 and to 220.9 TWh in 2040. The percentage increase is 24% in 2015-2030 and 34% in 2015-2040. On the other hand, the domestic production of district heating will increase from 281.4 PJ in 2015 to 329.6 PJ in 2040, a growth of 17% in the period under consideration. The results of projections are based on the assumption that measures to connect new customers to district heating will be stepped up and that the thermal upgrading of buildings will proceed at a moderate pace.

Gross electricity generation by fuel Electricity generation by fuel is presented in Table 55 and Figure 30. An analysis of the directions of development of the national electric power sector suggests gradual shifts in the energy mix as a result of nergy policies. The development of renewable energy sources (enforced by administrative measures) and the obligation of operators of coal-fired plants to purchase CO2 emission allowances under the ETS will result in steadily decreasing the share of coal-fired plants in the energy mix. The share of coal-based units in the generation structure is expected to decrease from approx. 80% in 2015 to approx. 69% in 2030 and approx. 31% in 2040. Between 2030 and 2040, the share of coal-fired units in total electricity generation will, therefore, be rapidly decreasing. This process will be mainly driven by the decommissioning of coal-fired units (determined on the basis of declarations of electricity undertakings) and the decreasing operating time of coal-fired units, amongst others as a result of an expected increase in the popularity of low-carbon sources over the period. Nevertheless, despite the high decline in their share, coal-fired power plants will remain an important producer of electricity in the country. This can be attributed, to a large extent, to the production units currently under construction in hare of gas units (the new units are mainly high-efficiency steam-gas units) in the production structure will increase from 3.9% in 2015 to approx. will enforce the implementation of new low-carbon sources, a large proportion of which will be non-controllable intermittent renewable sources (wind farms and solar farms). The anticipated existence of such generation sources will necessitate investments in flexible (e.g. gas) sources, energy storage, etc., that will be necessary for the sources to be integrated with the power system. The share of RES in net electricity generation will double during the analysed period. The development of nuclear power in Poland plays a central role in the decarbonisation policy. The first nuclear power plant unit is expected to be put into operation between 2031 and 2035 and another two between 2036 and 2040. Decarbonisation of the Polish energy sector will be a long-lasting and very costly process that will have to be spread over time in such a way as to mitigate the resulting economic and social impacts, including a risk of deepening the problem of energy poverty in the country. It should be emphasised that the strong development of nuclear, gas and RES power generation anticipated in 2030-2040 is to a large extent dependent on the cost of CO2 emission allowances, not only in a given period, n order to avoid the distortion of  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  63  analysis results in relation to investment decisions made towards the end of the modelling period, the horizon analysed under the MESSAGE model was extended to 205035.

Electricity generation capacity by source The results of the analyses demonstrate that far-reaching changes in the structure of electricity generation in Poland should be expected in 2040. (Table 55 and Figure 31). The net generating power of electricity sources will increase from 37.3 GW in 2015 to approx. 51 GW in 2040 (an increase of approx. 37%). The role of coal-fueled utility power plants will be significantly diminished, as reflected by their reduced share in net installed capacity. The share of renewable sources and natural gas-fueled units will increase significantly. The first nuclear power unit with a capacity of approx. 1,500 MW will be added to the production capacity structure between 2030 and 2035. A further two units with a total capacity of 3,000 MWnet will be constructed between 2035 and 2040. Table 53.
