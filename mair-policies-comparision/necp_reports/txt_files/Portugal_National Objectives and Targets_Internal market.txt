2.4. Dimension Internal Energy Market 2.4.1. Electricity interconnectivity  Electricity interconnectivity is essential to ensure the better functioning and development of the internal energy market, along with improvements in managing and digitalising the electricity system and making it more flexible. Interconnectivity ensures both increased competition, stability in energy markets as well as the integration of markets. In its conclusions of 23 and 24 October 2014, the European Council approved a Climate and Energy Framework for 2030 for the Union, based on four main goals, including a goal of 15% for electricity interconnections. This goal was set out in the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and Portugal is committed to achieving it. Regional cooperation is similarly relevant in this context and will be reinforced to promote closer ties among Member States, with special emphasis on Spain and France, with a view to monitoring and assessing interconnection projects that meet the need for interconnectivity in energy markets and systems.  Table 16 - Portuguese target for electricity interconnections  2020 2030 Target for electricity interconnections 10% 15%   2.4.2. Energy transmission infrastructure  i. Key national objectives for electricity and gas transmission infrastructure, and if required, modernisation projects that are necessary for the achievement of objectives and targets under any of the five dimensions of the Energy Union Strategy  To meet European commitments, based on national energy policy with respect to internal market integration and supply security, and with the aim of achieving more robust, efficient and interconnected national electricity and gas systems, Portugal is planning to develop the respective transmission and distribution networks. Currently underway are projects which contribute to this goal which are recognised by the European Commission as having a relevant role in internal market integration, supply security and also with respect to economic sustainability. Key gas transmission infrastructure projects (to be implemented by 2030) -following projects are planned:  Interconnection PT-ES (3rd interconnection)  1st phase 47 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 2. objectives and targets   The Project of Common Interest (PCI) for the gas sector relating to the Celorico  Vale de Frades gas pipeline, first stage of the future 3rd interconnection between Portugal and Spain, is directly dependent on the completion st stage of the future interconnection between Spain and France. It should be noted that the abovementioned interconnection projects (Portugal  Spain and Spain - France) are also defined in the Madrid Declaration Implementation Plan. Key electricity transmission infrastructure projects (to be implemented by 2030) For 2021-2030, the following projects are planned in Portugal in the -South Electricity   2.16 Total internal lines o  o 2.16.3 Internal line between Vieira d  2.17 Portugal-Spain Interconnection: o Portugal  Spain interconnection between Beariz  Fontefría (ES), Fontefria (ES)  Ponte de Lima (PT) (formerly Vila Fria/Viana do Castelo) and Ponte de Lima  Vila Nova de Famalicão (PT) (formerly Vila do Conde) (PT), including substations in Beariz (ES), Fontefría (ES) and Ponte de Lima (PT) A new interconnection between the electricity transmission networks of Portugal and Spain in the Minho region will allow a minimum commercial interconnection capacity of 3 000 MW to be achieved, in both directions (ES > PT and PT > ES). Furthermore, the current proposed National Electrical Power Transmission Network Development Plan for 2018-2027, presented by the TSO in March 2017 sets out a series of network reinforcements (including the 400-kV Falagueira-Fundão axis, the 400-kV Falagueira-Estremoz-Divor-Pegões axis and the 400-kV Ferreira do Alentejo-Ourique-Tavira axis) which will allow network capacity to be created for new renewable energy power plants. In order to facilitate the connection of the future Tâmega waterfall dams (Gouvães, Daivões and Alto Tâmega - with 1 158 MW total power and 880 MW pumping capacity) the 400-kV line will be finalised linking the current Vieira do Minho step-down station with the future Ribeira da Pena substation, and its extension to the current Feira substation. It is also important to note that the Electricity Transmission and Distribution Network Operators (REN and EDP Distribuição) will be oriented so that their future proposals for Network Development and Investment Plans (PDIRT and PDIRD) are aligned with the national goals and targets set out in this Plan, including identifying the necessary investments in the network. In this regard, the criterion of economic rationality will always be upheld while implementing the changes that are essential to comply with the goals and targets defined herein for 2030.  Main infrastructure projects (trans-European) envisaged other than Projects of Common Interest (PCIs)21  In order to achieve the objectives set out in this point of the plan for the 2021-2030 time frame, other infrastructure projects may be considered in the electricity and gas sectors deemed to be equally relevant:  Of note in the electricity sector are the projects to reinforce internal networks (transmission and distribution) to connect and accept renewable power production (to achieve national potential in this type of electrical power production).  Moreover, depending on the evolution seen in the Portuguese and Spanish electricity systems, more specifically with regard to renewable power generation, it will be necessary to assess, in addition to possible network reinforcement, the need for new interconnections;  Planned for the gas sector are projects which could increase the use of LNG and improve LNG reception                                                            21 In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2013 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and repealing Decision No 1364/2006/EC and amending Regulations (EC) No 713/2009, (EC) No 714/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 (OJ L 115, 25.4.2013, p. 39)  48 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 2. objectives and targets   internal market/European gas system. The Strategy to Increase the Competitiveness of the Mainland Commercial Port Network - Horizon 2026, approved by Council of Ministers Resolution No 175/2017 sets out a strategic vision based on fundamental on innovation in green of LNG vessels and into an LNG re-exporting hub. This aim can be achieved through conventional onshore terminal solutions (as with the terminal in Sines), onshore small-scale (as is the case in the port of Rotterdam) or floating offshore bunkering (ship-to-ship, LNG -exportation hub, actively contributing to establishing a European energy corridor, promoting economic activity related to LNG trading, ship building and related engineering services.  2.4.3. Market integration  i. National objectives related to other aspects of the internal energy market such as market integration and coupling22, including a timeframe for compliance with objectives   Not applicable.  ii. National objectives related to the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via energy aggregation, in all energy markets, including a timeframe for compliance with objectives  Not applicable.  iii. National objectives with regard to ensuring that consumers participate in the energy system and benefit from self-generation and new technologies, including smart meters;  In February 2018, ERSE approved the rules for implementing, as of 1 June 2018, two pilot-projects, including the introduction of dynamic tariffs for access network access in mainland Portugal. Participation in the pilot-projects, intended only for industrial consumers, is voluntary and will cover 100 consumers per pilot-project, over 12 months. Based on the results of the pilot-projects, ERSE will conduct a cost-benefit analysis to assess the merits for the electricity system and the possible setting of specific targets for installing smart meters. To promote distributed production and self-consumption of power from renewable sources, a new legal framework was developed, Decree-Law No 162/2019 of 25 October 2019, which: (i) allows and promotes individual self-consumption; (ii) allows the forming of energy communities. The legal establishing of these activities will allow individuals, companies and other public and private entities to produce, consume, share, store and sell energy produced from renewable sources, thus actively participating in energy transition. For its obvious advantages, but also in relation to the challenges it presents, the promotion of self-consumption of renewable energy, whether individually or collectively or through energy communities, will be accompanied by an information and support programme for implementing self-consumption projects. The aim is to reduce information asymmetries and support companies, municipalities and citizens in the development of such systems. Of special note among the initiatives to be implemented are the support programmes for establishing self-consumption in partnership with municipalities. These programme(s) aim to support the establishment of the aforesaid projects, both technically as well as with a view to obtaining funding. Support will be provided through public entities qualified for the purpose in partnership with agencies and local partners.  Self-generation projects                                                            22 Such as an increase in system flexibility, particularly in relation to the competitive setting of prices in line with applicable sector law, market integration and coupling to increase the commercial capacity of existing interconnections, smart networks, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed production, dispatch mechanisms, re-dispatch and load shedding and real time price signalling  49 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 2. objectives and targets   will be established in the short term, particularly in municipalities in the interior regions and for consumers suffering from energy poverty.  iv. National objectives with regard to ensuring electricity system adequacy as well as flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production, including a timeframe for when the objectives should be met  National objectives with regard to ensuring the adequacy of the electricity system With regard to ensuring the adequacy of the electricity system, the NES Supply Security Monitoring Report (RMSA-E) sets out supply security indicators. Supply security in relation to the production of electricity is linked to the performance of the electricity production system in two ways: adequacy (static assessment of the installed capacity to meet hourly electricity demand), and security (operational analysis with assessment of system response capacity to disruptions in the supply - demand balance). Supply security conditions on the RMSA-E timeline are assessed through probabilistic indicators resulting from the simulation of configurations of the electricity production system with the RESERVAS model, which reflect its performance in the two aspects mentioned above. This model is applied by the TSO in collaboration with DGEG when drawing up the RMSA-E: i) Adequacy Assessing the adequacy year. In this analysis, a contribution of capacity corresponding to 10% of the planned Net Transfer Capacity (NTCwith probability of surplus between 95% and 99% must not be less than 1.0. ii) Security23 The operational reserve requirements are assessed on the basis of the deviations in supply and demand balance occurring between all incremental periods. Those requirements are addressed with the existing production resources each year that are capable of supplying the operational reserve. The operational reserve is made up of the secondary and tertiary reserves up to an hour. To assess overall security of supply levels for configurations of the national electricity generating system under analysis the LOLE indicator is used (Loss of Load Expectation), which is calculated by the RESERVAS model incorporating the loss of load expectation associated with the Adequacy component (static LOLE) and the loss of load expectation due to inadequate operational reserve  Security component. In the analysis of security of supply, in accordance with studies carried out by the TSO, this indicator should be not more than 5 (h/year). National objectives with regard to ensuring energy system flexibility With the growing integration of renewable power production installations into the NES, it is now vital to create mechanisms providing the System Manager with greater real time monitoring of such production and that flexibility mechanisms are built into this production. In light of the above, by 2022 all production installations with more than 1 MW of installed power and which are connected to transmission and distribution networks are required to implement means of communication to receive real time interruption or reduction instructions from the System Manager relating to the injection of energy produced by them. For this purpose, the production facility is required to have at its disposal all of the communication, metering and control mechanisms necessary so that it may receive System Manager interruption or reduction instructions directly or via a dispatch centre linked to the producer facility. This requirement must be implemented as quickly as possible for production facilities of more than 1 MW which                                                            23 Of note with regard to the Security aspect is that only the disruptions in the stationary regime of the system are analysed (sufficiency of secondary and tertiary reserves). The dynamic analysis of the system is therefore not contemplated (in the transitory regime).  50 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 2. objectives and targets   are not connected to transmission and distribution networks. Interconnection capacity among the different European systems leads to an increase in system flexibility, which is normally associated possible exchange of reserves to satisfy imbalances between the supply and demand of electricity. A part of the new hydroelectric projects equipped with storage capacity and reversibility (functioning as pumping) that are scheduled to become operational by 2026 (Gouvães with reversibility, Daivões and Alto Tâmega) will make an important contribution toward increasintermittent renewable production, as this type of technology provides an operational reserve for rapid mobilisation (rising and falling reserves). The adequacy of the Portuguese electricity system (medium/long-term assessment) with regard to flexibility corresponds to the supply security assessment referred to in previous point.  v. National objectives to protect energy consumers and improve the competitiveness of the retail energy sector  National objectives to protect energy consumers At this stage of development of the plan, no specific objectives or targets exist in this regard. However, of note is the strategic objective in NECP to ensure fair, democratic and cohesive transition, reinforcing the role of the citizen as an active agent in decarbonisation and in energy transition. This will create equitable conditions for all, fighting energy poverty and providing instruments to protect vulnerable citizens while promoting their active involvement and territorial enhancement. It is important to note that the energy sector and climate questions are complex and often communicate in a language that is not understood by everyone, and as a result, citizens are not aware of the options available to them. This is why it is crucial to promote energy literacy for consumers through more transparent information and to ensure greater knowledge on energy and climate, allowing citizens to make more informed choices and promote more and better information for consumers, contributing toward transparency and competition in the energy market. A better-informed consumer represents better, more efficient and sustainable choices and a consumer at the centre of decision making is a more active consumer in energy transition, and one which is available to participate in the structural changes required to meet this challenge. Therefore, measures will be implemented to promote information for consumers and companies, contributing toward better energy literacy and simplifying interaction with the market.  2.4.4. Energy poverty  i. National objectives with regard to energy poverty, including a timeline for compliance with objectives  At this stage of development in the plan, no specific objectives or targets exist in this regard. However, of note is the strategic objective in NECP to ensure fair, democratic and cohesive transition, reinforcing the role of the citizen as an active agent in decarbonisation and in energy transition. This will create equitable conditions for all, fighting energy poverty and providing instruments to protect vulnerable citizens while promoting their active involvement and territorial enhancement. Measures aimed at combatting energy poverty and improving instruments to protect vulnerable clients will be instituted. For this purpose, a long-term strategy will be developed to combat energy poverty, the main objective of which is to diagnose and characterise the problem, develop monitoring indicators, monitoring strategies and targets to reduce energy poverty in the medium and long-term, on a national, regional and local scale, and to propose specific measures to achieve these targets, as well as forms of funding. After these short-term measures have been completed, the measures to fight energy poverty will be defined thus providing benefits which ensure the supply of electricity to vulnerable customers or support to improve the energy efficiency of homes.
