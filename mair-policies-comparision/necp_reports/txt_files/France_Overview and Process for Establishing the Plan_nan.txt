 3      SECTION A: NATIONAL PLAN    1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN   1.1. Executive summary  1.1.1. Context and targets  This draft integrated national energy and climate plan for France is based on two documents adopted at national level on the governance and programming of matters relating to energy and climate.     establishes the priorities for government action in the field of energy for the next 10 years, divided into two five-year periods. It covers all energy types and all of the cornerstones of energy policy (managing energy demand, promoting renewable energies, safeguarding security of supply, controlling energy costs, developing networks in a balanced manner, etc.), and makes it possible to forge a coherent and integrated vision of the role of energies in French society and desirable future trends in this respect.   The National Low-Carbon Strategy (strat√©gie nationale bas-carbone, SNBC), which is roadmap for climate change mitigation. This provides guidelines to enable the transition to a low--term and medium-term greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets (carbon budgets) and aims to achieve carbon neutrality, i.e. net zero emissions, by 2050.  The MEP and the SNBC are closely linked: the energy scenario in the MEP is identical to that in the SNBC for the period covered by the former. The MEP covers the first 10 years of the SNBC as regards energy consumption and the energy mix. The MEP adopts an operational approach to this 10-year period in terms of government action to decarbonise energy. Compliance with the projections of the SNBC for the period until 2050 represents onSNBC covers all greenhouse gases, some of which are not covered by the MEP.  The scope of the MEP is restricted to metropolitan France, whereas the SNBC also covers the overseas departments. As a result, the parts of these documents incorporated into the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (PNIEC) may vary slightly in terms of scope.   The Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth (LTECV) of 17 August 2015 sets out the principles underpinning the process for drafting these two documents. The SNBC and the first three carbon budgets were adopted by decree (Decree No 2015-1491 of 18 November 2015). The MEP for the period 2016 2023 was also adopted by decree (Decree No 2016-1442 of 27 October 2016). The MEP and the SNBC are linked in terms of compatibility: the LTECV provides for the MEP to be compatible with the SNBC and the GHG emissions reduction targets set in the carbon budgets.  The LTECV states that these two documents should be revised every five years, with the exception of the first revision, which was initially planned for the end of 2018 for the MEP and mid-2019 for the SNBC. A full revision cycle for the MEP and the SNBC therefore started in 2017 and continued throughout 2018. A draft revised version of the SNBC was published in December 2018 (hereinafter the (involving the Environmental Authority, the High Council for Climate, the Corsican Assembly, the  4    overseas authorities, the National Council for Standards Assessment, the Regulatory Impact Mission of the Secretariat General of the Government and the public). A draft version of the MEP for the period 20192028 (hereinafter decree, the draft underwent a process of statutory consultation involving the energy committees.   The current draft integrated national energy and climate plan for France incorporates sections from the draft SNBC 2 and the draft MEP 2, and follows the general framework outlined in Annex I to the Regulation on the governance of the Energy Union.   The SNBC 2 and the MEP 2 were drafted for the purpose of ensuring that France can comply with the energy and climate targets imposed on it by the EU. The following table contains the EU targets that apply to France and the figures forecast for 2030 under a scenario that assumes the implementation of    Target  Timeline  Forecast  Final energy consumption   National target of -20% compared to 2012  EU target of -32.5% compared to trend-based scenario  2030  120.9 Mtoe or -32.6%  compared to  PRIMES 2007  Primary energy consumption  No national target  EU target of -32.5% compared to trend-based scenario  2030  202.2 Mtoe or -24.6%  compared to  PRIMES 2007  Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption  National target of 33%  EU target of 32%  2030  41 Mtoe or 33%  Renewable and recovered heat and cold in district heating  +1% per year up to 60%  2030  +0.9% per year up to 65%  Increase in the rate of renewable and recovered heat  +1.3% per year  2030  Between +1.2% and +1.8% per year  GHG emissions except for land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) and except for sectors covered by the  European carbon market (EU  ETS)  -37% compared to 2005   2030  -42%  Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF)  Emissions do not exceed removals in relation to the  reference period of 2005 20091   20212025 and  2026-2030  Overall compliance with no-debit rule    The trajectory corresponding to these targets differs slightly from that presented in the draft MEP and SNBC published in early 2019; in particular, it is slightly more ambitious in terms of energy efficiency in the buildings and industry sectors, and includes recently implemented or planned measures (application of  1 For the land sector and with reference to a projected reference level for forests in relation to forestry management.   5    (buildings that lose a large amount of heat), freezing of the carbon component, etc.). The target for renewable energies was also increased to 33% of final energy consumption, compared to 32% in the initial draft.  The measures explicitly outlined in the final version of the MEP and therefore in the integrated national energy and climate plan will not be sufficient to achieve all the relevant targets by 2030, in particular with regard to a reduction in final energy consumption, meaning that additional measures must be taken. The gradual increases in the carbon component of taxation were suspended in November 2018, meaning that new measures are also required to achieve outcomes equivalent to those anticipated for this component.   These measures may be tabled by the governance bodies that have recently been set up (Ecological Defence te Convention).   As an indication of the amount of work that remains to be done, it has been estimated that the following outcomes would be achieved by 2030 if action were limited solely to the measures set out in the MEP:  - a reduction of 39.5% in GHG emissions (with reference to 1990), compared to a target of 40% stipulated by law, and an expected outcome of 43.2% for the trajectory that serves as a basis for the MEP and the SNBC;  - a reduction of 17% in final energy consumption (with reference to 2012), compared to a target of 20% stipulated by law, and an expected outcome of 20% for the trajectory that serves as a basis for the MEP and the SNBC;  - a reduction of 36% in primary fossil fuel consumption (with reference to 2012), compared to a target of 40% stipulated by law, and an expected result of 41% for the trajectory that serves as a basis for the MEP and the SNBC;  - an increase of 33% in renewable energy consumption, in line with the target stipulated by law and the trajectory that serves as a basis for the MEP and the SNBC.    1.1.2. Key strategies and measures relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union  Generally speaking, and even though the data are broken down by dimensions and sectors, it is important to remember that many measures have cross-sector effects and promote the achievement of several targets. For example, measures that reduce levels of atmospheric pollutants typically have a positive impact on GHG emissions, and in some cases on energy efficiency. Conversely, care must be taken to avoid potential adverse impacts (for example, a deterioration in air quality caused by an increase in the use of wood). When working on the scenario that serves as a basis for the MEP and the SNBC, it was necessary to adopt a holistic and cross-sector approach to the various dimensions and sectors, even if it was impossible to examine all of the relevant topics in depth.   1.1.2.1. Decarbonisation  Carbon budgets: a key tool for steering the trajectory of GHG emissions reductions  The carbon budgets specified in the SNBC are greenhouse gas emissions caps that must not be exceeded at national level over specific five-year periods. They define the target trajectory for GHG international level. They are broken down as follows:   by major sectors (ETS emissions, ESR emissions and, from 2019: negative emissions linked to land use, land-use change and forestry),   by major areas of activity (transport, residential and tertiary buildings, industry, agriculture, energy generation and waste);   6     as a guideline, in annual time frames and by greenhouse gas.  -to-date inventories) against the carbon budget for the period in question, including data broken down by sector, represents a key indicator for tracking the implementation of the strategy. In particular, a comparison of this kind highlights the recent impacts of measures that have been put in place.

A new carbon budget is drafted every five years when the strategy is revised. The draft SNBC 2 contains the next three future carbon budgets.  Guidelines in the SNBC  The draft SNBC 2 sets out 45 public policy guidelines, both cross-cutting and sectoral in nature, which are aimed at fostering the transition to a low-carbon economy and achieving carbon neutrality in 2050.   Planned policies and measures for decarbonisation  Emissions from the burning of fuels account for roughly 70% of GHG emissions in France, meaning that the decarbonisation of energy represents a vital step towards achieving the emissions reduction targets. Strategies for decarbonising energy include improving energy efficiency and developing renewable energies. The draft MEP 2 outlines the government actions to be taken over the next 10 years to reduce energy co  2 Historical GHG emissions data are taken from the national inventory available in 2018, which was when the bulk of work was carried out on the joint scenario for the MEP and the SNBC. Some of these data may therefore have been superseded by more recent inventories.   7    Emissions are also generated by non-energy sectors. In the waste sector, the Roadmap for the Circular Economy published in 2018 and the Law on the Fight against Waste and the Circular Economy adopted in 2020 are targeted at better manufacturing (ecodesign, use of recycled materials), better consumption (increase in rates of reuse and repair, lengthening of product lifespans), better waste management (optimised sorting of waste, increase in recycling and recovery) and better mobilisation of all stakeholders.  In the agriculture sector, the revised versions of certain plans linked to the Agri-Environmental Plan for France (the Vegetable Protein Plan, the Organic Plan and the Teaching to Produce Alternatives Plan) will help to transform agricultural practices with a view to reducing direct and indirect emissions of N2O and CH4. In afiveyear period between 2017 and 2022, incorporates an agricultural pillar aimed at accelerating changes to tools and practices. France has also come out in favour of strengthening the environmental component of the common agricultural policy (CAP). In addition to changes in agricultural practices, the measures resulting from the National Foodstuffs Meeting (EGA) organised by the Government in 2017 are aimed at influencing demand and consumption in agri-food sectors, for example through the adoption of regulations obliging operators in the food service industry to use a minimum amount of locally sourced or quality-certified agricultural products by 2022, and through the introduction of mandatory preliminary assessments for all such operators aimed at reducing food waste.  Cross-sector measures are also planned, in particular the taxation of HFCs and the introduction of a lowcarbon label confirming that a particular project has been awarded emissions-reducing status. Although it was also planned that the carbon component of energy taxation would be subject to gradual increases, the latter were put on hold during 2019 in response to industrial action.   As regards the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector, policies and measures aimed at ensuring compliance with Regulation (EU) 2018/841 involve firstly action under the AgriEnvironmental Plan for France, and secondly the revitalisation of forestry management. In particular, four mutually reinforcing tools have been identified in the forestry and timber sector:  - use of bio-based products as substitutes for energy-intensive materials;  - recovery of energy from bio-based products or from the waste generated from these products as a substitute for fossil fuels;  - storage of carbon in wood and waste wood products; -  carbon sequestration in the forestry ecosystem.  Several different national strategies and plans are aimed at leveraging these tools, in particular the National Bioeconomy Strategy, the National Forestry and Timber Plan, the National Biomass Mobilisation Strategy and the Strategic Wood Sector Contract.  Development of renewable energies  Targets relating to renewable energies were set in the Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth and updated in the 2019 Law on Energy and Climate. According to current plans, the share of renewable energies will be increased to 23% of gross final energy consumption by 2020, and to 33% by 2030. By this date, renewable energies must account for at least 40% of electricity production, 38% of final heat consumption, 15% of final fuel consumption and 10% of gas consumption in order to achieve this target.  The MEP sets a target of significant acceleration in the rate of development of renewable energies by 2028. This would serve as a basis for achieving the targets set by law for 2030. In particular, achieving the targets set in the MEP would allow the following:   Doubling of installed renewable electricity capacities by 2028 compared to 2017, with an installed capacity of 101 to 113 GW by 2028 and 36% renewables in the electricity mix by 2028 (upper bracket). This represents a 50% increase in installed capacities between now and 2023.   8     Increase of 4060% in renewable heat production compared to 2016, with production of 219 247 TWh by 2028, or in other words 3439% of total heat consumption.   Increase in injected biogas volumes to 1422 TWh by 2028, compared to 0.4 TWh in 2017. Biogas (whether injected or used directly) would then account for 68% of gas consumption in 2028.   Increase in the share of advanced biofuels in fuels to 5 TWh (3.35 TWh in diesel and 1.65 TWh in petrol, without multipliers).   Increase in the share of renewable and recovered district heating and cooling to 32.438.7 TWh by 2028, representing an increase by a factor of 2.42.8 compared to 2016.    1.1.2.2. Energy efficiency  A long-term vision  The Energy Code, which was recently updated by the 2019 Law on Energy and Climate, sets the following medium-term and long-term targets as a basis for joint action by citizens, businesses, regions and the state:   between 1990 and 2030, reduce GHG emissions by 40% (based on the trajectory outlined in the carbon budgets); by 2050, achieve carbon neutrality throughout the country, without the use of carbon offsetting, by reducing gross emissions by a factor of at least six compared to 1990;   by 2050, reduce final energy consumption by 50% compared to the reference year of 2012, with an interim milestone of 20% by 2030;   by 2030, reduce primary fossil fuel consumption by 40% compared to the reference year of 2012;   -standards across the entire building stock;   fight energy poverty;   safeguard the right of every household to access energy at a cost that is proportionate in relation to household resources.  The MEP and the SNBC, both adopted by the Government, contain measures aimed at achieving these long-term targets and outline cross-cutting and sectoral policies and measures to this end.  Energy scenarios  Several energy scenarios were developed in connection with work on the MEP and the SNBC; these scenarios were used as a basis for designing and scaling the policies and measures relating to energy efficiency and reductions in energy consumption.  ter be probable in the macroeconomic parameters. Pursuant to the statutory provisions, a scenario incorporating different macroeconomic assumptions was also developed under the MEP. The macroeconomic parameters, which included GDP, demographic growth and energy prices, were modified to provide an idea of the scale of additional measures that would be required to achieve the relevant public policy targets in the event of shifts in the economic climate.  Projections were drawn up for 2050, with interim milestones of 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030 and 2050. The deadlines that apply under the MEP (2023 and 2028) were identified on this basis. The scenarios are based on multiple interacting models.   9    Reduction in final energy consumption  The first pillar of the energy transition involves reducing energy consumption.  In application of Article 3 of Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, France has set itself the dual target of reducing its final energy consumption to 131.4 Mtoe and its primary energy consumption to 219.9 Mtoe by 2020 (excluding international bunkers and non-energy uses).  Generally speaking, the total figure for final energy consumption in France is already decreasing; at the same time, however, the current rate of this decrease is not sufficient to achieve the target for 2020 set under the Energy Efficiency Directive. The measures that have already been implemented would need to be stepped up quickly or new measures adopted in order to achieve the 2020 targets.  In application of Article 1 of the Regulation on the governance of the Energy Union and Article 3 of Directive 2012/27/EU, France has produced an initial estimate of its contribution to the EU target of reducing energy consumption by at least 32.5% by 2030 compared to a trend-based reference scenario.  Based on the reference scenario used for the MEP and the SNBC, which incorporates all the measures resulting from the MEP, estimated final energy consumption by 2030 is 120.9 Mtoe, and estimated primary energy consumption by 2030 is 202.20 Mtoe.    Planned policies and measures for energy efficiency  Specific sectoral energy consumption targets have been set under the MEP.  France has adopted two major cross-sector approaches to achieving its final energy consumption reduction targets; the first of these is the system of white certificates, and the second is the set of EU rules on the ecodesign of energy-related products and the energy labelling of these products. France also implements targeted measures in all the various sectors: residential, tertiary, industry, transport and agriculture. Flagship measures include the Long-Term Buildings Renovation Strategy, environmental and energy new-build regulations, the energy transition tax credit, the zero-rate eco-loan, energy audits and an extension of the conversion premium for replacing an old vehicle with a new high-performance vehicle.    1.1.2.3. Energy supply security  The security of supply is defined as the capacity of energy systems to meet demand continuously and at a reasonable cost for the foreseeable future. It is guaranteed in particular by managing energy demand, by producing energy at national and local level (in particular from renewable sources) and by diversifying supply. Maintaining a highly secure supply for the benefit of all consumers (citizens, government authorities and private-sector enterprises) represents a major challenge that must be tackled as part of the energy transition.  The main objectives relating to the security of supply are as follows:   confirming the criteria that apply to the supply of gas and electricity;   accelerating the reduction in peak electricity demand;   mobilising biomass resources while striking an appropriate balance between biomass uses and food-production uses, and working towards the goal of sustainable soil quality, which is essential for the sustainable production of renewable biomass.  Measures to ensure the security of supply for liquid fuels   10    The security of supply for fuels is ensured throughout France. The distribution of oil depots and service stations ensures a high quality of supply across the entire country. Reduced demand for oil will affect the profitability conditions of infrastructures and depots such as service stations, and these latter may be forced to close. The closure of these service stations might also destabilise upstream logistics in the long term (interim storage depots). No significant problems of this kind are expected within the time frame covered by the MEP, but they may occur thereafter. A forward-looking approach based on the concept of a network of oil depots must therefore be adopted to safeguard the security of supply, at the same time as ensuring that service stations are distributed uniformly at regional level.  Measures to ensure the security of supply for gas products  The security of supply for gas is ensured throughout the country. Measures to ensure supply security have recently been consolidated by means of legislative and regulatory amendments concerning the storage of gas, aimed at ensuring that stores are adequately filled before the start of winter. Gas consumption (like fuel consumption) is likely to reduce. The infrastructure system that guarantees supply security is scaled correctly for the 20192023 period, in particular as regards active underground gas storage sites. There is currently no demand for new natural gas underground storage sites, or for the reopening of any of the three underground storage sites that are currently mothballed. Exempting these sites from the scope of the Regulation would make it possible to reduce transmission system tariffs, which would benefit natural gas consumers.  Increasing the level of natural gas consumption interruptibility to at least 200 GWh/day between now and 2023 at major consumption sites will also make the gas system more flexible.  Measures to guarantee the security of supply for electricity  According to analytical work carried out by RTE when working on the provisional balance sheet, the system is flexible enough to handle the integration of extensive renewable energy capacities (over 100 GW installed by 2035 based on the Amp√®re scenario) without any disruption to the supply/demand balance. It will be possible to use all the existing flexibility tools, in particular demand flexibility, storage and interconnections, to handle the new challenges that will arise in connection with the increase in electricity produced from non-controllable renewable sources.   Investigations carried out in late 2017 by RTE, and updated in 2018 and 2019, confirmed that shutting down the last coal-fired power plants between now and 2022 while meeting the supply security criteria at both national and local level based on the reference scenario under the MEP is a feasible option, provided that the Flamanville EPR comes online in 2022 at the latest.    It was announced in summer 2019 that the Flamanville EPR project had been delayed, prompting RTE to amend the analytical data underpinning its provisional balance sheet for 2019. One of the conclusions that emerged from this process was that it would be possible to start the process of shutting down the first coal-fired power plants in 2020, but that shutting down all of these plants between now and 2022 would require additional measures, particularly as regards peak demand management.  The Government has undertaken to put the relevant measures in place to ensure that coal-fired electricity production can be phased out between now and 2022.   1.1.2.4. Internal energy market  Safeguarding the future of the energy system involves:   Most importantly, building an interconnected Europe. The main strategic guidelines of the order to benefit not only from the complementary nature of generation means at European level, but also from European solidarity. In particular, interconnections are planned with Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ireland, and investigations will be carried out into the feasibility of strengthening interconnections with Germany, Switzerland and Belgium.   11       systems to make them smarter and more flexible; this can be achieved through the balanced development of systems, through the storage and transformation of energy and through energy demand management, in particular with a view to promoting local energy generation and developing smart grids and auto-generation.     Laying the g--to-these systems.  The guidelines of the MEP and the measures carried out on its basis should make it possible to anticipate these changes by developing interconnections, smart grids, auto-generation/self-consumption options and storage facilities, with a view to supporting the energy transition in the regions.    1.1.2.5. Research, innovation and competitiveness  The transition to a low-carbon economy (i.e. one which consumes small amounts of materials and energy and is highly circular and decarbonised) involves a stepping-up of energy-related research and innovation measures aimed at developing the technologies and behaviours that will promote reductions in emissions while ensuring that France can compete on future markets for low-carbon goods and services.  Many specific research and innovation requirements have already been identified:   in energy-related sectors: decarbonisation of energy, energy efficiency, energy storage, smart management of transmission and distribution systems and carbon capture, storage and reuse solutions;   in non-energy-related sectors: process improvements efficiency, optimisation, recycling and reuse of resources;   in relation to social innovations (changes to behaviours and attitudes, ownership of change, etc.) and organisational innovations (public policies etc.).  Meeting these needs would make it possible to overcome the challenges involved in low-carbon transition, and to mobilise all the stakeholders involved in low-carbon research and innovation measures at national, EU and international level. Specific targets include the following:   continuing and boosting R&D and innovation funding for the energy transition, in particular through the Investments for the Future Programme (PIA), in accordance with the broad guidelines laid down by the Innovation Council (created in 2018);   reiterating the undertakings given under the Mission Innovation initiative, in particular the increase in government R&D funding levels to accelerate the development of proenergy transition technologies;   ajor international research programmes, in particular the future Horizon Europe framework programme;  developing new training courses for careers relating to the energy transition, with the assistance of tertiary education establishments or institutes such as the Institutes for the Energy Transition.       12    1.2. Overview of current policy situation   1.2.1. National and Union energy system and policy context of the national plan    In 2016, 232.4 Mtoe of primary energy was consumed in France. Of this total, 12% was generated from renewable or recovered energy sources. Primary energy consumption can be broken down as follows:   ¬∑  nuclear: 101.5 Mtoe   ¬∑  oil: 57.7 Mtoe;   ¬∑  natural gas: 37.2 Mtoe;   ¬∑  renewable thermal energies and waste: 20.1 Mtoe;   ¬∑  coal: 8.2 Mtoe;   ¬∑  renewable electricity: 7.7 Mtoe.

Of the total figure for energy use, 43% is accounted for by the occupation of buildings, either by individuals (residential, 27%) or businesses (tertiary, 16%): this includes heating, food preparation, refrigeration, lighting and the operation of devices.   The transportation of persons or goods accounts for 29% of the total figure for energy use.                                 hydraulique,               13     Industry accounts for 17% of the total figure for energy use: this includes furnaces, processes, etc.   Farming accounts for 3% of the total figure for energy use: this includes agricultural machinery, heating of greenhouses, etc.   The remaining 9% of energy resources are used as raw materials rather than as a source of energy: oil can be used to produce plastics or as a fuel, for example.     charbon  coal  p√©trole  oil  gaz naturel  natural gas  chaleur  heat  EnRt et d√©chets  renewable thermal energies and waste  √©lectricit√©  electricity    Sankey diagrams of the type shown below are commonly used to illustrate energy balance sheets; they depict all energy flows (supply, transformation, consumption, including losses) in the form of arrows, the size of which is proportionate to the amount of energy involved. The diagram below shows flows of energy from primary to final energy consumption. It also incorporates non-energy consumption (industrial processes), resulting in a total figure for final consumption of 153 Mtoe.

By way of contrast, the sources of energy used in the buildings sector are much more diverse: electricity, gas, oil, coal and renewable energies.  Energy sources are much more diversified in the buildings sector than in the transport sector. Electricity accounts for the largest share and gas for the second-largest share, followed by oil and wood for heating.

In the early 1970s, petroleum was the main energy source used by industry. Following the oil shocks of the 1970s, petroleum gradually lost ground to gas and electricity for certain industrial uses and for the heating of buildings.   Industry still uses small quantities of coal. The main energy sources are electricity and gas.

Energy production  France imports almost all of the gas, oil and coal it uses as sources of energy.   The country has produced no coal at all since 2004. Gas and oil produced within the country account for around 1% of consumption, and this figure will drop in step with the gradual scaling back of research into and use of hydrocarbons (in line with the policy adopted by France in 2017).

Current energy and climate policies and measures relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union  1.2.2.1. Decarbonisation and energy efficiency  The following section provides an overview of the policies and measures implemented by France with a view to reducing GHG emissions, decreasing energy consumption and promoting renewable energies. The aim of these policies and measures is to deploy all possible mitigating measures across all sectors: transport, residential and tertiary buildings, energy, industry, waste, agriculture and forestry.   A detailed description of the policies and measures that have been implemented in France can be found in the Fourth Biennial Report forwarded to the UNFCCC in early 2020, and in the reports on policies and measures forwarded in March 2019 in application of Article 13 of the Monitoring Mechanism   Regulation.       23    Transport  The policies and measures implemented in this sector are primarily aimed at improving the energy efficiency of new road transport vehicles by encouraging buyers to purchase the highest-performing vehicles (energy/CO2 label, bonus/penalty system, conversion premium) and requiring automotive manufacturers to comply with emissions standards (EU regulation obliging manufacturers to meet the target of 95 g CO2/km for personal-use vehicles by 2020). They are also aimed at encouraging the development of low-emission vehicles (in particular through bonuses for purchasing rechargeable electric and hybrid vehicles, by promoting the roll-out of recharging infrastructure and by setting targets for low-emission vehicles purchased in connection with the renewal of publicly owned fleets); at promoting the development of biofuels and other alternative fuels (by means of tax measures); and at supporting modal shifts (by improving the availability of non-road transport services and infrastructures, through measures that encourage cycling and active mobility, and by providing transport service users with more information about the impact of greenhouse gases emitted by transport services). Voluntary undertakings have also been made by professionals in the passenger and goods transport sector (CO2 Objective Programme).   Residential and tertiary buildings  Actions implemented with a view to reducing emissions in the residential and tertiary buildings sector are primarily aimed at improving the thermal performance of building shells, promoting the use of highefficiency heating equipment and less carbon-intensive energies, and improving the energy efficiency of other types of equipment (lighting, cooking, hot water for sanitary use, specific electricity consumption). These tools can be broken down into those that apply to new builds and those that apply to existing buildings.  The 2012 heating regulation imposed a general requirement for low-consumption standards in new - nched in late 2016, introduced an innovative environmental standard for new builds that combines requirements relating to both energy and GHG emissions. It lays the groundwork for the environmental regulations that will apply to new builds in the future. These future regulations (RE2020) are currently being drafted, but will include ambitious criteria in respect of energy efficiency, the use of renewable thermal energies and GHG  A great many measures of various types are being implemented to improve the energy performance of existing buildings: regulations on the quality of renovations; labels certifying high-efficiency renovations; support for renovations (tax credit, zero-rate or reduced-rate loan, grants for low-income households, third-party financing etc.); vocational training courses; encouraging households to opt for renovations or to change their behaviours (schemes involving the provision of information on building performance and available funding sources for renovations, allocation of heating costs to individual households in multi-household dwellings); obligation to install thermal insulation when carrying out major building renovations etc. Tax expenditure is also used to fund purchases of renewable energy equipment by individuals (solar water heaters, heat pumps etc.).  Industry  ns quota trading system, improving energy efficiency (by means of green loans for SMEs and industrial intermediate-sized enterprises, grants from the Agency for the Environment and Energy Management (ADEME) for research into energy efficiency in industry and reductions in the public electricity grid usage tariff for companies that consume a lot of energy and that introduce an energy efficiency policy) and recovering waste heat (with mandatory cost/benefit analyses for new installations that generate waste heat with a view to determining whether this heat could be used in a district heating or cooling network).    24    Energy  In addition to sectoral policies aimed at managing energy demand (particularly in the residential and tertiary buildings and transport sectors), a number of other cross-sector measures help to limit energy demand and promote renewable energies. In particular, these measures include the following:  - The carbon component of energy taxation, which is calculated in proportion to the CO2 content of fossil fuels, and which promotes energy efficiency and the emergence of lowcarbon solutions in the road transport, building and industry (non-ETS) sectors.  - The system of white certificates, which imposes a mandatory energy-saving requirement on the main energy suppliers (companies selling electricity, gas, domestic fuel oil etc.). This serves as an incentive for these companies to take proactive steps to promote energy efficiency among energy consumers.  - The obligation for large companies to carry out an energy audit every four years.  - The Heat Fund, which provides funding for the production of heat from renewable sources in the tertiary, industry and collective housing sectors.  - Support programmes for renewable energies (electricity and biogas): calls for tenders, obligation for small-scale installations to purchase renewable energies, supplement paid for high-power installations. These schemes are designed to achieve the quantitative targets for developing renewable energies under the MEPs.  - Capping of emissions from installations producing electricity and heat and from refineries, through the EU emissions quota trading system.  Agriculture and forestry  Policies and measures in the field of agriculture are aimed at improving the management of nitrogenous fertilisers, preventing organic nitrogen surpluses, reducing emissions from livestock manure, promoting renewable energies of agricultural origin (in particular anaerobic digestion), boosting the energy performance of holdings and maintaining and increasing carbon stores on plots and in soils. Progress towards these goals is outlined in a series of cross-disciplinary plans: the Agricultural Holding Competitiveness and Adaptation Plan, the Vegetable Protein Plan, a number of different schemes for accessing aid under the common agricultural policy, the Methane Energy and Nitrogen Autonomy Plan and the Agri-Forestry Development Plan.  Measures implemented in the forestry sector are aimed at improving the management of forests for the purpose of promoting carbon sequestration in the forestry ecosystem, and at increasing the use of biobased products (allowing both the storage of carbon and the substitution of energy-intensive materials or materials from which energy can be recovered).   Waste treatment  Reducing emissions from the waste sector involves preventing waste (ban on single-use plastic bags, the fight against food waste, penalties for planned obsolescence); increasing the accountability of manufacturers; implementing measures that promote sorting with a view to increasing the proportion of waste that can be recycled (obligation to sort papers, cardboard, plastics, metals, wood, glass from economic activities, obligation to sort biowaste (applies to major manufacturers and will apply to households by 2025); expansion of the sorting guidelines, etc.); and tax measures aimed at limiting the amount of waste sent to landfill or incinerators (waste component of the general tax on polluting activities). Funding for the waste management and prevention policy is provided via the Waste Fund -waste  Cross-sector policies and measures   25    Companies are obliged to produce balance sheets of their GHG emissions. These obligations apply across all sectors and all greenhouse gases.  Companies (as well as local authorities with over 50,000 inhabitants, central government services and publicly funded institutions) must publish regular balance sheets of their GHG emissions and an action plan for reducing these emissions. In addition, large companies must ensure that their non-financial reports include details of any significant GHG volumes emitted in connection with their activities, particularly as a result of consumers using the goods and services that they produce. Institutional investors must publish information on their contribution to climate targets and the financial risks associated with the energy and environmental transition.

In particular, it establishes a mechanism for gradually reducing the volumes of HFCs placed on the market, as well as for imposing sectoral bans on the marketing of products and equipment containing GHGs that exceed a certain GWP.  1.2.2.2. Energy supply security  Levels of energy independence (the ratio between primary energy produced and primary energy consumed) are close to 0% for gas, coal and oil. This means that France imports almost all of the fossil fuels that it uses.  The first stage in achieving the security of supply is therefore to diversify import sources, with a view to preventing adverse impacts in the event of a political or economic crisis. Growth of renewable  on imports.   energy supply. As far as the electricity system is concerned, diversification of the mix will forestall the crisis that could potentially occur in the event that a generic fault were to be identified in multiple nuclear reactors constructed at the same time and according to the same design. Decentralised means of production reduce the probability of large-scale technical malfunctions.  Organisational continuity in the national supply system  The security of supply also has an organisational dimension within the country:  - for oil and gas  seamless logistics are required to convey the right resources to the right place at the right time;  - for electricity  production and demand must be balanced in real time, since the storage of electricity is almost impossible.  Guaranteeing the security of supply at a reasonable cost represents another major challenge.  Supply/demand imbalances have not caused any power cuts in France over the past few years. A number of tense situations were encountered involving unavailability of the generating fleet, particularly during January 2017, but no power cuts occurred and there was no use of exceptional tools.  The supply of gas has not been interrupted to any customer in recent years, despite a number of potentially problematic situations.  There was scope for problems to arise in connection with the supply of petroleum-based fuels, mainly as a result of logistical issues caused by industrial action that might have affected supply throughout the country.   26      diversifying the means of generating electricity or the means of supplying gas and oil, which are not produced within the country;   protecting imports across all vectors, in particular through the strengthening of infrastructures.   The following sections provide details of the challenges that must be overcome in relation to the security of supply for different energy sources.  Security of supply for coal: absence of policy challenges  The burning of coal emits large quantities of greenhouse gases. Coal now accounts for only 3.4% of the energy resources used to produce energy in France. Its use is expected to drop yet further with the -fired power plants; the deadline for this shutdown has been announced as 2022. The supply of coal does not therefore constitute a strategic problem from the perspective of energy policy.  Australia was the main supplier of coal for France in 2016 (31% of all imports). Russia ranked second (27%, year-on-year increase of eight percentage points), followed by Colombia (14%) and South Africa  Security of supply for oil  A range of different challenges are faced in connection with the security of supply for oil, depending on the time frame considered:  - the short-term objective is to avoid any interruption in supply to refineries and service stations;  - the medium-term objective is to make the necessary investments into the transmission and distribution network to ensure that the demand for petroleum products can be met.  The petroleum logistics network in metropolitan France incorporates the following elements:   import depots for petroleum products, located as close as possible to refineries or ports, which provide the main storage capacities;   transport pipelines for crude oil or finished products (pipelines);   depots for temporary storage prior to final delivery to consumers via the network of service stations.  Each level of infrastructure is an essential link in the supply security chain. The density of the network, and in particular the network of temporary storage depots, helps to ensure high security of supply across the entire country. A decrease in oil demand will alter the profitability of infrastructures. It will be important to ensure that this does not jeopardise the security of supply for hydrocarbons.  6 Mm¬≥, including 23.2 Mm¬≥ in refineries (15.7 Mm¬≥) and outside refineries (7.5 Mm¬≥). Over 60% of this storage capacity is used for finished products.

The regions of Normandy and Provence-Alpes-capacities. The regions of Nouvelle-Aquitaine and Hauts-de-France are also significant, albeit to a lesser extent, since they account for 18% of capacity due to the presence of major import depots.  Since 1 July 2012, the strategic stores that must be established and maintained by operators have been equivalent to 29.5% of the quantity of petroleum products distributed in metropolitan France during the year n-1, minus the quantity of crude oil produced within France (Decree of 29 January 2016). Stores that are established in this way with a view to meeting the strategic storage obligations account for 88% of the petroleum products stored in France. The minister responsible for energy has approved a map of strategic storage locations, indicating the sites where operators must establish stores with a view to guaranteeing security of supply flows and consumption.    Security of supply for natural gas  Security of supply for gas: level and criterion  The security of supply for natural gas involves ensuring that gas can be supplied continuously despite the various hazards affecting the gas system, in particular bad weather and failures of supply sources; it also involves ensuring that natural gas can be transmitted continuously throughout the network despite a number of potential risks, in particular congestion.   28    The aim of ensuring the security of supply for natural gas is to guarantee that consumers can be supplied with natural gas under the following circumstances (with the exception of consumers who have signed an interruptible supply contract):   a very cold winter of the sort that is statistically likely to occur once every 50 years;   a three-day period with extremely low temperatures of the sort that are statistically likely to occur once every 50 years.  The aim of broadening the scope for interruptibility is to increase the number of consumers willing to tolerate interruptions in their supply of natural gas, which will automatically reduce the supply standard. The possibility of further reducing the supply standard will continue to be examined, at the same time as strengthening the courses of action available in the event of a crisis.  The security of supply standard is more stringent than the minimum level provided for in Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Based on the findings made in the relevant inspection report, no alterations to the current criterion are currently proposed.  Obligations incumbent upon players in the gas supply chain  Obligations relating to continuity of supply  Suppliers of natural gas are obliged to ensure continuity of supply for all their customers at a level that corresponds to the security of supply standard (with the exception of customers that have signed an interruptible supply contract)3.  In addition, suppliers of natural gas must be able to ensure continuity of supply to these same consumers even if their main source of supply fails for a maximum of six months, under average weather conditions. A ministerial authorisation must be granted before a company can supply gas on the French market. Supply authorisations must be updated annually, and evidence of compliance with the obligations relating to continuity of supply may be requested at the same time.  Obligations relating to diversification  Suppliers with a share of the market that exceeds a certain percentage are obliged to diversify the points at which their supply enters the country. The details are outlined in Article R. 121-1 of the Energy Code. To avoid penalising new market entrants, the obligation does not apply to suppliers with a share of a market below 5%.  Obligations relating to continuity of supply  Natural gas TSOs and DSOs must ensure that their infrastructures are designed in such a way as to ensure that natural gas can be transmitted in quantities that allow the security of supply standard to be met.    In addition, the public service obligations incumbent upon infrastructure operators mean that they must give advance notice of the dates when their infrastructure will be unavailable, so that suppliers can ensure continuity of supply.   3 The aim of ensuring the security of supply for natural gas is to guarantee that consumers can be supplied with natural gas under the following circumstances (with the exception of consumers that have signed an interruptible supply contract): a very cold winter of the sort that is statistically likely to occur once every 50 years; a three-day period with extremely low temperatures of the sort that are statistically likely to occur once every 50 years.   29    Sizing of the gas system and storage  The gas system has been expanded significantly over the past decade in order to facilitate the flow of natural gas.  It currently includes seven main interconnection points (import capacities of around 2,335 GWh/day) and methane terminals on three continental seaboards (import capacities of around 1,160 GWh/day), providing access to diversified gas sources: North Sea, Russia, the Netherlands, Maghreb, and also  in a more general sense  the international liquefied natural gas (LNG) market.  Within continental metropolitan France, the flow of gas is facilitated by a network of transmission and distribution systems that operate in synergy with natural gas storage infrastructures. Completion of the Val-de-Sa√¥ne and Gascogne-Midi projects allowed the establishment of a single market from 1 November 2018, since the French gas system is now deemed to have adequate capacity for the internal circulation of natural gas.  The current sizing of the gas system makes it possible to guarantee the supply of natural gas to French consumers. The drop in natural gas consumption that is likely to occur in the future will necessitate efforts to optimise the use of current infrastructures or the scaling down of these infrastructures.  The need to optimise the use of existing infrastructures applies in particular to underground natural gas storage infrastructures. According to the revised provisions that entered into force on 1 January 2018, the list of essential underground natural gas storage infrastructures that are necessary to guarantee the security of supply is defined under the MEP. The operators of these essential storage infrastructures are obliged to maintain them in good working order and to auction off their capacities; they are also subject to economic regulation. In return, they are able to recover the costs of these essential infrastructures on a guaranteed basis. The revised provisions guarantee that the natural gas stores required for the security of supply will be established within the country.    Protective measures in the event of a gas crisis  In the event of a crisis, and if preventive measures are not adequate to guarantee the supply of natural gas to French consumers, the following specific measures can be taken:   recommendation by the public authorities to moderate energy consumption;   triggering of interruptibility clauses in natural gas supply contracts;   as a last resort, load shedding of consumers by the operator of the system to which they are connected;   if the supply of natural gas to domestic consumers and core welfare services still cannot be guaranteed despite these measures, a call for European solidarity.  Security of supply for electricity  The purpose of ensuring the security of the electricity system is to avoid localised power cuts or blackouts on a larger geographical scale. It can be broken down into two separate goals.   Electricity system reliability, which refers to the capacity of the electricity system to convey electricity from producers to consumers; this is achieved in particular by keeping infrastructures  in good working order and by carrying out short-term balancing. Operating reliability also covers events such as major storms or system imbalances owing to an incident abroad that may cause large-scale power cuts. The associated challenges are beyond the scope of this document.   30     Security of the electricity supply, which refers to the balance between supply and demand; at any given time, the quantity of electricity consumed must be equal to the quantity of electricity produced and injected into the system, making allowances for the uncertainties associated with both production and consumption. A balance must be achieved both at an operational management level and in the long term. This involves managing two different kinds of phenomena:  consumption in France, requires sufficient capacity to be available during the relevant periods (either production or load shedding);  requires an adequate number of flexibility tools to be available within the electricity system. These tools include demand management, storage, interconnections and controllable production units.  The security of supply criterion is based on a probabilistic approach that evolves in response to changes in the tools.   The criterion that applies in respect of the security of the electricity supply is that mean annual downtime caused by failure should not exceed three hours over a 10-year period. Failure includes both load shedding of end customers a-market measures: reduction in voltage on distribution systems. This falls under the remit of the electricity TSO (RTE). This criterion is concerned with managing the system, i.e. achieving a balance between supply and demand, rather than with technical malfunctions. It therefore depends to a very great extent on the ability to anticipate demand, the structure of demand and changes in consumption peaks.   The following methods are used to handle consumption peaks:  - production capacities that are not normally used;  - interconnections (links with the electricity systems of neighbouring countries for the purpose of importing their electricity);  - reducing electricity consumption; for example, peak/off-peak hours encourage households to consume electricity outside busy periods.  According to the criterion that is currently applied, all failures are recorded identically, regardless of the number of customers affected. Consideration should be given to adopting a different approach in the future.  Security of supply criterion  The provisional balance sheet for the supply/demand of electricity4, which is drawn up every year by last provisional balance sheet that was published contains an in-depth examination of the relationship between supply and demand over the past five years. It quantifies the mean downtime, analyses the risk scenarios and assesses the electricity production and load shedding capacities required to safeguard the security of the electricity supply.  Article D. 141-12-mean annual downtime caused by failure to balance electricity supply and demand that does not exceed tAccording to the definition used by RTE as a basis for modelling, failures are situations in which the  4 . Provisional balance sheet for the supply/demand of electricity: https://www.rte-france.com/fr/article/bilanprevisionnel   31    normal functioning of the market no longer allows supply and demand to be balanced. In such cases, the transmission system operator must use exceptional means (both contractual and non-contractual), as presented in the following figure:  Figure 12: Disruptions  Source : RTE, 2018    Recours aux leviers exceptionnels contractualis√©s ou consentis  Use of exceptional contractual or agreed tools  Gestes citoyens  Public action  Appel aux gestes citoyens (EcoWatt, campagnes ADEME, etc.)  Call for public action (EcoWatt, campaigns by ADEME, etc.)  Solidarit√© europ√©enne  European solidarity  Sollicitation des GRT frontaliers pour am√©nager/d√©grader certains sch√©mas  Call for border TSOs to manage/degrade certain operating modes with a view to increasing import capacities  Interruptibilit√©  Interruptibility   Mechanism provided for by Article L. 321.19 of the Energy Code (major consumers within the public transmission system)  Recours aux leviers syst√®me non contractualis√©s  Use of non-contractual system tools  D√©gradation marges  Worsening of margins  Mobilisation des r√©serves secondaires et tertiaires contractualis√©e en r√©duisant les marges  Mobilisation of secondary and tertiary contractual reserves by reducing real-time operating margins  -5% Un  -5% Un   32    Baisse de la tension de 5% sur les r√©seaux de distribution  5% voltage drop on distribution systems  D√©lestage/Coupure  Load shedding/power cuts  D√©lestage (tournant) et coupure de consommateurs  Load shedding (rotational) and cutting off consumers  Situations consid√©r√©es comme d√©faillantes au sens de la d√©finition historique, en vigueur √†  RTE  Situations regarded as failures according to the historical definition used by RTE    The likelihood of a disruption is calculated according to the definition provided by RTE, based on a number of different scenarios that take a range of factors into account, in particular temperatures, likelihood5 of disruption of three hours per year is equivalent to the likelihood that a consumer will be cut off for less than two hours6.    1.2.2.3. Internal energy market  Network development  Rapid growth in the decentralised production of electricity has resulted in the emergence of new production zones, in some cases strengthening the transmission and distribution networks as a result. In addition, the intermittent nature of some of the renewable energies currently in development across Europe heightens the need for interconnections between France and its neighbours and for the development of new flexibility tools.  It is estimated that the following sums will need to be invested over the next decade:   - connection of new offshore wind installations;  - current distribution networks were designed to supply consumers rather than to accommodate production. At present, the low- and medium-voltage network is adequately dimensioned for the bulk of the new decentralised renewable energy capacities; it must therefore undergo modifications to ensure that it can convey both electricity delivered by producers and electricity supplied to consumers.   In general terms, the increase of decentralised production (particularly in consumption zones that are less densely populated) necessitates the establishment of new networks or the strengthening of existing networks. The location and size of production installations are of vital importance in terms of connection costs.   Smart grids    The transition to smarter grids involves a number of different factors, including the roll-out of new families of equipment (sensors, remotely operated equipment, communication equipment, etc.), the  5 . In the mathematical sense of the term.  6 . A power cut is recorded as soon as one consumer is cut off. There does not need to be a widespread blackout.   33    digitalisation of existing equipment and the development of software and IT systems able to handle the volumes of data collected by the grids. Smart grids enable active demand management and improved energy efficiency.  Smart meters  New meters (Linky for electricity and Gazpar for gas) are being introduced with the aim of gaining more information on how users consume energy and improving the quality of service provided to them. Both meters will allow more granular measurements of consumption and supply information on energy quality. Linky will allow the distribution system operator to carry out remote management operations, for example by cutting off a single home instead of an entire neighbourhood in the event of a problem.  In particular, Linky and Gazpar will also allow preventive network maintenance operations to be carried out on the basis of earlier and more timely information. This is expected to reduce network management ried out by the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE), the improvements in energy efficiency anticipated in connection with these meters will balance out the investment costs.  The Linky meter will promote more effective management of the low-voltage network, in particular by allowing the voltage level to be monitored more accurately and faults and consumption anomalies to be detected more rapidly. Further developments that will be possible thanks to the smart meter include optimised management and development of the distribution network and the large-scale integration of renewable energies and electric vehicles.  Benefits to the consumer include remote meter readings and bills based on actual rather than estimated data. Certain tasks will become more straightforward thanks to the meter (such as switching contract or supplier). The use of the Linky smart meter will also provide a boost to demand management services; for example, a supplier would be able to offer its customers the option of compensated curtailment during peak periods, by reducing the amount of electricity consumed only by specific appliances (such as freezers) for half an hour.  The Gazpar meter will make it possible to prioritise renovation operations in the highest-consuming buildings or neighbourhoods. The Linky meter will allow suppliers to offer new tariffs with a view to facilitating peak demand management and remote management.  The National Commission for Data Protection and Liberties (CNIL) was closely involved in all stages of work on the meters and introduced further protections for consumers7, in the interests of data confidentiality, protection of privacy and security of the metering system. Measures provided for in this respect include the following:  - secure management of the data stored in information systems; consumers will retain ownership of their data;  - consumer education measures explaining the new options that are available and the associated rights.    In both cases, the Network and Information Security Agency (ANSSI) was involved in the process to ensure that that all the necessary protective measures had been taken.   7 https://www.cnil.fr/en/node/23936   34    The National Frequency Agency (ANFR)8 and the National Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (ANSES) also carried out research into health-related issues with a view to ensuring that all users are protected.  Electricity demand management: curtailment  The option of cu-during which the price of electricity is lower encourage consumers to use appliances at times when less electricity is being consumed overall. Smart grids are different because they allow the granular and automated management of electricity demand. Operators will be able to offer services that alter the times of consumption dips and peaks without causing any inconvenience to consumers. This will make it easier to implement curtailment measures.  It will be possible for consumers to offer flexible curtailment capacities ranging from several kilowatts (individual households) to several megawatts (industrial operators); spread across multiple consumers, this will allow demand to be reduced significantly if an imbalance arises between production and consumption.   Curtailment of consumption accordingly helps to increase the security of supply within the network and eliminates the need to develop new production capacities in the medium term, thereby reducing costs.  Curtailment capacities rose to 2.9 GW in 2019. The MEP sets a target of 6.5 GW for total curtailment capacity by 2028.  The vast majority of curtailment operations affect industrial operators, with little use made to date of distributed curtailment (i.e. cutting off power to individual households). The distributed curtailment capacity can be estimated at 1.5 GW by 2030.  1.2.2.4. Research, innovation and competitiveness  Existing plans and strategies  France is involved in a number of international initiatives, most notably the Mission Innovation initiative launched in November 2015 by President Hollande, President Obama and President Modi during COP21, in the presence of around 20 Heads of State or Government. This initiative was launched in response to the finding that innovation will be an essential factor in meeting long-term commitments under the Paris Agreement, and that efforts in this direction must be accelerated. The initiative has three goals:   doubling public R&D funding for carbon- strengthening cooperation between Member States on the relevant R&D measures;   mobilising private investors to bring new solutions to the market.  topics: smart grids, off-grid energy access, carbon capture/storage/recovery, advanced biofuels, conversion of solar energy into fuels, advanced materials, decarbonised heating and cooling for buildings and hydrogen. France is involved in all of these challenges, and is jointly responsible for work on the challenge relating to off-grid energy access.     8 https://www.anfr.fr/fr/toutes-les-actualites/actualites/compteurs-linky/#menu2   35    At European level, France actively participates in measures under the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan, particularly through the various working groups responsible for implementing the action plans recently adopted under the aegis of this body.  change adaptThe National Energy Research Strategy is the energy pillar of this strategy. It is based on four areas of work:   targeting key topics for the energy transition;   growing Research & Development & Innovation (R&D&I) capacities in tandem with the regions and the industrial base, particularly SMEs and intermediate-sized enterprises;   developing skills and knowledge for and by R&D&I;   creating a streamlined and high-performance governance framework that facilitates dynamic operational steering of the National Energy Research Strategy.   Support and funding  the field of new energy technologies (renewable energies, energy efficiency, carbon capture and use, storage and networks, cross-sector fields), according to the nomenclature proposed by the International Energy Agency; this is equivalent to slightly more than 40% of Fof energy.  Funding is awarded not only to public research bodies, but also for R&D measures carried out by Consignations (CDC), as well as the National Research Agency (ANR) (Energy Transition Institutes and generic calls for projects).   Between 2010 and 2017, ADEME implemented measures under the first two pillars of the PIA: measures addressed multiple topics, which can be split into four main groups:   production of renewable energies, energy storage and smart electricity networks;   energy efficiency in buildings, industry and agriculture and bio-based chemistry;   circular economy and waste;   transport (including all its components) and mobility.  A range of different funding tools were implemented, as well as calls for projects relating to demonstrators, an SME initiative and equity-based measures, ultimately making it possible to fund 745  With a view to building upon the PIA 1&2, ADEME is implementing several different measures under the    operator, with separate loans for the regional component). From the perspective of ADEME, this builds on measures under PIA   150 million in State aid (BPI is also an   36     State aid.  Incentives designed to stimulate research and innovation in the field of renewable energies  the Energy Transition Institutes  The Energy Transition Institutes (ITE) are public/private platforms aimed at establishing centres of excellence that bring together academic researchers, major corporations and local SMEs to work on specific topics relating to the energy transition, with a view to promoting innovation by aligning public R&D funding with industrial strategies. The activities of the ITE are targeted at the industrial development of an entire sector, from technological innovations right through to demonstrators and industrial prototypes.   Under the PIA, the National Research Agency funds the work of these Energy Transition Institutes (which currently number around 10) in the following areas:   green chemistry and agri-based materials;   renewable marine energies;   solar energies;   geothermal;   smart electricity grids;   energy efficiency;   sustainable buildings;   carbon-free vehicles and mobility.     1.2.3. Administrative structure of implementing national energy and climate policies  The Directorate-General for Energy and Climate (DGEC), which operates under the aegis of the Ministry for Ecological and Inclusive Transition, is responsible for drafting and implementing policies on energy, energy feedstocks and the fight against climate warming and atmospheric pollution. It was set up in 2008 by means of Decree No 2008-680 of 9 July 2008 and the Order of 9 July 2008. Structures within this Directorate-General include the Directorate for Energy and the Climate and Energy Efficiency Department:  - The Directorate for Energy drafts and implements policies aimed at guaranteeing the security gas, oil) are functioning properly under competitive and environmentally friendly conditions. It the challenges relating to climate change, and it also monitors the development of clean technologies. The Directoratrenewable energies.  - The Climate and Energy Efficiency Department drafts and implements policies on the fight against climate change, climate change adaptation and the fight against atmospheric pollution. It proposes measures aimed at promoting demand management and the rational use of energy across all energy uses, as well as measures aimed at promoting the use of renewable heat. It drafts technical regulations designed to make road vehicles safe and to reduce the level of  37    polluting emissions from such vehicles. It proposes and implements measures that incentivise the faster placement on the market of safer or more environmentally friendly vehicles.    1.2.4. Regional cooperation    1.2.4.1. Pentalateral Energy Forum  Introduction  The Pentalateral Energy Forum is a platform for voluntary regional cooperation that has existed since 2005. Its members include Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and, since 2011, Austria, which contributes actively to its technical work and decision-making processes. The Pentalateral Energy Forum also works closely with the European Commission on an invitation basis, with the aim of improving cooperation between all stakeholders in order to create a regional electricity market as an intermediate step towards a single electricity market in the EU.  The ministers responsible for energy policy meet regularly for the purpose of steering these cooperative efforts. The Penta coordinators and the Penta NECP Committee monitor work under the leadership of the Director-Generals of the countries that belong to the Pentalateral Forum. The work programme is implemented by the electricity TSOs, the relevant ministries, the national regulatory authorities, the European Commission and the market operators, which meet regularly within three Support Groups.  The most successful development over the past 15 years has been the shift by the Penta countries to a regional approach to energy market policy, instead of the previous purely national approach. Specific regional milestones have been adopted for the various dimensions, and these still remain relevant.   Internal electricity market/market integration:  The Support Group Penta 1 (SG1) focuses on the coupling of the electricity markets in the region. The Group pursued the goal of encouraging flow-based market coupling (FBMC) of the day-ahead markets, and in May 2015, the countries of the Penta region were the first in the European Union to introduce a model of this kind. The FBMC model has undergone continuous improvements since then with a view to generating yet greater welfare gains, and is currently being used as a basis for full flow-based market coupling at EU level for day-ahead markets.  In addition, as well as increasing the transmission capacity available for cross-border trade on the intraday market, SG1 has promoted a coordinated approach to intraday capacity calculations following an day-ahead flow-based market coupling model for all the borders in the region.  The Support Group has witnessed first-hand the dramatic changes in the electricity landscape and electricity market governance. Back in 2005, the electricity companies were still working in isolation from each other; over the years, however, the Support Group has actively encouraged cooperation between stakeholders. Positive outcomes of this process include the regional grouping of TSOs within associations, the merger of power exchanges or TSOs and the emergence of new regional players (TSCNet, Coreso, the former CASC-CWE, SSC).  In view of the fact that new implementation plans must be drafted in line with the provisions of the Clean Energy Package, the Penta countries will coordinate their activities closely and explore the options for joint action.    38    Internal electricity market/flexibility:   Support Group 3 (SG3) focuses on issues relating to flexibility in the region. Work within SG3 has centred to date on balancing, the intraday market and the role of demand management, which are the three main areas of regional cooperation that aim to improve the flexibility of our electricity markets. Various technical reference documents have been drafted that summarise the main obstacles to increased use of flexibility in the Penta region. As well as traditional participants (national regulatory authorities/TSOs), other stakeholders such as DSOs, major consumer protection organisations and renewable energy producers were also eligible to become members of SG3.  The Pentalateral Forum evaluates current approaches to balancing and exchanges best practices in this A separate group of experts has worked on a report describing the current situation with regard to demand management in the Penta region, emphasising the rules and responsibilities of the new market players in each country within the region. A workshop on hydrogen is planned with a view to identifying potential topics for future cooperation between the Penta countries on this issue.   Security of supply:  Support Group 2 (SG2) focuses on issues relating to the security of supply in the region. A Memorandum of Understanding signed in June 2017 formalised cooperation between the Penta countries in relation to the security of supply. On this basis, and having regard to the new EU Regulation on risk-preparedness, a crisis exercise (PENTEX 2018) was organised in 2018 for the purpose of achieving a better mutual understanding of national concerns, identifying the main (cross-border) crises that the region could potentially face and evaluating various crisis mitigation measures.  A key milestone was passed in March 2015, when the first regional Generation Adequacy Assessment (GAA) carried out by the TSOs of the Pentalateral Energy Forum was published. The methodology applied when working on the GAA was based on a probabilistic and chronological approach with hourly calculations for the years 2015/2016 and 2020/2021, representing a significant improvement on previous deterministic approaches. In addition, the Penta TSOs had access to a common set of regional data based on the same scenarios and hypotheses, such as a regional model of heat-sensitive load and harmonised probabilistic hydrological data.  The governments of the Penta countries believe that these dimensions are still relevant. The Pentalateral Energy Forum will serve as a platform not only for continuing efforts in the areas referred to above, but also for the Penta countries to work on the following priorities over the next few years.  Decarbonisation in the electricity sector  Shared vision of carbon-free electricity in the Penta countries by 2050  The Penta countries will share their visions of what a carbon-free electricity system might look like in 2050 (with interim milestones in 2030 and 2040), based on a highly efficient system using mainly renewable energies, the gradual elimination of electricity produced from fossil fuels and the efficient end use of electricity. As a first step, national scenarios describing what the electricity system might look like in 2050 will be compared as a basis for identifying the shared and differing features of these scenarios, and the way in which they would guarantee security of supply. This will allow the Penta countries to reach a shared understanding of expectations and of the challenges involved in creating a future electricity system.   Cross-border cooperation on renewable electricity  The Penta countries will engage in voluntary efforts aimed at developing a range of shared proposals for cooperation at different levels, including an exploration of options for opening up national tendering procedures/cross-border tendering procedures, and shared tendering procedures for all Penta countries that are interested and that make increasing use of a European framework that is conducive to renewable  39    interested Penta countries.   The Penta countries also support the efforts currently being undertaken by the European Commission and the Member States with a view to establishing a new EU financing mechanism for renewable energies.   Elimination of regional restrictions on e-mobility services and options  The Penta countries will help to increase the share of renewable energies in the transport sector by promoting e-mobility (including fuel-cell vehicles). They will allow the unrestricted integration and implementation of e-mobility options and services within the Penta region by identifying and (where applicable) eliminating obstacles to the cross-border roll-out of e-mobility and recharging services, and by ensuring interoperability.   Research into carbon pricing options and their cross-border impact on electricity prices  The Penta countries that have plans for or are considering the introduction of carbon pricing will engage in voluntary exchanges of views on policy approaches in this area, advantages and disadvantages in terms of reducing CO2 emissions, security of supply, price trends and the establishment of a level playing field for their industries.  Internal electricity market  Market integration  The Penta countries will step up their FBMC monitoring efforts yet further with a view to increasing cross-border trade and social welfare and maximising consumer benefits. They will use more innovative monitoring methods based on shared key indicators with a view to assessing progress towards a totally carbon-free electricity market within the Penta countries by 2050.   They will work together to achieve prompt implementation of the Clean Energy Package and to assess potential cross-border impacts on the energy market (e.g. tracking developments with regard to redispatching in the Penta region and improving cooperation in this area).   Flexibility  The Penta countries will examine the impact of implementing flexibility options such as energy demand management, Power-to-X (PtX), hydrogen, the role of storage and electric mobility, as well as specific obstacles to sectoral coupling that are linked to electricity in some way.   They will also examine the future potential of joint approaches to hydrogen within their energy systems as an increasingly renewable energy vector (in respect of guarantees of origin, cross-border infrastructure, the respective roles of TSOs and DSOs and hydrogen blending standards), and exchange information and best practices on support schemes for hydrogen and innovative projects and on the future role of hydrogen in a more general sense.   Security of supply  The Penta countries will make long-lasting improvements to generation adequacy assessments within the region, based on the most reliable meteorological data and the latest figures and targets under the future energy mixes and other sensitivity analyses. The Penta TSOs are currently working on the third assessment for the period between now and 2021/2025, taking into account regional scenarios (based on national scenarios), improved flow-based calculations and sensitivities linked to demand flexibility.  Within the framework of the Clean Energy Package (CEP), and more specifically in the context of regional cooperation and the Regulation on risk-preparedness, discussions have been held with  40    ENTSOE, the Commission and other stakeholders with a view to adopting rules governing intra-Member State cooperation aimed at identifying potential regional crisis scenarios and preventing, preparing for and managing crises in the electricity sector, in keeping with the principles of solidarity and transparency and giving full consideration to the requirements of a competitive internal electricity market.  The Penta countries will work together as partners to develop detailed regional crisis responses.   Tools for funding the energy transition  The Pentalateral Energy Forum will start to exchange information on potential regional approaches aimed at bringing about improvements to energy efficiency and rolling out renewable energies, for example by working together with financial institutions (such as the EIB) on joint approaches intended to reduce risks in these two sectors, thereby making it easier for the Penta countries to achieve their targets.    1.2.4.2. North Seas Energy Cooperation  France forms part of the wider North Sea region, which offers considerable potential in terms of renewable energies. The European Commission has estimated that North Sea offshore wind could cover  Wind energy production and network infrastructure projects may have cross-border impacts on energy prices, security of supply and the environment, including the availability of maritime space and the pace of innovation, and cooperation in this area would therefore greatly benefit the North Sea countries.  The North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC) is a voluntary, regional, bottom-up and market-based cooperation initiative set up in 2016, aimed at  wherever possible and on a mutually advantageous basis  harnessing synergies, avoiding incompatibilities between national policies, sharing international best practices and promoting joint strategies. Its objective is to coordinate and facilitate the profitable rollout of offshore renewable energies, in particular wind energy, with a view to guaranteeing a supply of sustainable, safe and affordable energy for the North Sea countries based on an accelerated and better coordinated roll-out of offshore wind energy and on potential joint projects or clusters of projects. The NSEC favours an incremental approach aimed at deeper integration and increased efficiency of wholesale electricity markets; it is also engaged in efforts to reduce GHG emissions, combat discrepancies in average wholesale prices and improve security of supply in the region.   The North Seas Energy Cooperation is made up of 10 countries and the European Commission: Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark.  Regional cooperation  In response to a request from the Government issued in connection with the drafting of this plan, experts for example obstacles faced and best practices for the national development of wind energy, as well as the bundling of national trajectories for renewable energies (specifically wind) for the period between now and 2030 and market integration.     France also consulted the other North Sea countries on its national energy and climate plan as regards the planned roll-out of wind energy between now and 2030 and other issues relating to network planning.   The Support Groups engage in cooperation on the following topics:    Support Group 1: maritime spatial planning and environmental impact assessments;   41     Support Group 2: development and regulation of offshore grids and other offshore infrastructures;   Support Group 3: support and financing mechanisms for offshore wind projects;   Support Group 4: standards and technical rules in the offshore wind sector.    Maritime spatial planning and environmental impact assessments  France is involved in efforts to develop a joint methodology for environmental impact assessments under the aegis of the NSEC. A better understanding of the potential environmental limits to the large-scale and climate targets, and further work is needed in terms of maritime spatial planning and environmental authorities responsible for energy, maritime spatial planning and the environment, the North Sea countries will continue to cooperate closely in the field of maritime spatial planning, environmental research and assessments of the cumulative effects of wind farms, with a view to building knowledge and supporting the roll-out of wind projects in the North Sea.     Offshore grids and other offshore infrastructures  The NSEC serves as a platform for cooperation on concepts for potential joint wind projects and for coordinated electricity infrastructure, including transport infrastructure.   France works together with other countries on specific potential cooperation projects under the aegis of this platform.  In addition to joint offshore wind projects that will be supported by several Member States lutions using network connection cables to transmit offshore wind, and on interconnection capacities between countries and the corresponding market adaptations.   In this way, France contributes to efforts to broaden cooperation on potential hybrid projects and to identify and overcome any legal, regulatory and commercial obstacles. The coordination of activities aimed at greater interconnection between the NSEC countries will mean that increasing amounts of surplus energy production can cross borders in order to meet internal market demand for high-efficiency energy.   The NSEC has drawn up a list of areas where mutually beneficial joint projects could potentially be carried out. These include: (1) the wind farm IJmuiden Ver (United Kingdom); (2) CGS IJmuiden Ver (Norfolk); (3) COBRA Cable; (4) the offshore wind farm connected to the Netherlands; and (5) the North Seas Wind Power Hub.    The NSEC is developing detailed concepts for the implementation of projects selected from the list above.   It will continue to work on action plans for specific hybrid projects that may also be implemented at national and regional level. In addition, the NSEC will continue to serve as a platform for examining ways of addressing the lack of regularity certainty at national and EU level in relation to hybrid projects, and for debating the options available for overcoming these challenges.     Support and financing mechanisms for offshore wind projects  France benefits from its participation in the NSEC in several ways with regard to these measures. The NSEC serves as a platform for exchanges of views on best practices as regards the design of support schemes, for the development and drafting of new concepts that respond to the novel challenges being  42    faced in connection with support for offshore wind, and for the exploration of potential opportunities for future joint offshore wind projects.  France is engaged in efforts under the aegis of the NSEC to coordinate its tender timetable, to exchange views on best practices for the design of offshore wind funding schemes, and to identify, where possible, shared principles and potential opportunities for the alignment of funding.     France regularly shares information on its national tender timetable with other NSEC countries for the purpose of identifying potential overlaps and allowing the greatest possible flexibility in respect of calls for tenders in the North Sea region, with the ultimate aim of ensuring that tendering procedures create strong competition and are as cost-efficient as possible for consumers. Alongside other criteria and to the extent possible, France is willing to take account of this overview of tender timetables in its future planning of calls for tenders, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication and to create a stable pool of capacity for stakeholders without the repeated need to stop and then restart.  As part of the NSEC, France shares and evaluates information on the estimated trajectory for renewable offshore wind, on its plans for the roll-out of offshore wind and on best practices in respect of the design of calls for tenders in the field of offshore wind.   During the ministerial meeting held at Esbjerg on 20 June 2019, the North Sea countries agreed to work together with a view to achieving a joint installed capacity for offshore wind of at least 70 GW by 2030 (total indicative figure), based on national plans.  This total planned capacity (at least 70 GW by 2030) may be implemented by means of an overall trajectory for the region with interim milestones of around 25 GW by 2020 and 54 GW by 2025, with the aim of more accurately mirroring developments as regards the roll-out of offshore wind in the region.  Again under the aegis of the NSEC, France is involved in the assessment and development of options for the increased mobilisation of funding for joint projects, for example through European funds such as the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), as well as through institutional investors.  These joint projects might include cross-border renewable energy    Harmonisation of rules, regulations and technical standards  The NSEC aligns technical requirements and standards that are likely to further reduce the cost of offshore wind deployments. The aim of this process is to align technical standards, regulations and rules in the five areas that have been identified. These include: (1) aviation, marking and lighting, (2) health and safety, (3) certification of regulatory requirements, (4) wind farm planning and site surveys, and (5) research approaches. The NSEC draws up proposals and recommendations that are implemented in close collaboration with industry. The aim of these recommendations is to reduce costs in a workable manner. The NSEC will continue to cooperate on the alignment of technical requirements and standards and to exchange best practices with a view to reducing anti-industry regulations and costs. 1.2.4.3. High-- The Quadrilateral Summit on Interconnections, which gathers together the Heads of State or Government of Spain, France and Portugal and the President of the European Commission, and which took place in Madrid on 4 March 2015, decided to set up a High-Level Group on Electricity and Gas Interconnections for South-West Europe. This High-Level Group, which was launched formally in Paris on 30 June 2015, gathers together representatives of three countries and the European Commission, as well as the national regulators and TSOs. Its purpose is to gain a holistic overview of projects across the entire region and to  43    involve all stakeholders, in particular TSOs and regulators. It receives support from the Commission through the recognition of these projects as projects of common interest, and through access to EU financing tools.     1.3. Consultations and involvement of national and EU entities, and their outcome  1.3.1. Involvement of stakeholders, the national parliament, local and regional authorities, civil society and the general public  The current integrated national energy and climate plan is based on the MEP 2 and the SNBC 2. These documents underwent an extensive consultation process when they were drafted; this process is described below.   1.3.1.1. Process for drafting the MEP  Stakeholder engagement  The process for revising both the MEP and the SNBC kicked off in June 2017, with a joint meeting of the Monitoring Committee for the MEP and the Steering Committee for the SNBC. The Monitoring Committee for the MEP is made up of around 80 members of French society, most of whom represent bodies that belong to the National Council for Ecological Transition (CNTE) and the High Council for Energy (CSE). This Committee met three times over the course of the year so that it could express its opinions on the progress of work. The Monitoring Committee and the Steering Committee are made up of representatives of businesses, civil society and trade unions, representatives of Parliament and representatives of local authorities.  The workshops held on the topic of demand management were also attended by individuals working on the revision of the SNBC. These workshops were organised on by sector. They each met four times during the period between June 2017 and June 2018:   industry;   buildings;   transport;   economy;   agriculture and forestry.  In addition, 24 workshops were held between October 2017 and January 2018, covering all the topics specifically addressed by the MEP. Each workshop was attended by between 20 and 50 individuals. The members of the Monitoring Committee were invited to each workshop, as well as bodies working in the specific area to be debated. Over 100 presentations were discussed and 70 written contributions shared during these workshops. Workshops on anticipating energy demand were organised by sector:   biofuels;   biogas;   solid biomass;   offshore wind/marine renewable energies;   onshore wind;   geothermal;   hydropower;   44     nuclear;   photovoltaic;   waste energy recovery.  Workshops on energy systems were organised by theme:   supply and demand for petroleum products;   supply and demand for gas;   gas transmission networks, storage and import infrastructures for natural gas;   distribution networks and new uses of natural gas;   heating in the residential and tertiary buildings sector;   heating in the industry and agriculture sector;   district heating and cooling;   electricity mix;   electricity networks;   demand management (curtailment etc.);   self-consumption;   storage;   security of supply for electricity and gas;   recharging infrastructures for alternative fuels.  Public engagement  A public debate was organised by the National Public Debate Commission (CNDP) between 19 March 2018 and 29 June 2018. The debate incorporated the following:   a website centred around the debate, an online questionnaire, brochures produced by stakeholders;   thematic workshops (Europe/international, innovation, stakeholder opinions);    workshops on controversial topics (involving experts) and expert hearings;     regional initiatives;   targeted initiatives implemented with partners.  The Government made available a public enquiry file containing information for citizens on the key topics: https://ppe.debatpublic.fr/dossier-du-maitre-douvrage-dmo    Initiatives regarded as particularly effective by citizens in terms of reducing energy consumption: the measures that would most likely to encourage them to take action both at home and with regard to their mobility choices.   The development of different renewable energy production sectors: wind, photovoltaic, anaerobic digestion, etc.,   Security of supply guarantees. What do they think of the way in which the criteria are defined? Would alternative definitions or levels be more appropriate? Would consumers be more willing to tolerate the risk of power cuts if the cost of energy were reduced?   45    The 86 meetings organised in connection with the public debate were attended by almost 8,000 people in total. The website was visited 47,572 times, with 561 opinions posted, 140 contributions published and 193 brochures uploaded by stakeholders, 2,379 comments posted on the information and opinions available on the website, and 666 questions submitted by Internet users. The Special Public Debate Commission published a report that can be accessed at the following link: https://ppe.debatpublic.fr/.  The Government paid close attention to the contributions made by citizens during the debate. Its decision was published in the Official Journal on 4 December 2018. The findings that emerged from the consultation were taken into account when drafting this document.  A summary of the debate is available at the following link: https://ppe.debatpublic.fr/compte-rendubilan-du-debat.   In addition, a post-debate public consultation on the MEP was subsequently organised under the guidance of the National Public Debate Commission, involving the following:   presentations of the draft MEP in several regions of France;   formal written consultation;   a meeting on 14 June 2019 with the parties responsible for organising the 86 local debates on the MEP;   a meeting in September 2019 to exchange views with members of G400 Energy (a group of 400 individuals selected at random from across France to play an active role in the public debate on the MEP).  Finally, the current draft version of the revised MEP underwent a public consultation via the website of the Ministry for Ecological and Inclusive Transition.    Formal gathering of opinions  Formal consultations were held on the draft MEP. Opinions were gathered from the following bodies:   the Environmental Authority (in respect of its strategic environmental assessment);   the National Council for Ecological Transition;   the High Council for Energy;   the Management Committee for the Public Electricity Service Contribution (CSPE);   the Committee for the Public Electricity Distribution System;   the European Commission;   the public.  The following countries, some of which share borders with France, were also consulted, since their system: Germany, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland.  These opinions will be taken into account in the final MEP.    1.3.1.2. Process for drafting the SNBC  The reference scenario and the guidelines outlined in the SNBC were developed in close cooperation with stakeholders with a view to identifying all of the challenges involved and ensuring that the strategy would subsequently be viewed positively by the greatest possible number of these stakeholders. Based  46    on initial interdepartmental efforts aimed at supplying a holistic overview of climate policy from the outset, civil society representatives (stakeholders) and the general public were asked on several occasions to get involved, to submit their suggestions and to express their opinions. This iterative process ended with an official referral of the strategy to the following bodies prior to its adoption by decree: the Environmental Authority, the High Council for Climate, the Corsican Assembly, the overseas authorities affected by the strategy and the National Council for Standards Assessment. This was followed by a final public consultation carried out in early 2020.         47    Cooperation with stakeholders  The reference scenario and the guidelines outlined in the SNBC were drafted jointly with stakeholders on the basis of regular exchanges of views with these latter.  These exchanges of views took place firstly via the Information and Orientation Committee for the SNBC, which is made up of around 120 members of the National Council for Ecological Transition (including representatives of each group within civil society, e.g. representatives of workers and employers, consumer rights activists, environmental NGOs, local authorities and members of parliament), and which held joint meetings with the Monitoring Committee for the MEP. The Information and Orientation Committee met six times after June 2017, at each key stage of the revision process (for the purpose of validating the hypotheses uexample). The interdepartmental services affected by the strategy also took part, with a view to ensuring that the strategy would be supported and put into practice by each of the departments involved in its implementation.  In addition, working groups were set up and met an average of four times; these working groups included members of the Information and Orientation Committee and sectoral experts, in particular representatives of specialised trade associations, research institutes and universities. The working groups were structured as follows:   Five sectoral groups: transport, buildings, agriculture, forestry and industry/waste.   Two cross-disciplinary groups: the economy, and other cross-disciplinary areas.  The experts within the working groups made particularly significant contributions in relation to the modelling of hypotheses for the reference scenario (based in particular on sector-specific ideas about carbon neutrality, proposed additional measures, comparisons with existing scenarios and the need for the broadest possible consensus on the hypotheses chosen for the reference scenario), in relation to the strategic guidelines outlined in the SNBC and in relation to the indicators selected in this connection. In addition, 24 workshops were held between October 2017 and January 2018 on all the topics specifically addressed in the MEP.    Preliminary public consultation  French citizens were invited to take part in the revision process for the SNBC by responding to an online questionnaire between 13 November and 17 December 2017. Over 13,000 responses were collected. version) and in a selection of the most notable (also available in a long and summarised version); these can be accessed at the following link: https://www.ecologique-solidaire.gouv.fr/revision-strategienationale-bas-carbone-contributions-des-citoyens.  The vast majority of suggestions submitted during this consultation corresponded to policy initiatives that were in progress or that had already been implemented. This is reassuring, because it suggests that  Nevertheless, some of the suggestions related to topics that had not previously been identified as priorities. The suggestions were often expressed as recommendations for action. For example, it was recommended that advertising be better regulated, with a view to informing consumers and guiding their choices. Certain recommendations also related to the need to make the energy and climate transition more effective and consensual, and to ensure that it is inclusive and beneficial for as many stakeholders as possible. In particular, Internet users highlighted the need for more trust in products and services relating to the transition and in professionals working in this sector on the basis of the information supplied (on labels etc.) and on the basis of public policies, by increasing transparency and reducing inconsistencies.   48    This questionnaire was not carried out as a survey; the contents of the responses and their relevance in terms of informing decisions on future areas of action were more important than the frequency of responses.  The online summary consolidates these contributions, with a particular focus on those most likely to provide concrete pointers for the content of the SNBC.  The outcomes of this consultation were presented and forwarded to the members of the Information and Orientation Committee and the working groups. They also served as input into the public debate on the revision of the MEP (see the following paragraph).  The outcomes of the Public Debate that was organised in connection with the MEP also served as valuable input when revising the SNBC. For example, recommendations relating to the clarity of the document were taken into account; an explanation of the legal framework is provided in a separate annex, which outlines the legislative and regulatory provisions governing the content and scope of the Strategy, the carbon budgets and the process for revising the Strategy. The recommendation relating to a specific summary of the strategic environmental assessment has been followed up on by publishing a non-technical summary of the strategic environmental assessment. The Special Public Debate The links between the SNBC and the other national and regional plans and programmes are outlined in the published report accompanying the strategy.   The report on the public debate on the MEP also highlights key concerns regarding the role to be played by citizens in the ecological and energy transition. Concerns that came to the fore during the public debate included consumer information and social innovation for behavioural change. These topics are addressed in the revised SNBC, particularly in the secti-raising, ownership of challenges and bottom-including moderation of use, as one of the major levers for achieving carbon neutrality, along with energy efficiency, decarbonisation of the energy sectors and an increase in carbon sinks and bio-based with a view to ensuring that future innovations are social as well as technological.  Opinion of the Expert Committee for Energy Transition  Pursuant to Article L. 222-1 D of the Environment Code in the version in force prior to the promulgation of the Law on Energy and Climate, the Expert Committee for Energy Transition must issue an opinion on compliance with the carbon budgets already adopted and on implementation of the current strategy no later than six months before the deadline for publication of the revised strategy (i.e. late 2018 at the latest). The opinion is forwarded to the Standing Committees of the National Assembly and the Senate responsible for energy and the environment.   As well as comparing the emissions figures against the carbon budgets and examining the reasons for any discrepancies, particularly in the transport, buildings and agriculture sectors, the opinion9 dated 24 December 2018 outlines a number of avenues for future work on the SNBC, such as:   use of the SNBC as a portfolio of public measures available to steer the transition at different regional levels and in different economic sectors;     9 http://www.ecologique- solidaire.gouv.fr.vpn.e2.rie.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/CETE%20AVIS%20BUDGET%20CARBONE%202018.pdf   49     accurate assessments of the factors that might contribute to success or failure of the transition;   more systematic reliance on best practices from other countries;   questioning of certain policies that are already in place.    The High Council for Climate established by the President of the Republic on 27 November 2018 was intended to take on certain tasks previously performed by the Expert Committee for Energy Transition, by carrying out The High Council for Climate is therefore responsible for assessing the revised version of the SNBC before it is published.  Consultations on the draft SNBC following the revision process  Once the revision process was complete, the draft strategy (published in December 2018) was submitted to the relevant bodies as part of a formal consultation:    the Environmental Authority, which submitted its opinion on 6 March 2019. In this opinion, the Environmental Authority:   o biodiversity in environmental assessment reports;  o highlights the need for mechanisms and methodologies guaranteeing the alignment of the SNBC with plans, programmes and projects at regional level;  o recommends that the principles governing carbon footprints and GHG emissions offsetting should be more stringent;  o recommends that the state should undertake to carry out offsetting measures in the event are exceeded;  o highlights the lack of any detailed analysis of the impact of increased biomass use, and the challenge of ensuring that the mineral resources required for the energy transition are available;  o more generally speaking, identifies a lack of concrete measures for implementing the planned guidelines in the various sectors and for quantifying the associated measures, for example mechanisms that compensate society for the cost of carbon or that promote a modal shift in the transport sector;   the National Council for Ecological Transition, whose opinion of 18 April 2019 related mainly to the following points:  o the need for consistency between the hypotheses underpinning the reference scenario and recent decisions by public authorities, in particular those relating to the carbon tax  o the importance of compliance with targets and robust monitoring, in view of the fact that the first carbon budgets were exceeded;   o the need to align the SNBC with the MEP, and to align the SNBC with regional planning tools and strategies such as the regional plan for SRADDET and the regional energy and climate plans (PACET);   50    o the importance of the economic and social impacts of the guidelines outlined in the SNBC and the need for supporting measures;  o the need for everyone to get behind the goal of carbon neutrality;   submitted to the Prime Minister on 25 June 2019) serves as an opinion on the draft SNBC and the draft carbon budgets, and contains the following recommendations in particular:  o incorporation of the short-term effects of freezing the carbon component of taxation, by adopting additional measures to compensate for its effects on GHG emissions;  o adjustment of the 20192023 carbon budget to the level set for the SNBC in 2015;  o establishment of a link between emissions from international air and maritime transport on the one hand, and carbon budgets and the target of carbon neutrality on the other;  o implementation of measures aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of consumption;   o clarification of the reasons why international funding sources have not been utilised with a view to achieving carbon neutrality, and improved provision of information on the targets per sector and per gas;   the National Council for Standards Assessment (favourable opinion of 11 July 2019);   the Corsican Assembly, whose opinion dated 26 July 2019 contains the following recommendations in particular:  o clarification of the precise relationship between the SNBC and the specific plans and programmes for non-interconnected areas, in particular Corsica;  o explanation of the scope of the data set out in the strategy-related chapters (continental France, metropolitan France, non-interconnected areas, Corsica, etc.); o  reiteration of the energy targets that have been set only for the interconnected areas;  o further clarification in the document of the sections that apply only to continental metropolitan France;    the overseas authorities, including opinions from:   o the local authority of Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon (favourable opinion of 29 July 2019); o  the local authority of La R√©union (favourable opinion of 2 August 2019); o  the local authority of Martinique (unfavourable opinion of 23 August 2019);   the public, whose contributions (gathered via the Internet) were gathered together in a summary document.  Certain bodies submitted opinions on the draft SNBC on their own initiative. In particular, the following opinions were submitted:   the opinion of the Economic, Social and Environmental Council of 9 April 2019;   the opinion of the High Council for Construction and Energy Efficiency of 21 May 2019.   1.3.2. Consultations of other Member States   Other Member States were consulted in 2019 in accordance with Article 12 of the Regulation on the governance of the Energy Union.    51    A meeting with the countries that share borders with France (Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, system (the Netherlands, Austria, Ireland and Portugal) and the European Commission took place on 1 March 2019. Work was also stepped up within certain other bodies, in particular the Pentalateral Energy Form and the North Sea Wind Forum.  Finally, the countries that share borders with France were invited to take part in the public consultation launched on 20 January on the revised draft MEP.    1.3.3. Iterative process with the Commission  This process took place in 2019, as provided for in the Regulation on the governance of the Energy Union (Article 9).
