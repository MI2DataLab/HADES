3.4 Dimension Internal energy market81                                                             80National Plan for the implementation of electricity and natural gas transmission infrastructure projects, approved by Government Resolution No 2014 of 22 July 476 approving that Plan. 81 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 154   Electricity infrastructure  It should be noted that the connectivity aspect in Lithuania is satisfactory (see section 2.4.1), therefore no specific measures are foreseen to improve it, but Lithuania is still not in the synchronous zone with the continental European networks, therefore one of the most important strategic objectives for the Lithuanian electricity sector is the connection of the Lithuanian electricity system with the continental European networks for synchronous operation and full integration into the European electricity market. The main volumes and parameters of network development are therefore proposed in such a way as to ensure the implementation of existing strategic objectives and guidelines and to avoid unnecessary investment. The synchronisation project is covered in more detail in sections 3.4.2. and 2.3 .  See section 1.3 on regional cooperation and see section 3.3 on funding.   Energy transmission infrastructure  Electricity sector The medium-term adequacy forecast82 by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) predicts that in 2025 the Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE) in Lithuania will increase to 29.5 hours per year under the PPM scenario. Lithuania aims to limit the Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE) to a maximum of 8 hours per year. To achieve this, a capacity mechanism is being developed in Lithuania to ensure reliable operation of the Lithuanian electricity system and an adequate level of security of electricity supply after 2025. In Lithuania, capacity adequacy is mainly influenced by interconnections between systems, their reliability and availability, and particular attention is paid to the operation of interconnectors and the development and deployment of regional market mechanisms.83 The capacity mechanism described in more detail in section 2.3, covering load adjustment instruments, storage facilities and other tools, will contribute to the reliable operation of the system84. New reliably available local power generation capacities could also contribute to ensuring competitive local power generation. Litgrid is currently conducting a pilot battery project to test the potential of battery storage systems under realistic operating conditions of the Lithuanian power system. The test results will help you to evaluate the applications of such batteries and to determine the technical parameters of these devices that best meet the system needs. The project is being implemented to increase frequency management and to ensure system stability and security. Battery storage systems can contribute to maintaining the required level of inertia (function of synthetic inertia) and to ensuring very fast reserves of control power, which would contribute to improving system adequacy in the preparation for synchronous operation with continental European networks. A total of 11 areas where such a battery system could be useful have been identified, most of which are related to frequency management, as well as rapid compensation of power changes, management of network congestion, improvement of energy quality and a dynamic stability and emergency reserve.                                                              82 https://www.entsoe.eu/outlooks/midterm/ 83 https://enmin.lrv.lt/uploads/enmin/documents/files/LEES_adekvatumo_vertinimo_santrauka.pdf 84 rted into another type of energy and returned to the grid as electricity (including electric batteries, the Kruonis Pumped Storage Plant, capacitors, compressed air or hydrogen storages). 3.

In Lithuania, the project will cover the national territorial waters of in the Baltic Sea, the municipalities of Palanga town and Kretinga district. The Harmony Link cable project will be implemented by the Polish electricity transmission system operator PSE and the Lithuanian electricity transmission system operator AB LITGRID. This project expects to receive support from the CEF (the project is also on the list of projects of common interest, after the Synchronization project). The project is planned to be implemented in several phases, including studies on the implementation of the interconnector project to be completed in the third quarter of 2021, spatial planning on the Lithuanian side, the solutions of which should be implemented and registered in 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 156   the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as interconnector design, equipment manufacturing and construction contract work from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the scheduled start of operation of the interconnector (offshore cable) in the fourth quarter of 2025;  impact assessment processes are scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022, while and the start of operation of the newly constructed switch yard is scheduled for the second quarter of 2025.  The project is on the list of projects of common interest to be supported by the CEF.  Gas sector The gas transmission infrastructure part includes the following national strategic initiatives:  to acquire a floating storage regasification unit (FSRU);  to build a gas interconnector between Poland and Lithuania (GIPL project);  to upgrade and develop the natural gas transmission system by installing smart remote control system equipment and optimizing system capacity;  to implement the EU gas network codes;  to increase enhance the Latvia-Lithuania interconnection (ELLI project);  to upgrade and develop the natural gas transmission system by installing smart remote control system equipment and optimizing system capacity;  to deploy smart metering devices for natural gas customers (on condition of positive results of the cost-benefit analysis).  For regional cooperation, see: 1.4. section. For funding, see also sections 3.3 and 2.3 concerning CEF projects.   Market integration  The Lithuanian energy sector will undergo major changes up to 2030. They will primarily take place in the electricity sector, where a growing share of decentralized generation will require major structural changes. Ongoing technology-neutral auctions increase the share of local power generation each year, but also create additional challenges such as system balancing. With the introduction of smart meters a growing number of prosumers, a legal framework is being developed for the aggregator mechanism, which, having three different types of users, would create preconditions for demand-side response and avoid a part of the peaks in the electricity demand market. To analyse the possibilities of connecting/integrating electricity and gas markets, an analysis of applicability and relevance of power-to-gas technology for Lithuania will be carried product consumers will be questioned and a technology review will be prepared in 2020. The NEIS Action Plan 2021-2022 envisages a feasibility study to assess the transformation of the Lithuanian natural gas sector in the context of adapting to an economy based on clean energy production. DSO is developing a data hub, which will be implemented in several steps:  a standard for electricity suppliers will be developed and introduced by 2020, modifying the existing information technology systems;  a joint platform for data collection and exchange (data hub) will be created by 2023.  3.

ERK21. Aggregation of electricity demand and generation. Independent demand aggregators wishing to participate in the provision of electricity balancing and reserve power services will mobilize electricity consumers and generators interested in responding to electricity market supply and demand signals and incentive payments from the transmission system operator by offering opportunities to reduce or increase normal power consumption mode. Demand-side management measures will not only make for more efficient use of electricity, but will also optimize the use of the capacities of the transmission and distribution networks and generation. Independent aggregators will contribute to the flexibility of the Lithuanian electricity system and encourage the development of new and innovative energy start-ups. ERK26. To promote the integration of electricity storage facilities and services into the electricity market. 'Energy storage' means the postponement of the final use of electricity in the electricity system to a point after its production or conversion of electricity into a form of energy that can be stored, storage of such energy and the subsequent conversion of such energy into electricity or into a different energy carrier. Consumers and market participants will be enabled to consume, store and sell the electricity generated by them on the market and to participate in all electricity markets, contributing to the flexibility of the electricity system through energy storage.  The electricity system in Lithuania is changing fundamentally. The growing share of electricity from renewable energy sources in the electricity generation basket forces system operators to integrate both renewable and conventional power plants in a responsible manner. Consumer behaviour and market access are becoming increasingly important, and consumers are being motivated to adapt their electricity consumption to real market prices and the situation in the system. When installing smart meters (smart metering of natural gas under ERK17. is treated as a part of measure EE4.), lays down requirements for smart metering, which include not only remote reading but also functionalities related to improving the quality of services. The expected rapid development of electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies will have a major impact on the functioning of electricity systems. Therefore, customers who are able to adapt to changing                                                            85Indicative funding requirement. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 166   conditions will play an increasingly important role in ensuring sound management of electricity systems and rational investments in distribution systems. Incentives will be available to customers who are able to change consumption patterns flexibly and contribute to a more stable functioning of the systems. Lithuanian DSO is implementing a prosumer development plan that removes bureaucratic barriers for prosumers to connect to electricity networks. Consumers operating solar power plants produce electricity for their own use and participate actively in the exchange process with the DSO. Currently, more than 2,500 consumers produce electricity in this way in Lithuania.86 The traditional customer becomes not only a consumer, but also a producer of energy. Renewables and self-generation are the future of energy, a trend that is growing in all advanced countries where the decentralisation of infrastructure is gaining momentum. uggestion, preconditions, development and production permits and in some cases projects are no longer required, the cost of connecting prosumers to the networks has been reduced, enterprises are allowed to become prosumers, the capacity limitation requirements have been revised, the financial incentives for solar installations have been modified, control accounting has been eliminated, and the plan. The aim is to create a sustainable ecosystem for prosumers and ensure its sustainable development. The development of small energy aimed at consumers who produce electricity themselves is one of the priority activities of the Lithuanian Ministry of Energy. Virtual power plants and demand-side management technologies are another important tool. Artificial intelligence and other innovations are changing this area and consumers are no longer passive and can become active players in the market. Technologies such as virtual power plants or electricity demand-side management devices in some cases bring monetary benefits. A virtual power plant is perceived to be composed of many different types of customers  domestic customers, electric cars and businesses - who can change their consumption and production behaviour according to their needs. A survey carried out by the international consultancy E4tech in Lithuania showed that a household consumer providing virtual power plant services in Lithuania could potentially earn up to EUR 300400 in additional income per year. The British market model was used for the calculations.87 Ignitis group, the largest State-controlled holding of energy undertakings, has invested in Moixa, a British company that develops battery and virtual power plant technologies. Another investment was also made in the Estonian start-up Fusebox, which is developing a platform to help businesses change their electricity consumption behaviour. The Plan of implementing measures for the Lithuanian National Strategy for the Development of Renewable Energy Sources88 provided for the design and implementation of support schemes to facilitate the use of renewable energy sources, prioritising projects with the highest impact at the lowest cost and ensuring that any potential investor can participate in renewable energy activities through transparent, simple, non-discriminatory and public selection procedures. According to the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on Electricity,89 a vulnerable electricity consumer is a household electricity consumer who receives (himself and/or through persons residing with him) and/or is                                                            86 https://www.eso.lt/download/208922/gaminan%C4%8Di%C5%B3%20vartotoj%C5%B3%20statistika%202019-10-18.pdf 87 https://nlea.lt/data/public/uploads/2019/05/elektros-energijos-ir-gamtiniu-duju-rinku-apzvalga_2019-geguze.pdf 88 https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/TAIS.377162/asr 89 Law of the Republic of Lithuania on Electricity: https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/TAR.F57794B7899F/mouDoNqiIt 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 167   entitled to social assistance in cash in accordance with the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on Cash Social Assistance to Low-income Residents and who, in accordance with the procedure laid down in this Law and its implementing legislation, is entitled to additional guarantees available for vulnerable consumers. Additional measures to protect the rights and legitimate interests of vulnerable consumers:  vulnerable customers may not be subjected to restriction of and/or disconnection from electricity supply and/or transmission for failure to pay the bill for the electricity transmission service or other related services within a specified period in full or in part, if the amount owed to the distribution system operator or supplier by those vulnerable customers is or was equal to or less than 3 basic social benefits, except in the cases provided for in Article 71 and Article 72 (1) and (3) of the Law on Electricity;  failure by vulnerable customers to pay for the electricity supplied or to pay, in full or in part, for the electricity transmission service or other related services within the prescribed period may not result in termination of electricity supply and/or transmission on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, public holidays or the day before a public holiday or when the average daily air temperature is below -15 °C or above +30 °C, except in the cases provided for in Article 71 and Article 72 (1) and (3) of the Law on Electricity. In such cases, supply to the customer may be terminated on the day after the situations referred to in this paragraph have ended, provided that the vulnerable customer has been warned in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Electricity Supply and Use Rules and other legislation implementing the Law on Electricity;  vulnerable customers have the right to settle with the distribution system operator or the supplier by the last day of the month following the calendar month during which the transmission and/or supply of electricity or other related services to the customer takes place, except where extended time limits for payment have been agreed upon at the request of the vulnerable customer;  in the case of vulnerable customers connecting electrical equipment to the electricity networks managed by the distribution system operator, where the connection fee exceeds EUR 600, 60 per cent of the fee is be paid within 10 calendar days of the signing of the service contract to connect the consumer and the remaining part of the fee is paid within 10 calendar days of the completion of the contract work. Provision of the connection service begins when the vulnerable consumer has paid the first instalment of the connection service fee. The distribution system operator notifies the vulnerable customer of the completion of the works specified in the works contract and provide him with the necessary documents for payment in accordance with the procedure laid down in the connection service contract;  in the event of failure by vulnerable customers to pay for the electricity supplied or to pay, in full or in part, for the electricity transmission service or other related services within the prescribed time limit, no default interest can be charged for 3 months from the date of expiry of the time limit.  The NEIS sets the objective of phasing out the regulation of electricity retail prices (ERK20). The aim is to make regulation of electricity retail prices through social tariffs and subject to certain requirements possible only in exceptional cases, thus protecting socially vulnerable electricity consumers and not exacerbating energy poverty in the country. With the liberalization of the market for non-household customers, they are under an obligation, while household consumers have the right, to choose an independent electricity supplier. It is planned that, subject to a political decision: 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION A 168    As a first step, regulation of the final price of electricity will be eliminated as of 1 January 2021 in respect of household customers whose actual electricity consumption exceeds 5,000 kWh during the period from 1 June 2019 to 31 May 2020, as well as for all household customers whose facilities are connected to medium voltage grids, and to relevant communities and community organisations and associations This would not apply to vulnerable consumers, that is to say to those who receive social assistance.  As a second step, final electricity price regulation would be eliminated as of 1 January 2022 in respect of all household customers with an actual electricity consumption of more than 1,000 kWh between 1 June 2020 and 31 May 2021, excluding vulnerable customers.  As a third step, as of 1 January 2023, final electricity prices would no longer be regulated for all household customers and they would have to choose an independent electricity supplier. The Law on Electricity of the Republic of Lithuania90 stipulates that the electricity demand-side management service provider is the person responsible for ensuring that the actual maximum permitted power of a group of electricity consumers corresponds to the sum of maximum permitted powers set by those consumers and the transmission system or distribution system operator. The DSO must ensure non-discriminatory conditions of access to distribution networks for electricity network users and electricity demand-side management service providers, taking into account the technical and electricity demand-side management capabilities. In fixing the caps for transmission, distribution and public supply services and assessing the prices and tariffs submitted by the network operators, the NRA ensures that transmission and distribution system operators are granted appropriate incentives, over both the short and the long term, to increase electrical energy efficiency by enabling the introduction of smart grids, to ensure system security through the provision of systemic services to network users, to develop demand-side management and demand-side response services, as well as to foster the integration of the electricity market and security of supply and to support the related research activities. With a view to improve electrical energy efficiency, when setting the transmission and distribution service price caps and evaluating the prices and rates submitted by the service providers, the NRA assesses the decrease in the operating costs of transmission system and distribution system operators due to the demand, the introduction of demand-side response measures and the development of generation capacity, including savings from the provision of electricity transmission or distribution services or the reduced network investment costs and the optimal operation of the network Regulation of the prices of electricity transmission, distribution and public supply services must be without prejudice to electricity demand-side management, demand-side response, development of electricity capacity and development of services, including:  shifting electricity consumption by consumers from peak times, taking into account electricity production from renewable energy sources, electricity from cogeneration and the development of generation capacity;  electricity savings through demand-side response and with the help of electricity demand-side management service providers;  reducing electricity demand with the help of energy saving service providers;  connection of power plants to networks of appropriate voltage;                                                            90 Lithuanian Law on Electricity: https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/TAR.F57794B7899F/mouDoNqiIt 3.

The Single Baltic-Nordic balancing market is a balancing area coordinated by Baltic and Nordic countries in 2018. In order to develop a common Baltic reserve balancing market for manual activation frequency recovery and to harmonize electricity balancing principles in the Baltic States, the Baltic transmission system operators developed a common Baltic reserve balancing market for manual activation frequency recovery and a Baltic electricity imbalance accounting model (hereinafter referred to as  The single Baltic balancing market has been operational since January 2018. The barrier for entry into the Baltic balancing market has been reduced by lowering the minimum bid volume to 1 MW. Agreement on the development of a regional gas market model in the Baltic States and a common entry/exit tariff regime. The Regional Gas Market Coordination Group (RGMCG) established in 2015 under the BEMIP initiative consists of representatives of ministries of Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, national regulatory authorities, transmission system operators, LNG terminal operators and distribution system role in pursuing the goals set by the BEMIP. Since January 2015, the RGMCG has achieved a number of short- and medium-term milestones in its work by improving the regional gas market in the eastern Baltic Sea. A study on the development of the Finnish-Baltic regional gas market has been completed. The results of the study were taken into account in the follow-up actions by the RGMCG. These actions were included in the Action Plan for the creation of a regional gas market for the next 34 years. This Action Plan sets out the necessary measures to ensure the functioning of the regional gas market in the eastern Baltic Sea, namely:  establishment of a common tariff area between Finland, Estonia and Latvia (FINESLAT) (from 2020);  a common balancing zone of Estonia and Latvia (from 2020);  planned accession of Lithuania to the common area.
