On December 6, 2019 the Government reached an agreement on a new Climate Act with 8 out of the 10 parties in the Danish Parliament. The act will include a legally binding target to reduce greenhouse gases by 70% by 2030 (relative to 1990 level), to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, and to set milestone targets based on a five-year cycle. Moreover, the Danish Government will develop Climate Action Plans that will outline concrete policies to reduce emissions, and these will hence include further information on additional policies and measures in relevant sectors among others. As preliminary estimates indicate that the total amount for LULUCF accounting will be above the limit for Denmark, which is 14.6 Million credits in total for the period 2021-2030, an annual average accounting quantity of 1.46 Million credits per year is shown in chapter 4 on projections for information. It should be noted that the showing of the projected accounting amount in chapter does not indicate whether Denmark will make use of the LULUCF flexibility under the ESR or not.  In addition, on 2 December 2019 the Government reached agreement with the Red-Green Finance Act 2020. In the agreement, the parties agreed to establish a new fund called , which will manage a total of 25 billion DKK. The fund will contribute to the green transition in Denmark and abroad including development and deployment of new technologies, conversion of energy systems to renewable energy, storage and efficient energy use etc. and promote global export of green technologies, particularly in regard to wind. At the same time the fund will contribute to solving the challenges that climate change and a growing world population creates in regard to food shortage and scarcity of water.  Moreover, the parties agreed to allocate a total of 2 billion DKK in the period 2020-2029 with the aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture as much as possible. In addition, the parties noted, that the Government is currently looking into the possibilities of establishing a Forest Fund and has allocated 100 million in the 2020 budget towards the project.   (ii) Where relevant, regional cooperation in this area  One fora where Denmark participates in regional cooperation is the Nordic Council of Ministers. The Nordic Council of Ministers was founded in 1971. Despite the generic name,         83  it consists of several councils. Regional cooperation in the area of climate change takes place through the Nordic Council of Ministers for the Environment and Climate (MR-MK)29.  The Council of Ministers for the Environment and Climate (MR-MK) is responsible for the Nordic inter-governmental co-operation on environmental issues, including on climate change. Its remit includes preserving and enhancing the quality of the environment and life in the Region and exerting influence on regional and international co-operation30. Currently, in MR-MK Denmark is represented by the Minister for Environment when environment is on the agenda and by the Minister for Climate, Energy and Utilities when climate is on the agenda. The Nordic Council of Ministers for the Environment and Climate (MR-MK) has a Committee of Senior Officials for the Environment and Climate (EK-MK), which prepares and follows up on the work of the council and is responsible for ensuring that the Environmental Action Plan is implemented. The Nordic Committee of Senior Officials for the Environment and Climate (EK-MK) has set up a Working Committee (AU) consisting of representatives of national environment agencies, to plan and co-ordinate its activities. Currently, the Danish Environmental Protection Agency represents Denmark in MR-MK and AU. Working Groups under MR-MK/EK-MK/AU relevant to regional cooperation on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction are:     Climate and Air Pollution Group (KoL):  The work of the Climate and Air Pollution Group supports the Nordic objectives of reducing serious climate change and preventing the impact of air pollution on the environment, ecosystems and human health. The outcome is a series of publications31.  The Nordic Council of Ministers' Environmental Co-operation funds projects whose aims are in keeping with the Nordic Environment Action Plan 2013201832 and/or the programme of the annual Presidency. At least three Nordic countries must take part in the project, which must generate clear Nordic synergy. The Climate and Air Pollution Group (KOL) invites applications for contributions to Nordic projects that support the implementation of the Nordic Environmental Action Programme and the priorities of the Climate and Air Pollution Group. The Climate and Air Pollution Group is working to limit and prevent serious climate change and transboundary air pollution, as well as to limit and prevent air pollution from causing harm to human health33.                                                            29 http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/council-of-ministers/nordic-council-of-ministers-for-the-environment-and-climate-mr-mk/nordic-council-of-ministers-for-the-environment-and-climate  30 The most recent outcomes are available here: http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/council-of-ministers/nordic-council-of-ministers-for-the-environment-and-climate-mr-mk/strategy  31 http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/council-of-ministers/nordic-council-of-ministers-for-the-environment-and-climate-mr-mk/institutes-co-operative-bodies-and-working-groups/working-groups/climate-and-air-pollution-group-kol/publications-and-reports  32 http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:701877/FULLTEXT01.pdf  33 http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/council-of-ministers/nordic-council-of-ministers-for-the-environment-and-climate-mr-mk/institutes-co-operative-bodies-and-working-groups/working-groups/climate-and-air-pollution-group-kol/the-climate-and-air-pollution-group2019s-project-funding-in-2018          84   The Nordic working group for global climate negotiations (NOAK):  The group's overarching goal is to contribute to an ambitious and effective implementation of the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement, with a Nordic perspective. The outcome is a series of publications34.  In addition there are also Working Groups under the Nordic Council of Ministers for Sustainable Growth (MR-VÆKST)35 and its Committee of Senior Officials, which are relevant to regional cooperation on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  (iii) Without prejudice to the applicability of state aid rules, financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds, in this area at national level, where applicable  Renewable energy sources are promoted with economic measures, including use of energy and CO2 taxes on fossil fuels and through the Public Service Obligation Schemes (PSO), which have been a supplement to the price of electricity paid by all consumers until 2017. The Danish PSO levy will be phased out during a period of 5 years (2017-2022), and the financing of support to renewables will gradually shift to the State Budget.                                                             34 http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/council-of-ministers/nordic-council-of-ministers-for-the-environment-and-climate-mr-mk/institutes-co-operative-bodies-and-working-groups/working-groups/the-nordic-working-group-for-global-climate-negotiations-noak/publications-and-reports 35 The Nordic countries work together on business, energy and regional policies in order to promote continued positive growth in the Region. The Nordic Council of Ministers for Sustainable Growth consists of ministers responsible for business, energy and regional policy.           85  3.1.2 Renewable energy (i) Policies and measures to achieve the national contribution to the binding 2030 Union target for renewable energy and trajectories as referred to in point (a)(2) Article 4, and, where applicable or available, the elements referred to in point 2.1.2 including sector- and technology-specific measures. On December 6, 2019 the Government reached an agreement on a new Climate Act with 8 out of the 10 parties in the Danish Parliament. The act will include a legally binding target to reduce greenhouse gases by 70% by 2030 (relative to 1990 level), to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, and to set milestone targets based on a five-year cycle. The Government will furthermore adapt climate action plans, which will contribute to ensuring that national reduction targets are met. The climate actions plan will amongst other things include the following initiatives in regard to renewable energy:  - A unified strategy for electrification of the transport sector, industry and society in general. - Investigating the potential for Denmark to prepare a common strategy with the North Sea nations for a significant expansion and exploitation of the offshore wind potential. - Investigating the potential for Denmark to construct the first energy island by 2030, with a minimum of 10 GW connected.  In addition, on 2 December 2019 the Government reached agreement with the Red-Green Finance Act 2020. The parties agreed, among other things, to initiate a screening of Danish waters that can identify locations suitable for future offshore wind, which also will include screening for potential locations for a so--and-th minimum 10 GW offshore wind capacity connected. The parties further agreed to allocate funds in support of large-scale power-to-X technologies. The parties agreed to allocate 30 million DKK in 2020, 27 million DKK in 2021 and 8 million DKK in 2022. Moreover, Denmark has already taken the first steps towards establishing a professional and efficient energy sector as the basis for the transition to a sustainable green society.  With the 2018 Energy Agreement, the parties in the Danish Parliament have agreed to work for net zero carbon dioxide emission in accordance with the Paris Agreement and net zero carbon dioxide emission in the EU and Denmark by 2050 at the latest. With the initiatives outlined in the Energy Agreement of 2018, Denmark has allocated funding that sets the course towards a renewables share of approximately 55 % by 2030.  In the coming years, the capacity of renewable energy is expected to expand significantly. In the electricity sector new capacity is primarily expected to be solar PV and wind, but also solid biomass will play an important role in the conversion of the remaining central power plants still operating on coal.         86  Denmark has over the last years gradually moved from fixed support for renewable energy to more competitive bidding and marked based support schemes. In the coming years Denmark will continue the path towards more marked based solutions e.g. through tendering. Technology neutral tenders for wind and solar PV will be conducted again in 2019, and further renewable technologies are to be included in the technology neutral tenders conducted from 2020-2024.  In the case of offshore wind tenders agreed upon in previous energy agreements, contracts have been signed for 400 MW to initiate commercial operation in 2020, 600 MW to initiate commercial operation in 2021 and 350 MW expected to initiate commercial operation in 2023. Additional tenders for three offshore wind parks of a total of at least 2,400 MW have also been decided. The decision rests upon the prerequisites mentioned in section 1.1. To support the continuant renewable capacity increase, Denmark will implement new financial support schemes for a range of technologies as described under point iii) below. The production and consumption of renewables go hand in hand. Therefore Denmark wants to ensure better incentives for use of renewable energy over fossil alternatives. Denmark is phasing out the public service obligation originally put on the electricity bill to finance support for renewables. At the same time, the parties of the 2018 Energy Agreement agreed to reduce the electrical heating tax to approximately 0.15 DKK/kWh (2018 prices), effective from 2021.The tax reduction constitutes a follow-up on the Agreement on Business and Entrepreneur Initiatives36. This initiative will make the tax on electrical heat slightly lower than the tax on fossil fuels for heating per GJ. Therefore it is expected an increase in the use of individual heat pumps and heat pumps in district heating systems. It also increases the incentive for utilising surplus heat. As a result of the shift towards electrical heating, the tax reduction contributes to reducing carbon emissions in non-quota sectors. It will also make electrical heat more attractive relative to wood-burning stoves, thereby lowering particle emissions. This means that electricity produced on renewable sources will become more competitive with other energy sources. The parties of the 2018 Energy Agreement agree to work for a modernised heating. The regulatory bindings on the choice of fuels for smaller district heating areas were terminated in January 2019. It is expected to leave way for more renewable heating as a substitute for natural gas. As well from January 2019, a stop for the connection obligations for new customers will give individual consumers freedom to choose their own renewable heating options, as these have been made more competitive.                                                             36 https://eng.em.dk/news/2017/november/agreement-on-business-and-entrepreneurial-initiatives/          87  Increasing the renewable penetration in the heating and cooling sector further requires thorough decarbonisation of the district heating sector and especially of individual heating based on natural gas and oil fired burners. The energy policy agreement includes a support scheme of 80 million DKK for replacing oil burners with electric heat pumps to further this goal. Also a strategy for the future gas grid is being developed in order to ascertain the potential uses and required policies related to the gas system as part of the green transition. Surplus heat has the potential to fill a small but substantial part of the district heating system with an estimated potential of 12-18 PJ. The current utilization of surplus heat is approx. 5 PJ compared to a total district heating production of around 135 PJ. The share is expected to rise to approx. 9 PJ in 2025 as a result of lowered electricity taxes and the 2019 policy agreement on increased utilization of surplus heat. This development will be monitored and the new measures evaluated in 2022. In transport, according to present Danish legislation, suppliers must blend at least 5.75 % of biofuels in the transport fuel they put on the market. From January 1, 2020, they must blend in at least 0.9 % of advanced biofuels.  The proposal of the Government to prolong the exemption from registration tax for electric vehicles until the end of 2020 was passed in December 2018.   (ii) Where relevant, specific measures for regional cooperation, as well as an option, the estimated excess production of energy from renewable sources which could be transferred to other Member States in order to achieve the national contribution and trajectories referred to in point 2.1.2 Denmark has entered a cooperation agreement with Germany which will result in statistical transfers from Denmark to Germany, corresponding to the electricity production from 50 MW solar PV financially supported by Germany.  Denmark cooperates with other European and non-European countries on renewable energy in a number of fora. The European policy fora include CA-RES (RES in EU), BEMIP (RES and other topics in countries around the Baltic Sea), North Seas Energy Cooperation (Offshore wind in the North Sea), and Nordic council of ministers (RES and other topics in the Nordic countries) (see section 1.4.1). Denmark also actively collaborate with other countries in the IEA Renewable Energy Working Party. On cooperation regarding renewable gas, the Danish TSO, Energinet, issues biomethane certificates for every MWh of biomethane injected into the natural gas grid. Upon request, certificates are issued to biogas producers serving as documentation for the amount of biogas fed into the grid. In order to receive certificates, each producer must register with a specific database operated by Energinet. Certificates can be traded across member states, but at present, the renewable share is counted towards the national Danish renewables target. Denmark works in the North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC) to coordinate the timing of tenders, to exchange best practices on the design for offshore wind support schemes and         88  to identify, where possible, common principles as well as possible options for alignment of support. For more information see section 1.4.1.   Nordic co-operation on renewable energy  The Nordic countries make considerable efforts to develop and increase the use of renewable energy, aiming to diversify the energy system and to be less dependent on import of energy sources such as fossil fuels, and to reduce the CO2 emissions. The Working Group for Renewable Energy (AGFE)  consisting of experts from the Ministries and energy authorities in the five Nordic countries  supports the Nordic countries policy and development work in renewable energy sector by exchanging information and enhancing the collaboration between Nordic countries. In addition, AGFE disseminate information about relevant projects commissioned by AGFE tackling different issues on renewable energy in the Nordics. Most recently AGFE has looked at: renewable energy system support in the Nordics, how new EU sustainability criteria for biomass will affect the Nordics and finally, an assessment of the emerging trend of distributed electricity production and self-consumption.   AGFE aims to strengthen Nordic added value through projects that would usually occur nationally, but where positive effects are created through a Nordic joint effort. The group works to develop and manifest Nordic collaboration, and thereby increase Nordic competencies and competitiveness. AGFE also strives to develop Nordic perspectives on emerging policies and regulations within EU. Some of AGFE's recent activities are listed below:  In 2018, AGFE initiated a study on Distributed energy production and self-consumption in the Nordics. The aim of the study is to review the current situation and future prospect of decentralized energy production and the transition where consumers such as households are also becoming producers. The regulations and policies in the Nordic countries concerning distributed electricity production and self-consumption are discussed, and eventual barriers to a sound development identified. The study was published in June 2019 and provides useful information for policy makers and other stakeholders and will contribute to fulfil coming requirements according to the revised EU directive on renewable energy (REDII). AGFE works for enhanced Nordic co-operation on implementing the current EU renewable energy directive (REDI) to 2020 as well as preparing for the revised directive (REDII).  As a set of new forest biomass sustainability criteria were proposed in RED II, AGFE in 2017 commissioned a study on the emerging Bioenergy Sustainability Policy and its possible This work contributed to the process of revising the Directive and increasing the knowledge of its impact on the bioenergy sector in the Nordic region.  the purpose to investigate the impact of the revised State Aid Guidelines on current Nordic         89  support schemes designed to promote renewable energy. The study contributed to the discussions regarding the design of Nordic support schemes. (iii) Specific measures on financial support, where applicable including Union support and the use of Union funds, for the promotion of the production and use of energy from renewable sources in electricity, heating and cooling, and transport  Denmark has a long history of subsidizing electricity from renewable energy. Wind power has been supported through a variety of measures since the 1970s. Later, support schemes have been established for both electricity from biomass, biogas and solar PV. Based on the recommendations of The Energy Commission among others, Denmark has shifted from technology specific support to a higher degree of technology neutrality and a more marked based approach through e.g. multi-technology tenders. Electricity from wind power and solar PV Denmark has conducted tenders of support for offshore wind parks and signed contracts for 400 MW to start production in 2019, 350 MW is being planned to start production in 2020 and 600 MW to start production in 2021. Additional tenders for three offshore wind parks of at least 800 MW each have been decided in the policy agreement of June 2018.  Denmark has held the first technology neutral tender of support for wind power and solar PV in 2018 and will arrange the second round in 2019. The installations are expected to start production in 2020 and 2021. The policy agreement of June 2018 includes further technology neutral tenders in the period 2020-2024, which will also include wave and hydropower technologies among other things. The June 2018 political agreement also include a reserve of 400 million DKK in 2025 and 500 million DKK annually for further efforts from 2026 to promote renewable energy.  Denmark also has specific support schemes for wind turbines with a testing purpose.  In the North Seas Energy Cooperation, Denmark contributes to analysing and developing options for further mobilisation of investment capital for joint projects, for instance through EU funds such as the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) as well as institutional investors. Such joint projects could be cross-border projects for renewable energy in accordance with the CEF proposal.  Promotion of the use of electricity Denmark has by far the highest general consumption taxes on electricity in the EU. As the renewables share in electricity steadily increases, the Danish Parliament wishes to improve incentives for the use of electricity over other types of energy, especially in the heating sector. For that purpose it is agreed gradually to reduce the electricity taxes in the period from 2019-2025.           90  The tax on electricity for heating purposes will be reduced to 0.15 DKK/kWh from year 2021. The general electricity tax will be reduced from 0.91 DKK/kWh (2018) to 0.77 DKK/kWh in 2025. For certain types of businesses the electricity tax will be reduced to the EU-minimum level. A special task force has been set up with the purpose to analyse if the present tariffs and tax regime can be optimized to better support demand side management and flexible energy consumption. The report from the task force is to be finished primo 2020. Moreover, the upcoming climate action plans will include a unified strategy for electrification of the transport sector, industry and society in general. Biogas The use of biogas for certain purposes is supported financially. More specifically, end-users are eligible for different types of direct grants when biogas is used to produce electricity or heat, upgraded to biomethane, used as a fuel in the transport sector or used in industrial processes.   In the June 2018 Energy Agreement it was decided to phase out the current biogas support schemes by 2020. This implies that no new installations can enter the existing subsidy schemes from January 1, 2020 and that existing installations will continue to receive support for a fixed depreciation period.  Electricity and heat from solid biomass The electricity production from the use of solid biomass is supported with a fixed premium of 0.15 DKK/kWh. The scheme ran for 10 years until April 2019 and covers existing and new biomass CHP plants. The fixed premium scheme, in combination with tax exemption on biomass fuels for heat production, has been a strong driver in recent years for the fuel switch from coal and gas. The policy agreement of June 2018 establishes the future support system after April 1, 2019.  There are in total 3 support schemes: 1) Existing non depreciated installations will continue with a fixed premium of 0.15 DKK /kWh in the entire depreciation period.  2) Depreciated installation will be supported by a fixed premium calculated on basis of the difference in operating cost in using biomass compared to an alternative fossil reference.  3) For new installations after April 1, 2019 a grant pool is established, which would give the possibility of aid for new capacity for the production of electricity using biomass, biogas and other green gasses after application.   The latter two new schemes are to be notified to the European Commission.             91  Transport In the Energy Agreement from June 2018 there has been made a reservation on an amount of 500 million DKK for the years 2020-2024  100 million DKK a year for the transport sector. The pool shall be used to support green solutions in the transport sector. The specific initiatives will be developed further. Furthermore, as an element in the agreement on business and entrepreneurial initiatives of 12 November 2017, there has been made a reservation on 140 million DKK to support the production of advanced biofuel. It is yet to be decided how these 140 million DKK can support the production of advanced biofuel.  In addition, the Government will work for the transition of the transport sector. For more information see section 3.1.3 (iii) Policies and measures to achieve low-emission mobility (including electrification of transport).   Heating and Cooling  Since 2015, two smaller support schemes totalling 106 million DKK have supported investments in electric heat pumps for district heating production. Also two smaller support schemes have been enacted to support the deployment of electric heat pumps for individual households and companies by energy service providers as part of a market maturation strategy. The Energy policy agreement from June 2018 lifts the prohibition of direct heat production based on biomass at decentralized natural gas fired combined heat and power plants.  Further, a technology neutral support scheme of 114 million DKK for investments in heat production capacity at decentralized natural gas-based district heating plants is being established from 2020. This scheme will support investments in electric heat pumps, biomass boilers and solar thermal plants. In addition, the aforementioned support schemes for deployment of individual heat pump installations by energy service providers have been expanded by 80 million DKK for the replacement of oil boilers for individual households and 70 million DKK for electrical heat pumps in discontinued district heating areas. These measures are expected to boost the deployment of electrical heat pumps compared to the use of biomass burners and to incentivise the phasing out of natural gas primarily in the district heating sector and oil boilers in the individual heating sector. The heat pumps are expected to utilize a variety of low-temperature heat sources such as air, ground and sea water as well as intermediate temperature sources such as geothermal energy and low grade surplus heat. From 2020 133 million DKK/year is earmarked for promotion of use of surplus heat which is projected to increase the utilization of surplus heat by approximately 35 % by 2025. As a result of these measures combined with the lowered tax on electricity for heat production, the utilization of surplus heat is projected to increase from app. 5 PJ to approximately 9 PJ in 2025. This number is expected to rise further approaching 2030.         92  The Energy policy agreement also includes a series of policies amending administrative and legislative barriers to the deployment and expansion of district cooling networks from 2020. According to the Comprehensive Assessment of the Potential for High-Efficient Cogeneration and Efficient District Heating and Cooling and in Denmark, the total cooling potential is around 5.000 MW, of which approximately 40 % could be covered by district cooling networks. The effects of the mentioned policy measures have not yet been estimated. (iv) Where applicable, the assessment of the support for electricity from renewable sources that Member States have to carry out pursuant to Article 6 (4) of the Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. A thorough assessment of Danish taxes and subsidies in the energy sector was published from 2016 to 2018. This analysis has informed later policymaking and does among other things form part of the background for the ongoing shift from technology specific support to a higher degree of technology neutrality and the shift from financing support for renewable electricity via a tariff on electricity consumption to financing on the state budget. The assessment consists of six parts which can be read (in Danish) at the following links: Part 1: Development in tax and subsidy base https://www.skm.dk/media/1827192/Afgifts-og-tilskudsanalysen-delanalyse-1.pdf Part 2: Costs of public obligations https://www.skm.dk/media/1827200/Afgifts-og-tilskudsanalysen-delanalyse-2.pdf  Part 3: The extent of non-regulated externalities of energy consumption https://www.skm.dk/media/1827208/Afgifts-og-tilskudsanalysen-delanalyse-3.pdf  Part 4: Effects of the tax and subsidy system on integration of green energy http://www.skm.dk/media/1596491/afgifts-og-tilskudsanalysens-delanalyse-4_19042018_samlet.pdf  Part 5: Utilisation of surplus heat https://www.skm.dk/media/1827224/Afgifts-og-tilskudsanalysen-delanalyse-5.pdf  Part 6: Future support for onshore wind https://www.skm.dk/media/1827232/Afgifts-og-tilskudsanalysen-delanalyse-6.pdf (v) Specific measures to introduce one or more contact points, streamline administrative procedures, provide information and training, and facilitate the uptake of power purchase agreements. Summary of the policies and measures under the enabling framework Member States have to put in place pursuant to Articles 21(6) and  Article 22(5) of Directive (EU) 2018/X on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources] to promote and facilitate the development of renewable self-consumption and renewable energy communities         93  The administrative procedures regarding permit granting for offshore wind has been simplified in recent years by the establishment of a single contact point handled by the Danish Energy Agency. The agency acts as a one stop shop and is responsible for delivering the final permission regarding feasibility studies, construction and production. The Agency is also responsible for coordinating input from other relevant authorities.  Denmark is in the preparation for the national implementation of article 15 and 16 in the revised Renewables Directive regarding streamlining administrative procedures and the set-up of national contact points for renewable energy projects. Electricity used for self-consumption is supported by an exemption from electricity tax. At present, the tax on electricity for private consumers is 0.88 DKK/kWh plus VAT and network tariffs. This gives an economic incentive for self-consumption in buildings. As of February 2019 the pre grid connection application procedure for self-consumption through instant settlement has been removed. Instead, the self-consumer can connect the renewable installation to the grid and then afterwards notify the local distribution system operator. The new simplified rules minimize the administration and avoid long processing times.   In Denmark there is a long tradition for establishing renewable energy communities especially in the district heating sector and renewable electricity production.  Denmark is in the preparation for the national implementation of article 21 and 22 regarding an enabling framework for renewable self-consumption and renewable energy communities.   In May 2019, Nordic Energy Research published a study, initiated by the Nordic council of ministers and carried out by SWECO and Oslo Economics, on Distributed energy production and self-consumption in the Nordics. The aim was to review the current situation and future prospect of decentralized energy production and self-consumption. The report describes some perceived barriers identified by consumers, e.g. complex regulation, tax-rules, several different support schemes etc. The report however, does not identify administrative barriers to a sound development for self-consumption in Denmark. An independent consultancy firm has on behalf of the Danish Energy Agency conducted an analysis of the Danish market for power purchase agreements (PPA). None of the identified barriers were due to the regulatory framework. The identified barriers were mainly driven by a lack of demand (due to the characteristics of the Danish industry with few large  (vi) Assessment of the necessity to build new infrastructure for district heating and cooling produced from renewable energy sources  Denmark is rapidly phasing out fossil fuels for the production of heat and power. The latest Energy Agreement from June 2018 is expected to give Denmark a renewable share in electricity above 100 % of consumption, while ensuring that at least 90 % of district heating consumption is based on energy sources other than coal, oil or gas by 2030. It is a political priority to achieve the increase through market mechanisms.          94  An analysis of modernised heating is being conducted to assess the expected transition paths. This analysis will allow for further assessment of the possible need for new infrastructure and is expected finalized early in the second half of 2019. The analysis focuses on legislative constraints in the district heating and individual household heating sectors and is set to form the basis of new policies for the completion of the green transition for the heating sectors in Denmark driven by market mechanisms. (vii) Where applicable, specific measures on the promotion of the use of energy from biomass, especially for new biomass mobilisation taking into account:  - biomass availability, including sustainable biomass: both domestic potential and imports from third countries  - other biomass uses by other sectors (agriculture and forest-based sectors); as well as measures for the sustainability of biomass production and use  Denmark currently has no specific measures that promote the production of electricity from new biomass installations after 2020. Considerations regarding the promotion of new installations (as outlined in the Energy Agreement from 2018) are currently undergoing. Biomass for heating is promoted by the absence of energy and CO2 taxes on heat from renewable sources. In 2014, the Danish energy sector laid down principles for a set of sustainability criteria for the use of solid biomass in energy production. The purpose and principles are set up as a voluntary industry agreement, to encourage the industry's members and branches to the purchase of sustainable biomass. See section 2.1.2 for a further description of this agreement. As mentioned, in the present setup the electricity production from the use of solid biomass in existing installations is supported with a fixed premium of 0.15 DKK/kWh. This fixed premium scheme has been a supplement to tax exemption on biomass fuels for heat production.            95  3.1.3 Other elements of the dimension (i) Where applicable, national policies and measures affecting the EU ETS sector and assessment of the complementarity and impacts on the EU ETS  Not applicable.  consumption mentioned in Table 137 will have an effect on both CO2 emissions under EU ETS38 and greenhouse gas emissions under ESR39, as mentioned in chapter 3.1.1, assessments of the separate effect on the EU ETS sector have not been carried out. (ii) Policies and measures to achieve other national targets, where applicable  UNFCCC40 and under the EU Monitoring Mechanism Regulation (MMR) cf. Table 8, there are several policies and measures, which will also contribute to the achievement of the expected national share on renewable energy in 2030.41  (iii) Policies and measures to achieve low-emission mobility (including electrification of transport) It requires a comprehensive green transformation of the transport sector to renewable energy in order to reach the goal of becoming a climate neutral economy. Moreover, concrete and ambitious measures for all modes of transport are needed in order to achieve significant reductions in emissions from the transport sector. Today, the Danish state-owned rail network is only partially electrified, though there is currently several large electrification projects being carried out on the main rail lines in the country. This electrification will enable railway sector operations to contribute to the overall target of the transport sector to reduce fossil fuel emissions. Hereto the biggest train operator in Denmark is currently in the proces of buying electrified trains to replace older diesel trains for the future train operations on main rail lines of Denmark. In addition to the electrification af the Danish state-owned rail network we have been expanding the metrosystem in Copenhagen with the Cityring, that opened in September 2019. Further expansions of the metro system in Copenhagen will follow in 2020 and 2025. Expanding the metro system further contributes to the overall target of reducing fossil fuel emissions in the transport sector. Furthermore, the Danish state has provided grants for the establishment of light rail transits play a role in a future of green public transport services as well as making public transport an attractive alternative to private motoring.                                                             37 names starting with TD, EN, BU, TR or HO. 38 Directive 2003/87/EC 39 Regulation 2018/842 40 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 41 Directly this includes EN-2, EN-3, EN-4, EN-5, BU-8 and TR-8 in Table 1 and indirectly TD-1b, TD-2, TD-3, TD-4, TD-5, TD-6 and TD-7 in Table 1.         96  transit in Odense is expected to open in 2021, and the one in the Copenhagen area is planned to open in 2025. Moreover, environmental impact declarations are underway on further lines in Aarhus and Odense, to which the Danish state has also provided grants. Public busses are also undergoing a transformation towards greener fuel alternatives. Across the country low or zero emission busses are prioritized. By the end of 2019, it is estimated that approximately 11 percent of all public busses will use a green fuel alternative. It is expected, that these numbers will increase in the near future.   The green transition in the transport sector is also evident in the taxi industry. This is partly driven by governmental legislation which secures that all new taxies from 2025 will be zero-emission vehicles. Furthermore, the Danish state experiences a great interest towards the permission to drive in zero-emission taxies.  Passenger cars are responsible for around 60 % of the greenhousegas emissions from the transport sector in Denmark, so the Danish Government finds it essential to ensure significantly more electric vehicles on the roads. A Commission for Green Transition of passenger cars has the objective to deliver recommendations on specific policy measures to promote green cars such as electric and plug-in hybrids, recommendations on infrastructural requirements to the electrical system and charging network to support the green transition of passenger cars. The Danish Government expects to prepare a political strategy when the recommendations from the Commission are available. The Danish Government would also like to start discussions in EU on a transition to a fleet of zero emission passenger cars as the Commissioner for Internal Market, Industry, the Danish Parliament with the aim of eventually phasing out new diesel and petrol cars in the EU. The Danish Government had therefore asked for this subject to be brought up as an AOB item at the Council meeting for ministers for environment on the 4th of October 2019, and the Danish Government will work to continue this discussion. The Danish Government will negogiate an infrastructure agreement, which will consider climate and environmental issues to a much higher degree. This requires invenstments in public transportation and cycling, among other things A fair d. At the same time, the Danish Government will work for initiatives aimed at ensuring more sustainable air transport. This can be achieved through European solutions.  included in Table 8 (for further information see Annex 8), there are policies and measures,         97  which will also contribute to the achievement of low-emission mobility and/or electrification of transport.42  In the Energy Agreement from June 2018 a reservation has been made in an amount of 500 million DKK for the years 2020-2024  100 million DKK a year for the transport sector. The pool shall be used to support green solutions in the transport sector. The specific initiatives will be developed further.  Furthermore, as an element in the agreement on business and entrepreneurial initiatives of 12 November 2017, there has been made a reservation on 140 million DKK to support the production of advanced biofuel. It is yet to be decided how these 140 million DKK can support the production of advanced biofuel.   In addition, on 2 December 2019 the Government reached agreement with the Red-Green Finance Act 2020. The parties agreed to prepare concrete initiatives in regard to how requirements can accelerate the transition to green busses and taxies towards 2030. The parties moreover agreed to allocate 75 million DKK in 2020 to a scheme to support and accelerate the transition towards greener busses.   Moreover, the parties agreed to prioritize bicycling, which supports and further develops green mobility. The parties agreed to allocate 50 million DKK in 2020 to fund half the cost of municipal bicycling projects. As such the scheme will promote investments for a total of 100 m DKK towards promotion of bicycling. Finally, the parties agreed to cancel the planned registration tax increase in 2020 on green cars. The parties also agreed to introduce a tax deduction on green company cars on 40,000 DKK from April 1 2020 to December 21 2020.  (iv) Where applicable, national policies, timelines and measures planned to phase out energy subsidies, in particular for fossil fuels  Denmark provides subsidies for renewable energy technologies, e.g. onshore wind, offshore wind, solar PV, biomass and biogas. Subsidies are given as production subsidy per kWh, normally for a limited number of years. The costs of renewable technologies is steadily declining, and becoming competitive with fossil fuel sources. It is a political objective to promote future electricity production from renewable energy on market conditions free of subsidies.  Subsidy systems for renewable energy will increasingly be market oriented. As of 2018 the subsidies for future onshore wind and solar PV will be offered through a tendering procedure, allowing these technologies to compete against each other and provide a                                                            42 This includes TR-1a, TR-8, TR-10 and TR-12.          98  downward pressure on the subsidy level. Later more technologies will be included in the tenders and allow these to compete for support. For more information see section 4.6.iv.   In Denmark no direct subsidies to fossil fuels are given. In a report from 2019 the Commission, among other things, assessed the size of subsidies to fossil energy among the member states. In this report, Denmark is regarded to have indirect fossil subsidies especially in the form of exemptions from taxes for fuels to domestic sea- and air transport and exemption from taxes for electricity for certain types of transport. The report was written by the consultancy Trinomics, and the consultancy has identified 13 subsidies to fossil fuels in Danmark (see Table 9).  Table 9 Subsidy Average size, mill. EUR Excise tax exemption on inland sea transport and fishery 72.1 Tax exemption for fuels and electricity for trains 59.6 Higher tax deductions for investment in fossil fuel extraction infrastructure 30.1 Act on energy saving obligations 23.3 Excise tax exemption for domestic aviation 19.7 Act to support power from distric heating, based on e.g. natural gas 15.4 Aviation in EU ETS 3.2 Public R&D expenditures  Oil and gas: 2.2 Coal: 0.15  Other fossils: 0.8  Note: The average size is for most of the subsidies for the period 2008-16. The Green Check is excluded from the list, as it is not a fossil subsidy. It was introduced in 2010 to compensate persons with relatively low incomes for increased environmental and energy taxes etc. in relation to the so ore has a purpose related to distribution policy and has a neglectable effect for the energy consumption in Danish households. Source: Trinomics mentions several sources for this data, including IEA, EEA, EC, CIRCABC for R&D, ETS and tax exemptions. Moreover the Danish Energy Agency, Ministry of Taxation and Statistics Denmark are being refered to.   Some of the indirect subsidies mentioned in table 8 are already being phased out, including act on energy saving obligations and act to support power from district heating. The levels uses of fossil energy  have lower tax rates or are fully exempted from tax, for example energy to farms and horticultures, mineral and metallurgical processes and oil- and gas extraction in the North Sea. Typically the lower taxes on energy for industrial processes etc. are due to the fact that the relevant firms are facing fierce international competition.  Denmark has a very ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions with 70 percent in 2030 compared to 1990 level. Denmark therefore plans to further investigate the topic of fossil fuel subsidies in the coming years in order to effectively reach the target.         99  Denmark has for many years been working internationally for phasing out fossil fuels. Denmark has since 2010 been a member of the coalition Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform, the F-FFSR-group, together with Sweden, Norway, Finland, Switzerland, New Zealand, Ethiopia, Costa Rica and Uruguay. The coalition works for promoting the phasing out of ineffective fossil fuel subsidies through Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidy Refrom. The group has, since the G20 countries decided to phase out ineffective subsidies for fossil fuels in 2009, been seeking to hold the G20 countries accountable to this goal. During the G20 meetings, Denmark is as a rule represented through the embassies in the respective country for the G20 meeting, and is thereby exercising direct influence. The F-FFSR-group also co-finances the Global Subsidies Initiative43. The Global Subsdies Initiative analyses the extent and the effects of subsidies to fossil fuels, including in different emerging and developing economies.                                                                43 https://www.iisd.org/gsi/about
