4.3. Energy efficiency dimension 4.3.1.i. Current primary and final energy consumption in the economy and by sector (including industry, residential, service and transport)  Primary energy consumption dropped by around 8.7% between 2008 and 2018. The period between 2010 and 2018 accounted for 7.7% of this drop. Final energy consumption fell by 2.1% between 2008 and 2018; between 2010 and 2018 final energy consumption fell by 3.7%. Individual final consumption sectors displayed different trends. In industry (other mining and processing), positive volume effects (production, workforce) counteracted increases in energy efficiency, with consumption rising by 0.3% between 2010 and 2018. Commerce, trade and services (CTS) showed a decrease (-12%). Consumption rose by 7% in the transport sector, but dropped by 13% in the private household sector. This significant drop is closely linked to weather conditions during this period. 2010 was a very cold year, which meant that consumption levels for space heating were high. Temperatures were markedly warmer between 2011 and 2018, resulting in a significant drop in the consumption of space heating. There have been no substantial changes in energy consumption in the domestic sector since 2011. 137   Table B12: Primary energy consumption and final energy consumption (total and by sector), 2008 to 2018, in PJ   2008 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Primary energy consumption 14 380 14 217 13 599 13 447 13 822 13 180 13 262 13 491 13 523 13 129 EEV 9 159 9 310 8 881 8 919 9 179 8 699 8 898 9 071 9 208 8 963 Industry1 2 587 2 592 2 634 2 587 2 551 2 545 2 548 2 609 2 666 2 601 Transport 2 571 2 559 2 568 2 559 2 612 2 616 2 621 2 690 2 765 2 743 Households 2 558 2 676 2 333 2 427 2 556 2 188 2 302 2 376 2 342 2 320 CTS2 1 443 1 483 1 346 1 345 1 460 1 350 1 428 1 396 1 434 1 299 1 Other mining and processing 2 Commerce/trade/services Sources: Energy data published by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy, 2020  4.3.ii. Current potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling  According to the latest estimates for 20145, and depending on the approach used, the power generation potential of CHP is either 173 TWh (microeconomic potential) or 244 TWh (macroeconomic potential). Taking into account the reduction over time in CHP-compatible electricity generation (through the growth in wind and photovoltaics), the CHP potential which can be tapped into will drop below the above values in the long term. Account must be taken of the fact that potential CHP power generation is lower than CHP-compatible power generation. The study commissioned on this topic did not estimate the exact level. From the vantage point of the present, it should also be noted that current energy system studies forecast a faster rise in the use of wind and photovoltaics to generate power than the CHP potential study outlined here. The achievable CHP potential is therefore likely to be somewhat lower in the long term. Table B13 shows the development of cogeneration in the baseline scenario.

Projections considering existing energy efficiency policies, measures and programmes as described in Section 1.2.ii. for primary and final energy consumption for each sector at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)  According to the baseline scenario, primary energy consumption will have dropped by 20% by 2030 and by over 28% by 2040, in each case compared to 2010. Final energy consumption will reduce by 10% or 16% over the same period.

Annual consumption will drop by an average of 0.8% until 2030, and subsequently slow down. Energy consumption will continue to rise in the transport sector and will only start to drop after 2025. By 2030 it will therefore still be higher than the figure for 2010. In the more distant future, as e-mobility penetrates further into the market, annual consumption will drop significantly, by -1% a year after 2030.  4.3.iv. Cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements resulting from national calculations, in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU  Research findings concerning the cost-optimal level of minimum requirements for overall energy efficiency in economic feasibility studies Technische Gebäudeausrüstung, ITG], Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, ecofys). The ideal level is calculated separately for residential and non-residential buildings (from a microeconomic perspective in each case), using not only the energy price development scenario utilised by the Federal Government, but also an alternative scenario in order to carry out a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis complies with the European criteria for calculating cost optimisation, and (based on these latter) states that the current regulatory standard (Energy Conservation Regulation 2016) is the cost-optimal level at present. The outcome will be forwarded to the European Commission
