        123  3.5 Dimension Research, innovation and competitiveness  (i) Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.5  i. National objectives and funding targets for public and where available, private research and innovation relating the Energy Union, including, where appropriate a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met In June 2018 the Danish Parliament made a Energy Agreement. As part of the agreement, Denmark has committed to spend 580 mill. DKK in 2020 on research, development and demonstration of new energy technology. With the research reserve agreement 2020, the Government and all the political parties has agreed to increase spending to green research, development and demonstration by 1 billion DKK in 2020 in addition to the spending target in 2020 that follows from the Energy Agreement. Furthermore, the Energy Agreement states that by 2024 Denmark will spend at least 1 billion DKK on research, development and demonstration of new technologies related to energy and climate.  In 2020 514 mill. DKK will be allocated to the Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP). EUDP supports development and demonstration of new energy technology, as well as research that supports preparation for development and demonstration. The objective of EUDP is to create growth and jobs, increase the security of supply, and contribute to the green transition that will make Denmark independent of fossil energy by 2050. Demonstration projects in particular can be difficult to finance, partly because they typically demand large financial resources, and partly because they demand a high risk tolerance. By contributing to financing, the EUDP ensures results from research and development projects are brought closer to market. EUDP supports actions under the SET-plan, IEA and Nordic Energy Research, as specified in section 3.5.(ii). EUDP was established in 2007 to support national energy targets regarding a stable and secure energy supply, consideration for the global climate, cost efficiency and business strengths and potentials through development and demonstration of new energy technologies. EUDP has from 2011-2015 had an annual budget of approx. 400 mill. DKK. The budget decreased in 2016 to approx. 190 mill. DKK, but has since increased to approx. 430 mill. In 2019. EUDP has a politically independent board which is responsible for allocating funds to the best projects among the applicants. EUDP funds projects in many different energy sectors. In 2018 the EUDP allocated 86% (approx. 362 mill. DKK) of its funds to four different sectors: Wind projects received approx. 180 mill. DKK, projects regarding hydrogen and fuel cells received approx. 82 mill. DKK, projects regarding system integration received approx. 55 mill. DKK, and projects regarding energy efficiency received approx. 43 mill. DKK.  In 2020 83 mill. DKK will be allocated to the energy area in Innovation Fund Denmark (cf. the Budget proposal 2020). Furthermore, 629 mill. DKK will be allocated to green research         124  in Innovation Fund Denmark in 2020. These funds cover different themes related to green research, including energy research. Innovation Fund Denmark primarily support projects focusing on strategic research and development. The two programs thereby cover technologies approx. from TRL 2-8. Like EUDP, Innovation Fund Denmark has an independent board which is responsible for allocating funds to concrete projects.  The Danish Parliament has already allocated 90 mill. DKK to research and development focused on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector, which is relative large in Denmark. The 90 mill. DKK will cover the period 2019-2021. The funds will support the Danish reduction target in 2030 in the non-ETS sector as well as the goal of reducing greenhouse gasses by 70 % by 2030, relative to 1990 levels.  In the beginning of 2019 the Danish Parliament allocated 50 mill DKK to new test facilities at Lindoe Offshore Renewables Center (LORC). The money supplements private financing and will be spent on constructing the  by far  most powerful nacelle test facility in the world, further underlining the Danish position as world leader in offshore wind.  This is just the latest test facility constructed in Denmark. Under the former Green Labs DK program a series of test facilities were constructed, most of which are considered successful and still used by private companies to test new technologies within smart grid, green gas, heating and cooling and outdoor lighting.  As mentioned, both EUDP and Innovation Fund Denmark support a wide variety of projects. These programs are supplemented by test facilities as well as funding of climate solutions in the agricultural sector. Funding of research, development and demonstration of new energy and climate technologies and instruments is an essential part of securing national objectives on the other dimensions such as greenhouse gas reductions, further developing strengths in renewables, new technologies on energy efficiency as well as ensuring a high energy security.  Denmark does not have any funding targets for private research and innovation relating to the energy union.  ii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to competitiveness. The global green transition market continues to grow. In order to reach the temperature increase target limit, the international community must invest 90,000 billion Danish kroner in green transition over the next 11 years. This represents a unique opportunity for the Danish business community, which must be exploited. Denmark must be known as a nation of green entrepreneurialism.  With the 2018 Energy Agreement, the parties agree to significantly intensify export promotion activities in the energy sector both in scale and volume  to a total of 174 million DKK from 2019 to the end of 2024. The current export scheme in the key export markets of Germany, the UK and the United States will be extended until the end of 2024         125  and expanded to include two new partner countries and the posting of four new energy advisors. Denmark will also increase its collaborations with authorities in future growth markets through public-private partnerships with an increased focus on the promotion of Danish exports, market development and investments. To this end, 62,3 million DKK from the total of 174 million DKK have been allocated for projects and activities that serve to further the export promotion activities in the energy sector. These funds will be allocated through tenders and subsidies in accordance with the EU state aid rules (de minimis regulation). In addition, on 2 December 2019 the Government reached agreement with the Red-Green Alliance, the Social LiberaFinance Act 2020. The parties agreed to strengthen the green diplomacy. This will happen amongst other things by strengthening the effort of posting energy advisors in growth markets with the aim to deploy Danish expertise within energy systems and green transition. The parties have allocated 5 million annually in the period 2020-2021. iii. Where available, national 2050 objectives related to the promotion of clean energy technologies, and where appropriate, national objectives, including long-term targets (2050) for deployment of low-carbon technologies, including decarbonizing energy and carbon-intense industrial sectors and, where applicable, for related carbon transport and storage infrastructure. Denmark has a long term target of net-zero emission by 2050 at the latest and independency from fossil fuels. Furthermore, 55% of its energy consumption and more than 100%. of its electricity consumption must come from renewables by 2030.  As part of the new G to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70 % by 2030, relative to 1990 levels, it is essential that funding is in place for research, development and demonstration as well as deployment of new climate friendly technologies. New solutions will have to be developed in the energy sector, in transportation and aviation as well as in the agricultural sector.  Denmark will install three new off-shore wind farms towards 2030. Thereby Denmark will make itself increasingly independent from fossil fuels. The increasing ratio of renewable energy production will require further research, development and demonstration of technologies to fully integrate and exploit the renewable energy when production exceeds demand. As part of these efforts solutions regarding energy storage will also be promoted concretely through an Energy storage fund of 128 million DKK. In December 2019 money was granted to two Power-to-X-projects. The projects will establish big scale production and storage of green hydrogen. Both projects have an ambition to demonstrate production and consumption of green hydrogen on near market based conditions.  As part of a future green mobility plan the Government wants to stop sales of all new diesel and petrol cars as of 2030 and enhance low emissions zones. This requires deployment of new green vehicles in Denmark.         126  (ii) Where applicable, cooperation with other Member States in this area, including, where appropriate, information on how the SET Plan objectives and policies are being translated to a national context  Since its establishment, the EUDP has focused on strengthening Denmark's international collaboration. International collaboration is based on participation in the European Research Area Networks (ERA-NET's) under the EU Horizon 2020 program; extensive involvement in IEA Technology Collaboration Programs (formerly Implementing Agreements); as well as international participation in a number of specific EUDP projects.  Nordic energy research co-operation Nordic Energy Research (NER) is the platform for cooperative energy research and analysis in the Nordic region under the auspices of Nordic Council of Ministers. It funds research of joint Nordic interest that supports these ambitions by expanding knowledge on sustainable energy and contributing to the development of new, competitive energy solutions. Denmark is an active member of Nordic Energy Research. According to its strategy for the period 2018-2021 the vision of NER is to create the knowledge basis for the Nordic countries to become global leaders in smart energy. The mission is progressed through Nordic collaboration. NER manages a number of projects and facilities in various fields, ranging from compilation of results from ongoing studies, to technical research. As an illustration, in 2015 NER energy for the coming 4-year period, covering such diverse areas as flexible electricity market design to allow for more wind and solar energy; modelling how to achieve  an energy-efficient and low carbon transportation system; and enabling negative CO2-emissions through new combustion-related technologies. With regard to the regional aspects linked to the national energy and climate plans, two projects are of particular significance: Nordic Energy Technology Perspectives (NETP) is a Nordic edition of the International Enerpublished twice (2013 and 2016) and offers a detailed scenario-based regional analysis of how the Nordic countries can achieve a near carbon-neutral energy system. At present, the possibility of an updated report (with the working title Nordic Energy Outlook) is discussed within the Bard of NER and with the IEA. The Nordic Electric Vehicle Outlook 2018 (NEVO 2018) has been developed in co-operation between the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Nordic Energy Research. It aims to identify and discuss recent developments of electric mobility in the five Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. The report assesses the current status of the electric car market, the deployment of charging infrastructure, and the integration with the electricity grid at country level. It analyses the role of European, national and local policy frameworks in supporting these developments. The analysis also provides insights on consumer behavior and includes an outlook on the progress of electric mobility in the Nordic region up to 2030.         127  The NER Board Meeting in November 2018 decided to allocate up to 4 million NOK to each of the key areas 1-6. The proposed Nordic Exchange programs for energy researchers (key area 7) was allocated 5 million NOK for the 2019-2020 period. These funds are intended as seed money to attract additional funding from the national research councils to meet the 500 million DKK overall target. Programs meeting the following three criteria are deemed relevant; Deliver Nordic added value, agreed by all Nordic research councils and fall within the areas below. Based on this process, NER has identified seven key areas that could enhance joint Nordic research efforts: 1. Digitalisation of the Nordic Electricity Grid. 2. Further enhancing the Nordic Energy Market 3. Energy Storage 4. Energy and Transport (land-based, aviation and maritime) 5. Bioenergy and Biofuels 6. Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) 7. Support Nordic Exchange programmes for energy researchers  NER is also exploring how the Nordic countries can join forces in providing input to European research programs, especially the so-called ERA-NETs under the existing Horizon 2020 and the upcoming Horizon Europe programmes. ERA-nets on; Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS), Energy Storage, Biomass and Digitalisation of Energy Systems seem particularly suited.    SET-plan The overarching criteria of the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP) are applicability to global trends and challenges, and business potentials, in line with the objectives of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-plan). When it comes to specific technology areas, Denmark has taken a neutral approach, but favor areas where Denmark already has a stronghold.  The EUDP wants to further strengthen the international collaboration effort in order to attract the best international players to project consortia with Danish partners, providing that results are anchored in Denmark and create added value for Danish players. Furthermore, participation in international collaboration will also help promote Danish acquisition of knowledge about the newest trends and methodologies. The European Energy Union and the SET-Plan play an important role in this context. EUDP funds participation in large European projects and the projects must concurrently be within the on in relevant ERA-NET Co-fund initiatives under Horizon 2020. In this connection, the EUDP will prioritize participating in SET-Plan work in collaboration with the Danish Energy Agency in order to provide Danish input to the process and acquire relevant knowledge for use in implementation of the EUDP strategy and in the allocation of funding. The SET-Plan is being implemented through Horizon 2020, and through the ERA-NET Co-fund mechanism, which the EUDP is already making use of and to which the program will continue to afford priority.          128  The EUDP board strategy for 2017-19 was presented in early 2017 and is still valid. The strategy places special priority on ensuring that funds are granted in focus areas in which there is a particularly good match between the global demand for energy technology on the one hand, and Danish strongholds and commercial potentials on the other. This also goes for international collaboration projects. Danish strongholds Both EUDP and an independent report on research and innovation in the Danish energy sector have identified the following Danish strongholds based on a number of indicators (i.e. patents, publications, quality of energy-related research, demonstration projects, available export statistics). Compared to other countries, Denmark is relatively strongly positioned in the following areas:  Wind power  Danish competences in wind energy are based on a network of large and small enterprises and a range of research and development centers. The wind power industry employs approx. 30,000 people. DTU Wind Energy (Technical University of Denmark) has played a key role in this development. Moreover, Denmark has a number of unique test facilities such as the Lindoe Offshore Renewables Center (LORC), the Test Center for Large Wind Turbines at Høvsøre, Østerild  National Test Centre for Large Wind Turbines and more. Denmark is also home to some of the world's largest wind turbine manufacturers, including Vestas Wind Systems and Siemens Wind Power. Furthermore, Ørsted has driven the development of offshore wind technologies through the establishment and operation of offshore wind farms. District heating  Denmark's stronghold in district heating has been shaped over a period of 100 years. Today, Danish district-heating plants are among the most energy-efficient CHP plants in the world. The sector employs more than 7,000 people. There is strong demand abroad for Danish competences in this area. In a large number of situations, the effective Danish CHP production provides support for unique partnerships with local enterprises connected to the district heating infrastructure.  Danish CHP plants have gradually been converted to a high rate of biomass use, and have therefore gone from a biomass consumption of only 8% in 1980 up to approx. 40%. This has been possible, e.g. because Danish fuel taxes have only targeted fossil fuels. However, technological developments have also been a factor. The gradual conversion of the district heating sector also contributed to the build-up of the Danish knowledge and resource base, and this was established through close collaboration between plants, authorities, consultants and suppliers. Denmark therefore has strong competencies within the design and dimensioning of CHP plants, consultancy services and specialized production.   Efficient use of energy  Efficient and intelligent energy use is crucial, e.g. in buildings, in households, in production processes, at system level and in the transport sector. Denmark is relatively well positioned within lighting, low-energy buildings, building materials and processes, as well as reduction of energy consumption in existing buildings. Comparative analyses of retrofitting of existing         129  buildings versus raising new buildings in a sustainability perspective, including energy consumption for production, also place Denmark in a leading position. Danish strongholds in this area have been established primarily through taxes and subsidy schemes as well as energy labelling of products; all instruments intended to reduce energy consumption. A large number of enterprises are in the markets for products within efficient use of energy and energy-efficiency improvements and optimization.   Bioenergy  The fact that Denmark introduced energy-policy requirements for alternatives to fossil fuels at an early stage, that it envisioned a supply sector supplied from several sources, and that Denmark focused on exploiting domestic fuels, led to the establishment of a solid platform for bioenergy in the 1980s and 1990s. This development involved both research and development activities and focused on the role of agriculture as a supplier of residual products and the role of the energy sector as a recipient of energy produced at CHP plants. A large number of local and decentralized biomass-fired CHP plants were built. Furthermore, a large number of large-scale and centralized CHP plants were converted to biomass. To this should be added the unique knowledge and technology development within biofuels and biogas. It is the expectation that biogas production will more than double and, perhaps, triple, while the use of biogas is becoming independent of local CHP plants, with distribution through the existing gas infrastructure, so that gas can be used in the CHP sector, in industry, in natural gas boilers in households, and in the transport sector. Biogas technology can also be defined as a Danish stronghold based on the number of reference projects abroad and the scope of research and development activities in Denmark.   Smart grids and system integration  For Denmark, smart grids are a particularly interesting area because of the challenge of integrating large amounts of intermittent wind power into the existing system, which to an ever greater extent is calling for ways by which to regulate electricity consumption relative to current production efficiently and intelligently. One element in this context is activation of consumers through hourly meter pricing and smart meters. Developments in this area received a boost when it was decided that all Danish homes must have remotely-read meters and hourly pricing by 2020. Another important element is the dramatic developments in digitalization. While smart grids specifically address the problem of moving consumption to other times during the day and matching supply with demand, system integration is also a growing and very important area. In the future, many factors will be competing to supply this dynamic: electric cars, electric cartridges, heat pumps, etc. system integration also covers aspects relating to energy storage and smart energy. Smart energy is a broader concept than smart grids. Smart energy covers several energy grids, energy types and sectors in the overall energy infrastructure (electricity, heating, cooling, gas, transport). Developments within system integration are therefore to a great extent a question of creating dynamic incentive structures which can incorporate different technologies and different parts of the energy system in an integrated interplay and in a cost-efficient manner, e.g. combining solar heating and heat pumps with gas or biomass in the district heating system. The challenge with regard to storing energy is to develop         130  technologies and concepts that can store the energy from periods with high production and low demand (e.g. wind power) and save it for peak demand periods, or, alternatively, to convert the energy to other, high-value energy products (e.g. fuels).   Oil and gas  The Danish oil and gas industry is founded on Danish exploration and recovery activities in the North Sea since the 1980s. Oil from the Danish continental shelf is not easy to access, and persistent focus on increasing the recovery rate and continuously extending the service life of Danish oilfields means Danish players have become world leaders in advanced oil extraction. This applies e.g. within horizontal drilling and injection. Danish strongholds within oil and gas are primarily an industry cluster of around 250 enterprises. Furthermore, a Centre for Oil and Gas has been set up at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The center will provide support for research and development activities as well as highly specialized education and training in oil and gas technology and exploration. Other technologies There is a category of other technologies, for which, so far, no large export revenues have been registered, but with regard to which Denmark is also relatively strongly positioned in terms of publications and demonstration projects, for example within heat pumps, fuel cells, geothermal energy and wave power. Prioritization and allocation of funds  Danish business potentials in the area of energy technologies are especially prominent in those areas which, over the next 5-10 years, will see a significant demand for specific technologies, and about which it can be said with relative certainty that there is a good match with Danish industrial strongholds and RDD activities. This assumes that Danish players in one way or another will have a head start or an advantage compared to other countries due to an extensive knowledge and resource base, patents, knowhow, test facilities.  The rationale behind the EUDP Strategy is to invest in areas in which there is a particularly good match between global demand for new energy technology, on the one hand, and Danish strongholds and business potentials on the other. First, global trends and challenges in the energy area are described, and, then, business potentials are identified by comparing the challenges and trends with the Danish strongholds. This approach forms the basis for focusing EUDP efforts.  The primary focus of EUDP will be on projects which develop, demonstrate and scale-up technologies in Denmark with the aim of exporting them - in other words, primary focus is on Technology Readiness Levels 4-8 in the value chain. On the basis of a review of global trends and Danish strongholds in the energy area, the following observations are deemed of particular interest in the context within which the EUDP is to prioritize its funds:   Expected greater focus on unsubsidized energy production in future.   Expectations that onshore wind will be the cheapest new electricity capacity globally in the short term.          131   Expectations that solar PV will be the cheapest new electricity capacity globally in the medium term.   Expectations that roof-top PV installations combined with battery storage will relatively quickly become widespread in many countries throughout the world.   Offshore wind investments have seen relatively large growth in the European market so far.   Growing focus on energy-efficiency improvements globally.   A larger share of intermittent RE (Renewable Energy) leads to greater demand for demand-response management technologies.   A larger share of intermittent RE leads to greater demand for energy storage solutions. In this context, battery storage, in particular, is expected to play a significant role.   Greater focus on the use of interconnectors between countries and energy systems globally.   Investments in biofuels have declined over the past five years, while investments in bioenergy and waste-to-energy have increased. Biomass will probably increasingly have to be used to make high-value products, e.g. in those parts of the transport sector which are not so easily electrified (heavy goods transport, ships, aircraft).  International Participation and Collaboration in the IEA  EUDP promotes international projects, knowledge-sharing, network building and knowledge acquisition, etc. through the IEA Technology Collaboration Programs, wherever this is of strategic interest to Denmark. Furthermore, the IEA is currently strengthening efforts with regard to its Technology Collaboration Programs (TCPs). By applying this, EUDP can fund Danish participation in annexes or tasks that involves:   A technology area of particular Danish interest.   That the applicant has a professional self-interest in participating.   That the application has an adequate overview of relevant Danish players and stakeholders within the area of technology in question.   That the application contains a plan for dissemination activities, which must be conducted in relation to the relevant Danish players and stakeholders within the technology area. In order to participate in tasks/annexes, a minimum requirement is to set up an electronic newsletter or similar (e.g. website), which is offered to all players and stakeholders and is disseminated at least two times a year. This can e.g. by the appearance of new reports, analyses or other initiatives from IEA. During the project period, there must be arranged at least one workshop/seminar addressing Danish players and stake-holders within the relevant technology area. This can take place in collaboration with other related IEA collaborations or the like.   Mission Innovation Denmark is member of Mission Innovation, and has  besides committing to double funding in energy research by 2020  been active in both the international secretariat, innovation challenges and the business engagement group. Denmark is active in four Innovation Challenges:  Smart Grids,   Carbon capture,          132   Sustainable Biofuels,  Clean energy materials, In three out of four Innovation Challenges the engagement is rooted in research environments and contribute to knowledge sharing, as well as development of programs and projects. The work has resulted in new partnerships and strengthening of existing projects. As for smart grids and biofuels the engagements builds on Danish areas of strength, whereas materials has turned out to be  a connection of different areas of expertise to create new opportunities within the fields of energy materials. Denmark has recently joined the Innovation Challenge regarding Carbon Capture, and is looking forward to contribute to the innovation challenge. Denmark has also recently joined the leadership forum and is leading a coalition on shipping.  (iii) Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds  EUDP was established in 2007 to support national energy targets regarding a stable and secure energy supply, consideration for the global climate, cost efficiency and business strengths and potentials through development and demonstration of new energy technologies (TRL 4-8). EUDP has from 2011-2015 had an annual budget of approx. 400 mill. DKK. The budget was halved in 2016 to approx. 190 mill. DKK, but has since increased to approx. 430 mill. in 2019. EUDP has a politically independent board which is responsible for allocating funds to the best projects among the applicants. EUDP funds projects in many different energy sectors. In 2018 the EUDP allocated 86% (approx. 362 mill. DKK) of its funds to four different sectors: Wind projects received approx. 180 mill. DKK, projects regarding hydrogen and fuel cells received approx. 82 mill. DKK, projects regarding system integration received approx. 55 mill. DKK, and projects regarding energy efficiency received approx. 43 mio. DKK.  Innovation Fund Denmark was established in 2014 and supports strategic research projects (TRL 2-4). The Innovation Fund has in 2018 allocated a total of 206 mill. DKK in funds to research and development in the energy sector. Denmark has received approximately 923 mio. DKK to energy related projects under the Horizon2020-programme (from 2014 to 2019). Denmark thereby is one of the most successful countries in the EU (funding per capita) in getting access to EU funding and participating in projects in the EU. The funds are an essential part in advancing new green technologies in Denmark as well as countries working with Danish actors in these projects.
