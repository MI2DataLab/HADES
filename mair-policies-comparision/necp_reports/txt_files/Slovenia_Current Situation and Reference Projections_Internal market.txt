190 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   4.5 Internal Energy Market Dimension 4.5.1 Electricity interconnectivity i. Current level of interconnection and main interconnectors Slovenia's electricity connectivity87 was 83.6% in 2017, significantly exceeding the 10% target for 2020 and the 15% target for 2030. Slovenia is connected with Austria by means of two 400 kV interconnectors (2x400 kV Maribor-Kainachtal) and one 220 kV interconnector (220 kV Podlog-Na Selu (Obersielach)), with Italy by a 400 kV interconnector (400 kV -Sredipolje (Redipuglia)) and a 220 kV interconnector (220 kV -by means of three 400 kV interconnectors (2x400 kV -Tumbri interconnectors and the 400 kV -Melina interconnector), two 220 kV interconnectors (220 kV Cirkovce--Pehlin) and three 110 kV interconnector (110 kV Koper- Buje, 110 kV Ilirska Bistrica-Matulji and 110 kV Formin-Nedeljanec), while the connection to Hungary (2 x 400 kV Cirkovce-Pince) is still being prepared88. The Slovenian electricity market is part of the Multi-Regional Coupling (MRC) system, which uses a single PCR (Price Coupling of Regions) to calculate its daily market price, and which integrates the daily markets of Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland (via SwePol), Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. In practice, this makes it possible to simultaneously calculate the price of electricity and commercial cross-border day-ahead flows for all the above markets. This translates into a direct benefit for final customers, as better coordination between electricity markets enables more efficient use of the transmission network, and in particular cross-border interconnections, which is of utmost importance in the face of increasing operational uncertainty and pressure to curb cross-border trade. Given the above, the Slovenian transmission system operator (ELES) has already largely met the requirements of Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 [54] regarding the allocation of cross-border transmission capacity (CBTC) for the day ahead. As can be seen from the figure below, ELES, in cooperation with neighbouring system operators, has significantly increased maximum net transfer capacity (NTC) values in recent years, especially in 2014 at the Slovenian-Italian and Slovenian-Croatian borders in both directions. The reason for the increase of maximum values in the Slovenia-to-Italy direction in 2017 is the new procedure for the coordinated calculation of NTC for the day ahead at northern Italian borders.                                                            87  Source: Slovenia: Energy Union factsheet, 2017, p. 56. 88  Source: Development plan of the transmission system of the Republic of Slovenia: 2019 to 2028. 191 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 64: Average daily value of net transfer capacity (NTC) in the period 2011-2017  Source: Development Plan of the Transmission System of the Republic of Slovenia: 2019 to 2028, p. 95.

Projections of network expansion requirements by at least 2040 (including 2030) The most important reinforcement of the transmission network in the coming years will be the construction of the 400 kV Cirkovce-Pince interconnector, which will significantly increase the import capacity of transmission system and enable the importation of potential surplus electricity from the eastern part of Europe. The following is a list of the most important investments at 400 kV and 220 kV voltage levels to be made between 2024 and 2028, i.e. in the second half of the next decade, in order to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the transmission network of Slovenia. 192 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   400 kV and 220 kV voltage level:  TR 220/110 kV in the Podlog substation (replacement of TR 212);  TR 220/110 kV  In the context of development of the 400 kV network, the question of deploying the Kozjak HPP remains open. If this project proves economically viable and the investor chooses to implement it, it will mean the construction of an additional 400 kV connection to connect the Kozjak hydro-electric power plant. In all the NEPN scenarios analysed, the deployment of Kozjak hydro-electric power station is not foreseen until 2030. Based on the results of the development analyses carried out by the transmission system operator, the following is a list of the most important investments that must be made by 2023 in order to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the Slovenian transmission network or to enable the involvement of new users of the energy network89. By 2040, the issue of providing 220 kV network capacity will also need to be addressed.  400 kV and 220 kV voltage level:  IC 2 x 400 kV Cirkovce-Pince with Cirkovce substation and 2 x TR 400/110 kV in Cirkovce substation;  IC 2 x 220 kV Zagrad-Ravne with substation Ravne and TR 220/110 kV in substation Ravne;  TR 400/110 kV   TR 400/110 kV   TR 400/110 kV in Maribor substation (replacement of TR 41);  TR 220/110 kV   installation of voltage  110 kV voltage level:  IC 2 x 110 kV -  IC 2 x 110 kV Kamnik-Visoko  kbV 110 kV PCL-TE-TOL;  kbV 110 kV Center-TE-TOL  kbV 110 kV Koper-Izola;  kbV 110 kV Izola-Lucija;  IC 2 x 110 kV Dravograd-Velenje;  kbV 110 kV DTS 220/110 kV Ravne- Ravne Ironworks;  IC 2 x 110 kV Murska Sobota-Lendava;  IC 2 x 110 kV Lenart-Radenci;  110 kV -HPP Mokrice;  other parts at 110 kV voltage level in accordance with the development plan of the transmission system of the Republic of Slovenia. If in future it turns out that building up RES in neighbouring countries is increasing at a faster rate than was predicted, timely action will need to be taken in the Slovenian transmission network to increase transmission capacities, for the most part in the western part of the high-voltage network.                                                             89  Source: Development Plan of the Transmission System of the Republic of Slovenia from 2019 to 2028, p. 104. 193 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 66: Slovenia's transmission network in 2028  Source: Development Plan of the Transmission System of the Republic of Slovenia from 2019 to 2028, p. 107  Energy Transmission and Distribution Infrastructure.  4.5.2 Energy Transmission Infrastructure Slovenia has a relatively small electricity system with high availability of existing generating units, the good transmission network integration into international connections and a high degree of transmission network operation reliability and thus a reliable high-level electricity supply. The latter is made possible by active modernisation of the transmission network after carrying out many investments and important international projects (FutureFlow, SINCRO.GRID, etc.), while at the same time, through the projects, the transmission system operator is looking for answers and modern approaches to the challenges of accelerated introduction of production from renewable energy sources and the requirements of ensuring flexibility. Thus, in accordance with comparative studies and in comparison with other European transmission system operators, Slovenia's transmission network is currently a leader in terms of cost-effective maintenance and operation. i. Key features of existing electricity and gas transmission infrastructure Electricity Transmission Infrastructure At the end of 2017, the total length of the 400 kV interconnector system was 669 km, that of the 220 kV interconnector system was 328 km, and that of the 110 kV interconnector system was 2 723 km, of which 1 886 km were owned by ELES. There are four different types of transformer stations in the Slovenian network, i.e. effecting 400/110 kV, 400/220 kV, 220/110 kV and 110/35 kV transformations. The 400/400 kV phase-shifter transformer rated 2 x 600 MVA located in Divsubstation was incorporated into the Slovenian electricity system in 2010. The figure below shows the busiest transmission lines with respect to the 95% probability limit. The situation shows that there are not many emergencies in the system.  194 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 67: The busiest transmission lines with respect to the 95% probability limit  Source: Development Plan of the Transmission System of the Republic of Slovenia from 2019 to 2029, p. 48. Key to Figure 67  Over 70% thermal power  Between 60% and 70% thermal power  Between 50% and 60% thermal power Electricity distribution infrastructure Distribution networks account for practically 95% of all electricity networks in Slovenia; the figure below shows the layout of the 110 kV and medium-voltage networks in Slovenia. Figure 68: Layout of 110 kV and medium voltage networks in Slovenia  Source: EIMV, 2019. In 2018, the Slovenian electricity distribution network comprised 840 km of 110 kV, 17 672 km of medium-voltage and 45 518 km of low-voltage network, 98 distribution transformer stations, 80 distribution stations, 16 359 MV/LV transformer stations, with 6 380 dispersed sources with a total power of 572 MW connected to the network. In 2018, the peak power of individual EDPs was: 727 MW (Elektro Ljubljana), 441 MW (Elektro Maribor), 341 MW (Elektro Celje), 302 MW (Elektro Primorska) and 205 MW (Elektro Gorenjska). The total EDP peak power in 2018 was 2 032 MW and the minimum power was 689 MW. The majority of users, end consumers and electricity producers are connected to the electricity distribution network, so the role of the distribution operator is crucial in two respects, the distribution of electricity and the provision of services to users connected to the distribution network. 195 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Natural gas transmission infrastructure The Slovenian transmission pipeline system comprises almost 1 174 km of gas pipelines, compressor stations at metering-regulating or other stations. Equipment is installed at key points of the transmission pipeline system that allows the system to be monitored and maintained. District control and command functions are implemented through an information and telemetry system. The transmission pipeline system connects most of Slovenia's industrial and urban centres, except the Obalna k krajina and parts of the Notranjska and Dolenjska regions. The transmission pipeline system is monitored and managed from the dispatching centre, which is connected to the dispatching centres of the transmission system operators of neighbouring countries, as well as to the system operators of distribution networks and major natural gas customers. Most of the existing transmission pipeline network is over 30 years old. The Slovenian transmission pipeline system is connected through the border interconnection points to the transmission pipelines of neighbouring countries, which are managed by different TSOs. The cross-border interconnection points between the Slovenian transmission system operator and neighbouring transmission systems are as follows:  with the Austrian TSO, Gas Connect Austria, interconnection point,  with the Italian TSO, Snam Rete Gas, at the and  with the Croatian TSO, Plinacro, at the Rogatec interconnection point;  interconnection with the Hungarian TSO is also envisaged. The entry points where natural gas enters the transmission system and the exit points where natural gas leaves the transmission system are an integral part of the transmission pipeline system. The key entry and exit points of the transmission system are called relevant points and are confirmed by the Energy Agency. The TSO publishes data regarding transmission pipeline system capacity of these points, as shown in the figure below. Five points are shown, four of which are border crossing points, which are relevant points for the publication of data, and the fifth relevant point is aggregate exit/transfer data for users in the Republic of Slovenia.

Projections of network expansion requirements up to at least 2040 (including 2030) Electricity transmission The development plan of the transmission system of the Republic of Slovenia up to 2028 has been drawn up on the basis of studies of demand for new transmission infrastructure. The status of the network, the need for technological renovation of transmission system facilities, the needs of electricity producers and customers, criteria for the reliable and safe operation of the transmission system and international agreements and contracts are taken into account. General guidelines to be taken into account when making new and renewable investments include: connecting with neighbouring electricity systems, controlling power flows and ensuring appropriate voltage conditions throughout the Slovenian electricity system, ensuring reliable and safe operation in accordance with ENTSO-E recommendations and criteria, and the deployment of smart grids to make better use of existing infrastructure and to achieve appropriate stability and efficiency in the context of meeting European energy requirements. In connection with the latter, the implementation of the international smart grid project SINCRO.GRID will continue, in which the system and distribution operators of Slovenia and Croatia have taken up the challenges of managing the voltage in the transmission network and reducing the required capacity for the secondary reserve. Trial operation and optimisation of all systems developed under the SINCRO.GRID project is scheduled for 2021. Electricity distribution The development plan of the electricity distribution network in the Republic of Slovenia for the ten-year period 2019-202890 defines the amount of infrastructure that must first be built or updated in order to ensure a reliable, safe and efficient Slovenian electricity distribution system in the long term. We conclude that the current applicable development plan does not meet the expected additional needs in the area of electricity distribution. In order to achieve the ambitious energy and climate policy targets, Slovenia will have to provide better conditions for the accelerated development of the electricity distribution network, which is the basis for the future transition to a low carbon society and enables accelerated integration of renewable energy production facilities, greater involvement of heat pumps and compliance with requirements for the accelerated deployment of e-mobility. The aim is to boost capacity, resistance to disruption, future development potential and exploitation of flexibility in terms of sources and burdens of the electricity distribution network in accordance with the sustainable needs of distribution system users. In the development plan of the distribution operator, special attention is paid to the construction of a new network and reconstruction of the existing medium- and low-voltage network, since these are the weakest links in the EES from the point of view of the continuity of supply, especially in the above-ground implementation. In new construction and reconstruction projects, underground network construction predominates. In order to speed up development of the electricity distribution network, which will enable the inclusion of heat pumps, accelerate the deployment of e-mobility and the integration of RES generators, we will ensure substantially more financial and human resources. In all the NEPN scenarios analysed, we expect in the next decade to achieve the necessary social changes and related changes in financial flows, which will significantly accelerate the much-needed investments in upgrading and reinforcing the electricity distribution network with a view to ensuring the conditions for achieving the NEPN targets. The regulator must ensure an appropriate ratio of items for the transmission and distribution systems and introduce advanced billing systems that will:                                                            90  Development Plan of the Electricity Distribution Network in the Republic of Slovenia available at: https://www.sodo.si/_files/5746/RN_2019_2028_SODH_nov_2018_del50.pdf. 197 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA    reflect the actual costs incurred on the network, with manufacturers also having to contribute a fair share to the use of the network;  prevent individualisation of benefits and cost collectivisation,  be non-discriminatory, transparent and user-friendly. Smart or advanced distribution networks The introduction of smart or advanced networks in the electricity transmission and distribution system requires the accelerated digitisation of transmission and electricity distribution networks. Digitisation means connecting all energy elements of the transmission and distribution network with digital energy and service platforms. Energy and digital services must be available 24 hours a day and seven days a week (24/7). Today, energy services which used to be in the exclusive domain of transmission networks are also moving to distribution networks. Digitised energy networks will enable near-real-time monitoring of energy networks and response and implementation of near-real-time measures. We need the right energy services to respond properly, based on the open supply and demand of the energy market and the digitised network. The transmission system operator is active and successful in obtaining EU funds for the implementation of advanced projects and, in recent years, has led and participated (or is still participating) in several different EU projects directly related to the technological areas of smart grid management. Slovenian power distribution companies are also successfully involved in international projects. All this gives Slovenia a leading position in the introduction of modern technologies in the wider region and the EU. In future, though, there is a need to further develop platforms that will connect local smart grids at the national level and guarantee security, network stability and electricity supply. Development of the advanced measurement system in Slovenia The installation of advanced measuring devices in Slovenia is also proceeding at an intensive rate. At the end of 2018, 61% of users on the distribution system were equipped with advanced measuring devices. This data places Slovenia among the leading European countries in the area of advanced metering. Continuing this trend, Slovenia is expected to move closer to the European Directive target stipulating that 80% of users should be equipped with advanced measuring devices by 2020. In accordance with the Decree on measures and procedures for the introduction and interoperability of advanced metering systems (UL RS No 79/15), by 2025 system meters should be installed which will enable operation and control of the distribution system using advanced systems91. Already in 2017, Slovenian electricity companies started installing meters with G3 communication technology, which provides system users with advanced services. G3 technology is also much more appropriate in terms of robustness, communication throughput, cybersecurity and the protection of personal data. This will certainly not end the development and, above all, the use of advanced measurement systems. In future, more attention will need to be paid to the effort to provide technically simple and affordable (near) real-time measurement data to all those stakeholders on the energy markets, including the upcoming flexibility market, who will have a legal basis to access user metrics. Using such metering data will increase the possibility of developing new innovative energy services for both end-users and network operators, and will enable users to graphically represent their electricity consumption (access to data).                                                            91  Advanced systems and the meaning of terms are defined in Article 2 of the Decree on measures and procedures for the introduction and connectivity of advanced metering systems (UL RS No 79/15).  198 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Development of telecommunications infrastructure In order to support the operation of the electricity distribution network and development of the internal electricity market, appropriate development of telecommunications infrastructure also plays an important role. In future, it will be necessary to ensure the establishment of dedicated machine-to-machine (M2M) networks for distribution telecommunications infrastructure throughout Slovenia. A dedicated network for this purpose means a closed network that provides electronic communications services to M2M and does not share resources or provide services to end-users. Investments in the natural gas transmission system Depending on the purpose of the planned infrastructure, there are three groups of projects:  projects to increase operational reliability and expand the transmission system,  connecting new natural gas customers and  establishment of interconnection points with neighbouring operators. Projects that help increase operational reliability and expand the transmission system include energy loops, relocation of pipeline sections due to specific settlement adjustments and landslide prevention. In several cases, these projects can also be used to expand and connect new municipalities.

These technologies are commercially available and are suitable for the implementation higher rated power levels. Biomass gasification plants with a rated capacity of more than 100 MW are already operating in Europe and beyond. Synthetic methane production technology has already been developed and is available in a number of implementations, both in catalytic reactors and in biological reactors which are commercially available and suitable for use in higher rated power installations. Gasification and methanation technologies have already been tested in various pilot projects in Europe and beyond, where the technology has proven to be suitable and mature enough for wider commercial use at higher power plants, comparable to the rated power of larger existing thermal power plants. As the decarbonisation of the gas sector is expected in future in order to achieve climate targets and the integration of the electricity and gas sectors, and as the demand for storage of excess RES will increase, as well as the volumes of renewable gas in gas networks, further research and integration solutions are needed to incorporate gasification and methanation technologies into energy systems. These include the gas as well as the electricity sector (power-to-gas technologies), and, in particular, further research into the effects of the increasing proportion of hydrogen and synthetic natural gas (SNG) on parts of the gas pipeline network and on the related security of supply will be of vital importance. Synthetic gas and hydrogen have different effects on parts of the network due to their 200 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   different composition and chemical and physical properties. Gas network components must, therefore, be monitored and further defined and investigated in order to continue to fully utilise the pipeline infrastructure in the carbon-free future, since the gas sector offers the possibility of seasonally storing electricity surplus from RES and transporting CO2 neutral gas at minimal cost since no construction of new transmission and distribution infrastructure will be needed, removing some burden from the electricity sector. Research and development in the area of production and use of renewable gases in gas pipeline systems should be prioritised to analyse the impact of different components of renewable gases on gas pipelines and different types of end-users. Wider use requires an integrated view of how the whole sector works. At the same time, this is the basis for active work in determining the criteria, proportions and acceptable compositions of renewable gases in systems. 4.5.3 Electricity and gas market, energy prices i. The current market situation for electricity and gas, including energy prices The electricity market The Slovenian electricity market is at the intersection of three major European markets, the German-Austrian, Italian and South-East European markets. As the liquid electricity exchanges do not yet operate on the fragmented markets of South-East Europe, we maintain that the markets of Germany, Austria, Italy and South-Eastern Europe have the greatest influence on the Slovenian market. In the first two, in recent years, production in wind and solar power plants, which are among the unpredictable and weather-dependent energy sources, has increased rapidly. An additional impact on the market situation was the fact that most wind and solar power generation plants are covered by national support schemes and can, therefore, offer very low electricity prices on the market. As a result, prices have fallen in recent years, which for some reasons, stopped and reversed in 2017. The market situation is also significantly influenced by the merging of day ahead markets. Until 2018, the Slovenian market was included in the multi-regional coordination of day-ahead markets at borders with Austria, Italy and Croatia. By the end of 2019, implicit day-to-day coupling at all borders had taken place. In the coming years, due to the gradual introduction of European regulations laying down guidelines for the establishment of network rules, the introduction of day-to-day and intra-day market coupling at all European borders is expected. In addition, balancing energy will be exchanged between countries. The markets of Slovenia and Hungary are also expected to connect in 2022. Wholesale market The wholesale market in Slovenia is fully open and liberalised. Generators, traders and suppliers of electricity come into contact on the market. Borzen d.o.o. performs the role of the electricity market operator and records all electricity transactions or contracts. Thus, all contractually agreed obligations in which electricity is bought or sold in Slovenia or energy is transferred across the border of the regulatory area are recorded. Individual participants can conclude deals bilaterally or on energy exchanges in Slovenia or abroad. The electricity exchange in Slovenia is operated by BSP Energetska Borza d.o.o. Day-ahead and intra-day trading is carried out on the exchange. It is also possible to register transactions in the OTC clearing and settlement system. BSP is the designated operator of the electricity market (NEMO). The Energy Agency (AE) monitors the performance of the wholesale market in Slovenia. The AE implements inter alia market transparency controls based on REMIT, which is the key basis for ensuring the integrity and transparency of the energy market and an integrated regulatory framework for monitoring and controlling the European wholesale electricity market. 201 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Market concentration In 2018, 26 domestic and foreign companies traded on the BSP, which is less than the year before and in previous years. The total market share of three traders as an indicator of the level of concentration - CR3 was 50.4%, and the total market share of five traders - CR5 was 63.4%. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) stood at 1 357 in 2018, indicating a moderate concentration in the wholesale market and was higher than in 2017, when it was 1 077. Bilateral market Bilateral trading takes place outside the organised stock market. It is carried out between two parties who determine the terms of purchase or sale. As the content of the bilateral agreement is mutually agreed, it is the most common form of trading. The contracts are closed, and the records are kept by the market operator. In 2018, the market operator recorded 109 113 closed contracts and operational forecasts with a total volume of 83 063 190 MWh. Compared to the previous year, the total number of recorded closed contracts and operational forecasts decreased by 4.7% in 2018, while the volume of trading decreased as the total amount of energy covered by the contracts decreased by 5.2%.92 Day-ahead trading on the exchange Day-ahead trading is carried out in the manner of auction trading through the trading application. Products in this market segment are limited by price range and minimum quantity interval. Multiregional Market Coupling (MMC) is also included in trading, which also allocates available interconnection capacity [MPZ]. The total trading volume in 2018 for the day ahead was 7 42 GWh, which is more than the year before. Twenty-five market participants participated in this market segment. Intra-day trading on the exchange The volume of auction trading through implicit intra-day auctions was 200 GWh. Bids worth a total of 4 133 GWh were handled, of which 2 581 GWh were for purchases and 1 553 GWh for sales. Intra-day trading also includes the balancing market section, which allows an electricity grid system operator to purchase electricity to balance the system. The balancing market is traded on a regular basis. For ease of operation, the Slovenian balancing market is linked to the intra-day market. The total volume of intra-day trading decreased in 2018 compared to 2017, reaching 131 GWh, of which the balancing market volume was 129 GWh and the remaining volume of intra-day trading was only 2 GWh. The volume of intra-day trading in 2018 represented only 4.3% of the total trading on the Slovenian electricity exchange. Wholesale market liquidity Wholesale market liquidity is determined by the Energy Agency on the basis of calculation of the Churn factor. In 2018, the value of the index decreased slightly compared to the values of previous years, amounting to 3.06. The index shows that the Slovenian wholesale electricity market is well developed and provides a high level of liquidity. At the end of 2018, the final average price of electricity supplied for business consumption was EUR 86.6/MWh, which is 7.3% more than in the previous year. Business consumption prices went up in all customer groups, but by different rates. When indicating figures, we summarised Eurostat's analysis comparing two business customers in the group with annual consumption between 20 and 500 MWh/year and in the group 20 to 70 GWh/year.                                                            92  Source: AGEN RS, Report on the State of Energy in Slovenia in 2018, p. 76.  202 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   In the first- group with electricity consumed between 20 and 500 MWh/year, the total final price was 129 EUR/MWh, with the price without fees and taxes amounting to 88.3 EUR/MWh and the fees and taxes amounting to 40.7 EUR/MWh. In the second-mentioned group with electricity consumption between 20 and 70 GWh/year, the total final price was 75.8 EUR/MWh, with the price excluding fees and taxes amounting to 54.3 EUR/MWh and fees and taxes amounting to 21.5 EUR/MWh. Although prices had generally risen in 2018, they are on average still below EU average prices. Retail market The retail market is fully liberalised, and there is no regulation of retail prices. The data in the table below shows that the Slovenian retail electricity market is well developed and that there are no systemic obstacles to its operation. The number of electricity suppliers is large in number and is gradually increasing. The market concentration (HHI) is reasonably small and has been decreasing in recent years (HHI in 2016: 1 413; in 2017: 1 281). Data on the situation in the electricity market are publicly available on the AE website, which further contributes to the transparency of the operation of the electricity market in Slovenia.

Traders, who are also natural gas importers, deliver it via neighbouring transmission systems to the Slovenian transmission system. Natural gas traded on the wholesale gas market comes from transmission systems from neighbouring countries that have their own natural gas sources. The Slovenian wholesale market can be supplied with gas from Austria, Italy and Croatia.93                                                            93  Under normal conditions, supply from Croatia is not (yet) possible due to having too low pressure in the transmission system. In the event of an emergency in Slovenia (and in the event of deliveries to Croatia via Hungary) this would be possible. In 2019, the possibility of return flow from Croatia to Slovenia was envisaged. 203 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Liberalisation of the market entails a decrease in the number of long-term contracts concluded directly with natural gas producers from Russia. They have been replaced by short-term contracts concluded at gas hubs, stock exchanges and other points in the EU. In 2018, 61.2% of natural gas was purchased under short-term contracts. This is slightly lower compared to 2017, when the percentage of short-term natural gas contracts was 62.5%. The duration of contracts or the ratio of short-term and long-term contracts can affect the security of supply since insufficient supply could result in gas shortages if the required quantities could not be purchased on current markets. The distribution of natural gas is carried out as an optional local public service (public service obligation) comprising distribution system operator activity to supply general consumption consumers in urban areas and settlements and as distribution to industrial and commercial customers in closed distribution system areas. According to the Energy Agency94, in 2018, the distribution of natural gas in the form of CPS was carried out in 81 municipalities in most of the urban areas of Slovenia, except for Primorska. The number of distribution system operators decreased to 13 due to the merger of the two companies. Status of the wholesale natural gas market Wholesale natural gas market The natural gas market in Slovenia is open and liberalised. There is no natural gas exchange in Slovenia, intra-day and day-ahead products are traded via a virtual point service offered to market participants by the natural gas transmission system operator. Natural Gas Market Concentration There are 18 companies in Slovenia that transport gas into the country. The market share of the company with the largest share of natural gas imports to Slovenia is 52.6%. Eight companies with the largest market shares provide 95% of all-natural gas imports to Slovenia, and 60% of all imports are covered by just the two companies with the highest market share. Twenty-one companies supply natural gas to system users. The largest market share of an individual company is 43.7%.  Of the total consumer off-take 95% is supplied by the nine largest companies and 60% by the three largest companies. The market share of the four largest gas companies on the market (Four-Firm Concentration Ratio - CR4) is 77.5%. Natural gas market liquidity On the virtual point through which natural gas trading takes place, 12 traders participate. In 2018, trading volumes on the virtual point came to 1.13 TWh, while there was no trading of amounts through the brokerage platform. The Churn factor for 2018 is 1.01. Import and export In 2018, 13.3 TWh of natural gas was imported into Slovenia while exports amounted to 3.8 TWh. Imports to Slovenia are possible via three border points and exports via two. The technical capacity in MWh/day is shown in the table below.

The total quantity was imported from abroad, namely 70% from Austria, 29.5% from Russia and 0.5% from Italy. Slovenia does not have its own natural gas production units, so production for 2018 amounted to 0 TWh. In Slovenia, there are also no biogas, hydrogen or synthetic gas production units connected to the gas pipeline network and the production of gas from renewable sources was 0 TWh. Natural gas storage facilities and LNG production facilities are also not available in Slovenia. Other important factors The transmission system operator shall provide certain support mechanisms to promote the use of renewable gas and alternative fuels in transport:  in order to promote the use of gas from renewable sources, the transmission system operator shall take into account the renewable factor in the calculation of the network charge and shall take it as a discount in the calculation of the network charge;  in order to promote alternative use of gas in transport, the transmission system operator shall take into account the compressed natural gas factor in the calculation of the network charge and shall take it as a discount in the calculation of the network charge. Situation on the natural gas retail market The Slovenian retail market comprises end consumers on the distribution and transmission systems. Retail market prices are unregulated for all types of customers. The distribution system comprises 120 228 household customers, 29 customers in closed distribution systems and 14 246 public utilities. There are 139 commercial customers connected to the transmission system. The average consumption of household customers is 9 615 kWh per year. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index for the natural gas market stands at 2410. The market share of the three largest suppliers is 67%. The share of customers switching to a natural gas supplier is 3.2%.  The supply to customers on the gas distribution system is mainly measured by classic gas meters, which are read at least once a year by the distribution system operator, while the customer has the opportunity to report meter readings to the distribution system operator or supplier at any time. The proportion of smart meters is negligible. Natural gas market development targets  In order to achieve climate agreement targets, Slovenia will also comply with the guidelines and recommendations of the European Commission and ENTSO-G for the gradual replacement of the share of natural gas with renewable gas, such as synthetic natural gas, hydrogen and biomethane. Adequate penetration of renewable gases into the energy balance will require the development of a renewable gas market, which may exist within the natural gas market or as a standalone market. The commercially available renewable gases will be made available to suppliers who will supply renewable gases to final customers in different sectors, thereby contributing to the decarbonisation of each sector and reducing the carbon footprint of each final customer. The development of a liquid market for renewable gas will contribute to increasing the share of renewable gas in natural gas and thus reduce the price of such gas, making the production of renewable gas more commercially attractive. This will increase the potential for the development of domestic production of renewable gas as a commercial activity for domestic non-regulated energy companies. The transmission system operator will continue to contribute to the development of the renewable gas market by taking into account the network discount in the case of renewable gas transmission. The gas system operator will only be able to participate in pilot projects for the production of renewable gas with the consent of the Energy Agency. Such pilot projects will seek answers to questions regarding the conditions for connection of larger production facilities to the pipeline system, which will be built by unregulated companies after the market breakthrough of renewable gas. This 205 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   will allow gas system operators to continue to ensure a secure and reliable supply of natural gas with varying proportions of renewable gas. ii. Projections of developments with existing policies and measures until at least 2040 (including 2030) Projections of energy prices are given in Section 4.1. Estimated development of major external factors affecting the energy system and greenhouse gas emission trends, subsection iii. Global energy trends, international fossil fuel prices, the carbon price in EU-ETS. It should be borne in mind that, on the basis of the planned new European directive on energy taxation, energy price ratios will change fundamentally.
