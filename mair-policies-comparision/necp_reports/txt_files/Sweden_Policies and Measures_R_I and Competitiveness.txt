3.5 Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness  3.5.1 Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.5  Policies for research and innovation Energy research policies are set out in the Government bill on Research and Innovation for Sustainability, Competitiveness and Security of Supply in the Energy Sector (Government bill 2016/17:66) and are implemented by the energy-related activities under the National Energy Research and Innovation Programme. They complement the policies presented in the Government bill A Cooperative Approach to Knowledge  and Enhancing Competitiveness (Government bill 2016/17:50).  These bills set out the policy and the budget for the next four years and similar bills have been presented every four years. The next Government bill on the energy research and innovation policy is currently being prepared and the Government will make a decision on it in autumn 2020. The 110 (199) Government has commissioned the Swedish Energy Agency to prepare the background information for this bill to provide a sound basis for continued funding for the sector.  The Agency has overall responsibility for research, development, innovation and demonstration and for the National Energy Research and Innovation Programme. Some related activities are also carried out by other agencies working in conjunction with the Swedish Energy Agency. Basic research on nuclear fission and fusion is funded by the Swedish Research Council. Overall basic energy research is carried out jointly by the Swedish Research Council (which evaluates the quality of the research) and the Swedish Energy Agency (which evaluates its relevance to energy).  The Energy Development Board is the ultimate decision-making body for the National Energy Research and Innovation Programme. Its members are appointed by the Government and represent various fields and disciplines. They are drawn from the academic and commercial world and from the public sector. The Board usually makes decisions on major programmes and large individual projects. It can also delegate decisions to the Swedish Energy Agency.  The National Energy Research and Innovation Programme Sweden's activities under the National Energy Research and Innovation Programme, which has an annual budget of around SEK 1.6 billion for 20172020, are based on the principle that energy research and innovation should help to find solutions for five overall challenges201:   to create a fully renewable energy system which meets the climate, while considering the environmental impact of the different types of renewable energy;  to ensure that the energy system is flexible and robust and provides security of supply for society as a whole as part of a fully renewable energy system;  to create a resource-efficient society which improves competitiveness, facilitates the transition to a renewable energy system and enables society as a whole to use available resources efficiently;  to increase action on innovation, jobs and the climate to give Sweden a leading position in the transition to a renewable energy system; to use the transition as an opportunity to develop businesses;  to facilitate interaction between various operators, sectors,                                                       201 Government bill Research and Innovation for sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply in the energy sector (Government bill 2016/17:66). 111 (199) standards and business models in the energy system with the aim of creating the conditions for cooperation and diversity to speed up the transition. Sweden will carry out initiatives to address these challenges under the 20172020 National Energy Research and Innovation Programme. The programme runs research and innovation initiatives in nine areas:   the transport system  bioenergy  buildings in the energy system  electricity generation and the electricity system  industry  sustainable society  general energy system studies  business development and commercialisation  cooperation on information.  Section 4.6 describes some examples of current or completed projects funded by the National Energy Research and Innovation Programme.  Ten-year research programme on climate and sustainable society In addition to the National Energy and Innovation Programme, there is also a Ten-Year National Climate Research Programme. The Programme was launched in 2017 to help achieve Sweden's aim to be a fossil-free welfare society and its ambition to be a global leader in achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement. People must radically change and adapt their behaviour to reduce humanity's impact on the climate  in Sweden, in the EU and worldwide. Interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral research and innovation in many different fields is required to meet climate challenges. The programme was granted around SEK 75 million in 2018, and it is estimated that it will receive SEK 130 million a year from 2019 to 2026.  There is also a Ten-Year National Research Programme for Sustainable Society. The programme was launched in 2017 and will develop knowledge which may lead to the development of new solutions of in all sectors of society, to create a safe, secure, sustainable and inclusive society. The programme is based on the Agenda 2030 sustainability goals, the national environmental targets and other relevant national objectives. Its initiatives are conducted on the basis of a strategic research agenda. The results of the programme must benefit society by utilising existing knowledge and developing new knowledge. In 2019, the programme will pay around SEK 25 million to research projects and around SEK 25 million to social housing projects. The programme funding for 20192026 is expected to be SEK 100 million a year.  112 (199)  Four cooperative programmes have been launched for the Government's 2019-2022 term of office to improve cooperation between businesses, academic institutions and the Government202. These programmes aim to concentrate resources on enhancing Sweden's competitiveness and capacity for innovation and meeting the major challenges facing society. One of the four cooperative programmes deals with the climate transition for businesses.  The Government will also monitor and develop the work of the cooperative programme Next Generation Travel and Transport, which has decided to focus on automation, digitisation and electrification.  The National Innovation Council The Government has set up an innovation council to devise innovative solutions for major social challenges and to promote long-term competitiveness and sustainability in Sweden203. The Innovation Council has an advisory role and brings a new perspective to matters of importance for innovation policy.  Its main purpose is to improve the conditions for innovation in Sweden and society's ability to find innovative solutions to challenges.  3.5.2 Where applicable, cooperation with other Member States in this area, including, where appropriate, information on how the SET Plan objectives and policies are being translated to a national context  Cooperation with other Member States International cooperation on energy research and innovation will be an ever more important complement to national initiatives for achieving the national objectives and is particularly important for a small country like Sweden. Sweden's cooperation with other countries on research, innovation and development is conducted mainly within the EU and its various instruments. These include the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (Horizon 2020) and the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET plan)204. However Sweden also participates in the work of other international forums such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Mission Innovation (MI).                                                        202 https://www.regeringen.se/regeringens-politik/regeringens-strategiska-samverkansprogram/. 203 https://www.regeringen.se/regeringens-politik/nationella-innovationsradet/. 204 https://setis.ec.europa.eu/actions-towards-implementing-integrated-set-plan. 113 (199) The SET plan contains four key priorities and ten key actions to accelerate the energy system transition. Objectives and implementation plans have been developed for each key action at EU level. Participation is voluntary, but Sweden participates in relevant key actions which are also national priorities, as this is be best way to link national and EU objectives. Sweden participates to some extent in the following working groups and corresponding implementation plans: ocean energy, smart solutions for energy consumers, smart cities, energy systems, energy efficiency in buildings, energy efficiency in industry, batteries for e-mobility, bioenergy and renewable fuels and carbon storage and carbon utilisation. The work entails linking up parts of the National Research Programme (activities under each objective), in other words each thematic and strategic research and innovation initiative within these objectives, to assist with the joint actions and objectives of a particular key action in the SET plan.  Swedish operators also participate in some of the EU's Technology and Innovation Platforms: ETIP Renewable Heating and Cooling and ETIP Smart Networks for Energy Transition (SNET). The platforms are industry-led and carry out activities within the key actions of the respective SET plans.  ERA-NET is a Horizon 2020 instrument for cooperation on joint calls and project funding between research funding agencies in the EU. Sweden takes part in many of these cooperative programmes to complement national initiatives in a particular area, increase the dissemination of knowledge and learn from various research and development initiatives. In summary, Sweden participates in the key actions: bioenergy, ocean energy, solar energy, smart cities and communities, building a sustainable society, smart grids, wind energy, transport and adaptation to climate change. Sweden also takes part in ERA-NET cooperative programmes and a Joint Programme Initiative which assists with implementing the SET Plan's implementation plans (see Table 13).  Around SEK 45 million was paid for the cooperative programmes and initiatives in which Sweden participates in 2018; this is expected to rise to around SEK 45 million in 2019. In addition to this, Sweden plans to take part in a Horizon Europe partnership programme (co-funded by the EU).   Table 13.

The calls require bioenergy projects in which cooperation between the operators in many of the countries taking part in the call add value to the project. The project must relate to supply or consumption or both (heating, cooling, electricity, fuel) in different biofuel chains. SOLAR-ERA.NET COFUND 1  SOLAR-ERA.NET COFUND 2 Reinforces national programmes for solar cells and solar thermal electricity and the networks of Swedish operators. The Solar-ERA-NET Cofund aims to increase the exchange of knowledge and stimulate developments in solar electricity by financing joint projects and activities and using existing knowledge at regional, national and European level. Sweden has a lot of solar electricity know-how. To maintain its position as a global leader, it is important to promote international cooperation. It is also expected to strengthen in Sweden. OCEAN ERA-NET  OCEAN ERA-NET COFUND Reinforces national ocean energy programmes205 and the networks of Swedish operators. The research and development carried out by universities and companies in Sweden is commercialised primarily in markets abroad. By supporting international cooperation, Swedish research and development can assist with the transition of the energy system both nationally and internationally and can be exported to foreign markets by Swedish businesses. There is also a significant need for cooperation in this area as there are many barriers to be overcome and a very limited amount of funding. Member States can work together to commercialise ocean energy in Europe. BESTF3 Reinforces national bioenergy programmes and the networks of Swedish operators. Funding for cooperative projects on bioenergy, which must demonstrate at least one innovative step in bioenergy processes and will result in pre-commercial demonstration. The programme aims to promote the contribution of bioenergy to European climate and energy policy targets. ERA-NET PLUS NEW EUROPEAN WIND ATLAS Reinforces national wind energy programmes and the networks of Swedish research priorities and the development of electricity generated from renewable sources. The aim is to develop and produce a new European wind atlas. ERA-NET SMART GRIDS PLUS ERA-NET SMART ENERGY SYSTEMS  ERA-NET PLUS REGSYS Reinforces national grid programmes and the networks of Swedish operators. ERA-Net Smart Grids plus aims to contribute to the technological development of smart grids and facilitate interaction with the market and society in order to achieve the common European vision for the energy system of the future. The objective is to integrate smart grid technologies, stakeholders and market processes to help achieve - (2020), medium- (2035) and long- (2050) term energy policy targets. ERA-Net plus Regsys aims to create new system solutions for the specific needs of local and regional energy systems and networks. The property owners, local and regional companies, municipal and county councils and others who need these solutions will be actively involved in the development of new knowledge and integrated technologies, processes, system services and prototypes. FORESTVALUE Reinforces national bioenergy initiatives. The aim of this cooperative programme is to promote innovation and improve competitiveness in the forestry sector in Europe and to support its transition from a resource-intensive to a knowledge-intensive, productive, resource-efficient and resilient sector. International cooperation contributes towards establishing a bioeconomy in Sweden by providing leverage for the development and testing of solutions which may achieve it ERA-NET COFUND SMART CITIES AND COMMUNITIES  ERA-NET COFUND SUSTAINABLE URBANISATION (ENSUGI) Reinforces national initiatives for sustainable cities and a sustainable society. priorities. The aim of ENSUGI is to address global challenges in the area covered by the call, focusing on synergies and connections within the Food-Water-Energy system and links to urbanisation and sustainable development through cooperation between European operators in the JPI Urban Europe and countries outside Europe. ERA-NET COFUND ELECTROMOBILITY EUROPE Reinforces national initiatives for electrification of the vehicle fleet and transport research priorities. Testing and demonstrating knowledge and innovation in the transport system and the urban environment will help produce a breakthrough for electric mobility in Europe. URBAN EUROPE The strategic research and innovation agenda developed within Urban Europe is supported by participation in ERA-sustainable cities initiatives.  Nordic cooperation Sweden is a member of Nordic Energy Research (NEF), which is a joint energy research and analysis institution under the Nordic Council of Ministers. The overall purpose of its activities is to promote energy cooperation, use and profiling in the Nordic countries. NEF supports areas of energy research that are of common interest to Nordic stakeholders and                                                       205 Ocean energy is a collective term for technologies that generate energy from waves, tides, currents, temperature differences and differences in salinity. 115 (199) provide potential for cross-border cooperation. It finances and coordinates research, provides administrative expertise and advice and builds networks. Sweden is paying SEK 12.5 million a year to the NEF for 2019 and 2020.  Examples of calls and projects NordForsk, The Academy of Finland, Formas, the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (Forte), the Swedish Energy Agency and the Research Council of Norway finance a joint call for research on sustainable urban development and smart cities. The call has a total budget of NOK 50 million. The overall objective of the call is to promote cooperation between the knowledge societies in the Nordic countries to increase the possibilities for addressing the challenges facing cities of all sizes. The projects must contribute to the overall analysis and use of important knowledge for the successful implementation of possible solutions.  The Swedish Energy Agency and the Norwegian state-owned company Gassnova are providing SEK 7.7 million and NOK 9.5 million respectively in funding for a bilateral three-year demonstration project for carbon capture and storage (CCS) at the Preem refinery in Lysekil. The project is investigating the possibility of setting up a full-scale CCS plant at the llation which will reduce its CO2 emissions by up to 500 000 tonnes a year. The demonstration plant is a stage in the plan to set up a full-scale plant in 2025.  3.5.3 Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds  Financing measures Sweden is a member of Mission Innovation, an initiative in which the governments of many countries cooperate to accelerate global clean energy innovation. The initiative aims to make new, clean energy technology affordable. Sweden has committed to double its initiatives under the energy research and innovation programme, which is operator-initiated set up as a result of public calls. This doubling is based on the average budget allocated for such initiatives from 2013-2015 until 2020.  Table 14 shows the outcome for 2016-2018 and the planned initiatives up to 2020. The initial value is estimated at SEK 134 million based on the average annual outcome for 2013-2015 and with the aim of increasing the funding to SEK 268 million by 2020. The total value of the initiatives planned for 2018 has now increased to SEK 215 million. In view of the current level and the initiatives planned by the Swedish Energy Agency, the total budget for the research categories highlighted by the Government is expected to double by 116 (199) 2020, in line with the Mission Innovation Commitment.
