INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 4   PART 1  GENERAL FRAMEWORK SECTION A: NATIONAL PLAN   1 OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN   1.1 Overview   i. Political, economic, environmental, and social context of the plan For some time, Italy has been working towards ensuring the widest possible use of instruments that, together, serve to enhance energy security, environmental protection and the affordability of energy, thus contributing to European objectives relating to energy and environment.  Italy is fully aware of the potential benefits inherent to the increased availability of renewables and energy efficiency, connected to the reduction in polluting and climate-changing emissions, improvements in energy security, and economic and employment opportunities for families and for the production system, and intends to follow this path with conviction, with an approach that increasingly focuses on citizens, including in their capacity as prosumers, and businesses, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises. This development will be guided by a constant focus on efficiency and facilitated by cost reductions for some renewable technologies, including photovoltaics, which will take on growing significance due to their modularity and the fact that they use a source that is widely available.  Italy therefore agrees with the Community approach, which is intended to strengthen commitment to the decarbonisation dimension, and aims to promote a Green New Deal, understood as a green covenant with businesses and citizens that views the environment as the expressed in different forms and follow different directions, including provisions to transpose the EU Directives implementing the energy and climate package, but also by promoting new and synergistic initiatives, starting with Law No 160 of 27 December 2019 (Budget Law for 2020).  In the course of this agreed and consolidated strategic process, due consideration will be given to aspects of economic and social sustainability, and to compatibility with other environmental protection objectives. The recent provision contained in Law No 141 of 12 December 2019, which converted Decree-Law No 111 of 14 October 2019 concerning the transformation of the INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 5   Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning (CIPE) into the Interministerial Committee for Sustainable Development (CIPESS), follows the objectives set out in the Green New Deal. Its declared purpose is to foster closer coordination of public policies with a view to pursuing the sustainable development objectives set out by Resolution A/70/L.1, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September 2015.  As regards the economic and social sustainability of the energy transition, in the last 10 years charges to support renewable energies and energy efficiency have increased significantly: taking just those incentives covered by tariffs, these have risen from approximately 3.5 billion in 2009 to 14.1 billion in 2017, to then fall to 13.3 billion in 2018.  The combination of the economic crisis with the increasing cost to support renewable energies and energy efficiency has created a greater vulnerability, meaning that the sustainability of the energy system, including from an environmental perspective, must be sought with due care and attention to the economic impacts on consumers, a proportion of whom, moreover, find themselves living in conditions of more than just energy poverty, and are in need of protection. On the other hand, the energy (gas, fuel and electricity) costs paid by businesses often point to a positive spread with respect to the European average (above all for SMEs), and this represents a further reason to adopt an approach that is very mindful of the costs of energy transition.  In addition, due care will be paid to ensuring that the energy and climate objectives are compatible with the objectives relating to landscape protection, the quality of air and water bodies, the safeguarding of biodiversity and soil protection. Those measures necessary for the increasing decarbonisation of the system require plants and infrastructure that may have environmental impacts. If, on the one hand, the impacts of some of these measures may be mitigated  for example by promoting the incorporation of photovoltaics into already built-up areas or areas unsuitable for other uses  on the other hand the stability of the energy system additionally requires, at least in the mid-term, a range of physical infrastructure, the construction of which will stimulate forms of dialogue and cooperation between territories.  The process aimed at establishing the mix of solutions and instruments that is most compatible with the objectives of the 2030 Energy and Climate Plan and other requirements, including those relating to environmental impacts, has involved various interlocutors. This is thanks not least to the public consultation and the strategic environmental assessment conducted on the draft Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (INECP) sent to the European Commission in late 2018.  The widespread adherence by citizens and businesses to the instruments for promoting distributed generation and energy efficiency suggest that the support policies in these areas may be able to continue, paying particular attention to minimising costs. As mentioned above, however, various forms of participation will also be required for the construction of large plants (supplemental to the plants for distributed generation, but still necessary) and the remaining physical infrastructure so as to ensure that the measures are implemented in an orderly and timely manner, in compliance with the process for achieving the objectives.  Innovation in terms of policies for the decarbonisation of the energy sector, developed with due regard for other issues to which citizens and businesses are sensitive, has a sufficient degree of support, as also emerges from the public consultation. That support may be strengthened by measures designed to protect the most vulnerable sections of the population, with a particular focus on energy efficiency and distributed generation from renewable sources. The arrangements for doing so would help ensure that the benefits of the energy transition are passed on to consumer citizens and businesses.   INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 6   ii. Strategy relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union This plan is intended to contribute to a wide-ranging transformation of the economy. In this, the combination of decarbonisation, the circular economy, efficiency and the rational and fair use of natural resources represent objectives and instruments for an economy that is more respectful of people and the environment. The framework is one of integration of the national energy markets in the Single Market and due consideration for affordable pricing and security of supply.  Italy therefore agrees with the approach proposed by the Governance Regulation, which opts for an organic and synergic strategy for the five dimensions of energy. The general objectives sought by Italy are essentially the following. a) Accelerate the decarbonisation process by setting 2030 as an interim milestone for achieving full decarbonisation of the energy sector by 2050 and integrating environmental factors in other public policies. b) Place a central emphasis on citizens and businesses (in particular SMEs), in such a way that they become key players and beneficiaries of the energy transition and not just the financiers of active policies. This requires the promotion of self-consumption and renewable energy communities, but also the greatest possible degree of regulation and transparency of the sales segment, so that consumers may reap the benefits of a competitive market. c) Foster the evolution of the energy system, particularly in the electricity sector, from a centralised structure to a distribution predominantly reliant on renewable sources, d) Adopt measures to improve the capacity of renewables to contribute to security while at the same time promoting frameworks, infrastructure and market rules which, in turn, contribute to the integration of renewables. e) Continue to ensure adequate supplies from conventional sources, by pursuing security and continuity of supply, with the understanding that the demand for these conventional sources is in progressive decline as a result of both the increase in renewables and energy efficiency. f) Promote energy efficiency across all sectors as an instrument for protecting the environment, improving energy security and reducing energy costs for families and businesses. g) Promote electrification of consumption, in particular in the civil and transport sectors, as an instrument for additionally improving air and environmental quality. h) Guide the evolution of the energy system through research and innovation activities to develop, in line with European guidelines and the requirements for full decarbonisation, solutions able to achieve sustainability, security, continuity and cost effectiveness of supply based increasingly on renewable energy in all usage sectors. Another goal to encourage the reorientation of the production system towards processes and products with a small carbon footprint, which may also be of benefit to the demand arising from other support measures. i) Adopt, taking into account the conclusions of the strategic environmental assessment (sea) and related environmental monitoring, measures and expedients to reduce the potential negative impacts of energy transition on other equally relevant objectives, such as the quality of air and bodies of water, the limitation of soil consumption and landscape protection. j) Continue the process for integrating the national energy system with the energy union. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 7   The pursuit of these general objectives requires the adoption of horizontal policies and measures to supplement the sector-specific measures outlined in Chapter 3, which, in turn, must be coordinated and structured so as to be coherent with not just the specific objectives, but also the general objectives outlined above.  The horizontal measures will include the following. - Careful governance of the plan that will enable it to be implemented in a coordinated manner and which ensures uniformity of action, in particular in terms of the timeframes and processes for authorising and building physical infrastructure, the coordination of research and innovation activities, and, more generally, the monitoring of the effects of the plan in terms of the reorientation of the production system, and of and costs and benefits. In light of the cross-cutting nature of the plan, which affects the tasks and remits of many State administrations, and the system of competences established by the Italian Constitution, this governance will encompass various ministries. It will also involve, in accordance with their respective roles, the Regions, the municipalities and the Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and Environment (ARERA), with the possibility of including representatives from the research sector and business associations and organisations. An important prerequisite for effective and efficient governance of the plan is ensuring that the objectives are widely shared and agreed upon and that the policies and measures are implemented and managed in a coordinated manner, as emerged from the consultation. A similar consensus will be sought as the Plan implementation instruments become operational. - An evaluation of the actions needed to effectively streamline the procedures for implementing the measures within the timeframes identified. Taken together with the stability of the legislative and regulatory framework, and where compatible with the requirement to periodically update the processes established as a result of technological developments and the monitoring of the costs and benefits of each measure, this will help to ensure that steady progress is made towards achieving the objectives. - Updating  and, if necessary, revising  the tasks of the various public bodies working on energy and environmental matters to ensure that their roles and activities are coordinated and coherent with the objectives of the plan and, more generally, the objectives of full decarbonisation by 2050. - Promoting research activities, with the involvement of network operators, on methods for enhancing the integration of the systems (electricity, gas, water), by exploring, for example, the possibility of using pre-existing infrastructure to store renewable energy, including in the long term, with solutions that are effective in terms of economic and environmental costs/benefits. - Integrating new technologies into the energy system, starting with information technologies, in order to facilitate distributed generation, security, resilience, energy efficiency, and the active participation of consumers in energy markets. - A willingness to consider additional instruments if necessary, such as, for example, a review of energy taxation, diversified on the basis of polluting and climate-changing emissions, and in any case in line with the Community approach to this issue. In this, consideration would be given to the vulnerable sections of the population and to those production sectors that are still without alternative options to traditional fuel. - The possibility of using the flexible mechanisms provided for in European sectoral legislation. With regard to the strategy concerning each of the five dimensions of the Energy Union, remaining faithful to the objectives and measures outlined in the relevant chapters, a number of main elements are provided below.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 8   Dimension decarbonisation Italy intends to accelerate the transition from traditional fuels to renewable sources, by promoting the gradual phasing out of coal for electricity generation in favour of an electricity mix based on a growing share of renewables and, for the remainder, gas. Making this transition a concrete reality requires and is subject to the planning and construction of replacement plants and the necessary infrastructure.  Italy will implement the policies and measures needed to achieve the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases agreed at European and international level. For those sectors covered by the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)  primarily the thermoelectric sector and energy-intensive industries  factors contributing to this goal include: the phasing out of coal, scheduled by the end of 2025, as mentioned within the limits of, and as long as the replacement plants and necessary infrastructure are constructed in good time; a higher CO2 price level than in recent years; and a significant acceleration of renewables and energy efficiency in manufacturing processes. The coal phase-out could be implemented through, among other things, the construction of additional gas-fuelled thermoelectric units, which are necessary in view of the increased proportion of renewables in electricity generation to maintain the system at adequate levels. At present, no gas infrastructure developments are planned, but a temporary increase in gas consumption is envisaged.  For those other sectors included in the objectives established by the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), measures that take into account the potential and costs of reducing emissions will be developed; the most important contribution will, in any case, come from the transport and civil (residential and tertiary) sectors, combining measures for using and increasing the efficiency of renewables. For the ESR segments, the involvement of local authorities with direct competence for the transport, residential and services sectors is of fundamental importance.  Italy will promote the further development of renewables while also protecting and enhancing pre-existing products, by exceeding, if possible, the 30% target set, which must, in any event, be assumed to be a contribution towards meeting the EU target. This will be achieved through the use of instruments calibrated on the basis of the sectors of use, types of measures and size of the plants, with an approach aimed at limiting soil consumption and the impact on the landscape and environment, including requirements on air quality. With regard to the electricity sector, and with an additional view to the electrification of consumption, the intention is to make widespread use of built-up areas or areas already in use in some other way, by raising the profile of the different forms of self-consumption, including through distributed generation and storage. A further aim is to promote the creation of systems, starting with a few small islands disconnected from the national networks, in which an accelerated decarbonisation process and electrification of consumption with renewable sources can be trialled. In the heating sector, it will be particularly important to ensure coordination with the instruments for energy efficiency, in particular for buildings, and coherence of the instruments with air quality objectives.  Dimension energy efficiency The intention is to use a mix of fiscal, economic, regulatory and policy instruments, primarily calibrated by  sector of activity and type of target group. However, attempts will be also be made to integrate the energy efficiency aspect into policies and measures whose main purpose is something other than efficiency, in order to optimise the INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 9   cost-benefit ratio of the actions. In this respect, the significant potential for efficiency in the building sector may be better exploited through measures aimed at, for example, the energy renovation of buildings and neighbourhoods, together with the structural renovation, earthquake-proofing, systems upgrading and refurbishment thereof, in line with the strategy for energy renovation of the building stock by 2050. It will thus be possible to give due consideration to the potential contribution to decarbonisation of existing building stock, and of stock not undergoing significant refurbishment, which makes up most of the total built environment. In this context, solar heating, electric and gas heat pumps, and micro and mini high-efficiency cogeneration (HEC) technologies should be carefully considered, especially if fuelled by renewable gas.   With regard to transport, priority is given to policies for reducing demand for mobility and increasing collective mobility, in particular rail transport, which includes shifting freight transport from road to rail. Improve measures (regarding vehicle efficiency and emissions) must be supplemented with instruments to reduce mobility needs (avoid measures) and with efficiency in travel (shift measures).   As for the remaining demand for private mobility and the mobility of goods, the aim is to promote the use of alternative fuels and, in particular, electricity. This will be done by increasing the share of renewables through economic and regulatory instruments, in coordination with local government bodies.  Along with the ordinary instruments, it will also be possible to use resources from the development and cohesion programming cycle for 2021-27. In this regard, in the discussions with partners, which involve the Regions, among others, a specific national energy programme has been proposed. Taking the INECP as reference, this is intended to support initiatives to modernise and improve the efficiency of buildings and build new infrastructure, including infrastructure for sustainable mobility. The national programme, when approved, will be coordinated with regionally managed programmes.  Dimension energy security In terms of security of supply, the aim is, on the one hand, to become less dependent on imports by increasing renewable sources and energy efficiency and, on the other hand, to diversify sources of supply (for example through the use of natural gas, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), with infrastructure consistent with the scenario of deep decarbonisation by 2050).   With regard to the security and flexibility of the electricity system, and notwithstanding the need to promote the extensive involvement of all available resources  including storage, renewables and demand  account must be taken of the transformation of the system resulting from the growing importance of renewables and distributed generation. New operational methods and structures must be tested, including with the active participation of the transmission system operator (TSO). Similarly, the vital need for storage systems must be considered, to prevent overgeneration by electricity plants fuelled by renewables. As evidence of this need, estimates of the power needed from wind and photovoltaic alone to meet the 2030 renewables goals are of the same order of magnitude as the annual peak power demand on the network.   In addition, to achieve the security and flexibility objectives, the intention is to explore the potential offered by growing integration of the electricity and gas network infrastructure. In INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 10   this context, it will be important to explore the costs and benefits of power-to-gas technological solutions which, especially over the long term, make it possible to absorb any imbalances between renewable electricity production and energy demand, especially with high levels of photovoltaic penetration. Hydrogen could contribute to this, including for non-electricity consumption.  Particular attention will be paid to the resilience of the systems, in particular of transmission and distribution networks, through preventive measures proportionate to the expected increase in extreme events and periods of heavy load, and operational rules that enable the systems to be quickly restored to normal functioning levels.  In addition, by the end of 2020 the Plan for the Sustainable Energy Transition of Suitable Areas (PSETSA) will be adopted. This document will make it possible to establish a framework of reference of those areas in Italy in which hydrocarbon exploration, research and production activities would be planned, with the aim of improving their environmental, social and economic sustainability. In this respect, the outcomes of the PSETSA analyses could change the national production scenario.  Consumption and sources of supply will be monitored in order to ensure compliance with Security Regulation No 2017/1938 concerning preventive action plans and emergency plans.  Dimension internal market A greater degree of market integration is considered to be advantageous to the entire Union, and therefore the electricity interconnections and market coupling with other Member States countries will also be studied and developed, in order to facilitate efficient trade.  plans, which will be revised with a view to introducing additional measures, such as centralised storage systems, needed to ensure safe integration of renewable sources, and reducing over-generation, to be implemented in compliance with the provisions of the latest EU guidelines.  In any event, in the long term the electricity market must evolve towards different forms of trading because the cost of renewable sources, on which the focus must necessarily be placed in order to increase their contribution, is predominantly one of investment. Consequently, they make it possible for the producers concerned to present their offering following a different dynamic from gas-fuelled plants, which also have to deal with variable fuel costs. This entails a need to supplement and then adjust market regulation to create a context in which the offerings can be fairly compared and prevent negative effects on system adequacy, which would also have repercussions for the gas market.  The need for flexibility may also prove beneficial to system integration (between electricity, hydro and gas systems in particular), which should be implemented on a trial basis, including with a view to researching the most efficient long-term storage methods for renewable energy. Appropriate changes to the market and to the regulatory system could be analysed to foster the electricity-gas integration of technologies that convert electricity into a gas that can be injected to the network, in line with the provisions for energy storage systems in the recently INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 11   approved Electricity Market Directive and Regulation. This would be done taking developments in storage systems, including those enabled by technologies that convert one form of energy to another, and the need to develop seasonal and long-term storage into special consideration.  The expected reduction in the cost of electrolysis technology will make it possible to obtain renewable hydrogen for the decarbonisation of energy-intensive industrial sectors and long-haul commercial transport.  With regard to energy poverty, to supplement the measures described below, studies are under way to introduce efficiency measures and measures for the installation of renewable energy plants with self-consumption. Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness There are three fundamental criteria behind research and innovation activities in the energy sector: a. the finalisation of resources and activities geared towards the development of processes, products and knowledge that have an outlet into markets opened up as a result of support measures for the use of renewables, energy efficiency and network technology; b. synergistic integration between systems and technologies; c. viewing 2030 as a milestone in the process towards full decarbonisation, on which Italy is engaged in line with the long-term strategy to 2050, in which ambitious scenarios are proposed that envisage the reduction of emissions eventually to climate neutrality, in line with the EU approach.  Similarly, the support measures for innovation in sectors other than the energy sector will follow an approach, in the light of the Green New Deal, that fosters the modernisation of the production system in line with the medium and long-term energy and environment scenario.  With regard to competitiveness, the strategy outlined in the previous sections must be combined not just with the integration of the single market, but also with careful regulation of the energy markets, so that consumers and businesses can benefit from the positive effects of transparent competition, and prudent use of support mechanisms that may burden the community, as well as integration into the single market.  iii.  Overview table with key objectives, policies and measures of the plan In order to support and provide a solid analytical basis for the INECP, the following scenarios have been drawn up:  a base scenario that outlines an evolution of the energy system on the basis of current policies and measures;  an INECP scenario that quantifies the strategic objectives of the plan. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 12   The following tables show the primary objectives of the 2030 plan on renewables, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, and the main measures established to achieve the targets of the plan.  Table 1  Primary energy and climate objectives for 2020 and 2030, EU and Italy                                                                   1 The level of electricity interconnectedness to be achieved is deemed to be very ambitious, although it is lower than the overall European objective. This is because of the high / powerful / considerable capacity of non-programmable RES electricity plants, sources that have comparatively lower energy capability than other technologies, which Italy intends to install by the end of that have to cross mountain chains or be installed under the sea, more onerous than elsewhere.  2020 objectives 2030 objectives EU ITALY EU ITALY (INECP) Renewable energies (RES)   Share of energy from RES in the gross final consumption of energy 20% 17% 32% 30% Share of energy from RES in the gross final consumption of energy in the transport sector 10% 10% 14% 22% Share of energy from RES in the gross final consumption of energy for heating and cooling   +1.3% per year (indicative) +1.3% per year (indicative) Energy efficiency     Reduction in primary energy consumption compared to the PRIMES 2007 scenario -20% -24% -32.5% (indicative) -43% (indicative) Final consumption savings as a result of obligatory energy efficiency systems -1.5% per year (without transport sector) -1.5% per year (without transport sector) -0.8% per year (with transport sector) -0.8% per year (with transport sector) Greenhouse gas emissions     Reduction in GHG vs 2005 for all plants subject to ETS rules -21%  -43%  Reduction in GHG vs 2005 for all non-ETS sectors -10% -13% -30% -33% Overall reduction in greenhouse gases compared to 1990 levels -20%  -40%  Electricity interconnectedness     Level of electricity interconnectedness 10% 8% 15% 10%1 Electricity interconnection capacity (MW)   9.285  14.375 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 1111   Table 2 Main measures established to achieve the objectives of the INECP Scope Short name for the measure Type of instrument Renewable sources Energy efficiency Greenhouse gas emissions Emissions Environmental Code Regulatory   GHG ETS: -43%;

National and Union energy system and policy context of the national plan With the signing of the Kyoto Protocol, the European Union and its Member States committed themselves to a path aimed at combating climate change through the adoption of EU and national policies and measures for the decarbonisation of the economy.  This path was confirmed during the 21st Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Paris in 2015, through the adoption of the Paris Agreement by Decision 1/CP21. The Agreement establishes the need to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.  Italy signed the Agreement on 22 April 2016 and ratified it on 11 November 2016. At the time of writing, the Agreement, which entered into force on 4 November 2016, had been ratified by 184 of the 197 parties to the framework convention.  With the European Council of March 2007, provision was made for the first time at EU level for an integrated approach between energy policies and the fight against climate change, with the 2020 Climate and Energy Package.  The targets of the package, some of which are binding, have been transposed into the national legislation of the Member States as of 2009. For Italy, those binding targets include a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in those sectors not regulated by the ETS Directive by 13% by 2020, compared with 2005 levels. With regard to the promotion of renewable energy sources, Italy has been set the target of achieving a 17% share of energy from renewables in the gross final consumption of energy by 2020 and a sub-target of a 10% share of energy from renewables in the gross final consumption of energy in the transport sector.  The overall gross final consumption of energy (namely the measurement introduced by Directive 2009/28/EC for the purposes of monitoring EU targets for RES) in Italy in 2017 totalled around 120 Mtoe, with energy from RES totalling around 22 Mtoe: the share of consumption covered by RES was therefore 18.3%, higher than the 2020 target set for Italy by Directive 2009/28/EC.  With regard to the electricity sector, in 2017, approximately 35% of gross national production originated from RES; the renewable source that made the greatest contribution to actual electricity production in 2017 was hydropower (35% of overall electricity production from RES), followed by solar power (23%), bioenergy (19%), wind power (17%) and geothermal power (6%).  In the heating sector, less than 20% of overall energy consumption originated from renewable sources. In particular, approximately 11.2 Mtoe of energy from RES was consumed in 2017, approximately 10.3 Mtoe of which was consumed directly (through individual boilers, stoves, chimneys, solar panels, heat pumps, plants for using geothermal heat) and approximately 0.9 Mtoe in the form of derived heat consumption (for example through biomass-fired district heating systems). The renewable source that was most used in 2017 for heat consumption was solid biomass (approximately 7.9 Mtoe), which was INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 24   primarily used in the household sector in the form of firewood and pellets. Heat pumps also play an important role (2.65 Mtoe), whereas the contributions from bioliquids, biogas, geothermal power and solar power are still limited.  With regard to the transport sector, approximately 1.2 million tonnes of biofuels were released for consumption in 2017 (energy content equal to 1.06 Mtoe), which largely consisted of biodiesel.  the whole Italian economy, 92.7, confirmed the improvements made since 2005 (index value of 100 for the reference year 2000).  In 2016, the final consumption of energy (excluding non-energy uses) totalled 115.9 Mtoe (source: Eurostat energy balances), a slight reduction compared with 2015 (-0.3%). The downward trend shown over the last few years in the transport sector continued, settling at a consumption of 39.1 Mtoe (-1.1%); consumption in the residential sector was equal to 32.2 Mtoe (-1.0% compared with 2015). Going against the trend, however, the services and industrial sectors registered +0.3% and +1.4% increases in consumption, respectively, which were primarily caused by trends in economic activity.   toe/million the decrease compared with 2015 (-1.8%) was caused by a reduction in primary consumption in the face of GDP growth; generally speaking, the reduction in energy intensity recorded by Italy in 2016 was amongst the largest in the European Union.  Over the last few years, the steadily growing impact of RES and the reduction in energy intensity have helped Italy become less dependent on foreign sources of supply; the share of national energy demand met by net foreign imports remains high (at 77.7%), but is approximately five percentage points lower than in 2010.  After a decade of almost continuous decline, primary energy demand started to increase once again in 2017 (+1.5% compared with 2016); this demand is met less and less by oil (which nevertheless still represents one third of the total), solid fuels (6.1%) and imported electricity (4.9%). The contribution of gas, however, is increasing (36.2%), as is the contribution from renewable sources (a little under one fifth).  nability beyond 2020 will follow in the tracks of the Energy Union strategy  based on five dimensions: decarbonisation (including renewables), energy efficiency, energy security, a fully integrated energy market, research, innovation and competitiveness  and the new 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy approved by the European Council in its conclusions of 23 and 24 October 2014, and subsequent implementing provisions.  In light of this situation, and with a view to 2030 and the Roadmap 2050, Italy is making efforts towards creating planning instruments to identify objectives, policies and measures coherent with the European framework and compatible with the aim of improving environmental sustainability, security and the affordability of energy.  The Decree of the Minister of Economic Development and the Minister of the Environment and Land and Sea Protection of 10 November 2017 approved the new National Energy Strategy (SEN), which, as was stated by the ministers that approved it, was not so much a INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 25   destination as a starting point for drafting the INECP, used for the basic technical examination and the consultation performed.  In addition to the National Energy Strategy, there are various important documents that outline a national context favourable to the adoption of the INECP, some of which are cited below.  European strategy on adaptation to climate changecatalyst for European countries to develop a national strategy in this respect. By way of the Decree of the Ministry of the Environment of 16 June 2015, the National strategy on adaptation to climate change was approved, with the objective of defining how to tackle the impacts of climate change, including climatic variations and extreme weather and climate events, and identifying a set of actions and guidelines aimed at reducing to a minimum the risks of climate change, protecting the health, wellbeing and property of the population, preserving natural heritage, and maintaining or improving the ability of natural, social and economic systems to adapt.  On 7 December Towards a circular economy model in Italy  Framework and strategic positioning documentDevelopment and the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Natural Resources and the Sea was approved. The aim of the document is to provide a general framework for a commitments undertaken within the context of the Paris Agreement on climate change, the this in order to define a framework for moving from the current linear economy model to a circular one, with market strategies and models being reconsidered, and also for the purpose of safeguarding the competitiveness of industrial sectors and protecting natural resources.  The National Strategy for Sustainable Development (SNSvS), approved by the Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning (CIPE) on 22 December 2017, lays out a vision for the future and for development focused on sustainability, as a shared value essential to tackling the global challenges facing Italy. The Strategy represents the first step towards transposing the principles and objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at a national level, by assuming its four guiding principles: integration, universality, transformation and inclusion. The SNSvS is split into five areas, corresponding People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnership. A sixth area is dedicated to what are known as vectors for sustainability, to be regarded as essential elements for achieving the strategic national objectives. The document briefly puts forward a vision for a new circular economy model, with low CO2 emissions and resilience to climate change and other global changes caused by local crises, such as, for example, the loss of biodiversity, altered fundamental biogeochemical cycles (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus) and changes to land use.  Elements for a roadmap to sustainable mobilitycollaboration with the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Natural Resources and the Sea, the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, research organisations, economic operators in the sector and consumer and trade associations, outlines the current mobility situation in Italy and its environmental impacts, and provides an in-depth look into the opportunities offered by the technological development of transportation means. According to this document, the creation in Italy of an industrial chain of vehicles based on innovative technologies represents an indispensable component for developing a vast infrastructure for alternative fuels. The roadmap also INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 26   highlights the role of support measures, with great importance being placed on local policies in favour of sustainable mobility. In fact, the critical issues of traffic congestion, polluting emissions and road safety are concentrated in cities. A cultural change towards modal shift and the use of bicycles, public transport, shared and electric mobility and vehicles that use alternative fuels thus needs to be triggered in cities. The increasingly widespread use of digital applications, such as, for example, web conferences, teleworking and smart working is also desirable, as is the creation of online services to reduce the need for people to travel.  The National Plan for Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure (PNIRE), approved in 2012 and updated in 2016, was adopted through a joint process involving the main competent departments and stakeholders in the sector. The targets of the Plan to be achieved by 2020 are to create up to 13,000 slow/accelerated charging stations and 6,000 fast charging stations, at a ratio of one public charging station to every eight private charging stations, and to have 130,000 electric vehicles in circulation. Within this context, a programme agreement was signed in 2017 between the Regions and local authorities for the creation of electric vehicle charging networks, which aimed to focus the measures for implementing the Plan on actual regional needs, by promoting and enhancing participation by public and private entities. Provision is made for a total budget of 72.2 million, in respect of government co-financing totalling 28.7 million.   The PNIRE is currently being updated from an integrated perspective that also considers other measures to support demand for electric vehicles, and to upgrade and facilitate the use of infrastructure. The possibility of coordinating the development of recharging infrastructure with plans to rationalise the fuel network is also being assessed.  The Action plan for environmental sustainability of consumption in the public administration sector, also known as the National Action Plan on Green Public Procurement (PAN GPP) establishes the following three main strategic environmental objectives: reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, reduction in hazardous chemicals, and recycling and reuse of materials.  The Action plan on sustainable production and consumption (PAN SCP) forms part of international and national policies and strategies on the circular economy, the efficient use of resources and climate protection, implementing EU guidelines on the European Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy Action Plan   The National strategic framework for the development of the alternative fuels market in the transport sector and the creation of associated infrastructure (Legislative Decree No 257 of 16 December 2016) promotes the use of alternative fuels, in particular electricity, natural gas and hydrogen. With regard to electricity, the Decree has established measures to create an appropriate number of charging stations. In particular, it introduces the obligation to put in place conditions for the installation of electrical charging infrastructure in new structures. Consequently, local building regulations must be adapted to the new provisions. A compulsory requirement Is also envisaged for local authorities to ensure that, at the time of their renewal, their fleet of cars, buses and public service vehicles is made up of at least 25% electric vehicles or vehicles fuelled with LNG or CNG. The regulation also provides for the establishment of LNG refuelling stations in ports for inland waterway and maritime navigation. A pathway towards the possible use of hydrogen in the transport sector has also been established. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 27   In 2019, the new President of the European Commission posed ambitious short-term challenges for the. She noted that a distinguishing feature of her mandate would be a European Green New Deal, i.e. a rethinking of the current economic paradigms and behavioural models to achieve a sustainable Europe for future generations that aims to become the world leader in the circular economy and clean technologies.  The Italian Government shares this approach and has launched its own Green New Deal: a green covenant with businesses and citizens that views the environment as the economic driver of the country, steering the national production system towards sustainability.   Following on from the aims of the Green New Deal, the note updating the Economy and Finance Document for 2019 (naDEF2019) envisages incentives and support measures that will pursue the goal of protecting the environment and fostering growth and the circular economy. First, two new investment funds, assigned to the State and to regional and local authorities, will be introduced in the Budget Law for 2020. The resources will be allocated to new urban regeneration and energy conversion projects and to incentives for the use of renewables. For 2019-21 incentives for building improvements are envisaged, to be implemented through the application of reduced rates of registration, mortgage and land registry taxes on transfers of buildings, for construction or renovation companies engaging in energy upgrade projects and subsequently transferring them to other owners. To boost investment by local authorities, with effect from 2020 a fund assigned to municipalities for initiatives involving energy efficiency, sustainable local development and the security of infrastructure and public buildings will be in place.  Another aim of note naDEF2019 is to accelerate investment in the rail network, as included in the update of the Italian Railway Network Programme Contract for 2017-2021. Here, the aim is to develop an integrated intermodal programme that would establish the railway system as a link between ports and airports. Rail transport would be given a more central role by increasing the efficiency of the existing stock and by doubling and electrifying the local public transport (LPT) offering. Work will also be taken forward on the electrification of  ports. urban environments and intends to support strategic local and urban mobility through appropriate investment on mass rapid transport and the renewal of the bus fleet. Economic resources will be earmarked to contribute to the replacement of public transport vehicles with the aim of incentivising transport security and safety and reducing CO2 emissions.  The Budget Law for 2020 followed up on the provisions of note naDEF2019; the measures adopted are described in the relevant parts of the Plan. However, it is worth noting in this section the creation of green government securities. Issuances of Green Bonds will be proportionate to interventions funded from the State budget to combat climate change, promote energy conversion and the circular economy, protect the environment and foster social and territorial cohesion.   Law No 141 of 12 December 2019, converting Decree-Law No 11 of 14 October 2019, introduces measures to improve air quality, in coordination with the INECP, and paves the way for policies to incentivise environmentally sustainable behaviours (measures to incentivise sustainable mobility in metropolitan areas, provisions to promote sustainable school transport, etc.).  The draft European Delegation Law 2019, which gives the Italian Government delegated powers to adopt legislative decrees to implement European Directives on a range of issues, including renewables and the internal market, is currently being submitted to Parliament. The INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 28   bill sets out a number of specific guiding principles and criteria to be taken forward. As regards renewables, the selection of the criteria on the basis of which each Region and Autonomous Province identifies which areas are and are not suitable for the installation of plant powered by renewable sources is worthy of note. Another point worth noting is the identification of processes to ensure that the deadlines for completion of the relevant procedures, including environmental ones, are met. A reorganisation and strengthening of the legislative provisions governing systems to foster self-consumption and at the same time monitor any effects it might have in terms of the setting and collection of system charges, is also envisaged. A further aim is to promote the spread and use of energy storage systems, including electric vehicles and long-term storage, and the integration of the electricity system with gas and hydro systems. It is also deemed important to update and strengthen support mechanisms for electricity and thermal renewable sources, and renewables for transport, including by fostering the replacement of obsolete plant, with a view to safeguarding, enhancing and increasing generation from the existing stock of plant using renewables, including hydroelectric plant.  As regards the markets, the draft European Delegation Law for 2019 aims to promote the active role of consumers, in both direct and aggregate form, in electricity and services markets, not least with the aim of improving the flexibility of the electricity system by managing demand. Another goal is to establish a regulatory framework for the development that would be active in the generation, supply, distribution, storage, sharing and sale of electricity and the supply of energy services, including energy efficiency and electric vehicle recharging services.   Yet another aim is to establish a framework of rules for the development and propagation of storage systems and for their participation in the electricity and services markets. This would follow criteria of technological neutrality and take into account the objectives of integrating generation from renewables and the conditions for operating the networks safely and securely. On the energy poverty front, the aim is to strengthen the measures for the protection of vulnerable customers, including through automatic procedures to deliver the benefits in question, and to establish specific monitoring indicators.  In addition to this Plan, Italy is required to submit its Long-Term Strategy to the European Commission, in implementation of Article 15 of the EU Governance Regulation. To quantify the effort required, the Strategy identifies possible pathways to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, in line with EU and Italian policy approaches. It also sketches out, as a first step, a reference scenario characterised by three essential elements: i) meet the goals envisaged by the INECP, carrying forward the resulting virtuous energy-environmental trends until 2050;  ii) employ which should be integrated in the next round of European simulations; iii) integrate the effects of climate change, in terms of potential changes in day degrees, crop yields and the frequency of fires. The use of up-to-date GDP and population projections (point ii) above) entails a difference with respect to the parameters for these values used in the INECP context. For this, the EU reference scenario values for 2016 were used, including at the invitation of the Commission. The analyses conducted point to limited differences up to 2030, which do not have a significant impact in terms of meeting the INECP targets and developing infrastructure. As a result of the European simulations, the first update of the INECP, to be submitted to the Commission by 30 June 2023 under Article 14 of the Governance Regulation, will be an opportunity to bring the two instruments more fully into line.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 29     ii. Current energy and climate policies and measures relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union In the past, Italy has devoted a great deal of attention to the five dimensions of the Energy Union and continues to do so today, having implemented numerous measures for sustainable energy development and the fight against climate change.

Key issues of cross-border relevance In 2017, 88.2% of electricity demand was met by domestic production (the same figure as in 2016), totalling 282.8 billion kWh (+2.0% compared with 2016) net of consumption for ancillary services and pumping. The remaining share of demand (11.8%) was covered by net foreign imports, totalling 37.8 billion kWh  an increase of 2.0% compared with the previous year. The national transmission network has 25 lines for foreign interconnections: four with France, 12 with Switzerland, two with Austria, two with Slovenia, two DC connections (a cable Corsica, Italy and Sardinia), a further AC cable between Sardinia and Corsica, and a 220 kV submarine and overland cable connection between Italy and Malta. Figure 1 Existing interconnections [Source: Terna  2018 development plan] Francia France Svizzera Switzerland Austria Austria Slovenia Slovenia Grecia Greece Malta Malta  following interconnections are currently under construction or in the preliminary planning stage: the HVDC Piossasco--France), the 132 kV Prati di Vizze/Brennero connection (Italy-Austria), the continental SACOI3 Sardinia-Corsica-Italy connection (Italy-France), and the Italy-Tunisia connection (ELMED project), and the HVDC Villanova  Tivat connection (Italia  Montenegro, currently ongoing).

The projects of interest relate, in particular, to the borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia and Montenegro. Figure 3  Interconnectors in development [Source: Terna  2018 development plan]  Francia France INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 41   Svizzera Switzerland Austria Austria Slovenia Slovenia Montenegro Montenegro  A key issue in the electricity sector appears to be the use of these net import-export of electricity in 2016-17 stood at around 37 TWh, which represents a decrease compared with the figures recorded over the previous five years, which consistently exceeded 40 TWh. The figure rose again, to about 44 TWh, in 2018. Without prejudice to the timeliness of -export balance might also be influenced by developments in the energy systems of those countries with which Italy has interconnections, in terms of decarbonisation objectives and changes in the energy mix. These aspects will need to be examined more closely, including on the basis of the final Energy and Climate plans of the other European countries.   billion Sm3, an increase of approximately 4.2 billion Sm3 (+6.0%) compared with 2016. Imports of natural gas in 2017 totalled 69.4 billion Sm3, representing approximately 92% of the total supply and with an increase in import demand of approximately 7% compared with the previous year, which equals 4.3 billion Sm3 in absolute terms. The increase in imports has helped to offset the reduction in domestic production, the total volume of which amounted to 5.2 billion Sm3 in 2017, a decrease of 5.9%.

Administrative structure of implementing national energy and climate policies The reform of Title V of the Constitution, and, in particular, Article 117, assigns the issue of the State and Regions. The text of Article 117 of the Constitution assigned the following exclusive powers on issues relating to the energy sector to the State: - relations with the European Union; - protection of competition; - protection of essential levels of service relating to civil and social rights; - protection of public safety and security; - protection of the environment and ecosystems; Among the principles established by national law, the functions assigned to the Regions include the following: - the drafting of regional energy policy objectives; - the siting and construction of district heating plants; - the development and enhancement of indigenous resources and renewable sources; - the issuing of hydroelectric concessions; - energy certification of buildings; - the providing of conditions of security and environmental and regional compatibility; - the security, reliability and continuity of regional supplies. In addition, as a result of the three constraints on law-making common to both the State and the Regions, namely compliance with the Constitution, compliance with European Union law and compliance with international obligations, the Regions are called upon, jointly with the State, to achieve the binding targets on energy and climate identified by the European Union for 2020. In the light of the objectives for 2030, and then for 2050, it is also necessary to encourage a more active role by those local and regional bodies that are closest to citizens. Specifically, this will be done by building on and strengthening the actions those bodies are taking forward in their own Action Plans for Sustainable Energy (APSEs) and Action Plans for Sustainable Energy and the Climate (APSECs), the operational instruments of the .   In the context of the concurrent competences between State and Regions, and with due regard for the roles of the regulator, the network operators and market operators, and with a view to ensuring that the Plan is implemented correctly, a permanent technical office will be set up (INECP Observatory, which will absorb the existing Renewables Observatory). The role of the office will be to discuss, share and agree and cooperate on topics regarding the implementation of the Plan, with particular reference to the following:  - establishing implementation provisions and decrees for the transposition of the relevant European directives; - reform to simplify authorisation procedures (dynamic repowering/revamping/permitting); INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 44   - monitoring the state of progress of the Plan objectives; - developing plants, electricity grid and storage systems; - coordinating, in a framework of overarching national rules, the promotion of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles; - checking and drafting improvement proposals, including in coordination with INECP environmental monitoring, regarding the arrangements and implementation times for the roadmap through which the effects of climate change will be integrated, in the two RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, in the first update of the INECP for 2023. This observatory will be set up jointly by the INECP proposing ministries, by a representative of the Regions proposed by the Energy and Environment Coordination unit of the State-Regions Conference and by the National Association of Italian Municipalities (ANCI), by GSE (Gestore Servizi Energetici, the energy services operator) and by the Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA). Its aim is to provide a forum for advanced technical discussion of the actual implementation of the Plan and the monitoring of its execution, prior to the official procedures established in the State-Regions or Unified Conference, and agreeing on and sharing any necessary adjustments to the INECP as it is implemented.  Each year the Observatory will draw up an implementation report that will be sent to the State-Regions Conference8 (environment) and10 (productive activities) and to the ANCI.  The functions of the State primarily involve the Ministry of Economic Development, which has competence over energy (understood to mean both security and affordability of supply), the Ministry of the Environment as regards environmental aspects and climate change, and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport for functions relating to the transport sector, but also other relevant issues, such as, solely by way of example, large dams. There are also various other ministries that contribute towards attaining energy and climate objectives and towards implementing the measures relating to the five dimensions of energy.  The statistical surveying and monitoring function relating to the various subjects of the present plan plays an important role within this framework; this is because an accurate quantitative measurement of the structure and dynamics of the different components of the national energy system is an essential requirement, both in order to identify the specific measures to be carried out and to evaluate the relative results/impacts.  In the Eurostat/ EU context, moreover, the need to enhance energy statistics and extend their scope of reference to encourage and support policy decisions is now being recognised; solely by way of example, various task forces have been established with the mandate to identify new fields of investigation or to broaden existing ones, by developing a more detailed sectoral breakdown of energy consumption. In parallel to this, the regulations forming the basis of the statistical activities  beginning with EU regulations on energy statistics and directives dedicated to promoting renewable energies  are also continuously updated to include new scopes of application, new definitions and new accounting criteria.  To allow Italy to keep pace with this evolving scenario, provision has been made for specific resources to be allocated to the performance of periodical statistical surveys, on the basis of which a model of the structure and characteristics of energy consumption across different sectors (residential, tertiary, industrial, transport) can be developed using Eurostat harmonised procedures, definitions and methodologies.   INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 45   The energy transition outlined in the INECP will be closely monitored, as will the state of implementation of the measures associated with the different dimensions of the Plan and the degree to which the objectives have been achieved. It will be vitally important to ensure that any trends providing evidence of the ongoing process can be used to provide public decision-makers with timely feedback on the efficacy of the measures and any need to update and fine-tune them, and on other factors that could determine the trajectory to follow to reach the targets. It will be equally important  as emerged from the public consultation  to provide all stakeholders with clear, timely and up-to-date information.  It will be particularly important to monitor the emissions targets resulting from national, European and international provisions and agreements. This will in part be done through the National system for the creation of the national greenhouse gas inventory and the National system for policies, measures and projections established, managed and updated by ISPRA in accordance with domestic legislation. It will also be done through pertinent communications, under Articles 7, 13, 14 and 15 of Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 (the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation, or MMR) and subsequently under Articles 18, 19(1) and 26 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action.  The monitoring activity will be based on different sets of indicators that can measure the effectiveness of the policies and the degree to which the various targets have been reached, as well as economic aspects such as investment and employment impacts in the different sectors, in line with the work done by GSE on renewables and energy efficiency. To this end, for the purposes of the INECP Observatory and to provide timely, up-to-date information to citizens and central and local government bodies, GSE will set up a Plan-monitoring platform to which data and information from different sources will be channelled. This platform will also provide input data for the environmental monitoring plan, for the tasks for which the Ministry of the Environment and ISPRA are responsible in the communications sphere under the above-mentioned MMR and Governance Regulations, for the drafting of the annual report on the implementation of the Plan envisaged in the context of the INECP Observatory, and for the drafting of the two-yearly reports to be sent to the European Commission.  The implementation of national policies linked to the attainment of national objectives will also involve a number of other parties, operating in a manner compliant with European regulations. These parties include, first and foremost, the Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) and the Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and the Environment (ARERA): in compliance with their independence from the executive, these authorities perform essential functions for protecting the interests of consumers and promoting competition, ensuring efficiency and the availability of services with adequate levels of quality, including in the energy sector, albeit with different roles, and, as regards the ARERA, for regulating a large number of the instruments linked to national energy policies.  Terna S.p.A. include managing the high and very high voltage network, maintaining network infrastructure, planning for network development and construction, and dispatching, namely managing flows of electricity on the network, thereby ensuring that electricity demand and supply are in constant balance. These regulated services are performed as part of a monopoly on the basis of a government concession, under the supervision of ARERA.  Snam Rete Gas, as the leading company for natural gas transport, is responsible for the dispatching thereof throughout Italy and presents itself as an operator of the natural gas transport system in line with the system of ownership unbundling, in compliance with Legislative Decree No 93 of 1 June 2011, transposing Directive 2009/72/EC and Directive INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 46   2009/73/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and natural gas. The rules governing the access and use of the transport service on the network of gas pipelines owned by Snam Rete Gas, as well as the levels of quality of that service, are all laid down in a network code that is approved by ARERA, with the latter also determining the tariff system for the transport of natural gas, by establishing the criteria used to determine the tariffs for each regulatory period.  Of particular significance for the future, including in the light of the long-term strategy, is the strengthening of cooperation between Terna and Snam Rete Gas. The aim here is to coordinate the development of their 10-year plans on the basis of agreed scenarios that are consistent with the INECP and the long-term strategy. Another aim is to explore the possibility of integrating the electricity and gas systems for the purposes of the energy transition and the requirements related to the penetration of non-programmable renewables.  The electricity distribution network in Italy is currently split between 126 distribution system operators (DSOs), which operate on the basis of concessions granted by the Ministry of Economic Development (62) and the Provinces of Trento and Bolzano (64). These operators differ greatly as a result of the size of the territory served and the reference benchmark and legal framework (municipalities, municipal utilities, types of companies). The ministerial acts of concession are published on the website of the Ministry of Economic Development; in addition, Terna publishes an up-to-date list of the distribution system operators and their associated identification codes, as well as an archive of the corporate changes made to these operators, on its website. The structure of the concession system for gas distribution is more complex, and is, moreover, undergoing a process of reorganisation.  The functions performed by Gestore dei Servizi Energetici S.p.A. (GSE), a company owned entirely by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance which operates in conformity with the strategic and operational guidelines defined by the Ministry of Economic Development and is responsible for managing and monitoring the support mechanisms for renewable energies  in the electricity, thermal and transport sector  and energy efficiency, are of particular relevance.  The GSE group is made up of the companies Ricerca sul Sistema Energetico S.p.A. (RSE), Gestore dei Mercati Energetici S.p.A. (GME, the Italian energy market operator) and Acquirente Unico S.p.A. (AU).  RSE is a company specialising in analysis, study and applied research covering the entire energy sector, with a particular focus on national strategic projects of general public interest, financed by the system research fund and international funding. The content of RSE projects mainly concerns the development of methods and technologies for producing sustainable energy, the distribution and storage of electricity, and scenarios for the energy system in line with the objectives and guidelines of national energy policy and the energy programmes of the EU.  GME is responsible for the economic organisation and management of the electricity market, environmental markets, natural gas and fuels in accordance with neutrality, transparency and objectivity criteria, and also manages the platform for registering fixed-term energy trade agreements concluded outside of the market.  AU performs the function of guaranteeing the supply of electricity to customers in the protected market (for as long as this market segment remains established), and manages a consumer help desk for providing support to end electricity and gas customers and a INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 47   mediation service for resolving disputes between customers and operators on behalf of ARERA. By way of the integrated information system (IIS), AU is also at the centre of information flows relating to the liberalised electricity and gas markets, with access to a database of off-also been assigned the functions and activities of the Italian Central Storage Entity (OCSIT) for the management of security oil stocks.  The National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA), a public-law body for research, technological innovation and the performance of advanced services in the sectors of energy, environment and sustainable economic development, is also supervised by the Ministry of Economic Development.   ISPRA, a public body which carries out research and testing, control, monitoring and evaluation, strategic consultancy, technical and scientific support, information, reporting, education and training activities in relation to environmental matters, with a focus on water protection, protection of the atmospheric environment, soil, subsoil, marine and terrestrial biodiversity and their respective crops, is, however, supervised by the Ministry of the Environment.  This is a necessarily complex system, therefore, which, in view of the 2030 objectives, suggests enhanced coordination for combined action in order to attain the objectives. In light of the shared competences established by the Constitution, this coordination primarily involves the State and the Regions. A coordination procedure aimed at sharing and attaining the national objectives established at EU level has been trialled with reference to the 2020 objectives on renewable sources. The Decree of the Ministry of Economic Development of 15 March 2012 (what is referred to -sharing availability of State support measures, the various Autonomous Regions and Provinces are required to provide in order to attain the national objective, with each of those Regions and Provinces being given specific regional objectives for the use of RES by 2020. Each Region has also been provided with an indicative trajectory, which identifies intermediate objectives for the years 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018. This approach, based on a distribution of effort between the various Regions, will also be proposed beyond 2020, in order to ensure sharing of objectives and to call on regional governments to contribute in a coherent manner to their attainment. More generally, the aim is to create, with the additional support of the bodies listed above, a technical policy framework to give impetus to the implementation of the Energy and Climate Plan, which provides for the active involvement of the Ministries of Economic Development, the Environment and Infrastructure and the Autonomous Regions and Provinces; those other Ministries which perform, in various capacities, functions of direct benefit to the implementation of the measures will also naturally be involved in this undertaking, including the Ministries of the Economy, Cultural Heritage, Agricultural Policies, Education and Labour. The framework may also represent an interface for efficient dialogue with associations representing the interests of businesses and workers in the sectors concerned, so as to promote the measures through an approach that distributes the costs and benefits of the energy transition in a balanced manner. The INECP observatory, as described elsewhere, also provides input to that structure.    INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 48   1.3 Consultations and involvement of national and Union entities and their outcome  i. Participation of the national Parliament The consultation was not conducted using a pre-established format. It was based, instead, on the customary instruments for dialogue which were activated given that the draft Plan had been made available to the Speakers of the Chamber and Senate, the Department of Regional Affairs, the local authorities and the ARERA.  At the parliamentary level, as part of the examination Committee 10 of the Chamber (Productive Activities) conducted tens of hearings of stakeholders in the following categories:  - institutional (representatives of the main ministries involved and of the independent authorities operating in the sector, and representatives of the European Commission and Parliament); - main public and private sector operators in the sector; - main non-profit associations; -  - industry associations; - associations of local public services agencies and companies operating in the electricity and gas sectors; - experts from academia and research institutes. After these hearings, tens of reports (produced by environmental and trade associations, businesses, research institutions and institutions) were filed.  In November 2019 the Minister for Economic Development (who submitted the draft INECP along with the Ministers for the Environment and for Infrastructure) reported to Chamber Committee 10 on the pathway followed and the underlying technical organisational structure. He then illustrated the key points of the public consultation, the discussion with the Regions and, not least, the recommendations of the European Commission. He set out the approaches adopted with regard to accepting certain proposals and with bringing the Plan into line with said recommendations. In December 2019, as part of the debate on the conversion into law of the Climate Decree-Law, the Chamber of Deputies approved, with the favourable opinion of the Government, a number of motions tabled by members of different political groups, from both the majority and the opposition. For the matters most directly related to the Plan, these motions, albeit with different emphases and sensitivities, commit the Government to take action on a number of fronts to foster the energy transition. Common elements are the drive to energy transition, the circular economy and related requirements for the development of the production system, with due regard for economic and social sustainability, in some cases with agreement on carbon neutrality by 2050 and an invitation to strengthen the measures for the implementation of the INECP.  Although it is not a parliamentary body, it seems appropriate here to also mention the position paper produced by the Ministry of Agricultural, Food, Forestry and Tourism Policies. This document underscores the importance of the bio-energy sector, taking into INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 49   account their widespread availability (residual, agricultural and forestry biomass; cover crops; and second-harvest crops), the timeliness of exploiting them for energy uses, and the capacity to mitigate the effects of climate change through the CO2 removals provided for by biomass supply chains. As regards electricity production, it is deemed that the current levels can be maintained until 2030. Turning to the production of thermal energy, the Ministry feels that a further growth in the input of bio-energy up to 2030, with respect to current levels, should be supported by encouraging increased forest growth. Lastly, as regards the transport sector, the Ministry deems that the conditions are right to make a determined effort to develop advanced bio-fuels and in particular agricultural and zootechnical biomethane.  ii. Involvement of local and regional authorities achieving energy and climate targets. The role of the local authorities is equally significant. The draft INECP was therefore discussed at length with the Regions and local authorities. This discussion took place in the context of the Unified State-Regions-Cities Conference, with the local authorities, and with the involvement of the Ministries of Economic Development, the Environment, and Infrastructure, all of the Regions (through energy and environmental experts) and the association of Italian municipalities. During the discussion, comments on and additions to the Plan, drawn up not least in the light of recommendations from the European Commission, were submitted and examined, for insertion in the final version. In formal terms, the Unified Conference expressed its positive opinion on the INECP in Document No 137/CU of 18 December 2019. Lastly, the Ministry of Economic Development opened a technical working group on the phase-out of coal from electricity generation. This was then divided up by electricity market area and a specific group for Sardinia was set up, with the involvement of all the Regions concerned and of operators and the social partners. Work on this issue, which is still ongoing, is intended to identify the conditions, accelerated pathways and arrangements for the phase-out, while keeping the system operating safely and securely and exploring solutions to address subsequent employment needs.  iii. Consultations of stakeholders, including the social partners, and engagement of civil society and the general public Thematic expert groups This consultation was intended to gather opinions, criticisms and proposals on the measures identified with reference to highly technical topics in the draft Plan, such as security, the market, research and competitiveness. Those invited to take part were experts, in some cases acting as third parties, such as independent authorities; and operators with public concessions, such as TSOs and distributors. Other participants were universities and research bodies operating in the sectors encompassed by the draft Plan, direct interests, such as particularly representative sector-based associations.  Participants in the thematic expert group, which received contributions from 30 respondents for a total of nearly 500 replies to the 49 questions drawn up on an ad hoc basis, could also take part in the public consultation. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 50   Of the 485 replies provided, 45% concerned just two themes: electricity renewables and transport. The main observations that emerged included the need to promote storage to enable the participation of energy stocks and generated distribution in the balancing and dispatching market, the development of electric mobility and the advanced biomethane supply chain, and the use of market-based support instruments with a low impact on energy bills.  Online public consultation associations, industry associations, non-profit organisations, professionals working in the sector, financial institutions and investment funds, etc.) including, when deemed make observations, criticisms and proposals regarding the Plan. The aim of the online consultation, which ran from 20 March to 5 May 2019, was to gather comments and proposals, especially on the measures identified in the draft Plan. Respondents could reply to just some of the questions if they wished, depending on the issues of greatest interest to them. This was the consultation channel most widely used in this consultation on the draft Plan, thanks to the online accessibility provided by the portal set up by the Ministry of Economic Development for the INECP (energiaclima2030.mise.gov.it). It offered many points for analysis: a total of 207 respondents replied (of which 92 citizens and 115 associations, businesses and organisations), making nearly 3,500 responses to the 46 questions in the online public consultation format.  Of the 3,491 responses, 46% concerned three themes: large RES electricity plants, security and infrastructure, and thermal RES and energy efficiency.  The topics receiving most attention in the sections regarding electricity RES include the points made in favour of self-consumption, including on a collective basis, by enabling multi-user configurations in energy communities. Other topics stressed by respondents were the promotion of demand and supply aggregators in the context of power purchase agreements (PPAs) and the development of an environment that would enable the full development of storage technologies, especially through pumping and batteries but without neglecting the new power-to-gas frontiers. On the transport front, respondents called for measures to spur more electrification, in which a leading role is expected for smart recharging and vehicle-to-grid systems. They also wanted to see a streamlining of authorisation procedures and a single framework of reference, and a review of subsidies for fossil fuel sources with a view to gradually reducing them to improve the competitiveness of RES. As regards the integration of RES at the local level, one point that emerged very clearly was the intention to conduct an accurate mapping exercise, jointly with the local authorities, of the existing potential and those areas most suited to energy production. The aim here is to share and analyse the extent of the areas available for future plants. As for the management of governance with the stakeholders involved, a unanimous convergence emerged towards a fuller, more informed involvement of citizens, drawing, for example, on the French débat public experience, and an overall simplification and standardisation of the authorisation procedures connected with new installations or the revamping of existing ones.  On the topic of transport, respondents noted the need to protect the national biofuels supply chain, which mainly uses animal and vegetable oils and fats, and allow for an INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 51   increased use of biomethane in the transport sector. Other important aspects included the role of LNG in various economic sectors and the strengthening of the LPT offering in the light of the general growth in the many forms of sustainable collective mobility, with a preferential track for the expansion of electric vehicles.  Turning to the section on energy efficiency, respondents underscored the need to strengthen the mechanisms envisaged in the Plan to promote energy efficiency (tax deductions, White Certificates, Heating Account, National Energy Efficiency Fund). They focused on aspects linked to the energy and environmental performance of the measures. One suggestion was to develop specialised incentives that would be effective in given sectors, and thus avoid competition between and duplication of the various mechanisms. Respondents also placed importance on training and information measures and initiatives to encourage behavioural changes.   Consultation in the Strategic Environmental Assessment With Directive 2001/42/EC, European legislation establishes the principle whereby all plans and programmes which are likely to have significant effects on the environment must be subjected to a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) process.  the environment and to contribute to the integration of environmental considerations into the preparation and adoption of plans and programmes with a view to promoting   In order to officially launch the SEA of the INECP, the ministries which collaborated on the draft Plan, namely the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Natural Resources and the Sea and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, were identified as the proposing authorities. The procedure involved two stages of consultation. - A consultation on the Preliminary Environmental Report (scoping report), which lasted 30 days and gathered observations and suggestions from 53 respondents with expertise in environmental matters. - A public consultation on the scoping report, which was extended to government bodies and to the public. This consultation ran for 60 days and gathered observations from about 40 respondents. Of the observations received during the public consultation on the Environmental Report, the following were worthy of note: consistency with regional environmental planning/programming; the need to propose criteria for the implementation of interventions throughout the country, compliance with which can be monitored; and the possibility of establishing sets of minimum indicators by type of measure (with standardised definitions and data-collection arrangements). In line with these observations, the Environmental Monitoring Plan, which, with a summary declaration, accompanies the INECP, was drawn up. The environmental monitoring will follow the entire life cycle of the INECP and will make it possible to monitor progress towards achieving the environmental sustainability targets established during the SEA process. It will also make it possible to check for any significant INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 52   effects on the environment resulting from the implementation of the Plan, with a view to identifying any unexpected negative effects and adopting suitable corrective measures.  The effects to be monitored are, first, the overall positive effects on the environment: reduction in climate-changing emissions, improvement in air quality, reduction in the atmospheric pollution and to risk factors connected with climate change, improvement in the quality of life related to energy efficiency in buildings. Any negative effects on the environment that might result from the implementation of the measures in the different areas of the country, aggregated at Plan level, will also be monitored.  The environmental monitoring will be conducted through structured collaboration by the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Natural Resources and the Sea, the Ministry of Economic Development, and the Regions and Autonomous Provinces, drawing on the resources of the system of environmental agencies and the Higher Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (part of the National System for the Protection of the Environment, SNPA).  This monitoring could provide input to the Integrated national energy and climate progress reports envisaged by Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 Governance, especially for the purposes of paragraph 1(e). The Technical Committee for the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and SEA performed the initial technical examination falling within its remit. It analysed and assessed the Plan and the environmental report and examined the observations, objections and suggestions received, and the opinions of the other administrations concerned and of other actors with competence for environmental matters. The technical examination concluded with Opinion No 3192 of 15 November 2019. The next step, on the basis of the outcome of the public consultation on the Environmental Report and the opinions expressed by the Ministry of Cultural Assets and Activities and of the competent authority, was to draw up the environmental monitoring plan referred to above as well as any resulting additions to the INECP. Of the latter, the following are worthy of note: a table relating the measures to the Plan objectives and targets, the inclusion of measures to reduce the consumption of land for new photovoltaic capacity, an improvement in the provision of the ecosystem service, policies to strengthen LPT, and integration with the National Atmospheric Pollution Monitoring Programme.  iv. Consultations with other Member States In the course of 2019 the first consultations with neighbouring countries were opened. After the initial discussions, a joint meeting with the four countries of the eastern cross-border quadrant  Slovenia, Hungary, Croatia and Austria  took place in July 2019. Representatives of the European Commission also took part. In early September 2019 a meeting was held with representatives of Malta. A process of dialogue and collaboration was thus initiated that will continue into 2020 and beyond.  In addition, on 26 November 2019 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the Italian Minister for Economic Development and the Greek Deputy Minister for Energy and the Environment with the aim of fostering energy cooperation between the two countries. The agreement is intended to establish a common framework of reference for Italy and Greece to promote industrial partnerships focusing on sustainability and on the diversification and security of energy supplies. It also envisages a further strengthening of INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 53   collaboration by the gas and electricity transmission and distribution system operators of the two countries, through new strategic industrial partnerships.   v. Iterative process with the Commission Italy took an active part in all meetings of the Technical Working Group on NECPs that took place between 2018 and 2019, during which a discussion with the European Commission and the other Member States on the individual points making up the National Plans was established. In this setting the Commission deemed the Italian INECP to be at a good stage of development. During the meetings, Italy was often held up as an example of good practice and was invited to set out its approach on various spheres and dimensions. Along with its Communication of 18 June 2019 containing an assessment of the draft Plans submitted by Member States to implement the objectives of the Energy Union, which was published in the Official Journal on 3 September 2019, the Commission issued specific recommendations for individual Member States. In the case of Italy, the Commission recommended the adoption of detailed and quantified policies and measures that are in line with the obligations set out in Directive (EU) 2018/2001, to enable the goal of a 30% renewable energy share for 2030 to be achieved in a timely and cost-effective manner. It also recommended an Increased level of ambition for renewables in the heating and cooling sector to meet the indicative target included in Article 23 of the Directive. A further request was that Italy put forward more detailed measures to meet the target for the use of renewables in the transport sector. As regards energy efficiency, Italy was asked to ensure that the policy instruments illustrated in the draft INECP would still deliver adequate savings in the period 2021-2030. The Commission also recommended a special effort on strengthening energy efficiency measures for buildings (new and existing public and private buildings) and in transport, sectors in which there could be significant untapped potential. In terms of air quality and emissions, Italy was asked to clarify how it intends to comply with the no-debit rule in the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) context and to provide a quantitative analysis of the interactions with air quality and emissions policy. Turning to security, Italy was asked to provide further information on how it would reconcile the central role of gas with decarbonisation, on the state of progress of certain gas infrastructure and on measures to increase diversification and reduce energy dependency on other countries As for the market dimension, the Commission asked Italy to establish measures to achieve the objectives of flexibility, market coupling and a reduction in the price differential and to assess the impact on prices of the capacity market and support for RES.  Lastly, in the sphere of regional cooperation Italy was asked to consult neighbouring countries on Central and South-Eastern Europe Gas Connectivity (CESEC) and on coordinated policies for energy supply in the Adriatic and in the Mediterranean region. A further request was to list actions undertaken and plans to phase out energy subsidies for fossil fuels. Those topics on which recommendations were made were incorporated in the additions made to the text of this document in the course of 2019, also taking into account any new legislative provisions, both national and European, introduced over the last year and the outcome of the consultation on the draft Plan.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 54   1.4 Regional cooperation in preparing the plan  i. Elements subject to joint or coordinated planning with other Member States The meeting of 4 July 2019, as referred to in point iv. of the previous section, found that it would be opportune to intensify the dialogue in the following spheres:  CESEC group;  new projects and infrastructure in the Adriatic. As regards the topics that emerged for further bilateral discussion by the countries involved, the following lines of collaboration were identified:  exchange of good practice and cooperation on alternative fuels in the transport sector, on RES and on energy efficiency;    for the development of RES;  testing of smart grids;  new cross-border infrastructure projects;  efficient integration of electricity markets and governance;  shared and agreed risk management plans for the electricity and gas system;  energy poverty;  development of hydrogen.  An initial technical meeting with Malta took place on 11 September 2019 with the aim of exchanging best practices and identifying topics of potential common interest. The discussion identified the following areas of common interest:  prospects for the development of the Italian electricity market;  gas price projections;  exchange of best practice for the development of biomethane in Italy;  metering methodology for renewable cooling systems;  indicative target for RES in the heating and cooling sector;  potential development of innovative renewable energy projects using European funds;  potential interest in statistical transfers of renewable energy. As regards enhanced energy cooperation with Greece, see point iv. of the previous section.  ii. Explanation of the way in which the plan takes regional cooperation into consideration The topics mentioned above are some of the existing points of contact between different draft Plans. It will soon be necessary to examine with the other Member States the possibility of developing joint or synergistic projects on these themes. On the basis of these initial meetings, Italy has assessed with interest the following topics:  energy supply infrastructure and offshore installations in the Adriatic on which the joint interests of several countries could converge;  policies for the sustainable development of energy supplies in the small islands, with exchanges of good practice;  policies and measures to mitigate energy poverty (e.g. Slovenia); INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 55    the development of the use of hydrogen (e.g. Austria). For other projects (statistical transfers, common RES projects at sea, etc.) initiatives to be developed in the coming years at bilateral level will be identified as work progresses. Some trials of this nature are undergoing initial assessment in the context of achieving the targets to 2020, in which context engage in statistical transfers, that is, to hand over its own objective for the share of consumption met by RES by 2020.
