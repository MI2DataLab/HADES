299 3.4. Dimension internal energy market 3.4.1. Electricity infrastructure i. Policies and measures to achieve the targeted level of interconnectivity as set out in point d) of Article 4  Federal State Given these indicators, Elia, the transmission system operator, has taken the initiative of launching studies with the relevant transmission system operators in neighbouring countries in order to research the possibility of developing additional interconnectivity across all the borders. These initiatives have been included in the 10-year network development plan 2018 (TYNDP18), as well as in the new Federal Development Plan 2020-2030 (which will be submitted for public consultation in October 2018 and on which a decision by the minister with responsibility for energy will be taken in January 2019). The development plan indicates that the 380 kV grid will be developed in three ways: 1. Reinforcing and expanding the 380 kV domestic grid: in order to integrate domestic renewable energy generation, connect new generating units and carry additional international electricity flows. 2. Expanding the offshore grid: in order to further integrate renewable energy generation at sea. 3. Reinforcing and expanding interconnection capacity: in order to integrate renewable energy at European level and have access to the most competitive prices on the international market, which ensures price convergence. The figure below provides an overview of the key investments in the 380 kV grid for the period 2020-2030, grouped into five investment packages based on a modular approach. Package A comprises both the reinforcement of existing interconnections with France and the Netherlands, and the reinforcement of existing 380 kV domestic corridors. To date, the following projects have been recognised as projects of common interest (PCIs): - Brabo project: reinforcing the interconnection with the Netherlands; - second high-voltage direct current (HVDC) link with the United Kingdom; - second HVDC link with Germany.

In addition, Fluxys, the Belgian transmission system operator, holds significant stakes in key projects across Central Western Europe. This provides additional flexibility, which contributes to the attractiveness of the Belgian natural gas market and is beneficial for security of supply. All the same, a review of whether additional investments are needed in the natural gas network for the period 2020-2030 will be carried out. Fluxys is planning investment projects for the period 2018-2027 totalling EUR 549 million. The programme is based on three key pillars: 1. investments to preserve the integrity of the natural gas transmission infrastructure and to adapt and modernise the infrastructure (67%); 2. investments in LNG initiatives and cross-border projects (26%); 3. investments to cover the increase in capacity made available to end-users (7%). As a result, our position as a natural gas hub in Central Western Europe can be reinforced, additional demand and/or the relocation of demand can be satisfied and new developments in the market can be anticipated (e.g. alternative fuels, power-to-gas).  ii. Regional cooperation in this area Federal State Regional cooperation at authority level mainly occurs through the Pentalateral Energy Forum. This was established in 2005 by the energy ministers of the Benelux countries, Germany and France to foster cooperation in the area of cross-border electricity exchange. Its main objectives are market integration and continued security of supply. A new action plan was agreed by the ministers through the signature of the Second Political Declaration of the Pentalateral Energy Forum on 8 June 2015. One of the key aims of this action plan is to reinforce the internal market by strengthening regional cooperation and combining a flexible market with a high level of security of supply. To achieve this goal, the Pentalateral Energy Forum will continue to play a pioneering role in the interconnection of electricity markets and will improve the quality of its joint regional assessment of the adequacy of production (see point 3.3.2). Other key objectives are to make electricity markets more flexible and explore different approaches to cross-border participation in capacity compensation mechanisms (CCM). Lastly, the integration of the renewable energy market will also Pentalateral Energy Forum will therefore continue to support EU energy policy and proactively share its findings with other countries and the European Commission. The Member States of the North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC) have decided that a number of clusters should be studied in depth and then set up. In parallel with long-term projects such as Dogger Bank, Germany Bight and developments in the Irish Sea, the Belgium-Netherlands-United Kingdom cluster is particularly 301 important, since a large proportion of the existing offshore wind generation already takes place in this area, meaning that cooperation is possible in the short term. The Federal Government is playing a very active role in developing cooperation around this cluster, in conjunction with Elia, the CREG and the Belgian Offshore Platform (BOP). Together with the other countries involved, it is exploring opportunities for connection, cooperation and further development of this cluster.  iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds Not applicable  3.4.2. Energy transmission infrastructure i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.2, including, where applicable, specific measures to enable the delivery of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and other key infrastructure projects Federal State Belgium encourages the businesses concerned to submit plans for cross-border projects. These projects are s as they contribute to the development of Belgian infrastructure and increase interconnections with neighbouring countries. Coordination between the relevant authorities will be scaled up with a view to making the authorisations needed to develop new generating capacity easier to obtain and adapting the networks required for renewables -projects of national interest. Particular attention will be paid to maintaining the lowest possible administrative burden for project owners.  ii. Regional cooperation in this area Federal State All projects are reviewed by the TEN-E regional committees and, where possible, are submitted jointly (e.g. the FR/B project for the conversion of B-gas to H-gas). In addition, the regional partnerships mentioned in connection with electricity infrastructure also address issues surrounding energy transmission infrastructure.  iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds If necessary, PCIs can apply for European funding  for example from the CEF  at the same time as being supported and overseen by the Federal Government.  3.4.3. Market integration i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.3 Federal State Belgium will closely monitor the commercial capacity available from interconnections with neighbouring countries. Where appropriate, the correct and timely implementation of the action plans drawn up in accordance with the Regulation on the internal market for electricity will also be closely monitored to ensure that policy on security of supply is not compromised.  302 ii. Measures to increase the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production such as smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, real-time price signals, including the roll-out of intraday market coupling and cross-border balancing markets Federal State At both federal and regional level, the aim will be to better balance demand and consumption. For example, measures will be taken to attract the right investments in order to obtain a complementary energy mix. At the same time, technical regulations and regulatory regimes will be regularly reviewed to make producers more accountable, and barriers will be removed to improve demand response. The gradual integration of the intraday and balancing markets will be pursued at regional and European level so as to increase the liquidity, security of supply and flexibility of the system. Flexibility solutions must be jointly reviewed at federal and regional level. At federal level, particular attention will be paid to the potential of hydrogen technologies to convert surplus renewable energy into energy and economic processes (e.g. power-to-gas, power-to-industry, power-to-mobility), with an emphasis on developing a roadmap and launching pilot pilots. Lastly, to bolster (energy) infrastructure, the legal certainty and investment security of projects must be ensure through a simplified permit application procedure. In the light of this situation, legal frameworks have been revised according to the different regional contexts in order to provide for the gradual and targeted roll-out of smart meters. This should give network users more insight into their energy consumption so that they can identify ways of using less energy. Smart meters will also help households and businesses to shift their energy consumption from times of peak demand to periods of surplus production without inconvenience or loss of productivity. Prosumers can choose whether or not to be aggregated and whether or not to feed the electricity that they generate into the grid at peak times, using a (domestic) battery storage system, in order to contribute to network stability. Lastly, the gradual integration of the intraday and balancing markets will be pursued at regional and European level so as to increase the liquidity, security of supply and flexibility of the system. As mentioned in Chapter 1, Belgium already has extensive interconnections. Further consideration will be given in the future to whether additional investments represent added value from a social point of view and whether Belgian consumers can be sure of benefiting from them. In addition, transmission and distribution system operators will endeavour to make efficient use of the existing grid by introducing intelligent network features and solutions (e.g. dynamic line rating, high-performance conductors). In addition to the meters supplied to final users, which are designed to allow the grid to be used and managed as efficiently as possible, the energy infrastructure will also evolve to facilitate the energy transition. Within this framework, the existing discrete energy networks will interact and become increasingly interdependent. District heating or a gas network (hydrogen/biogas) could thus serve as a back-up for the electricity grid, for example. Due to the increasing interaction and dependencies between existing discrete energy networks, operational cooperation will also be enhanced, both between transmission and distribution system operators and among distribution system operators. Distribution-level storage could be used to support the distribution network as an alternative to traditional network dimensioning based on peak power. In order to install individual home or neighbourhood batteries and to achieve demand-side management across a distribution network, a clear regulatory framework is needed. In addition, the focus is on large-scale, long-term storage to bridge seasonal differences and provide a solution for long periods during which the supply of solar and wind energy is not sufficient. Particular attention will also be paid to the potential of hydrogen technologies to convert surplus renewable energy into energy and economic 303 processes (e.g. electricity-gas, electricity-industry, electricity-mobility), with an emphasis on developing a roadmap and launching pilot projects. To bolster (energy) infrastructure, the legal certainty and investment security of projects must be supported by a simplified permit application procedure and by optimising existing legislation on urban planning and the environment.  Flemish Region Achieving our climate objectives and using much more renewable energy will not be possible without examining the energy system and infrastructure in the wider sense. The integration of variable, renewable and decentralised energy sources will increase demand for digitisation, flexibility and more intelligent management of the system, and will also require more investment in the system. Flexibility can be ensured in a number of ways: by matching supply and demand, by increasing connections between countries, by making energy systems more intelligent, and by enabling the storage of renewable energy for longer periods. Long-term energy storage will be vital, particularly to cope with seasonal variations in supply and demand. Such measures are also required in order to transpose the revised European Directive on common rules for the internal market for electricity (Fourth Electricity Directive, which forms part of the Clean Energy for all Europeans package).  Digitisation of the energy system Over the next few decades, digital meters and other digital technologies will make our energy system more connected, intelligent, efficient, reliable and sustainable. Digitised energy systems provide much more data and will be able to determine who needs energy so that it can be supplied at the right time, in the right place and at the lowest possible cost. The energy service offer, with all its various options and convenience, will also increase, which will improve market integration. The greatest potential of digitisation lies in its capacity to remove the barriers between the traditional sectors (electricity, gas and heat), increase flexibility and ensure system integration. - Roll-out of digital meters So that all households and businesses can anticipate when prices will be high or low and take advantage of the benefits of digitisation, we aim to maximise the roll-out and use of digital meters by 2024. Suppliers will therefore be able to develop new contractual arrangements and market operators can become more flexible. Various technologies are ready for large-scale roll-out and will therefore be available for use once a digital meter has been installed. In addition, there is an urgent need for a powerful, cost-effective and future-oriented software platform so that the market can use the data from the digital meters. - Smart use of energy data We will focus on the smart use of digital meters, by using aggregated/anonymised data to adopt better policies, and in this context we will look at the digital data technology options. We will also make the data available in a non-discriminatory manner for the purpose of future market developments, research and innovation. At the same time, digitisation will also pose new risks in terms of security and privacy, which we duly tackle. - Informing households and businesses User participation in the energy system will be facilitated by digital tools, such as geographical systems, web portals, the Internet of Things (IoT), megadata, blockchains, digital twin technologies, etc. So that the benefits of a flexible digital energy system are also clear to its users, we will support the development and use of applications allowing smart use of digital meters. We will provide sufficient information on the (technical) properties and options, and also on how the roll-out itself is progressing. We will inform the 304 public and operators concerned about the storage of energy, and we will develop a website containing objective information.  Modernisation and reinforcement of the low-voltage systems The low-voltage systems still seem to have the capacity to cope with current demand for PV, heat pumps and electric vehicles. However, we will soon have to choose between rapidly reinforcing the existing systems or voluntarily and temporarily restricting access through increased flexibility. The emergence of electric vehicles is a key issue for the existing systems. While numbers are limited, there are few problems globally. However, at local level, the situation can already be quite different. We will need intelligent management to avoid consumption peaks or system investments. The existing 230V systems need particular attention. They account for around 23% of all the low-voltage systems in Flanders, particularly in urban areas, and complicate the trend for increasing electrification (PV installations, heat pumps and electric vehicles). Fluvius will have to identify the necessary investments as soon as possible and, where applicable, plan and implement those investments. The energy data will be useful for comparing the costs of electrical systems or alternative such as hydrogen.  Increase in storage capacity The storage of electricity in batteries (or indirectly via heat pumps in boilers, for example) has already been technically developed and can be used to absorb short-term fluctuations. Energy storage in the form of hydrogen or other synthetic fuels offers an alternative for long-term storage. - Encouraging energy storage through an incentive We are currently encouraging the Flemish market for energy storage and management systems by supporting investments in electricity storage through a purchase incentive. Such energy storage systems will help to ensure system stability during peaks in demand and generation. They form a temporary alternative to additional investments in the system. The existing incentive will be assessed in 2020. - Establishing a regulatory framework for energy storage A regulatory framework for energy storage will be developed in order to increase storage capacity. The new style of electricity market requires energy services such as storage to be market-based and competitive. For that reason, we will not allow system operators to own, develop, manage or operate energy storage installations. In addition, we will study the role of energy storage within districts, and any obstacles to this, and we will adopt support measures or initiatives if need be. This framework will be closely linked with the regulatory frameworks for flexibility, which are yet to be developed, and with the local energy communities that are currently being developed as a result of the transposition of the European Directive on electricity and renewable energy, within which energy storage (at district level) may role an important role.  - Demonstration projects for energy storage and power-to-x Electricity can be stored in the short term in batteries; however, for longer-term energy storage, hydrogen or other synthetic fuels offer an alternative. Developing such storage on a larger scale takes time and the infrastructure and investments needed are significant, meaning that lead times of three to seven years are not unusual. In order to have reliable storage technology available from 2023, we need to quickly gain experience in this respect. We are therefore going to launch new pilot and demonstration projects for energy storage and power-to-x. We will therefore develop synergies between the various systems (gas and electricity), energy sectors and other sectors (sectoral coupling or integration). The aim will be to learn everything needed in order to develop a power-to-x policy and integrate it within the Flemish context. Energy storage capacity in Flanders will also be increased. 305  Design of a flexible energy system In addition to storage, demand or production management, where customers adjust their net energy purchases or production based on price signals, can also increase the flexibility of the energy system. The greatest potential for demand or production management currently lies with large consumers and/or producers. Small customers (households), SMEs and local authorities in the energy sector can also participate in this market as digital meters are rolled out and as smart devices or controls are installed. Due to a number of regulatory, technical and economic obstacles, a large part of this potential flexibility has not yet been exploited. The digital meters that we are currently rolling out and the new European regulations on the electricity market offer the opportunity to develop a Flemish framework for flexibility and to facilitate the development of new energy services across the distribution system. - Developing a Flemish regulatory framework for flexibility in the low-voltage and medium-voltage distribution systems We will develop a general regulatory framework for flexibility, in accordance with the recently adopted European legislation (such as the EMD), as a source of clarity, transparency and certainty for market players. This framework should ensure that the market is clear for the relevant operators and functions correctly and efficiently. Low-voltage and medium-voltage users must have more opportunity to base their flexibility on the market, which should allow them to react to external (price) signals, for example by using dynamic contracts and pricing. In addition to a regulatory framework, we will also emphasise communication and awareness-raising. End customers must be correctly informed of the options and value of flexibility. Market roles will be clearly defined in this respect. - Developing a framework for support services and flexibility for the distribution system operator We will develop a regulatory framework for the use of support services and flexibility for the distribution system operator (DSO). In this way, we will integrate smart solutions into the distribution system and thus offer an alternative to investment in more robust systems. The DSO will therefore have additional options for managing the distribution system. This framework will be comparable to the one for the support services of the transmission system operator, Elia, where energy services are purchased from various market players. This system is open to a range of users (households, local authorities, businesses, etc.), sources (demand, production, storage, electric vehicles, etc.) and technologies. It is designed to involve all the relevant market players.  Involvement of the public, local authorities and businesses in the energy transition It is vital that the public, local authorities and businesses become more involved in the energy issue in order to increase public support for the energy transition and the continued development of renewable energy projects. The concept of local energy communities offers an interesting framework for developing and testing new forms of (public) participation that are focused more on the collective or individual level. We will therefore ensure that the public, local authorities and businesses can be more active and come together within local energy communities in order to participate in the energy market as full stakeholders by engaging in activities such as financing, production, flexibility services, energy documents, energy storage, energy efficiency objectives. - Developing a regulatory framework for active customers and local energy communities Numerous pilot projects involving local energy communities are currently being carried out both in Belgium and abroad. In Flanders too, initiatives have already been implemented by various stakeholders, based around local energy communities. These projects will provide valuable information for the future design of local energy communities. Based on the analysis of existing (pilot) projects and in close cooperation with all 306 stakeholders, we will develop a regulatory framework for active customers and local energy communities. Through a consultation platform, we will have in-depth discussions with the relevant stakeholders about how to fashion local energy communities: options, objectives, value added, governance, priorities, best practices, professionalisation, scope, conditions, rights and obligations, etc. In this way, we will support and facilitate the active role that the public, local authorities and businesses can play in the energy transition and enable them to take advantage of that transition. - Setting the thresholds and developing a framework to assist local energy communities By the end of 2020, under the Directive on electricity and renewable energy, we plan to adopt a policy framework facilitating the development of local energy communities and removing administrative burdens and legal obstacles. We will focus on information, awareness-raising and alleviating the concerns of participants and project initiators. Other support instruments may also be developed. At the same time, we will ensure continued solidarity between all system users by contributing fairly to the funding of climate and energy policy and the energy infrastructures supplying each consumer.  Walloon Region Measures in relation to the flexibility market  The potential savings to be made from DSOs using flexibility vary according to the system and the assumptions made in each study. In general terms, there are two types of saving to be made from DSOs using flexibility: reduction in system losses and reduction in the need for investment in infrastructure. It is considered that the market itself can encourage the development of solutions in terms of flexibility, storage and appropriate use of electric vehicles. All measures associated with flexibility need to comply with the relevant directives (RES and System). The measures in question must be accompanied by a framework facilitating the development of those solutions.  Following the transposition of Directives (EU) 2019/944 and 2018/2001, it will be assessed whether the compensation mechanism for electricity generating facilities <10 kW can be maintained.  The flexibility framework, as provided for by the Decree of 19 July 2018, will be implemented (technical regulations, communication in order to encourage, development of the role of DSOs, issue by the CWaPE of flexibility service supply licences based on the Walloon Government Decree of 28 March 2019, etc.).  A framework encouraging centralised and decentralised storage will be adopted: granting of permits; alteration of tariffs (inappropriate feed-in and feed-out tariffs); removal of economic and administrative obstacles.  The DSOs will plan the development of flexibility needs and will determine how they will call on that flexibility.  Recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles and the management of charging and discharging operations will be planned. One of the main challenges for the distribution systems is the increased number of electric vehicles, as their recharging could significantly increase peaks in demand. These solutions must be implemented according to their technical feasibility, taking account of the situation of households and on a voluntary basis. Measures in relation to system development and intelligent systems  Smart meters will be rolled out in accordance with the framework, rate and principles determined in the Decree of 19 July 2018. This roll-out will be accompanied by an appropriate communication campaign and customer support when the meter is installed (see measure on smart meters).  A regulatory framework will be developed for innovative pilot projects. 307 The Programme Decree of 17 July 2008 added to the Electricity Decree of 12 April 2001 the option for the CWaPE to authorise innovative pilot projects involving alternative systems to the public system, while using and fairly remunerating the distribution system. This particularly means that certain barriers (tariffs, taxes, obligations, etc.) are temporarily suspended, within a well-defined, time-limited and controlled framework, in order to test and document the relevance and performance of projects aimed at implementing the best possible technological solutions for the Walloon electricity market, with a view to their widespread use across Wallonia. The pilot projects that can be authorised are in line with European energy policy as they must in particular involve the following areas: energy efficiency, demand flexibility, optimisation of the development and management of decentralised production, and promotion of local self-consumption and short supply circuits. This new option responds to various demands made by the sector and will allow these various issues to be better managed, where applicable, in order to optimise their development.  The measures in relation to collective self-consumption and renewable energy communities explained above are also intended to make the system smarter. DSO-TSO coordination measure A lack of coordination between TSOs and DSOs can impact the security and efficiency of the system or prevent the use of flexibility resources. It is therefore vital to ensure good coordination between these operators. This can be established via a common market within which TSOs, DSOs and BRPs can obtain flexibility services, through a system ensuring prioritisation between local and global balancing, or by requiring TSOs to consult  Pricing  At the moment, dual-rate tariffs are intended to guide consumer behaviour by influencing the periods of consumption or non-consumption. More refined tariffs, with more time-slots, will further develop this approach. These tariffs must be constructed in such a way that they are understandable and predictable for households. To achieve the objective of developing flexibility, pricing must be adapted based on the following goals:  The pricing system, among other factors, must support the shift in consumption.  The DSO remuneration system must encourage them to invest in the most cost-effective solutions, including flexibility solutions.  The pricing methodology must help to develop renewable energy communities, while ensuring a balance between solidarity in covering the total system costs and the contribution to taxes, surcharges and other regulated costs, and the interest in participating in such an operation.  The pricing methodology must not reinforce market segmentation and must not negatively impact those households that have chosen not to use flexibility, dynamic tariffs, etc. or that are unable to use flexibility.  The pricing methodology must ensure a balance between solidarity in covering the total system costs and the contribution to taxes, surcharges and other regulated costs, and the development of special schemes. A working group has been set up to define the new guidelines for pricing methodology, which must comply with the State aid guidelines. 308 Measures in relation to the roll-out of power-to-x (137) The production of hydrogen will develop in line with the market and the increased penetration of variable energy sources (by 2030 the Belgian variable renewable capacity could be nearly three times higher than the base load). The following should be the initial measures:  creation of a roadmap for rolling out power-to-x;  conduct of pilot projects;  development of a framework favourable to power-to-x.  iii. Where applicable, measures to ensure the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets As a member of the Pentalateral Energy Forum (PLEF), Belgium and the other members can learn from the efforts and experiences of the other PLEF members with regard to demand-side response (DSR). The DSR volumes at certain times and on certain markets that can already be seen in a number of PLEF countries (for example, in France and Belgium) show that, if enough barriers and obstacles are removed and if participation in DSR is actively encouraged, flexibility with regard to DSR will be offered and will contribute to system stability. The aim is now to learn lessons from these experiences and to extend participation in market-based DSR to all timescales and all markets in all the PLEF countries, in accordance with the Clean Energy for all Europeans package and in the interests of all consumers.  Federal State  Guarantee the roll-out of power-to-x.  iv. Policies and measures to protect consumers, especially vulnerable and, where applicable, energy poor consumers, and to improve the competitiveness and contestability of the retail energy market   Walloon Region Several measures have been adopted or reinforced in order to improve business competitiveness.  The carbon leakage measure has been authorised by the European Union since 2012. It allows the financial compensation of businesses that have become less competitive than international businesses not subject to the EU ETS (mainly in the metallurgical, steel, chemical, pharmaceutical and paper sectors). This measure currently applies until 2020 and should be extended.  Various measures have been adopted to help businesses, including VSEs and SMEs (through Novallia and the SOGEPA in particular), to reduce their energy consumption: low-interest loans; support and expertise; investment aid, etc.                                                             137 Power-to-case of Power-to-Heat (2)), which, for example, can meet industrial needs or supply district heating systems. It can also be a synthetic gas (Power-to-Gas (3)): hydrogen for mobility purposes or methane (following methanation), which can itself be injected into the gas system to meet industrial, heating or mobility needs. 309 v. Description of measures to enable and develop demand response, including those addressing tariffs to support dynamic pricing (138) Flemish Region See point 3.4.3.2.  Walloon Region A Decree governing flexibility in the distribution system and the associated operators was adopted by the Walloon Parliament on 19 July 2018. Under this legislation, a Decree on the licence to supply flexibility services was adopted by the Walloon Government on 28 March 2019. It can only be fully implemented once the technical regulation on electricity distribution systems has been adapted. Furthermore, as a result of the roll-out of smart meters and in accordance with the new Electricity Market Directive, dynamic pricing will be studied.   3.4.4. Energy poverty i. Where applicable, policies and measures to achieve the objectives set out in point 2.4.4 Federal State Energy poverty is not an isolated phenomenon; it is an integral part of overall poverty. Energy poverty must be tackled at source. Developing tools to make homes more energy efficient will ease pressure on energy bills, while an action plan to tackle energy poverty will be drawn up by each entity. This plan will outline measures to reduce consumption, as the size of energy bills is directly linked to consumption. The main priority for the energy poverty action plan should be to reduce consumption and promote energy efficiency. Existing aspects of social energy policy should also be assessed. The Regions are responsible for housing and its quality and will therefore take the necessary energy efficiency measure within an energy poverty action plan.  Flemish Region Current policy reveal, among others, the trends in a number of indicators relating to the regulatory stages of the procedure to protect against the disconnection of electricity and natural gas supplies. The most important indicators of energy poverty, such as the number of operational budget meters and the average monthly amount of repayment plans, have remained stable in recent years. Other indicators, such as the number of formal notice letters sent by suppliers, the number of terminated contracts and, in particular, the number of ongoing and additional repayment plans arranged by commercial suppliers, have risen significantly, mainly due to a more proactive and assertive approach on the part of suppliers when there is the least sign of default or late payment.                                                            138 In accordance with Article 15(8) of Directive 2012/27/EU. 310   2015 2016 2017 2018 Number of households having received at least one formal notice letter 242,613 253,100 258,090 272,336 Number of ongoing repayment plans arranged by commercial suppliers 83,757 100,197 118,176 125,423 Number of repayment plans started by commercial suppliers 64,791 81,198 97,015 98,331 Average amount of monthly repayment     Average outstanding debt     Number of supply contracts terminated by the supplier (due to non-payment) 78,539 80,376 83,326 87,198 Number of operational electricity budget meters 40,619 40,768 41,501 41,042 Number of operational natural gas budget meters 27,760 27,830 28,094 27,396  Number of customers of the distribution system operator When the commercial energy supplier terminates the supply contract with a customer due to non-payment, it is the system operator who, in accordance with the law, continues to supply those customers in its capacity as the social supplier. In 2018, the number of customers of the distribution system operator remained stable. In total, 2.90% (2.89% in 2017) of households were customers of the distribution system operator for electricity (81,080) and 3.10% (3.12% in 2017) of households were customers for natural gas (58,916). These figures cannot be simply added together because households can be customers of the distribution operator for both forms of energy. The number of customers returning to the commercial market after paying off their debt in full increased in 2018 to 13,380 for electricity (+11.5% compared with 2017) and to 9,385 for natural gas (+6.9% compared with 2017). In 2016, however, these figures actually fell sharply. Budget meters Households that are also in debt to the distribution system operator receive a budget meter. The installation of a budget meter therefore indicates a structural payment problem. The number of operational electricity budget meters went from 41,501 in 2017 to 41,042 in 2018, which represents a fall of 1.1%. The number of operational natural gas budget meters fell by 1.4%, from 28,094 in 2017 to 27,396 in 2018 (139). The number of households with a prepayment electricity meter (where the electricity restriction function has been disabled and which only work with credit on the meter card) rose by 1%, from 9,177 to 9,265. This means that nearly 23% of budget meters have no electricity restriction function (+1% compared with 2017). Given that the natural gas budget meter is de facto a prepayment meter, there is the risk that customers will themselves cut off their supply if they cannot add credit. Consequently, a minimum supply of natural gas has been introduced. Customers can use this service, via the CPAS, from 1 November to 31 March so that they can continue to heat their homes throughout the winter. The figures show that this measure meets a real need. 5,408 households (around 19%) with an operational budget meter have benefited from this service (5.5% more than in the previous period), with 70% being supplied by the system operator. Disconnections Before shutting off an access point due to non-payment, the distribution system operator must refer the case to the local advisory committee for the municipality. This committee consists of CPAS members and representatives of the distribution system operator. The customer in question is also invited to the meeting. In                                                            139 This is an absolute increase. Demographic differences have not been taken into account. 311 2018, 1,642 electricity disconnections were recorded, i.e. an increase of 26.5% over 2017 (1,298 disconnections), and 1,504 natural gas disconnections were recorded (compared with 1,508 in 2017).  Additional policy Over the next few years, the Flemish Government wants to make additional efforts to reduce energy poverty. For that reason, we will optimise the energy poverty action programme, in consultation with all stakeholders in this respect. Priority will be given to structurally improving the energy performance of housing. Targeted financial support for energy saving measures, intensive advice and tighter rules will remain essential. In order to best reach the target group, we will work in cooperation with local partners. Digital meters will allow budget shortfalls to be detected and tackled in good time. A monthly consultation process has been set up with stakeholders in order to make the most of the opportunities offered by digital meters. This process should result in a consensus general policy framework that will be applied once analogue meters have been completely replaced. The aim is to maximise the benefits offered by digital meters. A number of support measures have been developed in order to provide as much help as possible to the vulnerable target group in the renovation of their housing. To help those concerned prepare for and carry out such renovations, they have access to vulnerable target group through the various support measures, such as incentives, loans, tax relief, etc., for and provides further information on investments in renewable energy. We will continue the existing financial instruments for the vulnerable target groups and link them to a fixed income ceiling (interest-free energy loan, energy scans and social insulation projects for private rental housing). We will also provide efficient services in connection with all financial instruments that can increase the renovation rate.  Support measures: 1. Targeted financial support - Social housing and insulation incentive: in addition to a EUR 200 flat-rate incentive received by the project owner for each item of work carried out, aimed at supporting the overall process, the owner receives (if a number of conditions are met): o EUR 20 per mÂ² of roof or floor insulation in the loft; o EUR 12 per mÂ² of insulation inserted in cavity walls; o EUR 85 per mÂ² for the installation of high-performance glazing. In April 2019, a communication campaign targeted at owners was launched (www.huur-en-isolatiepremie.be/).   - Interest-free energy loan for the priority target group: o Loan amount: EUR 15,000 over a term of 10 years. o The borrower can use the subsidy or incentive received for work covered by the loan either to repay the loan early or to have the loan adjusted to reduce the monthly payment.  - Rolling fund for the energy renovation of housing purchased out of necessity: The emergency purchase fund aims to reduce energy poverty by granting interest-free loans to -quality home partly out of necessity, without having the financial resources to improve the quality of the home, resulting in high 312 energy bills among other issues. The number of homes purchased out of necessity in Flanders is estimated at 4% (i.e. around 119,000 homes) of the Flemish housing stock. The interest-free loans will be used to fund measures designed to improve the energy performance of the housing and ensure that this meets the basic safety, energy, health and quality requirements for housing. It is planned that the loan, including part of any capital gain, will be repaid when the property is sold or gifted, or after 20 years at the latest. We will assess the effectiveness of the emergency purchase fund with a view to possibly extending the loan arrangement.  - Digital meters: digital meters allow the accumulation of energy debts to be detected more quickly and a more proactive approach to be adopted. Given the priority roll-out of digital meters by the end of 2021 for all customers with a budget meter, we will optimise the current social public service obligations that protect electricity and natural gas customers from accumulating energy debts and losing their energy supply  - Increased energy incentives for protected customers (beneficiaries of the maximum social price for energy): o 50% increase in energy incentives (20% for solar water heaters, heat pumps and heat pump water heaters) + even higher incentives for:  roof insulation (EUR 10.5 per mÂ² instead of EUR 4);  high-performance glazing (EUR 56 per mÂ² instead of EUR 10);  incentive for installing a condensing boiler: EUR 1,800 (only for protected customers). o In addition, the amount of the incentives granted as part of the total renovation bonus where three or more measures are carried out is to be increased by 50%.  2. General support - Neighbourhood incentive: support instrument for collective renovation. The neighbourhood incentive is a maximum of EUR 400 per house or housing unit and is paid to the project guide. - Free energy scan: an adviser identifies ways of saving energy in housing. Occupants benefit from energy saving advice that can be immediately implemented. If necessary, the energy adviser provides energy-saving materials free of charge (energy efficient light bulbs or showerheads, radiator reflectors, pipe insulation). The occupant receives a report containing energy advice and other ways of making savings. Following this basic scan, a follow-up scan can be requested, which builds on the basic analysis and suggests further adjustments, where possible. These may be minor energy saving measures, but advice can also be given on more significant energy saving measures, such as installing high-performance glazing, roof insulation or a more energy efficient heating system. Since 2019, this type of follow-up scan has also formed  - Energy advice projects to tackle energy poverty 2019-2021 are helping to achieve the objectives of the energy poverty action programme (https://www.energiesparen.be/energieconsulenten). They provide information on energy scans, energy incentives (at the higher rate) and interest-free energy loans. Energy advisers inform the target group about the 2050 long-term objective of the Renovation Pact and about the measures and initiatives taken in this respect to ensure that, by 2050, all housing  including that of vulnerable families  is as economical as a new-build in 2015. Energy advisers also take direct action to encourage and help the target group to invest in energy savings. Five projects are currently ongoing: Samenlevingsopbouw, Komosie, REGENT, SOM Meetjesland and vzw Effect. - Provide frontline renovation advice from the integrated energy and housing information point.  313 3. Standardisation - Compulsory roof insulation standard: by 2020 all the roofs of every individual home (single-family houses, studios and apartments, i.e. excluding rooms) must be insulated. - Compulsory glazing standard: by 2023 all housing must have double-glazing. - Increase in the maximum energy score: in order to systematically improve the EPC score of rental housing, the Housing Minister will gradually increase the maximum EPC score as part of the minimum housing quality requirements. In this respect, we will take into account the 2050 long-term objective and introduce reference criteria complying with the Flemish Energy and Climate Plan.  Walloon Region The Walloon Government considers that keeping energy affordable is extremely important. The energy transition is vital, but it cannot come at the expense of the general public or reinforce inequalities. It must be accessible to all and must not adversely affect those households that cannot or do not want to use complex instruments such as dynamic tariffs. It must also not make consumption less flexible. Liberalising the energy market has already proven to be too complex for many households and has not necessarily enabled them to benefit from better technical solutions and tariffs. According to the CREG, every year 360,000 households pay EUR 600 too much for their energy because they have not made the right choice of supplier or tariff. The government will study the possibility of introducing a basic gas and electricity supply for residential consumers so that they can access energy at an affordable price without having to complete complicated processes. The government will call for a European-wide assessment of energy liberalisation in order to identify whether corrective measures are needed to better meet the environmental, economic and social objectives. All the energy policies will be closely reviewed from the perspective of households, and the most vulnerable in particular. The government will also adopt a new strategic plan to tackle poverty and reduce inequalities, which will focus on access to energy. Energy is a vital commodity and a fundamental right, to which access must be guaranteed for all. Tariff measures for protected customers As part of the organisation of the gas and electricity markets resulting from the European directives, the Federal State and the Regions have introduced specific mechanisms designed to help vulnerable households, known as  to be improved. There are two categories of protected customer:  first, federal protected customers (140) who benefit from the social tariff offered by all residential customer suppliers;  second, regional protected customers (141) who benefit from the social tariff offered by their DSO, where they are supplied by the latter in its capacity as the social supplier. Protected customers benefit from the social tariff set every six months by the CREG based on the best commercial offer (from among the suppliers). The Walloon Region has extended the concept of protected customers, as defined by the Federal State, to take account of other problematic situations faced by vulnerable households. Regional protected customers include beneficiaries (either the person holding the supply contract or a person with the same address as the contract holder) of the following:  a financial educational guidance decision made by a CPAS;                                                            140 https://www.energieinfowallonie.be/upload/documents/tableau-de-synthese-clients-proteges.pdf  141 https://www.energieinfowallonie.be/fr/mesures-sociales/le-client-protege#quels-avantages-pour-le-client-protege  314  debt mediation by a CPAS or an approved debt mediation centre;  a collective debt settlement. In order to benefit from the social tariff, the regional protected customer must contact his or her supplier, who must transfer the customer to the relevant DSO. The DSO then acts as the social supplier of the protected customer. Wallonia has seen a rise in the number of vulnerable households, as shown by the following figures for the number of protected customers and social tariff use (142).

Furthermore, the technical information available to the DSO does not paint a reliable picture of the situation on the ground in terms of electricity or gas disconnections experienced by households. An analysis supplementing the studies that are already available will be carried out, and the budget meter framework will be reviewed in order to limit use of such meters to those cases where they are proven to be useful. Legal framework for rolling out smart meters The Decree governing the use, functions and roll-out of smart electricity meters was adopted by the Walloon Parliament on 19 July 2018. It will be implemented through a series of implementing decrees and technical regulations. It provides for the phased roll-out of smart meters in the Walloon Region: The legal framework requires smart meters to be systematically installed and activated (communication function) in the following cases by 1 January 2023 at the latest, unless this is technically impossible or not cost-effective: - 1. depending on the results of the study carried out, the possibility of smart meters being used for residential customers declared in default will be assessed; - 2. when a meter is replaced; - 3. when a new connection is made; - 4. when a distribution system user so requests. No later than 31 December 2029, the DSO must reach the target of 80% smart meters installed within its system for users meeting one of the following requirements: 1. standardised annual consumption of 6,000 kWh or more; 2. net developable electrical capacity (in terms of electricity generation) of 5 kWe or more; 3. recharging points accessible to the public.  Support measures to reduce consumption or bills In the Walloon Region, various mechanisms have been established to improve access to energy and help households at risk of energy poverty: awareness-raising, incentives, MEBAR programme. These measures will be improved in the future. 316 Awareness-raising Various awareness-raising and support tools aimed at vulnerable individuals have been created: preventive  PAPE), energy guardians and training for social workers. In terms of the PAPEs, the task of the CPASs is to inform the public about the rational use of energy and management of consumption (reduction of consumption and therefore bills), and also about the subsidies and incentives available in this respect. Actions under the PAPEs also involve personalised monitoring in three stages: energy balance of the household, identification of possible solutions, and support for the household in implementing those solutions. This personalised monitoring is provided by social workers trained in this area, energy guardians or specialised associations. The work of the CPASs in this context involves personalised monitoring of vulnerable households, whether or not they are beneficiaries of social welfare. Information and awareness-raising sessions aimed at this target public are also organised. In 2017-2018, 121 PAPEs received subsidies totalling EUR 2,752,456. In 2019-2020, 134 PAPEs received subsidies totalling EUR 2,700,000. Through these PAPEs, over 15,000 households benefit from individual support every year. In addition, nearly 6,000 households benefit from monitoring in their homes, which allows them to be supported in reducing their consumption and bills. Energy guardians focus on nine priority actions, namely:  making and explaining diagnoses, making recommendations, relaying information and motivating beneficiaries;  supporting vulnerable people in their efforts to carry out small or large energy saving projects, which   raising awareness of Rational Use of Energy (RUE);  informing social welfare beneficiaries, which involves providing information consistent with the actions of the social service;  explaining the results of the energy audit, where applicable;  negotiating with owners;  informing people about available schemes and administrative processes;  making personal situations (all the ins and outs) clear and understandable, and analysing the situation, together with all those involved, from a technical, administrative and behavioural perspective;  participating in the sustainable management of the institution, i.e. raising the awareness of everyone within the institution/promoting discussion and bringing about changes in attitude. Incentives The Walloon Region also grants a subsidy to low-income households so that they can carry out work on their homes allowing them to use energy more rationally (MEBAR incentive). This emergency assistance can cover replacing external doors or frames, carrying out insulation work, installing a stove, lining a chimney, installing a boiler or water heater, etc. The subsidy can also be granted to a household or applicant living in a caravan or lodge on a campsite or a weekend residential park.  In order to obtain the subsidy, the applicant must contact the local CPAS, which will start the procedure.  including VAT for households with an income less than or equal to the living wage plus 20%. 317 An amount of EUR 1.5 million is reserved each year for this incentive in the general expenditure budget of the Walloon Region. This annual amount included in the initial budget is generally increased when the budget is amended and can reach EUR 1.75 million. On average, around 1,200 households benefit each year from the MEBAR incentive. In addition to this incentive, the Walloon Region also grants energy incentives, which are higher for those on low incomes, to help people improve their homes so that they can reduce their energy consumption. For example, for a household with an income of EUR 23,000 or less, the incentive is multiplied by six. The incentives are granted for the following investments: thermal roof insulation, thermal wall insulation, thermal floor insulation, installation of efficient heating and/or hot water systems, conduct of an energy audit.  Brussels Capital Region The issues of poverty and social inequality will be tackled by the Brussels Government across the board, based on an analysis of the impact of planned reforms on poverty and health factors. This is the case with the renovation policyfinancial support on low- and average-income households and by tackling energy poverty. In the context of a liberalised energy market, consumers are in a vulnerable position with regard to energy suppliers and the competition in which they engage: protection of privacy, changes in tariffs, complexity of offers, multiplicity of intermediaries, etc. For that reason, the government intends first of all to further develop and reinforce consumer protection policy. The government will also provide access to an independent and effective service offering information and support on energy contracts, understanding of bills, legal issues, etc. for all Brussels residents. It also intends to ensure that the independent regulator Brugel operates effectively.
