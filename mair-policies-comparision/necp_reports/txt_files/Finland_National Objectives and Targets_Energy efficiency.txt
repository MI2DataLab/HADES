2.2 Dimension energy efficiencyi. The elements set out in point (b) of Article 4ii. The indicative milestones for 2030, 2040 and 2050, the domestically established measurable progress indicators and their contributions to the Union™s energy efficiency targets as included in the roadmaps set out in the long-term renovation strategies for the national stock of 55residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EUiii. Where applicable, other national objectives, including long-term targets or strategies and sectoral targets, and national objectives in areas such as energy efficiency in the transport sector and with regard to heating and coolingFinland™s indicative national energy efficiency target for 2020, in accordance with the Energy Efficiency Directive, is the absolute level of final consumption of energy at 310 TWh. The corresponding level of primary energy consumption has been estimated at 417 TWh. In 2017, Finland had achieved a level of 294 TWh for final energy consumption, corresponding to 371 TWh of primary energy consumption. The possibility to achieve the national energy target 2020 seems realistic but depends, however, significantly on the weather conditions. The heating demand can vary substantially - more than 5 % in final energy consumption - between years due to significant differences in heating degree days between cold and mild winters. The competitiveness of Finnish energy intensive industry on the global market also greatly influences final energy consumption. When industry is running flat out, its final energy consumption accounts for almost 50 % of the energy demand in Finland.The 2030 energy efficiency target in final energy consumption is 290 TWh. The corresponding primary energy consumption is about 405 TWh. Figure 5 shows the WAM projection of primary and final energy consumption over the period 2018Œ2030.56050100150200250300350400450200520102015202020252030TWhPrimary energy consumptionFinal energy consumptionFigure 5.    Historical figures and indicative development of primary and final energy consumption of 2018Œ2030 in the WAM projection. Data source for 2005Œ2017 figures: Eurostat.As a result of Finland™s long-time efforts to improve energy efficiency in all sectors, final energy consumption is estimated to decrease slightly during the 2020s, although the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to increase. Building stock volumes continue to increase and industrial production is expected to grow particularly in the pulp and paper sector. At the same time, industry is developing its processes towards carbon neutrality, which often means electrification of the energy use and potentially increased energy use. This transition is also driven by the Government Programme that sets the national target of carbon neutrality by 2035. It should be noted that industrial energy use is difficult to forecast and includes substantial uncertainties.Primary energy consumption is estimated to greatly increase comparatively from 2020 until 2030. The main reason is the start-up of two nuclear power plant units, whose output will largely replace imported electricity. The two units are estimated to increase primary energy consumption by 26 TWh and 19 TWh, respectively, compared to the level with an equivalent amount of imported electricity. The effect of increased nuclear power on primary energy consumption can be seen clearly in Figure 5. There can also be some increase in primary energy when coal-based 57cogeneration of heat and power in big cities is converted to biomass boilers, replaced by heat pumps and other means of heat production before 2030.Level of energy savings requirement Œ EED Article 7Finland™s national cumulative energy saving obligation in accordance with Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive for the period 2014Œ2020 is 49 TWhcum. The estimated cumulative energy saving effects of the measures implemented in the period 2014Œ2020, presented in the 2018 annual report of the Energy Efficiency Directive, are 92.7 TWhcum at the end of 2020. Finland notified the Commission in December 2018 of already achieving Finland™s national cumulative energy saving target for the period 2014˝2020.The annual final energy consumption as defined in the EED Article 2(3) and averaged over the years 2016˝2018 (the data of for 2018 is preliminary) is 238 TWh. Finland™s cumulative energy savings target, based on this average, for the period 2021˝2030 is 105 TWhcum. The formulation ﬁsupplied toﬂ in the definition of the EED Article 2(3), has been taken into account by deducting auto-production of electricity, steam and heat from Eurostat FEC2020˝2030 data.Table 7 lists energy efficiency methods for the 2020s which are estimated to result in total cumulative savings of 153 TWhcum.58Table 7.

According to the 2018 annual report in compliance with the Energy Efficiency Directive, the energy savings in force in 2017, achieved with the measures implemented between 2014 and 2017, totalled 13,240 MWh. The long-term energy savings in force in 2020, achieved with the measures implemented between 2014 and 2017, will total 11,369 MWh.In compliance with Article 5 of the EED, Finland will continue the alternative approach for the period 2021Œ2030. The amount of annual energy savings that would have been achieved by the default 3 % renovation rate was 1,285 MWh in 2014 and will be 1,070 MWh in 2020. Respectively the annual 3 % renovation rate would deliver 1,038 MWh (1,070 x 0.97) energy savings in 2021 and 789 MWh in 2030. These values are used as the first and the last year targets for the alternative approach during the period 2021Œ2030.The equivalent energy savings to be reached by 2020 were notified to be 8,225 MWh. By 2030, the amount of equivalent energy savings to be reached is 17,312 MWh. The methodology and parameters for calculating the energy savings 59delivered by the default 3 % renovation rate has not been changed. Therefore, Finland can confirm that the condition ﬁat least equivalentﬂ is fully taken into account also for the new period. A detailed description of the methodology and parameters used is presented in the EU PILOT (EUP(2017)9259).Energy efficiency in energy productionFinland efficiently utilises the Cogeneration Heat and Power (CHP) and district heating potential. A significant part of the heated building stock in towns, cities and densely populated municipalities is connected to a district heating network. Finnish district heating statistics show that district heating is used to heat around 90 % of all Finnish residential apartment buildings, 30 % of industrial buildings and more than 60 % of other buildings. In single-family houses, district heating accounts for about 10 %. District heating in residential, commercial and public buildings has a total market share of 46 % (2017). Almost 70 % (68 % in 2017) of district heat production is based on CHP. Similarly, CHP electricity accounts for about a third of Finland™s electricity production. Since district heating suppliers are dominant in their operating areas with regard to the choice of heating source, the competition authority monitors them and can, if necessary, intervene in any abusive use of a dominant position, for example in the case of retail prices for district heating.Energy efficiency agreements also cover energy production and energy services that serve the achievement of the indicative national energy efficiency target. The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan 2017 (NEEAP-417) estimated that the energy saving effects of the measures implemented within the scope of agreement activities in the energy sector will total almost 1.7 TWh in 2020.Energy efficiency in the transport sectorFinland has set separate sector-specific targets only in the field of transport. The objectives and measures for improving the energy efficiency of transport have been included in the National Energy and Climate Strategy and the Medium-term Climate Change Policy Plan. These measures are related to improving the energy efficiency 17 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/fi_neeap_2017_en.pdf60of vehicles on the one hand, and to improving the energy efficiency of the entire transport system on the other. Improving the energy efficiency of vehicles reduces vehicle-specific consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, while improving the energy efficiency of the transport system reduces total mileage and, consequently, fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions across the transport sector.Long-term renovation strategyFinland is in the course of establishing a long-term renovation strategy with an overview of the building stock in 2020 and indicative targets for the years 2030, 2040 and 2050. The strategy will be published in March 2020 by the Ministry of the Environment. Below is a description of the preliminary targets and other information regarding Finland™s long-term renovation strategy.The Finnish building stock will be expressed through e.g. building type, building year, location, main heating source and energy efficiency level. In addition, public buildings will be dealt with separately from the rest of the building stock. The building stock will be divided into (1) buildings that are already highly energy efficient, (2) buildings that require renovation and (3) worst-performing buildings. Policies and actions will be planned according to the targets. The indicators will cover at least energy use of the building stock, energy efficiency levels of the buildings, GHG emissions from building use, GHG emissions from renovations, energy poverty, the number and size of apartments, living conditions, smart energy systems and societal impacts.The Finnish long-term renovation strategy aims at decarbonising the current building stock by 2050. This draft description of the strategy includes the 2020 building stock description as well as initial targets for the years 2030, 2040 and 2050 for the heating consumption in buildings and for the related greenhouse gas emissions. The targets take into consideration the existing policy measures as well as additional policy measures required to decarbonise the Finnish building stock (phase-out of oil heating and energy renovation subsidies). The full version of the strategy will also include e.g. the tracking of energy efficiency levels of the Finnish building stock (the full version will be submitted in accordance with the EPBD in March 2020). Additional indicators will include e.g. energy poverty, solar panel installations and apartment sizes. The building types included in the strategy 61are detached buildings, terraced houses, residential apartment blocks and service buildings.The heating energy use of the Finnish building stock in 2020 is estimated to be about 65 TWh. Besides the heating of buildings, saunas, a Finnish speciality, consume notable amounts of energy - about 2.6 TWh in 2020. Another Finnish characteristic is the popularity and rapid increase in heat pumps in buildings: about 5.8 TWh of the building heating in 2020 is estimated to come from the energy that is harvested by heat pumps.The initial target levels for heating energy use of buildings (excluding saunas) are 54 TWh in 2030, 45 TWh in 2040 and 37 TWh in 2050, including the energy harvested by heat pumps. This corresponds to an energy saving of 16 % in 2030, 30 % in 2040 and 42 % in 2050, when compared to the baseline year 2020.Energy savings from heating energy in buildings comprises two main factors: energy efficiency improvements and maintenance, and removals from the building stock and efficiency of space utilisation. Figure 6 shows the total heating energy savings compared to the baseline year 2020, allocated to the different sources of energy savings.0 %10 %20 %30 %40 %50 %60 %70 %80 %90 %100 %2020203020402050Removals from building stock and e˜ciency of space utilisationEnergy e˜ciency improvements and maintenanceHeating energy useFigure 6.    The total heating energy use and saving in the 2020 building stock when compared to the energy use in the base year 2020 (heating energy use of 2020=100 %).62The greenhouse gas emissions of the 2020 building stock are 7.7 Mt CO2 equivalent. The corresponding emissions are 2.9 Mt CO2 equivalent for 2030, 1.6 Mt CO2 equivalent for 2040 and 0.7 Mt CO2 equivalent for 2050. This leads to total emissions reductions of 62 % in 2030, 80 % in 2040 and 91 % in 2050, when compared to the baseline year 2020.The factors behind the emissions reductions in building energy use are Energy efficiency improvements and maintenance, which include the energy efficiency improvements in renovations as well as improved building maintenance and automation practices; decarbonisation of heating at the building level, which includes changes in heating sources (removals of oil-fired heating boilers and installations of heat pumps); removals from building stock and efficiency of space utilisation; and finally decarbonisation of centralised energy production (district heating and electricity).The impacts of decarbonisation policies vary in terms of energy sources. The main decrease in heating sources relates to fossil fuel use (consists almost entirely of heating oil), and the main increase is related to the heat pump use in heating. Figure 7 shows the impacts of the decarbonisation policies on the use of different heating energy sources.0102030405060702020203020402050ElectricityDistrict heatingHeat pumpsFossil fuelsWoodTWhFigure 7.    Heating energy sources of the remaining 2020 building stock in 2020Œ2050.63Main results of the recent Energy Efficiency Working GroupIn November 2018, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment appointed an Energy Efficiency Working Group to review the potential for improving energy efficiency during the period of 2021Œ2030. The working group proposed measures enabling Finland to achieve the energy savings objectives defined in Article 3 and Article 7 over the 2021Œ2030 period. The working group was assisted by expert working groups on industry, consumers, services and transport, consisting of the best national energy efficiency experts in each sector. The expert working groups compiled the existing and new energy efficiency measures in their respective sectors and assessed the potential for improving the efficiency of the existing ones. An impact assessment was carried out on selected measures to determine energy saving impacts and their feasibility. Table 8 shows the estimated annual savings (in 2030).64Table 8.

When considering early actions, anticipated GDP growth, its structure ˝ based heavily on energy intensive industries ˝ and the 18 Report of the energy efficiency working group, 2019. Työ- ja elinkeinoministeriön julkaisuja 2019:53. https://tem.fi/julkaisu?pubid=URN:ISBN:978-952-327-456-365changes in energy supply, it is very ambitious for Finland to contribute to the declining projection of the energy use 2021˝2030.Finland started active energy efficiency policies and measures already after the 1973 oil crisis. The Government launched the first comprehensive Energy Efficiency Action Plan in 1993 and established the sustainable development company Motiva Ltd to implement many of the plan™s activities, including the Energy Audit Programme. This long history of energy efficiency policies and measures in Finland means that there are no silver bullets or low-hanging fruit to improve energy efficiency.Economic growth in the 2020s will come partly from relatively energy intensive sectors: the forest industry (pulp production based solely on virgin fibre, new products and biorefineries) and data centres. Also in the forest industry, increasing demand for further processed bio- and other products typically increases the energy intensity of the products.Without these foreseen changes, final energy consumption would decrease steadily with increasing energy efficiency. However, the changes described above will mean the increase in final energy use roughly offsets the energy efficiency gains achieved at the same time. Progress will become even more evident in future as illustrated in Figure 8, which shows that rising GDP does not increase final energy consumption in the same proportion. On the contrary, improved energy technology and energy efficiency actions taken have already helped and will in future help to disconnect growth of the national economy from the amount of energy consumption.6600,20,40,60,81,01,21,41,62021202220232024202520262027202820292030GWh/million euro (2010 prices)Final energy consumption/GDPFigure 8.
