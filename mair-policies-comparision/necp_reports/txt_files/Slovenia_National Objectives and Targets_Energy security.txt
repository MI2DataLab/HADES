INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 51   2.3 Energy Security Dimension Overview of key objectives:  ensure a reliable and competitive energy supply,  maintain a high level of electricity connection with neighbouring countries,  at least 75% of electricity supply from sources in Slovenia by 2030 and 2040 and ensuring an adequate level of security of electricity supply,  continue to exploit nuclear energy and maintain excellence in the operation of nuclear facilities in Slovenia,  comprehensive examination of the potential for long-term use of nuclear energy (economic and other expert analyses as a basis for a decision by 2027 at the latest on the construction of a new nuclear power plant),  reducing dependency on fossil fuel imports,  increasing distribution network resistance to disruption - increasing the proportion of underground medium-voltage network from the current 35% to at least 50%,  further development of system services and the active role of clients,  development of energy storage technologies, infrastructure and services,  diversification of sources and supply routes and decarbonisation of the natural gas supply. 2.3.1 National objectives and contributions referred to in Article 4(c) The key objective of the future development of energy in Slovenia is to continue to strike a balance between the three fundamental objectives of energy policy, which are: (1) minimising environmental impacts, (2) appropriate security of supply, and (3) a competitive energy supply. Further development of the energy sector in Slovenia will require coordinated technological, legislative, economic and social action with a view to reducing energy requirements, reducing import dependency, increasing diversification and energy storage, and managing risks and emergencies in the energy markets. Without proper support and communication with the public, the new investments laid down in the NEPN will not have the proper effect or be implemented at all. The expected structure of primary and final energy consumption is shown in the figures below. The cornerstone of individual resource relationships will be long-term resource provisioning, competitive price of the final product, spatial and environmental acceptability and sustainability. The target is to achieve at least 75% of the electricity supply from sources in Slovenia by 2030 or 2040, and ensure an adequate level of security of electricity supply. In this process, it will be necessary to ensure an adequate supply during the different seasons, to store surplus renewable electricity by means of integration of sectors, and to provide adequate resources for the provision of system services and an adequate level of operational reliability at all times.

In accordance with Council Directive 2009/119/EC, Slovenia will continue to ensure a quantity of reserves of oil and oil derivatives, which corresponds to at least ninety days average consumption in the previous year. However, on account INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA 53   of the increased scope of renewables, the storage of electricity and the integration of different sectors are an ever-increasing challenge, and Slovenia is seeking to participate actively in the development of centralised and decentralised solutions and to support the implementation of demonstration and pilot projects on energy storage up to 2030, including through the installation of battery capacity, and other storage apparatus on the transmission and distribution networks (including pumped hydro-electric power plants), heat storage in district heating systems and using gas pipelines to store surplus electricity in the form of CNG/H2. Different options for seasonal energy storage should also be considered. In order to maximise the share of renewables in gross final energy use by 2030, we will build a sufficient number of different energy storage facilities, appropriate in terms of technology, size and duration of storage, connected to the transmission or distribution network that will ensure that the maximum possible share of daily electricity needs is stored in the Slovenian electricity system. In the area of security of the natural gas supply, Slovenia will continue to implement and reinforce measures to ensure the security of supply in the natural gas market, to ensure diversification of sources and supply routes, and will cooperate with other EU Member States (promotion of regional and bilateral solidarity) and guarantee suppliers obligations to supply of natural gas to final customers in accordance with signed supply contracts from at least two different supply sources and guarantee the protection of protected customers, etc., in accordance with the requirements of the Energy Act and implementing regulations. Through energy efficiency measures, Slovenia will strive to reduce the consumption of imported natural gas. In addition to the possibility of adding natural gas from production within Slovenia56, we will promote pilot projects for the domestic production of renewable gases. The pilot projects will be in the area of the production of hydrogen from renewable electricity and of synthetic methane and other fuels from wood and other biomass and waste. In the area of electricity supply, Slovenia's electricity transmission system will continue to be able to operate at all time in the event of a single part failure. The transmission system operator ELES in its development plans is planning to reinforce and upgrade the network and develop complex system platforms, which in future will be able to ensure a high-quality electricity supply to customers and improved resistance to potential disruption that may occur in the Slovenian electricity system57. The current development plan does not fulfil the expected increased electricity distribution needs, so we will introduce more development-oriented financing of the future development of the distribution network for greater capacity, resilience, future development potential and exploitation of resource and burden flexibility. We will also achieve greater future development potential and capacity to take advantage of the flexibility of our distribution network resources and burdens by improving the interoperability of the elements behind the measuring point with the elements before the measuring point (final introduction of smart networks, communities, cities, etc.). In view of increasing and intensifying weather events (e.g. ice storm of 2014, wind storm of 2017), for greater energy reliability (and security) it is vital to boost the resilience of the distribution network to disruption, including by increasing the proportion of underground medium-voltage network from 35% to at least 50%. We will significantly increase funding for investments in the distribution network, which is the cornerstone of the transition to a climate-neutral society. Additional measures will ensure appropriate conditions for its accelerated development for greater capacity and flexibility (adaptation of consumption and production), which will allow for greater integration of heat pumps, accelerated                                                            56  Natural gas reserves have been identified in the territory of North-Eastern Slovenia and the way is being paved towards the start of exploitation. The successful establishment of sustainable and environmentally friendly production and supply to the Slovenian transmission pipeline network would have a limited positive impact on the security of natural gas supply in Slovenia. 57  Simulation-based analyses showed that, in the event of outages, problems may be expected most of all in the Primorska and Dolenjska networks, with loads also reaching high values in the Pomurje network.

It is important that network capacity building (which is and will be a necessary but time-consuming process) and the introduction of the flexibility market go hand in hand as they support each other. The future development of the electricity generation sector includes the following:  up to 2030, the sector will continue to be based largely on the use of a mix of primary sources from Slovenia, in particular RES and nuclear energy, and will continue to use domestic coal - lignite;  we will maintain the excellence and safe operation of nuclear facilities in Slovenia;  we will examine the possibilities of introducing new nuclear technologies and will carry out all the necessary economic and other expert analyses and activities, on the basis of which it will be possible by 2027 at the latest to decide on the construction of a new nuclear power plant;  we will improve the diversification of primary sources of electricity production, increase the use of RES and increase the use of natural gas in the high-efficiency cogeneration of heat and power, which will reach the target of at least 5% of electricity production in Slovenia by 2030;  by 2030, the closure thermal power plant () will reduce lignite extraction and put an end to the use of imported coal for electricity production at Energetika Ljubljana, the Ljubljana thermal power plant unit.  2.3.2 Other objectives and contributions referred to in Annex 1 related to the energy security dimension Other than the above, the NEPN does not envisage additional specific targets for increasing the flexibility of the national energy system, increasing diversification of energy sources and supplies from third countries to increase the resilience of regional and national energy systems and reducing dependency on energy imports from third countries and to increase the resilience of State and regional energy systems.
