 Part 1 General framework SECTION A: NATIONAL PLAN 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 1.1. Executive summary i. Political, economic, environmental and social context of the plan The Slovak Republic (SR) became an independent state in 1993. It became a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2000, has been a member of the European Union (EU) since May 2004, and since 2007 has been a member of the International Energy Agency (IEA). The Slovak Republic adopted the joint European currency, the euro, in January 2009.  In November 2014, the Slovak Government approved an Energy Policy (EP SR), setting targets and priorities for the energy sector to 2035 with an outlook to 2050. The strategic objective of the EP SR is to achieve a competitive low-carbon energy industry sector ensuring the secure and efficient supply of all forms of energy at affordable prices, and taking customer protection and sustainable development into account. The Slovak Republic takes air quality, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mitigating climate change, the security of supplies of all energy types and their affordability, extremely seriously. In 2019, the SR committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The gross domestic consumption of the SR features balanced shares of nuclear and fossil fuels. The development of the power industry in the SR focuses on optimising the energy mix to reduce emissions of greenhouse gas and pollutants as much as possible while retaining or increasing energy security and the affordability of the individual energy types. Pursuant to Section 88 of Act No 251/2012, on energy and on the amendment of certain other acts, as amended, the ME SR is responsible for preparing an energy policy for at least 20 years and for updating it in a five-year cycle. The Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan, prepared within the meaning of Art. 9 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, is an update of the Energy Policy approved through Resolution of the Government of the SR No 548/2014 of 5 November 2014. The Energy Policy of the Slovak Republic (EP SR) originally featured four basic pillars - energy security, energy efficiency, competitiveness and sustainable energy. The EP SR also included science, research and innovation. This plan updates the existing Energy Policy while extending it to include decarbonisation. The priorities of the EP SR are:  an optimal energy mix;  increase energy supply security;  develop the energy infrastructure;  diversify energy sources and distribution routes;   maximum use of transmission networks and transit systems passing through the SR;  application of the primacy of energy efficiency principle;  reduce energy intensity;  a functioning energy market in a competitive environment;  high-quality energy supply at affordable prices;  protect vulnerable customers;  address energy poverty;  a reasonable pro-export balance in the electricity system;  promote high-efficiency cogeneration;  promote the use of efficient district heating systems (DHS);  promote the use of RES to produce electricity, hydrogen, heat and cold;  use nuclear energy as a low-carbon electricity source;  improve the safety and reliability of nuclear power plants. Sustainable development must meet the current needs of the population without limiting future generations ability to meet their own needs. It is therefore necessary to change technologies, processes and habits on both the generation and consumption sides. The main quantified energy and climate targets for 2030 are, throughout the Union, to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 40% compared to 1990 (individual Member States have shares that take their local conditions into account), with the following binding targets at Union level: achieve an RES share in gross energy consumption of at least 32%, while the RES share in transport must be at least 14% in every Member State, a national energy efficiency contribution of at least 32% and electrical system interconnectivity of at least 15%. The main quantified NECP targets for the SR by 2030 are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for sectors not involved in emissions trading (non-ETS) by 20% (the share has been increased from the originally declared 12%). The RES share in final energy consumption has been set at 19.2% for 2030, together with meeting the required target of 14% of RES in transport. The elaborated measures to achieve the national contribution of the SR in energy efficiency show slightly lower values (30.3%) than the European target of 32.5%. Industry and buildings will be key to achieving the targets. The interconnectivity of the electricity grids is already above 50% and will remain so in 2030, so the target of at least 15% will be met. Table 1 Europe-wide and national targets EU and SR targets EU 2030 SR 2030 Greenhouse gas emissions (compared to 1990) -40% There are no national targets for individual Member States Emissions in the ETS sector (compared to 2005) -43% Non-ETS greenhouse gas emissions (compared to -30% -20%  2005) Total share of renewable energy sources (RES) 32% 19.2% Share of RES in transport 14% 14% Energy efficiency 32.5% 30.3% Interconnection of electricity systems 15% 52% Source: EC, ME SR The NECP proposal submitted to the European Commission in December 2018 included a proposed SR contribution to the RES target of 18%. Taking into account the need to increase RES ambitions, and based on the PRIMES-EUCO model scenario that shows the possibility of achieving an RES share of 19%, as well as taking into account other additional factors, the proposal for the final NECP was submitted for a public comments procedure with thorough processing for a scenario with measures for a target RES value of 19.2% in 2030. An increase in the ambition to 20% was compared to this scenario, with the additional required investment calculated at around EUR 700 million. Based on the comments from the interdepartmental consultation procedure, the target of 19.2% was chosen because 5 entities directly supported the reference target while no entity was in favour of the alternative 20% target. In the electricity generation from RES sector, the NECP proposal from 2018 determined an indicative target of 25% for 2030, corresponding to 27.3% for the 19.2% target, which is at the limit of the technical possibilities of the Slovak electricity system. One alternative to increasing the overall share of RES in 2030 from 19.2% to 20% lies in heat generation. This would however require greater use of biomass, including the production of biogas and biomethane (mainly derived from waste from plant and animal production, from the biodegradable part of municipal waste, biodegradable kitchen and restaurant waste and waste from waste water treatment plants), heat pumps, solar panels and geothermal energy in DHS. The high level of national gasification, with over 90% of the population having access to natural gas, acts against the greater use of RES in the heat sector. The transition to biomass from natural gas in households is therefore problematic from the perspective of air quality, which could endanger compliance with EU legislation. One solution is to incorporate biomethane and hydrogen into the existing gas infrastructure. Given current technology and price levels, the extensive use of geothermal energy in the 2020-2022 period is unlikely. The costs connected to the accelerated construction of geothermal equipment would lead to a significant increase in prices for heat consumers. It is unlikely that the significant input investments required for a large number of geothermal sources could be covered from public and private financing in such a short time period. Greater use of geothermal energy is more likely at a later date. The planned RES target for 2030 in the NECP is 19.2%. The ME SR will take all possible steps to further accelerate RES development between 2021 and 2030, in particular in heat generation, to ensure that the SR will be able to approach the higher RES share in 2030. Our calculations and expert estimates indicate that the achievement of the 24% RES target in 2030, as indicated by the EC based on the indicative formula in Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of  the European Parliament and of the Council on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, is also not realistic. The regulation itself anticipates that this value will be modified to take national specifics into account. From the perspective of the SR, account needs to be taken of the fact that after the as-yet unfinished blocks at the Mochovce nuclear power plant are put into operation, it will be difficult, even impossible, to increase the RES share above the proposed RES target in the electricity generation sector. Maintaining the reliability of the Slovak electricity system will require a sufficient level of flexible sources, even if the level of cross-border connections with neighbouring countries is higher than the EU average. ii. Strategy relating to all five energy union dimensions Building a competitive low-carbon economy directed towards carbon neutrality is a long-term priority of the SRs Energy Policy. The transition to a low-carbon economy is associated with additional costs that will be borne by consumers and/or taxpayers. For this reason, it will also be necessary to adopt measures that respect the primacy of energy efficiency principle, while RES should not be the main target but only one of the tools for such transformation. Maximising the use of new financial support mechanisms between 2021 and 2030 (Modernization Fund, Innovation Fund) will also be unavoidable, as these  with the proper setup of priority projects at national level  can make a significant contribution towards the transition to a low-carbon economy. Measures to ensure environmental sustainability:  provide financial mechanisms and use the proceeds for the SR from quota auctions under the emissions trading scheme to support the energy and industry sectors, focusing on priority areas in line with the sustainable development principles as outlined above;  intensify activities to reduce CO2 emissions, particularly in the transport sector;  thoroughly assess the construction of new energy conversion resources in view of the possible negative impacts on environmental sustainability and on efficiency reduction;  optimise the RES share, especially in heat generation;  use natural gas and, in the long term, decarbonised gases and hydrogen;  prepare measures to enable economic growth based on a low carbon, circular and a less energy- and material-intensive economy;  ensure the timely implementation of the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP);  contribute towards achieving the environmental sustainability of the set targets through appropriate and targeted regulatory measures;  use waste-to-energy. Decarbonisation dimension Building a competitive, low-carbon economy is a long-term priority of the Energy Policy of the SR. The optimal use of renewable energy sources, nuclear energy, decarbonised gases and innovative technologies, which contribute towards the effective use of energy resources, are key to achieving a  low-carbon economy. The use of waste gases and waste within the framework of the circular economy can also make a contribution. Achieving Slovakias future targets while increasing the RES share will be associated with significant financial costs. Therefore, the SR will implement support mechanisms that will meet the target of increasing the RES share on the one hand while on the other contributing towards meeting the targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and  The SR has one of the lowest-emission energy sectors in the EU thanks to the high share of nuclear sources in its electricity generation and the high share of natural gas in the heating sector. There is only space for decarbonising the energy sector through the replacement of coal with low-emissions sources, respectively alternative fuel sources, in energy efficiency measures and in the decarbonising of transport. After the replacement of solid fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, the SR will have one of the lowest-emission energy sectors in the whole of the EU (specifically the seventh-least-energy-intensive energy sector in the EU from the perspective of the CO2 intensity of electricity and heat generation) and thus any potential for increased RES implementation must be sought in the regions, where solid fossil fuels are used to a greater extent  RES and decarbonisation will be far more cost-effective there. When projecting RES use, account was taken of the principle of minimising costs through an integrated approach to renewable energy sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This means that the use of fossil fuels, and thereby greenhouse gas emissions, will be reduced through a suitable combination of RES and low-carbon technologies. In the upcoming period, the use of RES will be a priority  especially in transport, and in heat and cold production  while support for electricity generation will be limited. In the coming years the heating sector and, in particular, district heating, will be important for the transformation of the energy sector. Reducing the share of coal in heating to the benefit of renewables will improve the sustainability and security of heat supply. The high degree of centralisation of heat supply creates good technical preconditions for the use of biomass, biomethane and geothermal energy. The low-carbon electricity generation mix means that gradual electrification, in particular of public passenger transport, will be a challenge. The acceptance of the more ambitious RES targets to 2030 (far over and above the scope of coal replacement) will significantly reduce the flexibility of a Member State to effectively reduce CO2 emissions in other sectors from a technological and economic perspective. Energy efficiency dimension  Energy efficiency synergistically contributes to reducing the energy intensity of the economy, contributes to increased energy security, has an impact on reducing the operating costs of energy companies and, last but not least, the savings on primary energy sources contribute to the mitigation of energy sector environmental impacts. Energy efficiency cuts across all dimensions of the Energy Policy.

Significant progress in reducing energy intensity is evidenced by its development from 2000 to 2015 when, according to Eurostat data, the SR reduced its energy intensity by 50.8%. This positive development is, inter alia, a result of the successful restructuring of industry, the introduction of low-energy manufacturing processes in industry, improvements in building thermal and technical properties, and the replacement of appliances for more-energy-efficient ones. However, in spite of this, the Slovak Republic has the seventh-highest energy intensity in the EU-28 on a constant prices basis. This is mainly due to the structure of industry in the Slovak Republic, with high-energy-intensity industry having a major share, meaning that energy efficiency measures, including funding sources, will focus much more on industry and related services, including energy, in the future. The Slovak energy efficiency priority is a further reduction in the energy intensity of the SR economy with a view to achieving the European average.  The Slovak Republic has transposed the entire energy efficiency strategic and legislative framework of the European Union into its national strategic and legislative framework.  For energy efficiency, the key implementation tools to 2020 were energy efficiency Action Plans that assess energy efficiency measures and set out new measures to meet energy savings targets. This role will transfer to the NECP and two-year energy sector progress reports after 2020.  Energy security dimension From the energy security point of view, there is support for an efficient energy architecture which creates, for the benefit and protection of consumers, conditions for increasing energy security through the utilisation of domestic energy sources, a favourable environment for the construction of low-carbon heat and electricity generation sources with the option of exporting electricity, and an optimal energy mix with low-carbon technologies in each sector. The key areas are the diversification of transit routes and energy sources, increased nuclear safety and reliability, and energy supply security. Internal energy market dimension The Slovak Republic will strive to maximise its use of existing infrastructure in accordance with the rules adopted in new or amended EU documents . In this context, the deployment of smart energy systems and electricity storage systems is considered to be extremely important. Research, innovation and competitiveness dimension: The Implementation Plan of the Research and Innovation Strategy for Smart Specialisation of the Slovak Republic (IP RIS3) elaborates the procedures and processes for fulfilling the criteria in relation to thematic ex ante conditionality for the thematic objective entitled Strengthening Research, Technological Development and Innovation, and implementing the relevant investment priorities financed during the 2014-2020 programming period, as well as the measures to which the Slovak Republic has committed under the Operational Programme Research and Innovation (OP RandI). As part of the EUs climate change research programme, nearly EUR 6 billion has been earmarked for research into non-nuclear energy for the 2014-2020 period. In September 2015, the Commission adopted a Strategic Energy Technology Plan to help address the challenges needed to transform the EUs energy system. This focuses on measures that will help the EU to become the world leader in renewable energy and develop energy efficient systems.  Establishing a technological lead in alternative energy and reducing energy consumption will create huge export and industrial opportunities. It will also support growth and jobs. Renewable energy sources will play an important role in the transition to a clean energy system.  The Slovak Republic has the potential to use knowledge and domestic expertise acquired through Big Data in the processing, analysis, prediction and visualisation of large volumes of data in real time, as well as to use artificial intelligence based on the extraction of historical data, with the objective of supporting future decisions, for example in environmental protection, the climate etc. These methods can be used to improve already tried and tested prediction models and to use modern technologies and developed algorithms for distributed and parallel data processing. This will allow, inter alia, the processing of analyses of various internal and external factors (for example weather effects) to predict the evolution of relationships within a selected ecosystem or power system, including the visualisation of Big Data and the virtualisation of various situations.  Draft State R&D Programmes for 2020-is currently being prepared. This material is ready for approval by the Government (as of September 2019). The State R&D Programmes address key issues in developing and meeting the needs of society. They specify the science and technology fields on which research and development should focus or that should be intensified to achieve increased economic and social benefits and contribute towards their high standard and international recognition.  The objectives of the implementation of the State R&D Programmes are to develop key areas of the economy with a direct link to the application of R&D results and outputs in practice, to support improving the competitiveness of the SR economy and to support societal development, through targeted solutions for research and development projects supported from the State budget.  iii. Overview table with key objectives, policies and measures of the plan  Table 2: Key objectives, policies and measures Strategy and policy Key objectives  Measures Economic Policy Strategy of the Slovak Republic to 2030 (Government Resolution No 300/2018) Determine the strategic direction of the economic policy of the SR with a view to 2030. Improve the predictability and stability of public decisions. The economic policy strategy has a supra-departmental nature; its defined scope commits the Office of the Government of the Slovak Republic and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for Investment and Informatics, in addition to the relevant ministries, to cooperate in its preparation. The draft measures were drawn up in cooperation with the relevant ministries and institutions. The measures set out in the document will be implemented through Action Plans in three-year cycles. There will be a review and possible modification of the strategy based on current needs in the middle of the period to which the document relates. Strategic Plan for the Development of Transport of the SR to 2030 Reduce the negative environmental and negative socio-economic impacts of transport (including climate change) Promote the use of alternative fuels and build the related infrastructure for road and water transport, replace  (Government Resolution No 13/2017) through environmental monitoring, effective infrastructure planning/implementation and reducing the number of conventionally powered means of transport, potentially by using alternative fuels obsolete marine propulsion units, including the use of low-emissions auxiliary power units, to protect water from pollution due to the discharge of waste from vessels on the Slovak Danube, renew the vehicle fleet by motivating citizens through direct financial support from the State, and potentially tax instruments, respectively exemptions from toll payment for freight vessels running on alternative fuels. Strategy for the Adaptation of the Slovak Republic to Climate Change - Update (Government Resolution No 478/2018) The main objective of the updated Strategy for the Adaptation of the SR to the Adverse Effects of Climate Change is to improve the readiness of the SR to face the adverse effects of climate change, to provide as much information as possible about the current adaptation processes in the SR and, based on its analysis, to establish an institutional framework and coordination mechanism to ensure the effective implementation of adaptation measures at all levels and in all areas, as well as to improve overall awareness of this issue. General guidance for adaptation and examples of specific adaptation measures in the transport, energy and industry sectors, and for some other business areas. Environmental Policy Strategy of the Slovak Republic until 2030 (Environmental Strategy 2030) Nature protection Air protection Green economy Improve biodiversity protection and limit the deterioration in the condition of species and habitats. The Slovak Republic will achieve good water condition and the green measures adopted will ensure improved protection from flooding. Water retention, improved landscape planning and more responsible water management will contribute towards reducing droughts and water scarcity. In the area of air protection, the main measures will focus on reducing the burning of coal, increasing ecological transport and more efficient and d more consistently, and environmentally harmful subsidies for coal or biomass from unsustainable sources should also be removed. Air quality will be improved in 2030 and will not have a significant negative impact on human health or the environment. In the field of climate change, the Slovak Republic will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in emissions trading sectors by 43%  and by at least 20% outside such areas compared to 2005. Sustainable use criteria for all renewable sources will be developed by 2020. Circular economy principles will be gradually introduced in Slovakia. By 2030, the recycling rate for municipal waste will increase to a minimum of 60%, and the landfill rate will be reduced to less than 25% by 2035. At the same time, the use of preventive measures to prevent illegal dumps will increase. Slovakia will limit the production of food waste by 2030. Restaurants and supermarkets will be obliged to use their food in alternative ways, either by donating unspoilt food to charity or by composting or applying energy recovery for post-guarantee food. Green public procurement will cover at least 70% of the total value of all public procurement, and support for green innovation, science and research will increase significantly. The energy intensity of Slovakias industry will approach that of the EU average. In the field of energy generation, renewable energy sources that, do not burden the environment by their nature, will be preferred. National indicative energy efficiency targets and contributions to the European energy efficiency target Primary energy consumption in 2020 16.38 Mtoe, 686 PJ, 20% Final energy consumption in 2020 (Eurostat) 10.39 Mtoe, 435 PJ, 23%  National indicative contributions to the EU target 32.5% in 2030 Measures to increase energy efficiency, in particular in buildings and industry. Chapter 2.2. energy efficiency dimension Low-carbon strategy for development of the SR Strategy objectives:  Provide a coherent long-term (30-year) strategic overview for the transition to a low-carbon economy  Ensure consistency with other strategic documents and Action Plans in the national economy (energy, industry, transport, agriculture and forestry, waste)  Introduce binding and indicative targets for individual areas  Ensure consistency with the targets of the Paris Agreement, To be specified in the Low-Carbon Development Strategy of the SR  primarily the carbon-neutrality target  Provide a list of measures and their funding possibilities  Evaluate the impacts of the strategy and its measures on macroeconomic indicators National Policy Framework for the Development of the Alternative Fuels Market (Government Resolution No 504/2016)  To promote the development of the alternative fuels market in the transport sector and the development of the relevant infrastructure through the determined measures The document defines the measures to meet the national targets and objectives of the national policy framework, measures to promote the introduction of infrastructure for alternative fuels in public transport services, and to evaluate the placement of filling stations for liquified natural gas in ports not part of the basic TEN-T network, and to evaluate the need to install electricity-supply equipment for the needs of aircraft at stands at airports. Fuels included in the national policy framework will be eligible for Union support measures and national support measures for alternative fuels infrastructure so that State aid focuses on the coordinated development of the internal market directed towards mobility, with the use of transport means running on alternative fuels, as well as on a whole range of regulatory and non-regulatory incentives, in close cooperation with private sector entities that could play a leading role in promoting the development of infrastructure for alternative fuels.  Action Plan for the Development of Electromobility in the Slovak Republic (Government Resolution No 110/2019)  promote low-emissions mobility The measures have the nature of direct support for the purchase of highly environmentally friendly low-emissions vehicles, support for the construction of infrastructure, as well as incentive support such as differing vehicle identification, access to low-emissions zones and the use of car parks intended for a restricted group of users.   1.2. Overview of the current policy situation  On 11 December 2018, the European Commission (EC) approved the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action. The  creation of an energy union is one of the ten political priorities, and this regulation is an important element in the strategic energy union framework. i. National and Union energy system and policy context of the national plan The Ministry of Economy is the central state administration authority for energy, including the management of nuclear fuel and the storage of radioactive waste.  The priorities of the Slovak Republic in the energy sector are to ensure synergy between sub-policies, cost efficiency, enforcement of the principles of sovereignty in the energy mix, preservation of competitiveness and energy security. In this context we consider the replacement of high-emissions energy sources for low-emissions ones, as well as the development of renewable energy sources (RES) and measures to increase energy efficiency as a means of achieving emissions targets. In Slovakia, as well as in several other Member States, safe and sustainable nuclear power will play a very important role in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Extending the service life of existing nuclear sources is an effective tool for achieving climate targets (with a minimal impact on the final electricity prices).  The energy sector is also very closely related to industry competitiveness, and is something to which we are paying more attention in view of high international competition and the emergence of the technologically revolutionary Industry 4.0 concept. We have committed to finding ways to reduce the final price of electricity for industrial customers.  The Slovak Republic constantly emphasises improving energy security and the security of energy supply, as evidenced by the continuation of work on individual Projects of Common Interest (PCI).   In the field of renewable energy sources (RES), efforts are being made to promote forms that can replace fossil fuels in a way that ensures reliable electricity or heat generation and supply without major additional costs. Conditions will be created for the optimal use of renewable energy sources in the energy mix in order to meet the from EU legislation. In October 2018, Parliament approved an amendment to Act No 309/2009, on the promotion of renewable energy sources, in line with the philosophy of gradually reducing support for this source, with the priorities being to ensure cost-effectiveness and to minimise the impact on final energy prices. The highly developed transport and distribution networks mean that the use of existing gas infrastructure provides the prerequisites for further decarbonisation of the economy.  The Ministry of the Environment of the Slovak Republic is the central state administration authority for environment creation and protection, and is responsible for the creation of the environmental policy and the climate change policy. Within the scope of its competence, the ministry establishes special professional organisations, which are budgetary and contributory organisations, unless otherwise determined in a separate regulation, and establishes other legal persons.  ii. Current energy and climate policies and measures relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union The Slovak Republic has taken all necessary steps to improve its mechanisms for monitoring, evaluating and streamlining instruments and measures to fulfil its commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). All relevant policies and measures at EU level are being strengthened to meet the 2020 targets under the agreement in the Climate and Energy Package. This includes legislation introduced in the EU to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% by 2020 compared to 1990, with a conditional shift to a 30% reduction provided that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emissions reductions. In addition, the EU has committed to achieving a 20% share for renewable energy (as a share of gross final energy consumption in the EU) by 2020, complemented by a target of an at least 10% share of renewable energy sources in the transport sector. The EU is also committed to achieving a 20% reduction in overall primary energy consumption by 2020 compared to projections in 2007.1 As can be seen from the recent greenhouse gas inventory results, the Slovak Republic is well on track to meet its commitments. The overall policy framework in the Slovak Republic consists of national conceptual and strategic sectoral documents as well as European climate strategies and policies.   Policy context at EU level a) The Europe 2020 Strategy - Europe 2020 is a ten-year growth strategy and builds on lessons learned from the Lisbon Strategy. The main objective of Europe 2020 is to ensure smart, sustainable and inclusive growth through greater coordination between national and European policies. Three priorities are outlined in the Europe 2020 Communication2:  Smart growth  developing an economy based on knowledge and innovation.  Sustainable growth  promoting a low-carbon, resource-efficient and competitive economy.  Inclusive growth  fostering a high-employment economy delivering social and territorial cohesion. b) Climate and energy package - In December 2008, the European Parliament and the Council agreed on the EU Climate and Energy Package which, for the first time, provided an integrated and ambitious package of policies and measures to combat climate change together with renewable energy sources and energy efficiency elements. The Climate and Energy Package was formally adopted in 2009, and includes the following 20-20-20 goals:  A cut of at least 20% in greenhouse gas emissions (from 1990 levels), with a firm commitment to increase this target to 30% if a satisfactory international agreement is reached.  To achieve 20% renewable energy (as a share of total EU gross final energy consumption) by 2020, complemented by a target of an at least 10% share of renewable sources in transport.                                                   1 consumption in the EU (at that time the EU-27) in 2020 cannot exceed 1 474 Mtoe of primary energy consumption and 1 078 Mtoe of final energy consumption. 2 COM (2010) 2020 Final   To save 20% of total primary energy consumption by 2020 compared to the unchanged reference scenario. In order to meet the key objectives, the Climate and Energy Package includes four pieces of complementing legislation3:  A Directive revising the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which covers some 40% of EU greenhouse gas emissions;  An effort-sharing Decision setting binding national targets for emissions from sectors not covered by the EU ETS;  A Directive setting binding national targets for increasing the share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix;  A Directive creating a legal framework for the safe and environmentally sound use of carbon capture and storage technologies - the Carbon Capture and Storage Directive. c) Climate and Energy Framework 2030 - This framework was agreed by EU leaders in October 2014 and is based on the Climate and Energy Package 2020 mentioned above. It sets three main objectives for 2030:  At least 40% cuts in greenhouse gas emissions (from 1990 levels). To achieve this reduction, EU ETS sectors should cut emissions by 43% (compared to 2005)  to this end, the EU ETS is to be reformed and strengthened. Non-EU ETS sectors should cut emissions by 30% (compared to 2005)  this target needs to be translated into individual binding targets for Member States.  At least 27% of EU energy consumption from renewable energy sources.  An at least 27% improvement in energy efficiency. New, stricter objectives were agreed in November 2018 through a revision of the Energy Efficiency Directive and the RES Promotion Directive:  Energy efficiency in the EU should increase by 32.5% by 2030.  The share of energy generated from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption should reach at least 32% in the same period.  Both targets should be reviewed in 2023, however if they are to be changed then only to make them stricter  no reduction in the targets will be possible. d) Roadmap 2050 - In 2011, the European Commission launched three plans to support the debate on a long-term framework for climate and energy policies in Europe:  A Roadmap for moving to a competitive low-carbon economy by 2050;4  A Roadmap for a Single European Transport Area  the creation of a competitive and resource-efficient transport system;5  A 2050 Energy Roadmap.6                                                  3 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-09-628_en.htm  4 COM(2011) 112 final. 5 COM(2011) 144 final.  In February 2011, the European Council reaffirmed that the EUs goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 2050 by 80% to 95% compared to 1990 levels as part of the developed countries efforts as a group to reduce their emissions by a similar amount. Although the EU has already committed itself to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels as part of the Climate and Energy Package, longer-term policies are now needed to achieve an ambitious reduction target by 2050. The European Commission has therefore published the notice A Roadmap for Moving to a Competitive Low-carbon economy by 2050, providing guidance on how the EU can decarbonise its economy. e) 7th Environmental Action Programme - Since the 1970s, environmental action programmes have provided the basis for the development of EU environmental policy. The 6th Environmental Action Programme expired in July 2012. Political agreement on a new General Union Environment Action Programme to 2020 (entitled Living well, within the limits of the planet) was reached between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council in June 2013. The Seventh EAP,7 as proposed by the European Commission in 2012, provides an overarching framework for environmental policy (without any specific climate policy objectives, as this policy is currently a separate policy area) over the next decade, identifying nine priority objectives for the EU and its Member States:  To protect, conserve and enhance the Unions natural capital.   To create a resource-efficient, green and competitive low-carbon economy from the Union.   To safeguard the Unions citizens from environment-related pressures and risks to health and well-being.   To maximise the benefits of Union environment legislation by improving implementation.  To improve the knowledge and evidence base for Union environment policy.  To secure investment for the environment and climate policy and address environmental externalities.  To improve environmental integration and policy coherence.   To enhance the sustainability of the Unions cities.  To increase the Unions effectiveness in addressing international environmental and climate-related challenges. g) EU Circular Economy Action Plan - In December 2015, the European Commission approved the EU Circular Economy Action Plan as a tool to achieve the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and, in particular, Objective No 12 Sustainable consumption and production. This Action Plan focuses on:  Production  Consumption  Waste management  Support for the market in secondary raw materials and water reuse                                                                                                                                                          6 COM(2011) 885/2. 7 Decision No 1386/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 November 2013 on a General Union   The priority areas of the Action Plan include plastics, food waste, key raw materials, construction and demolition waste, biomass and organic products. Policy context at national level a) The Energy Policy of the Slovak Republic The Energy Policy was adopted through Resolution of the Government of the Slovak Republic No 548/2014. The Energy Policy of the Slovak Republic (Energy Policy) is a strategic document defining the primary objectives and priorities of the energy sector for the period to 2035 with an outlook to 2050. The Energy Policy is part of the national economic strategy of the Slovak Republic, because securing sustainable economic growth is conditional on a reliable supply of affordable energy. The aim of the Energy Policy is to ensure the sustainability of the Slovak energy sector to contribute towards the sustainable growth of the national economy and its competitiveness. The priorities from this point of view are to ensure the reliability and stability of the energy supply, efficient use of energy at optimal cost, and to ensure protection for the environment. The Energy Policy signals certain measures to reduce final electricity prices, including the phasing out of electricity tariffs for renewable electricity by 2020, focusing on the use of renewable energy sources for heat, electricity and transport, and on some efficiency-related changes in energy tariffs in connection with cogeneration. b) The National Reform Programme (NRP) The NRP is a national, regularly updated programme with the main objective of meeting the Europe 2020 strategys structural policy objectives. It also contains an Action Plan with sector-specific target policies, including dedicated financial allocations.  c) The Slovak Republic National Strategy for Sustainable Development (NS SD) The National Strategy for Sustainable Development is the cross-sectional document for sustainable development in the Slovak Republic, approved through Resolution of the Government of the SR No 978/2001. It integrates the key strategies and concepts of all the ministries into one resulting document. According to the national strategy, the basic orientation of the SR should be a long-term, targeted and comprehensive focus on the creation of a society founded on the principles of sustainable development and their practical application. To achieve this orientation it is necessary, throughout society, to apply sustainable development principles and criteria and focus on the long-term priorities (integrated targets) of sustainable development in the SR. 28 strategic objectives have been defined as part of this focus on setting long-term priorities, including reducing the use of non-renewable natural sources with the concurrent rational use of renewable sources; reducing the environmental burden; mitigating the impacts of global climate change, ozone depletion and natural catastrophes; and improving the quality of the environment in the regions. d) Strategy for Adaptation of the Slovak Republic to Climate Change  The update was adopted by Resolution of the Government of the Slovak Republic No 478/2018. The main objectives of the updated national adaptation strategy are to improve Slovakias preparedness to face the adverse impacts of climate change; to provide the widest possible information on current adaptation processes in Slovakia; and to establish an institutional framework and coordination mechanism to ensure the effective implementation of adaptation measures at all levels and in all areas to improve general awareness of this issue.

The basic vision of Environmental Strategy 2030 is to achieve a better quality of environment and a sustainable circular economy based on the consistent protection of environmental components using as few non-renewable natural resources and hazardous substances as possible, leading to improvement in population health. For the preparation of this strategy, several studies were carried out, stakeholders were consulted, and the public had an opportunity to influence the strategy content. f) Low-Carbon Development Strategy of the SR until 2030, with a View to 2050 (LCDS SR) The MEnv SR completed a cooperation project with the World Bank in 2019. The main output of the project is a document entitled A Low-Carbon Growth Study for Slovakia : Implementing the EU 2030 Climate and Energy Policy Framework. This study is the principal material for the preparation of the LCDS SR. The LCDS SR will include effective and cost-effective measures in the industry, energy, energy efficiency, transport, agriculture, forestry and waste management sectors. Representatives of the professional and lay public (relevant ministries, departmental organizations, and other interest organizations and institutions) are involved in the LCDS SR preparation process.  g) European Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) The EU ETS was established through Directive 2003/87/EC and has undergone several revisions to strengthen its implementation during its three trading periods (2005-2007, 2008-2012 and currently 2013-2020).  The first phase (2005-2007) was a three-year pilot period to learn from practical situations as preparation for the second phase, when the EU ETS was to work effectively to help ensure that the EU and its Member States meet their emissions targets under the Kyoto Protocol.  Before the start of the first phase, the Slovak Republic had to decide on the numbers of quotas to allocate to each EU ETS operation in its territory. This was done through the first National Allocation  Plan, which the Slovak Republic prepared and published on 1 May 2004. The European Commission Decision on Phase I of the National Allocation Plan of the Slovak Republic was approved on 20 October 2004. Statistics from Phase I of the EU ETS: - 175 facilities; - 38 facilities closed their accounts; - a permit was cancelled for 1 facility.

The Decision of the European Commission on Phase II of the National Allocation Plan of the Slovak Republic was approved on 29 November 2006 and amended by the decision of 7 December 2007. Statistics from Phase II of the EU ETS: - 193 facilities; - 30 facilities closed their accounts; - a permit was cancelled for 1 facility.

It brought in harmonised rules for the free allocation of emission allowances, introduced auctions as the main instrument to meet the emissions reduction target, added other sectors to its scope (inter alia civil aviation and aluminium) and set an annual reduction target of 1.74%. The Slovak Republic notified the Commission of the list of facilities covered by the Directive in its territory on 17 August 2012.  Table 5: Statistics from Phase III of the National Allocation Plan (in tonnes) Year 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Allocation 16 466 336 15 821 315 15 029 434 14 522 533 13 849 714 13 658 304 Verified emissions 21 829 374 20 918 069 21 181 280 21 264 045 22 063 225 22 193 396 Source: Ministry of the Environment of the Slovak Republic  In July 2015, the Commission presented a legislative proposal for reform of the EU ETS for the post-2020 period (i.e. Phase IV). This was followed by several consultations on this proposal, including expert meetings, to discuss the technical aspects of the proposed emission allowance free allocation rules and carbon leakage and independent stakeholder consultations on the newly proposed Innovation Fund.   Final agreement on the legislative proposal was reached in November 2017. The revised Directive was published in the Official Journal of the European Union in March 20188. The main elements for the 2021-2030 period are: continued free allocation, continuation of safeguard measures to prevent carbon leakage, a linear emissions reduction factor at -2.2%, low-carbon support mechanisms (Innovation Fund, Modernisation Fund and exceptions for electricity generators) and a revision clause.   New Entrants Reserve A maximum of 5% of the volume of EU allowances for the 2013 to 2020 period will be reserved for new entrants. The Slovak Republic has so far registered three official requests.   New Entrants Reserve 300 No carbon capture and geological storage project or innovative renewable energy project from the Slovak Republic participated in the first or second call of the New Entrants Reserve 300 initiative.   Auction The auction is a new way of allocating allowances in Phase III. Interim auctioning began in 2012 with an auction of 120 million EUA, of which the Slovak Republics share was 1.8 million EUA. The auctions are held on the European Energy Exchange (EEX) every Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. From 2015 onwards, the entire proceeds of the auction are income for the Environment Fund of the Slovak Republic. The auction share of the Slovak Republic was 14.9 million EUA in 2018.

The main objective is to eliminate the current surplus of emission allowances in the EU ETS and to ensure an increase in carbon prices in the market.  According to Decision (EU) 2015/1814 on the establishment and functioning of a market stabilization reserve (see below), 900 million emission allowances deducted from auction volumes in the 2014-2016 period will not be added to the volumes to be auctioned in 2019 and 2020 but will instead be put in reserve. Directive 2009/29/EC lays down provisions that allow the EU ETS to be linked to other greenhouse gas trading systems, i.e. interconnection with other similar systems set up at regional or national levels outside the EU. Negotiations are ongoing on the interconnection of the EU and Swiss systems.                                                  8 Directive (EU) 2018/410   MSR The Market Stability Reserve (MSR) was introduced as a long-term solution to combat existing quota surpluses within the EU ETS. This is an automated mechanism to reduce the volume of auctioned allowances if there is a significant surplus in the market. If additional allowances are needed, the MSR will be used to increase the auction volume. The MSR will be operational from 2019 and all temporarily withdrawn allowances will become part of this reserve. This will cause a continuous increase in the price of carbon in the EU ETS and a stable investor environment for the next decade. On 15 May 2018, the Commission published the total number of allowances in circulation in 2017, approximately 1.65 billion. In accordance with MSR rules, 264 731 936 emission allowances will be placed in the reserve during the 8 months from January 2019. In accordance with the MSR rules, 397 178 358 emission allowances will be placed in the MSR over a period of 12 months (from 1 September 2019 to 31 August 2020). Further publication will be made in May 2020 to determine the reserve for September 2020 to August 2021. h) Effort Sharing Decision (ESD)9 The ESD sets out the annual greenhouse gas emission targets of the Member States for the 2013-2020 period  these are legally binding and cover only greenhouse gas emissions not covered by the EU ETS, i.e. transport (excluding aviation), buildings, agriculture (excluding LULUCF) and waste. Each Member State must define and implement national policies and measures to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases included in the Effort Sharing Decision. These include promoting public transport, building energy efficiency standards, more efficient farming practices and the conversion of animal waste into biogas. The emission limit values for the Slovak Republic are set at +13% by 2020 compared to 2005 levels.

Table 9: Progress made in meeting the GHG targets under the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) based on projections 2020 Target under ESD (% vs 2005) +13.0% 2015 ESD emissions (% vs 2005) -23.2% 2020 ESD WEM projections (% vs 2005) -23.0% 2020 ESD WAM emissions (% vs 2005) -26.0%  Source: MEnv SR The most important sectors falling under the ESD from the perspective of emissions are transport and domestic heating. Transport and domestic heating are the most-focused-on sectors covered and regulated under the ESD. Total aggregate GHG emissions in transport are at the same level as in the base year of 1990 even though emissions have fallen in other sectors. This is the result of an increase in traffic intensity and the number of kilometres travelled, which cannot be offset by the increased energy efficiency of the vehicles (thanks to European legislation on CO2 standards for cars and light commercial vehicles). Transport currently contributes 16.3% to total GHG emissions (CO2 equivalent) and its share of total emissions has more than doubled since 1990. CO2 emissions have fallen from 184 gCO2/km to the current 133 gCO2/km since 2000, and are expected to drop to 95 gCO2/km for passenger cars by 2020, a fall of about half. The obligation for engine manufacturers to reduce their CO2 emissions means that cumulative GHG and pollutant emissions over the last 15 years have not increased in direct proportion to the increase of 45% in vehicles, but have remained at the same level as in 2000. This indicates that engine manufacturers have improved their operational and environmental efficiency by up to 50%. As the transport sector is one in which reducing greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions is a challenge, attention still needs to be paid to the implementation of effective policies and measures that have real potential to reduce them, including taking their business environment and social impacts into account. The Effort Sharing Decision, effective in stimulating new national policies and measures, has led Member States to become more proactive in considering new measures, as well as leading to better coordination between national, regional and local governments. This positive progress led to a new legislative proposal on an Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) presented by the European Commission in July 2016. The Regulation lays down binding annual targets for greenhouse gas emissions for Member States for the 2021-2030 period, retaining binding annual greenhouse gas emission limit values for each Member State. Emission limit values will be set for each year in the 10-year period to 2030 on a falling linear trajectory. The main changes proposed by the current ESR include the retention of flexible mechanisms under the Effort Sharing Decision and the addition of two new flexibilities. These are:  one-off flexibility to transfer a limited volume of allowances from the EU ETS: this covers some emissions in non-ETS sectors with EU ETS allowances that would normally be traded through auction;   a new flexibility to transfer a limited volume of credits from the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector: to stimulate additional measures in the land use sector. The proposal will allow Member States to use up to 280 million credits throughout the 2021-2030 period from certain land use categories to meet their national targets. j) Biofuel use policy The basic framework for biofuel use was Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC, as well as Directive (EU) 2015/1513 of the European Parliament and of the Council, amending Directive 98/70/EC relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. It has now been replaced by Directive 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (recast). The body responsible for the implementation of the two directives is the Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic. The Ministry of the Environment is responsible for meeting the sustainability criteria for biofuels and bioliquids, for calculations to determine the impact of biofuels and bioliquids on greenhouse gas emission volumes, and for calculating greenhouse gas emissions during the life cycle of fossil fuels under Art. 7a of Directive 2009/30/EC and Council Directive (EU) 2015/652 of 20 April 2015 laying down calculation methods and reporting requirements under Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels.  In relation to sustainability criteria, the Slovak Republic has implemented Articles 17, 18 and 19 of Directive 2009/28/EC and the essentially similar Articles 7b, 7c and 7d of Directive 2009/30/EC, Art. 7a of Directive 2009/30/EC, Directive 2015/652 and the relevant Articles of Directive 2015/1513 through Act No 309/2009, on the promotion of renewable energy sources and high-efficiency cogeneration, as amended, and Decree of the Ministry of the Environment of the Slovak Republic No 271/2011, laying down sustainability criteria and targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from fuels, as amended. This law deals, inter alia, with the core roles and responsibilities of the competent authorities and economic operators in a context that demonstrates the meeting of sustainability criteria for biofuels and bioliquids, which are the preconditions for meeting the national greenhouse gas reduction target as well as targets for renewable energy sources. Decree of the Ministry of the Environment of the Slovak Republic No 271/2011, as amended, in force since 2011, establishes a national system for demonstrating compliance with the sustainability criteria for biofuels and bioliquids. Voluntary schemes have been established to assess compliance with sustainability criteria throughout the biofuel and bioliquids production chain. These schemes are subject to approval by the European Commission and are therefore not subject to national approval and national control, and each Member State must accept the results of these schemes without reservation. Decree of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development No 295/2011, determining a detailed declaration by the producer and supplier of biomass for the production of biofuels or bioliquids, has  been in force since October 2011. Since 2011, the Slovak Republic has been operating a national system for demonstrating compliance with the sustainability criteria for biofuels and bioliquids. This system is based on independent verifiers whose training is organised and who are subject to mandatory examination and registration by the Ministry of the Environment of the Slovak Republic k) Taxation of energy products and electricity The tax on mineral oils is the most important tax in terms of tax revenue creation. The revenue from electricity, coal and natural gas is relatively low. The Slovak Republic generates relatively low revenue from environmental taxes (Figure 2) and the implicit tax rate (Figure 3) on energy is low. There is considerable scope for environmental tax reforms. Heating and energy use in industrial processes make up the highest share of total energy use and CO2 emissions in the Slovak Republic. As a result, a more harmonised tax regime in these areas would increase tax revenues and provide incentives to reduce CO2 emissions. This could be achieved by raising taxes on all fuels used for heating and manufacturing at a standard rate per unit of energy for natural gas. Unit-linked consumption taxes could also be indexed for inflation to avoid a decline in environmental tax revenues in real terms over time. We might also consider abolishing the tax differential between petrol and diesel. A gradual increase in diesel taxes could also be used to reduce the direct tax burden, although there may be limited scope for such an increase in the short term without similar increases in rates in neighbouring countries to avoid fuel tourism. Support for electricity generation from coal and lignite will be abolished in accordance with the Action Plan for the Transformation of the Upper Nitra Coal Region approved by the Slovak Government on 3 July 2019. The potential for increasing electricity consumption taxation could be analysed, together with the full application of the Directive  meaning the application of a preferential tax rate on electricity used for industrial and energy purposes. The reduced household income could be compensated by the government using targeted tax or support measures.

Its main objective is to reduce the adverse impacts of air pollution on health, including reducing the annual number of premature deaths from air pollution by over half. This revised Directive contains the national emission reduction commitments for each Member State for the period to 2030 (with interim targets set for the period to 2025) for five specific pollutants: NOx, SO2, NMVOC, NH3, and PM2.5. The NEC Directive is transposed into national legislation in Act No 137/2010, on air protection. 2) Analysis of interactions with policy in air quality and air emissions In connection with the adoption of Directive (EU) 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants, amending Directive 2003/35/EC and repealing Directive 2001/81/EC, the Slovak Republic is intensively working on the preparation of the National Emissions Reduction Programme - which is currently at the end of the Strategic Environmental Assessment process - and the top-level document on air protection, the comprehensive Air Protection Strategy of the Slovak Republic to 2030, which will include, in addition to the emissions reduction programme, an Air Quality Improvement Strategy. Integration with other policies is a key aspect in terms of promoting air protection objectives. Many air protection measures cannot be implemented alone, without coordination with the affected sectors while, at the same time, many targets and tools of other policies have great potential to contribute towards meeting air protection targets. Coordination and cooperation are essential to ensure the affected policies are consistent with air protection targets (in particular air quality requirements) and to maximise synergy effects. In accordance with the above, the relevant sectoral plans and programmes were taken into account during the preparation of the National Emission Reduction Programme and the selection of measures to ensure the achievement of reduction commitments, in particular in the fields of climate change and energy, transport, industry and agriculture. Integration and synergies are also essential for the NECP and all the named contact points are important for all the areas concerned. 020406080100120TOE*  The climate change and energy policy are among the main areas where potential to achieve synergies in achieving common objectives can be identified. The tools and measures for achieving the targets of the indicated policies provide significant space for the integration of air protection requirements, yet also include potentially risky areas such as contradictory targets (e.g. in the promotion of biomass as a renewable energy source), and so communication and coordination are particularly important in this area. The described Low-Carbon Study analyses and describes a reference scenario as well as four possible scenarios for reducing emissions to 2050. In the reference scenario prepared based on current policies, the share of natural gas in cogeneration significantly increases, both before and after 2030. In the reference scenario, electricity sector investments focus on combined heat and power (CHP) and solar energy. CHP primarily uses natural gas as fuel. This also applies for four decarbonising scenarios before 2030, however the gas is subsequently replaced with biomass, wind and solar energy. Nuclear power will dominate electricity generation until 2050. Almost all the proposed measures, apart from the increase in biomass combustion, will also provide synergy effects in air quality. Specific figures will be provided through modelling, which is currently under way in cooperation with the World Bank, including the same scenarios. The strategy of the Slovak Republics adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change, as acknowledged in the EC opinion, also defines measures that can contribute towards improving air quality, in particular measures to preserve biodiversity and strengthen ecosystem services related, inter alia, to maintaining good air quality. These measures have not yet been quantified in terms of air protection. The main framework document in the energy sector of the SR is the Energy Policy of the Slovak Republic (EP SR). The EP SR defines a competitive low-carbon energy sector ensuring the secure, reliable and efficient supply of all forms of energy at affordable prices, taking consumer protection and sustainable development into account. Among other things, it defines objectives for transport, which it identifies as a serious future problem also in terms of air pollution, especially in view of the increasing trend of final energy consumption by motor transport. The energy policy objectives in transport relate to the greening of transport through the introduction of green fuels, strengthening the position of public transport, achieving a share of at least 10% RES in fuel consumption in transport, and applying the polluter pays principle. The measures consist in promoting the development and wider use of public transport, in particular rail, promoting the use of green fuels, biofuels, CNG, LPG, electromobility, and non-motorized transport (cycling). The EP SR also defines instruments to promote the use of CNG in transport, which include reducing the tax burden on this fuel or tax credits for means of transport using this fuel (road tax), and the creation of compulsory quotas for the number of CNG vehicles for government and public administration operating locally (waste collection, state and municipal police, customs, etc.). The adoption of measures to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions could significantly complement existing and planned air quality measures, thus achieving a significant reduction in air pollution. On 3 July 2019, the Slovak Government adopted Resolution No 336/2019 on the Action Plan for the Transformation of the Upper Nitra Coal Region. The submitted material proposes solutions to the situation related to the reduction in the general economic interest in electricity generation in the Nováky power plant and the subsequent fall in coal  mining due to the planned reduction in mining activity, and the impact on employment in the Upper Nitra region. The material also seeks to prevent a decline in the region and to address its development through a conceptual approach to structural change in the function of the economy and its associated impacts, similar to how the reduction in coal mining was - and is - addressed in developed countries in the context of European Union social cohesion, regional development and economic growth policies. With regard to the transformation of the Upper Nitra region and maintaining the continuity of heat supply in this region, it is appropriate to use the existing heat and electricity generation infrastructure in accordance with the Action Plan for the Transformation of Upper Nitra with a minimal impact on the environment, price competitiveness, and long-term sustainable growth in the region. Incentives for research and development The objective of providing R&D incentives is to support the growth of research and development in the business sector in Slovakia, to support increased cooperation with the academic sector (universities, SAS organisations), and to support the growth of research and development cooperation between business sectors in the Slovak Republic and in the EU, with the aim of increasing the competitiveness of the Slovak business sector in international markets by enhancing product quality and applying all kinds of innovation in manufacturing and other business processes.  R&D incentives also encourage close cooperation between enterprises and the academic sector, thus qualitatively increasing the leading-edge nature and excellence of the R&D. In this context, R&D incentives are perceived as promoting and developing the best outcomes of systematic creative work, raising awareness and creating new applications.  This will create conditions for the creation of new jobs for highly qualified employees, thus supporting development of the research base, improvements in the education system, and the development of cooperation between academic workplaces and the business sector.  One important aspect of providing incentives for research and development is the expansion of existing research and development workplaces, or the creation of new workplaces in enterprises, thus creating new jobs for highly qualified R&D staff. Under the terms of the incentives, these workplaces and related jobs must remain active for at least 5 years after the end of the incentives. Another important aspect is that incentive beneficiaries are obliged to invest their own funds in research and development at a stipulated level and for at least the monitored five-year control period after the end of the incentives. In 2018, the Government of the Slovak Republic adopted the Economic Policy Strategy of the Slovak Republic to 2030, which defines the measure O 2.10 Increase in R&D expenditures so that the Slovak Republic gradually catches the top five EU countries in terms of the share of R&D expenditure in GDP by 2030. In the past, R&D incentives were provided to address projects in the field of materials and energy  Development of a Technological Complex for Processing Municipal Waste for Material and Energy Purposes - and in nuclear energy, namely nuclear decommissioning  Conditional Release of Materials from Nuclear Decommissioning. In the upcoming period, the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic will focus, through research and development incentives, on promoting the following fields: research and development into highly efficient energy sources and technologies for transport  systems using Industry 4.0 principles; and research and development into biodegradable plastics, including composite materials, using renewable energy sources for the automotive industry.  The EURATOM (European Atomic Energy Community) Treaty was created to set up a European Atomic Energy Community that, among other things, helps coordinate Member States research programmes into the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It is currently one of the frameworks for sharing knowledge and infrastructure, and for nuclear energy financing. It ensures the security of nuclear power supplies through a centralized monitoring system. Since another main objective is to bring together the nuclear industries of the Member States, its competence includes those entities (Member States, public and private institutions, enterprises and natural persons) that carry out their business or part thereof in one of the areas the treaty regulates, and hence the special fissile materials, raw materials and the ores from which these raw materials are obtained. The powers granted by the EURATOM Treaty exclusively relate to civilian and peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  Specific EURATOM missions include: - promoting research and ensuring the dissemination of technical knowledge, - developing and ensuring the use of uniform safety standards to protect workers and the general public, - simplifying access to investment and ensuring the construction of the basic facilities necessary for the development of nuclear energy in the EU, - overseeing regularity and uniformity in the supply of ores and nuclear fuels to users in the EU, - guaranteeing that nuclear material is not misused, in particular for military purposes, - exercising title to the specific fissile materials assigned to it, - contributing towards progress in the peaceful use of nuclear energy in cooperation with third countries and international organisations, - establishment of joint ventures.  Euratom is a complementary research programme for nuclear research and training under the Horizon 2020 programme. Its role is to contribute, in a safe and efficient manner, to the long-term plan for decarbonising the energy system. As such, it reinforces three important Horizon 2020 priorities: scientific excellence, industrial leadership and changes in society.  Two areas form the core of EURATOM - nuclear fission and radiation protection, - the development of magnetic nuclear fusion as an energy source  iii. Key issues of cross-border relevance The Slovak Republic is highly dependent on imports of primary energy resources. It is therefore necessary to reduce its high dependence on fossil fuel imports through systematic measures in energy efficiency and RES that meet sustainability criteria. The location of the Slovak Republic in Central Europe means that the diversification of transport routes is more than usually important. Facilities enabling reverse gas flow from the Czech Republic and Austria were put into operation following the natural gas supply problems of 2009. A north-south connection between Poland and Slovakia is currently being built. In the electricity sector, the connection with Hungary is being strengthened and an intelligent connection with the Czech Republic (ACON) is being built.  The national intentions and targets for securing primary energy sources and diversifying transport routes are detailed in Article 2.3. Dimension: energy security. iv. Administrative structure for implementing national energy and climate policies The Ministry of Economy of the SR is primarily responsible for the energy sector, and the Ministry of the Environment of the SR is primarily responsible for atmospheric protection and climate change. The SR has a systematised mechanism for the management, planning, monitoring and evaluation of energy efficiency, arising from the requirements of European and national strategic documents and legislation. The Ministry of Economy of the SR is the general coordinator of the energy efficiency agenda, primarily focusing on energy savings in all sectors of the economy, and has an interdepartmental working group for this purpose involving all relevant central state administration bodies. The Ministry of Economy assesses the compliance of an application for a certificate to construct an energy facility with the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan, which replaces the Energy Policy within the meaning of Section 88 of Act No 251/2012, on energy and on amendments to certain other acts, as amended. The plan can only be assessed after the submission of an application containing all the stipulated particulars within the meaning of the Energy Act. The ME SR will assess whether the application is in line with EP priorities. If the application complies with the statutory requirements and is in accordance with the above priorities, the ME SR will issue a certificate of compliance of the investment plan with the Energy Policy of the SR. The Ministry of the Environment of the Slovak Republic (MEnv SR) is responsible for the development of the national environmental policy and the creation of the national climate policy. The preparation and subsequent coordination of the implementation of all strategic and legislative proposals in the specific sectoral policies of other ministries also falls within the competence of the MEnv SR.  The main units dealing with climate change at the MEnv SR are the Climate Change Policy Department and the Emission Trading Department, which come under the Directorate for Climate Change and Air Protection.  Based on Government Resolution No 821/2011, the Climate and Energy Package Commission was replaced at state secretary level by the Climate Coordination Policy Commission (the Commission).  The Commission was set up on 15 January 2012 at state secretary level and is chaired by the State Secretary of the Slovak Ministry of the Environment. Other members are the state secretaries of the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Ministry of Transport and Construction, the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, and the Chairman of the Network Regulatory Office.  The Commissions main objectives are effective coordination in the development and implementation of mitigation and adaptation policies and the selection of appropriate measures to meet international commitments. The Commission plays the major role in inter-ministerial decision-making.  There are two special working groups under the Commission: one focusing on the preparation of the Adaptation Strategy of the Slovak Republic for the Adverse Effects of Climate Change, while the second is responsible for the Slovak Republics Low-Carbon Strategy.  1.3. Consultations and involvement of national and Union entities and their outcome i. Involvement of the national parliament  The relevant committees of the National Council of the SR (NC SR) have been working with the draft Clean Energy for All Europeans package since its publication. The regular preliminary opinion of the Slovak Republic on the draft regulation on the management of the energy union was the subject of an interdepartmental commentary procedure in May 2017, and was then discussed by the National Council Committee on Economic Affairs (6 June 2017) and the National Council Committee on European Affairs (15 June 2017). Representatives of the Slovak Republic actively participated in the discussion of the draft regulation on the management of the energy union within EU units - as part of the Councils energy working group as well as within the Technical Working Group on National Energy and Climate Plans at the Commission. All interested state administration bodies were kept up to date on the progress and results of these negotiations. ii. Involvement of local and regional authorities  Local and regional authorities have the option to participate in the development of strategy papers in accordance with the procedures outlined in section 1.3. iii.).  For regional projects, involvement of regional and local authorities is usual in the preparatory phase. For example, the Upper Nitra Development Action Plan, for one of the three pilot regions of the new Platform for Coal-Mining Regions in Transformation launched by the European Commission, was approved by the Slovak Government in July 2019. It was prepared by the Office of the Deputy Prime self-governing region, the Association of Towns and Municipalities of Upper Nitra and interested parties from the region concerned. iii. Consultations of stakeholders, including the social partners, and engagement of civil society and the general public In accordance with the rules for the preparation of materials for meetings of the Slovak Government, preparation includes discussions with all ministries and stakeholders as well as with the public. Within the standardised process for material submitted for discussion by the Government, an intra-departmental commentary procedure is then followed by an inter-ministerial commentary procedure (MPK). The material is published in the MPK via the publicly accessible website Slov-Lex, operated by the Slovak Ministry of Justice. On the website one may familiarise oneself with the proposed documents and, via an electronic form, comments may be raised on the submitted material not only by representatives of state and public authorities but also by natural persons or legal entities from the public. After a specified publication period (at least 15 days, for materials of a non-legislative nature this may be shortened to 5 days), the submitter of the material must evaluate the comments made and, if necessary, incorporate them. If the material submitted relates to an activity for which a government advisory body has been established, it must be assessed in that advisory body prior to submission for discussion by the Government. Accepted comments of the government advisory body are incorporated by the submitter into the material; any failure to accept comments must be justified. Under the current legislation, the approval of strategic materials is also subject to an evaluation process under Act No 24/2006, on environmental impact assessment and on changes and additions to certain acts. If a strategic environmental assessment is required, the material is submitted for  Government discussion only after the public discussion of the strategic document and the Report on the Evaluation of the Strategic Document and the preparation of the final opinion from the evaluation of the strategic document. This procedure was used by the Slovak Government to discuss the documents mentioned in Chapter 1.2.ii.) As part of the process of assessing the draft Energy Union Regulation, NECP content and preparation issues were also consulted with other ministries, and an inter-ministerial working group was set up which, in addition to reviewing the draft Regulation, mapped out the data sources needed to prepare the NECP across various ministries. During discussion on the content of the Regulation on the Management of the Energy Union, the Slovak Ministry of Economy cooperated with the major companies and professional associations in the energy sector. Inputs from some experts from these companies and associations have also been used in the discussions on the final version of the Regulation and hence on the content of the Integrated National Plan for Energy and Climate. Organisations dealing with the production, transmission and supply of electricity, petroleum products, distribution companies, heat supply companies and employers associations were addressed. iv. Consultation with other Member States  The assessment of cross-border impacts is also included in the assessment process under Act No 24/2006 (the Act on Environmental Impact Assessment and on changes and additions to certain other acts). All cross-border connections are implemented in accordance with conventions with the relevant neighbouring Member States, international connections are on the current list of PCI projects. v. Iterative process with the Commission  Several consultations with relevant EU bodies were conducted during the preparation of the national energy and climate plan. Representatives of the Slovak Republic participated in the discussions of the Energy Working Group in preparation of the text of the Regulation on the Management of the Energy Union and in the discussions of the technical group for the preparation of the NECP, where aspects of the preparation process for the plans were discussed. Issues related to the preparation of NECPs were also the subject of bilateral and multilateral talks with EC representatives at various levels during their visits to Slovakia, respectively during meetings as part of international energy and climate conferences. At meetings in Brussels (at the Energy Council working group from February 2017, in the technical group for the preparation of the NECP at the EC from April 2017, and via teleconferencing in July 2019), there was consultation with DG ENER regarding recommendations from the EC on the working version of the NECP, especially with regard to the ambitions of the SR in RES and energy efficiency. 1.4. Regional cooperation in preparing the plan i. Elements subject to joint or coordinated planning with other Member States On 20 November 2018, a joint meeting of experts from the V4 countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) and Austria was held in Bratislava, where aspects of the preparation of NECPs in individual countries, as well as their basic objectives, policies on renewable energy, climate protection, energy efficiency, the internal market and the security of energy supply were discussed.  As part of regional cooperation, representatives of the Slovak Republic participated in the presentation of the German NECP in Berlin in April 2019 and, together with the hosting Austria, the Czech Republic and Germany, in the presentation of the content of the NECPs of the participating countries in Vienna in June 2019. In August 2019 the SR commented on the draft Polish NECP and in October 2019 responded to a call for comments on the Czech Republics draft NECP. ii. Explanation of how regional cooperation is considered in the plan Since the draft plan is based on previously approved materials that have been consulted in the preparation process, it reflects the requirements and opinions of the countries concerned.
