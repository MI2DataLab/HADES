3.5 DIMENSION RESEARCH, INNOVATION AND COMPETITIVENESS  Policies and measures related to the elements set out in 2.5 Under the Governance Regulation, Member States are required to set out national objectives and funding targets under the Research and Innovation Dimension for the upcoming ten-year period. 2020 by the Malta Council for Science and Technology (MCST), the official government body responsible for national R&I. This Strategy is set to retain the Smart Specialisation approach at its core,68 in which thematic areas for future R&I investment are determined through a bottom-up approach after consultations with stakeholders who define R&I priority areas according to their ; this is defined as the Entrepreneurial Discovery Process (EDP). The adoption of the Smart Specialisation approach and its continuation post-2020 is a conditionality for Member States to access the R&I portion of European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). As the bottom-up consultations of the EDP are still ongoing, the inclusion or otherwise of energy and low-Strategy for R&I was unclear during the time of development of the NECP.  In light of the above it was determined and agreed between the Parliamentary Secretariat for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation and the Ministry for Energy and Water Management that a sector-specific strategy for R&I in energy and water will be developed by the Energy and Water Agency to take full advantage of the value-added and cross-cutting benefits of such targeted approach. The development of the National Strategy for Research and Innovation in Energy and Water (2021-2030) was thus concurrent with the finalisation of the NECP, enabling alignment between research objectives and national policy, and allowing for exploitation of synergies between the two policy documents. The beginning of 2019 saw the start of engagement with experts, academia, and public and private institutions, as well as the preliminary collection of data for an initial stock-taking exercise on the current level of R&I in energy and water. It is planned that this Strategy document will be                                                            67 Anti-poverty and social exclusion centres.  68   The Smart Specialisation Strategy.  108  published for public consultation before the NECP is submitted, with a view to its finalisation and the start of its implementation in early 2020.  To achieve the objectives set out in the Draft National Strategy for R&I in Energy and Water, the draft document proposes the establishment of Platform-RINEW (Research and INnovation in Energy and Water). This is envisaged to be the primary tool to coordinate the implementation of the National Strategy for R&I in Energy and Water, and thus to achieve the high-level objectives outlined in Section 2.5.(i). Platform-RINEW will bring together government, academia, industry and the commercial sector within a structure that will enable multi-level coordination and cooperation, as well as streamline and effectively allocate resources for R&I in energy and water. The frequent exchange of information between these different bodies of actors is also considered to be imperative in ensuring the effectiveness of support measures and maintain the momentum of R&I at each stage, from defining support schemes to conducting R&I activities and the integration of successful outcomes within government and businesses alike. It is envisaged that national financing measures specific to the fields of energy and low-carbon technologies (as well as water) will be developed and issued by Platform-RINEW. These are outlined in Section 3.5.(iii).    [If applicable] Cooperation with other Member States in this area So far, no coordination or cooperation with other Member States was carried out during the development of the National Strategy for R&I in Energy and Water 2021-2030. This does not exclude the possibility of future collaboration with other Member States during the upcoming decade on the development of policies and measures to support R&I in energy and low-carbon technologies, particularly under Platform-RINEW. In terms of cooperation with other Member States on R&I projects, it is possible that the establishment of a specific fund to support R&I in energy and low-carbon technologies (and water) may, indirectly, have a positive impact on the participation of Maltese researchers in international projects. National financing may facilitate the retention of experienced members of research teams, increasing the domestic capacity and resources to apply for international projects. International collaboration, particularly with other EU Member States, has the potential to unlock additional innovation capacity through leveraging greater pools of funding and talent and providing an avenue for international best-practice sharing. Furthermore, support disbursed through national funding could act as an essential springboard for research teams to apply for the larger volumes of support required at higher TRL levels which are available through collaborative projects with other Member States.    109    [If applicable] Financing measures in this area at national level, including EU support and use of EU funds The current support framework (2014-2020) for domestic R&I, both at the national and EU level, appears to be largely geared towards experimental development69 and commercialisation, with limitted funding available for research at lower TRLs70. At the time of drafting of the National Strategy for R&I in Energy and Water, there was minimal visibility of the upcoming R&I landscape at the er development. Whilst direct EU funds such as those under Horizon Europe are expected to play an important part in funding future R&I in Malta, access to and use of European Structural and Investment Funds, is entirely dependent on the inclusion of this fR&I for the post-2020 period. This is an essential consideration given that EU funds represent the most significant resource for R&I undertaken in Malta.   In view of existing and upcoming EU-level instruments supporting R&I at the higher TRLs, such as the European Innovation Council and the Innovation Fund, the draft National Strategy for R&I in Energy and Water (2021-2030) foresees the prioritisation of financial support for R&I from fundamental research to experimental design (TRL 2-6). In this manner, this Strategy seeks to avoid overlap of resources and instead address existing gaps in the R&I support landscape. The limited support available for research at these levels has been emphasised by local stakeholders and noted by the JRC Policy Support Facility (2019). It is planned71 that a national fund specifically to support R&I in the fields of energy and water will be established, envisaged to function through two distinct mechanisms (similar to the set-up of Horizon 202072): 1. Calls for bottom-up proposals relating to the Priority Areas outlined in the Strategy; and  2. Calls for proposals to structured research questions which relate to the Priority Areas.  EUR 500,000 was allocated to the implementation of the National Strategy for R&I in Energy and                                                                  69 Experimental development is defined, in line with the definition used by the NSO, as systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience and producing additional knowledge, which is directed to producing new products or processes or to improving existing products or processes. 70 Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) is a method for estimating the maturity of technologies based on a scale from 1 to 9, that is, from basic scientific research to actual application of the technology. 71 At this draft, pre-consultation phase of the National Strategy for R&I in Energy and Water.  72 This is one of the proposals received from academics during consultation sessions.
