 1.  REVIEW AND DRAWING-UP PROCESS OF THE PLAN 1.1. Summary i. Political, economic, environmental, and social context of the plan The main objective of the new Energy Strategy and the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) is to strengthen energy sovereignty and energy security, to maintain the results of reduced overhead costs, and to achieve the decarbonisation of energy production, which is possible only through the combined use of nuclear energy and renewable energy. For countries with scarce conventional energy sources, such as Hungary, energy sovereignty is a question of welfare, economy and national security.  It is clearly in the interest of Hungary to reduce its demand for energy imports and to simultaneously ensure its connection to the regional electricity grids and natural gas networks, which guarantees the security of supply and effective import competition. The cleanest sources of energy are unused fossil fuels. The reduction of the use of fossil fuels may be achieved through the use of heating/cooling solutions based on renewable resources, implementation of the Green District Heating Programme, and the reduction of energy consumption in public institutions, industry and transport. Owing to the high useful efficiency of electric motors, the spread of electromobility clearly leads to energy savings for final customers. With the implementation of the Green Bus Programme  aimed at greening local transport  environmentally friendly electric buses will be used in larger cities. The energy independence of families can be facilitated by supporting household-scale energy production for private purposes and the spread of smart meters. The Government aims to ensure that most of the power generated in Hungary originates from two sources: nuclear energy and renewable energy  the latter produced mainly by solar power stations. These technologies do not replace or exclude each other, but are mutually supportive, and both are considered to be clean sources of energy. Carbon neutral nuclear energy provides roughly half of power generation in Hungary. This ratio can be maintained in the long term with the Paks2 investment. Carbon neutral energy production is inconceivable and unfeasible without nuclear energy. The Government of Hungary is committed to protecting our natural heritage and the natural environment of the way of life that we, Hungarians, jointly created in Hungary. Therefore the Government believes it is important to protect the world and the environment, and to provide protection against the adverse effects of climate change.  The Government needs to pursue realistic and responsible climate protection policies. Firstly, it needs to be realistic in assessing global political trends, the expected results of feasible measures afforded by current technologies and their cost. -climate of the Carpathian Basin renders the country particularly exposed to the undesirable effects of climate change compared to other European countries, although on a global scale the consequences of warming are expected to be less severe than in countries of mainly developing regions, thus Hungary will not become a source of climate migration, but be a safe target country. Thus, climate change and international migration are correlated issues that are inseparable. When the Government addresses climate policy it also safeguards the sovereignty of Hungary, ensures the livelihood of the nation and families, and the preservation of Christian culture. The European Union expects Member States to operate overall climate neutral economies by 2050. Hungary would need approximately HUF 50 000 billion to implement carbon neutral power generation, fully phase out the use of natural gas and to fully electrify transport. The Government of Hungary holds the view that Hungary can meet this target, but not without substantial financial contribution from the European Union. Hungary assigns a priority to the enforcement of the polluter pays principle: the cost of decarbonisation should mainly be borne by countries and companies mostly held responsible for the current situation. Hungary can make specific commitments only after careful consideration of the means and costs. The Government of Hungary is therefore adopting a realistic and feasible strategy. Economic growth and the objectives of climate protection are not incompatible. Hungary is among 21 countries in the world where since 1990 the GDP increased with a 32 % decline in carbon dioxide emissions and a 15 % drop in energy consumption. Thus, Hungary is not only ranked high in Europe in terms of economic growth, surpassing the average rate of GDP growth in the euro zone by 2-3 percentage points, but also leads by example in relation to climate protection. To secure our future, protect the world and our environmental heritage, the realistic and responsible policies should be pursued further, ensuring energy sovereignty and energy security, maintaining the results of reduced overhead costs, with the clear understanding that the carbon neutral economy can only be established with nuclear energy. on to setting out several new regulatory proposals concerning climate and energy policy, called on Member States to draw up National Energy and Climate Plans (NECP) based on a single methodology, with uniform content. In the opinion of the Commission, the NECP may rely on the climate and energy strategies, and action plans of Member States in effect, if these are compatible with the EU climate and energy policy objectives to be met by 2030, and with  greenhouse gas emission reduction obligations arising from the Paris Agreement. In the course of drawing up the NECP, Hungary conducted wide-ranging professional, CSO and social consultations to ensure that the plan is implemented with public support. Integrated planning spans the dimension of decarbonisation, energy efficiency, energy security, the internal energy market, research, innovation and competitiveness. In the course of drawing up the NECP, Hungary has taken into account current national plans, measures and policies. The drawing up of the NECP is closely related to the contents and development process of the new National Energy Strategy, which is drawn up concurrently with the NECP. The plan is also in harmony with policy measures set out in the Second National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS 2), adopted by Parliament in the autumn of 2018, and in the related First Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP), and with the National Development and Spatial Development Concept defining the development and spatial development objectives of Hungary up to 2030. As regards the plan, to ensure fulfilment of the objectives of the Energy Union and compliance with the Paris Agreement, the Government of Hungary has authorised the Ministry of Innovation and Technology s and vision, requiring political decision-making, determining the future of the energy sector and of other sectors involved in decarbonisation; to determine national objectives and Hungarian commitments relating to energy and climate change, with particular regard to reducing emissions, energy efficiency and increasing the share of renewable energy. ii. Strategy relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union The main objectives of the Hungarian National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) are summarised below, grouped according to the dimensions of decarbonisation, energy efficiency, security of supply, internal market and innovation-competitiveness. The quantified objectives are supported by results of the Hungarian TIMES model, specifically developed for drawing up the NECP, which also lay the groundwork for selecting the most cost-effective policy instruments serving fulfilment of the objectives. Dimension of decarbonisation GHG emissions and removals2 The EU climate and energy framework approved by the European Council in October 2014 provides for a minimum 40 % GHG emissions reduction at EU level by 2030, compared to the figure for 1990. Hungary aims to reduce GHG emissions by at least 40 % by 2030 over the year 1990, i.e. in 2030 gross emissions may not exceed gross 56.19 million t CO2eq, thus the value for 2017 should be reduced by 7.6 million t CO2eq.                                                       2 Consistency to be ensured with long-term strategies under Article 15.  Decarbonisation of lignite based energy production One of the key decarbonisation tasks is the conversion of the lignite-fired Mátra Power Plant based on low carbon technologies, thereby the phasing out of coal and lignite from national power generation by 2030. The Mátra Power Plant is a strategic general power plant of the national electricity system, but is also the largest CO2 emitter in Hungary, accounting for approximately 50 % of CO2 emissions in the entire energy production sector and 14 % of total national GHG emissions. The reorganisation of the Mátra Power Plant, however, goes beyond technological aspects of the power plant, as it should also take into account the social-economic and decarbonisation transition is composed of the following elements: Reorganisation of lignite based power generation at the Mátra Power Plant based on low carbon technologies, benefiting from the characteristics of the site. Construction of a new gas turbine power plant at the site of the Mátra Power Plant, with particular relevance for ensuring the security of supply in the eastern area of the country; construction of a new PV power plant and industrial energy storage unit, and the energy recovery of refuse derived fuel (RDF). The site of the Mátra Power Plant and/or the North Hungarian region in which it is located offers a good opportunity for implementing low carbon intensity energy production and energy storage projects that could provide relief for other territories. - The Mátra Power Plant had a substantial social-economic impact within the immediate region, including the creation and retention of jobs, the indirect creation of jobs by related undertakings, and local tax revenues. Based on the above, in the course of revitalisation particular attention should be -added chain. - Most of the 100 000 households supplied with household lignite based heating are located in the region of the Mátra Power Plant. In the course of revitalisation and the transition we aim to replace household heating energy with clean energy and to reduce energy consumption. Similarly to the whole of Hungary, in the Mápanel systems to partially supply local electricity consumption. - The large site of the Mátra Power Plant may also be suitable for multi-purpose utilisation going beyond energy functionalities. Such use includes industrial park expansion and diversification opportunities, the expansion of agricultural or other storage and logistics functions, conservation and presentation of the cultural heritage of mining, habitat reconstruction serving tourism and nature conservation purposes, and natural water conservation measures. The Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) was adopted in May 2018. It sets national emission reduction targets for Member States for the 20212030 period, relative to the base year of 2005. Pursuant to the Regulation,  Hungary's reduction target is 7 % between 2021 and 2030, i.e. during the ESR period. GHG emissions may be reduced by decreasing the quantity of consumed energy, more efficient energy consumption, increasing the use of renewable energy sources and by maintaining nuclear capacities. Two new nuclear power plant units will be built in Hungary by 2030, each with a capacity of 1 200 MW (Paks2). As a result the share of carbon-free power generation in Hungary could further increase. In terms of both climate protection and local air quality, it is important to substitute predominantly fossil fuel based retail heating with clean energy to the extent possible. We are planning a transport greening programme. The reduction of agricultural emissions is primarily served by the prescription of correct agricultural practices and various aid schemes. The currently prepared new waste management strategy will define waste management targets and measures for the post-2020 period. To increase our CO2 sink capacities we will significantly increase the share of areas covered by forest and other tree stock consistently with the National Forest Strategy. In addition a key project serving the creation of an energy and climate literate society will also serve fulfilment of the above objectives. Renewable energy Hungary plans to increase the share of renewable energy sources to at least 21 % within gross final energy consumption. Within the heating and cooling sector the share of renewable energy  with additional measures  may approximate 30 % in 2030. The efficient use of biomass in both individual heating equipment and in district heating, and options for using ambient heat through heat pumps have great potential. Implementation of the Green District Heating Programme plays a key role in the replacement of natural gas, the increase of using renewable energy sources on the heat market, and the supply of as many individually heated buildings as possible with renewable energy sources. Hungary has set the target of a minimum 14 % share of renewable energy in transport by 2030. To meet this target Hungary will increase the share of first generation biofuels produced from food crops and fodder plants to roughly 7 %, and the share of second generation (or advanced) biofuels produced from waste and biogas to 3.5 % in the final energy consumption of transport.3 The remaining share of the target will be met through the significant increase of electricity in transport. Hungary plans to increase the share of renewable resources within gross final electricity consumption to at least 20 % by 2030. which will increase from just under 680 MW in 2016 to ~6 500 MW by 2030. In 2030 wind power station                                                       3 The shares should be interpreted in consideration of the multipliers used in the Renewable Energy Directive.  capacities will approximate the current level (~330 MW). In addition to maintaining existing hydroelectric power plants, the increase of small-scale hydroelectric power plant capacities is justified. The transformation of the electricity sector requires the promotion of using innovative and smart solutions ensuring greater flexibility, which generates substantial market organisation, distribution and transmission network development, human capacity and competence development, and regulatory tasks. Implementation of the above should be preceded by a further major increase in the system integration of weather-dependent renewable energy producers to ensure the sustainability of system security and cost control. To this end, after the system integration of the 2 000 MW PV capacity, it is necessary to examine the funds and time frame of financial and infrastructure conditions of additional growth on a realistic basis. The new Hungarian aid scheme for incentivising electricity generated from renewable energy sources (REAS) was launched in January 2017. The first REAS tender was launched on 2 September 2019. To ensure cost-effective levels of aid, in the future aid within the REAS framework will only be available through technology-neutral renewable capacity tenders; production aid will be available within the conventional feed-in system only for experimental technologies and model projects. We also plan to install power generating PV panel systems to partially supply own electricity consumption. We aim to have at least 200 000 households with roof-mounted PV panels with an average capacity of 4 kW by 2030. Dimension of energy efficiency Hungary's energy efficiency target is to ensure that the country's final energy consumption does not exceed the value of 2005 in 2030 (785 PJ), either. If final energy consumption exceeds the level for 2005, such increase should exclusively derive from carbon neutral energy resources. The reduction of energy consumption is obviously a priority, but energy consumption in either the industry or in transport should not be limited to this end in case of economic growth. We aim to ensure that GDP growth exceeds the rate of the increase in energy consumption at a growing rate. We are planning the introduction of an obligation scheme ensuring the cost-effective fulfilment of energy efficiency targets, which may drive investment to areas with the highest energy consumption and energy efficiency potential on a market basis. The improvement of energy efficiency in the economy is a key project of the new Energy Strategy. Dimension of energy security The energy supply of Hungary  on both the electricity and gas markets  is characterised by a high share of imports. Significant dependence on energy imports may carry serious risks related to the security of supply and prices. Since Hungary defines the security of supply as an element of national sovereignty, the  Government of Hungary assigns a priority to strengthening energy independence. In the course of reducing dependence on energy imports and strengthening geopolitical independence, Hungary places emphasis on improving energy efficiency, maximising the sustainable exploitation of (conventional and unconventional) national hydrocarbon reserves and renewable resources, and on maintaining the level of nuclear capacities. Exposure, however, will still remain high; Hungary plans to mitigate the inherent risks by reducing import dependency, strengthening market integration and developing a diversified supply portfolio. The security of supply can be further enhanced by developing a consumer and climate-friendly electricity sector that encourages the introduction of new, flexible products on the market and can continuously integrate innovative solutions. To guarantee the security of supply on the electricity market it is necessary to continue to ensure sufficient capacities for satisfying national peak demand and to manage extreme market conditions resulting from decommissioned and commissioned power plants and growing cross-border capacities, and the Hungarian electricity system (including consumers) should possess flexible capacities guaranteeing secure operation and system balancing, and the transmission and distribution networks should also have a high level of availability. By maintaining and increasing national production capacities it will be possible to reduce the share of electricity imports  currently higher than 30 %  to under 20 % by 2040. Since energy based on renewable energy sources was produced by decentralised means in the past, a prerequisite for rapid growth in the penetration of renewables is the preparation of the transmission and distribution network for managing challenges attributable to the decentralised and partly weather-dependent production structure. This effort necessitates appropriate regulatory incentives. The increase of the share of renewables distribution networks, and the development of distribution network operation, as a decentralised intervention capability, and its transparent market mechanisms. Weather-dependent, primarily PV capacities are playing a growing role within renewable energy production. Short-term fluctuations in weather-dependent production can currently be balanced mainly by gas-fired power plants, but the spread of new, innovative solutions  such as energy storage and demand side responses  should also be enabled. The benefit of reduced import dependency for the security of supply is most obvious in relation to natural gas, as it accounts for the largest share of final energy consumption in Hungary (32-33 %), also in consideration of the consumed quantity of electricity and heat generated with natural gas. In recent years national production covered approximately 20 % of consumption, therefore ~80 % had to be imported to Hungary. We aim to reduce Hungary's share of gas imports to roughly 70 % by 2030 based on a decline in consumption and growing domestic production. The decline in consumption can mainly be achieved with energy efficiency investments induced by introduction of the obligation scheme and by reducing the  share of natural gas consumption in district heat generation. The use of domestic resources at a higher rate also contributes to strengthening energy independence. The increase of domestic natural gas production is guaranteed by continuing efforts to ensure the predictability of the concession scheme. By enhancing the flexibility of the system and improving the efficiency of non-standard gas extraction we can offset the exhaustion of production inventories with the encouragement of new extraction projects, thus under an ideal scenario we can expect to increase domestic conventional natural gas production up to even 2.4 billion m3 by 2030. In addition to domestic natural gas, the use of alternative gas resources (biogas, biomethane, hydrogen in the longer term) also has potential. We estimate that the domestic biogas potential can realistically substitute 1 % of national gas consumption in Hungary by 2030. As an additional strategic objective, the remaining annual import requirement of around 6.2 billion m3 can be met with sources as diverse as possible in 2030. To this end we aim to implement an infrastructure ensuring access to four independent gas import sources (gas traded on the Russian, LNG, Romanian and Western European markets). Hungary's security of supply can be further enhanced by strengthening market integration. Dimension of the internal energy market The appropriate operation of the internal energy market primarily depends on three main components: level of interconnection and necessity of its increase, the level of market coupling, and its reduction of prices and price volatility, and the liquidity of the Budapest electricity and gas exchange. Hungary is already significantly surpassing the EU target relating to electricity interconnection. We nevertheless plan to increase the share of interconnection to ~60 % by 2030, as the increase of existing cross-border capacities and the establishment of interconnection with Slovenia remains justified because an adequately interconnected energy network operated with neighbouring countries improves the national security of supply; in the event of any disruption within the national system, namely, the risk of disruptions in service in large areas is reduced. The expansion of the interconnection of energy networks also contributes to strengthening competition on the wholesale market, reducing the competitive disadvantage of Hungarian energy consumers compared to their Western European counterparts. Hungary's supply can be further enhanced by strengthening market integration. In other words, beyond the increase of cross-border capacities, it is also necessary to increase market coupling and to improve the efficiency of operating interconnected markets. In relation to the above, it is necessary to draw up regulations enhancing the efficiency of wholesale and balancing markets; the framework of the above is provided by the implementation of European operational and operating regulations. Further strengthening of the coupling of both intra-day and day-ahead markets on the electricity market is justified, with the efficient operation of these markets. To strengthen integration on the gas market consultations are under way between Hungary and  Croatia concerning elimination of cross-border tariffs. We are also exploring other options for integration. Beyond the foregoing it is also necessary to promote projects enhancing the regional role and liquidity of Hungary's regulated electricity and gas markets. Dimension of research, innovation and competitiveness Hungary aims to maximise the ability of the Hungarian energy and RDI sectors to fulfil the energy and climate policy objectives of Hungary and the European Union. To this end Hungary assigns a priority to the objective of improving innovation, maximising the economic development opportunities underlying energy innovation and climate change. Within the framework of the new energy innovation strategy we plan to encourage use of innovative solutions ensuring smooth transformation of the electricity markets noted above, on the one hand, and contribute to fulfilling objectives relating to the increase of consumer choices, the strengthening of the security of supply and the climate-friendly transformation of the energy sector, on the other. Innovation in the energy sector should also support the performance of the Hungarian economy, increase national RDI capacities and create industrial development opportunities to the extent possible. To support the drawing up of an energy innovation strategy in conformity with the above criteria, in October 2018 the Ministry of Innovation and Technology set up the Energy Innovation Council (EIC)4 with the participation of Hungarian energy and industrial companies, universities, research establishments, professional organisations, the Hungarian Energy and Public Utility Regulatory Authority (HEA), the MIT, the minister without portfolio in charge of managing national assets and specialists of the state secretariats of the minister without portfolio in charge of the two new units of the Paks Nuclear Power Plant. The Council identified possibilities of intervention in the following areas: 1. Innovative system balancing (flexible storage and demand management); 2. Encouragement of the market launch of innovative energy supply solutions; 3. Energy efficiency innovation programme; 4. Facilitation of the use of Hungarian natural gas reserves;                                                       4 The EIC, composed of Hungarian energy and industrial companies, universities, research establishments, professional organisations, the Hungarian Energy and Public Utility Regulatory Authority (HEA), the MIT, the minister without portfolio in charge of managing national assets and specialists of the state secretariats of the minister without portfolio in charge of the two new units of the Paks Nuclear Power Plant, aims to assess energy innovation opportunities in Hungary, improve the effectiveness of exploiting Hungarian energy innovation potential and to lay the strategy-oriented ion policy framework.

Overview of current policies i. National and Union energy system and policy context of the national plan The European Council approved the climate and energy framework for the 20212030 period in October 2014; based on the framework, the adoption of sectoral legislation determining the climate and energy policy of the EU between 2021 and 2030  considered to be primary legislation  was concluded in 2019 with the adoption of legislation of the Clean Energy package, which was debated last. In the case of Hungary, the new National Energy Strategy  prepared in parallel with the NECP  and the Second National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS 2)6 are the key national documents in conformity with the climate and energy policy objectives and directions of the EU for the year 2030. ii. Current energy and climate policies and measures relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union Pursuant to the Second National Climate Change Strategy, adopted by Parliament by way of Decision No 23/2018 of 31 October 2018 of Parliament, relating to the 20182030 period, and providing a projection of the period up to 2050, a gross GHG emission reduction of 5285 % should be achieved by 2050 over the figure for 1990. In addition to the National Decarbonisation Road Map, this strategy also contains the Action Plans - relating to three-year periods - are drawn up to fulfil objectives of the Second National Climate Change Strategy. The First Climate Change Action Plan  in effect up to 2020  aims to precisely define tasks determined by the short-term directions of action of the NCCS 2, and to prepare long-term measures. The Climate Change Action Plan determines the main areas of intervention by relying on the three pillars of mitigation, adaptation and awareness raising. The first plan will be followed by new ones every three years. Pursuant to the RED7, the mandatory share of renewable energy sources should reach 13 % in gross final                                                       6 http://doc.hjegy.mhk.hu/20184130000023_1.PDF 7 Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of  energy consumption in 2020, but Hungary has voluntarily increased this value to 14.65 % in the Renewable Energy Recovery Action Plan8. During the current budgetary period of the EU, several operational programmes were launched in Hungary to support environmental and climate protection tasks, and renewable energy sources, with a development budget of HUF 760 billion. The new Hungarian aid scheme for electricity generated from renewable energy sources (REAS) was launched in January 2017. The first REAS tender was launched on 2 September 2019. The REAS is in conformity with national needs and with EU guidelines concerning State aid for the environment and energy in the 20142020 period. A number of measures have been introduced to support the improvement of energy efficiency: - energy installations of households were modernised within the framework of the Warm Home Programme, - launch of implementing the network of energy engineers, - mandatory employment of energy engineers prescribed for large companies, - introduction of tax advantages for corporate energy investments, - improvement of energy efficiency at public institutions (renovation). The Government of Hungary assigns a priority to guaranteeing the security of energy supply. Hungary operates an adequate gas infrastructure to satisfy the stagnant, moderately declining rate of natural gas consumption. As a result of regulatory changes and infrastructure investments implemented in the past decade, a diversified supply model has evolved on the basis of multiple sources of supply. As indication of the success of implemented gas market diversification efforts (including construction of the Slovakian-Hungarian, Hungarian-Croatian and Hungarian-Romanian interconnected pipelines), strengthened import diversification and establishment of competition on the wholesale market has eliminated the competitive disadvantage of Hungarian gas consumers compared to Western European consumers since early 2014. iii. Key issues of cross-border relevance Although Hungary has substantial lignite reserves, it is grouped among countries with limited fossil fuel reserves and is therefore reliant on significant  mainly hydrocarbon  imports. Approximately 90 % of oil is                                                                                                                                                                                   energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC (text with EEA relevance) 8 https://20102014.kormany.hu/download/2/b9/30000/Meg%C3%BAjul%C3%B3%20Energia_Magyarorsz%C3%A1g%20Meg%C3%BAjul%C3%B3%20Energia%20Hasznos%C3%ADt%C3%A1si%20Cselekv%C3%A9si%20terve%202010_202 0%20kiadv%C3%A1ny.pdf  imported, although import sources are adequately diversified. Hungary imports approximately 80 % of its natural gas, most of which originates from Russia, therefore the issue of natural gas deliveries from Russia is of paramount importance for Hungary. The Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the expected decline in transiting through Ukraine, in particular, projects possible long-term changes to traditional transit routes in the 2020s. These developments may also modify transits to Serbia and Bosnia, which are currently realised exclusively through Hungary. Beyond Russian gas, access to alternative gas sources is important. However, the establishment of interconnectivity on the natural gas market  ensuring new source of supply  is not possible without international cooperation. As regards the electricity market, due to the integration level of electricity systems in Central Europe, fluctuating production in German power plants based on renewable energy sources has a direct, pronounced effect on the electricity systems of other States in the region. The interconnection of European electricity markets aims to resolve this problem by increasing and optimising, and improving the efficiency of electricity trade between countries. In 2018 the German, Austrian and Polish energy authorities approved the launch of the project serving the connection of the Hungarian-Czech-Slovakian-Romanian markets (4M MC) to the already interconnected Western European markets. A large share of demand is satisfied with imports, in addition to domestic production capacities. It is necessary to monitor current and expected capacity changes in countries serving as import sources, and Hungary needs to be aware that it is critically exposed to adverse regional events. iv. Administrative structure of implementing national energy and climate policies The Ministry of Innovation and Technology (MIT)  called as such since May 20189  is competent to carry for innovation and technology cover, inter alia, the following fields: State infrastructure investments, mining, energy and climate policy, use of European Union funds, construction economy, economic development, sustainable development, waste management, industry, trade, transport, regional development, and coordination of innovation and science policy. Within the scope of his responsibility for energy policy, the minister establishes strategic conditions for sustainable economic development, energy efficiency and energy management, and drafts climate policy legislation. Within the scope of his responsibility for industry, the minister, inter alia, draws up decisions supporting the spread of electromobility in Hungary, carries out tasks                                                       9 The Ministry of Innovation and Technology, within the meaning of Act V of 2018 on the listing of the ministries of Hungary and amending certain related acts, shall continue to operate by renaming of the Ministry of National Development under Act XX of 2014 on the listing of the ministries of Hungary.  concerning the allocation and settlement of European GHG emission allowances in relation to the emissions trading scheme of the European Union, the operation of the emissions trading scheme (ETS), and arranges for their execution. Additional institutions and actors involved in the implementation and monitoring of the plan: - Research Institute of Agricultural Economics, - Ministry of Agriculture, - Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, -  - Hungarian Mining and Geological Service, - Hungarian Energy and Public Utility Regulatory Authority, - Hungarian Hydrocarbon Stockpiling Association, - Centre for Energy Research of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, - Hungarian Chamber of Engineers, - Prime Minister's Office (government offices), - National Research, Development and Innovation Office, - Minister without portfolio in charge of national assets, - Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority, - Hungarian Meteorological Service, - Minister without portfolio in charge of the design, construction and commissioning of the two new units of the Paks Nuclear Power Plant, - Ministry of Finance.  1.3. Consultations and involvement of national and EU entities and their outcome i. Involvement of the national parliament The Hungarian Parliament has not debated the NECP. ii. Involvement of local and regional authorities Local and regional authorities were involved in the drafting of the plan, and had the opportunity to present   iii. Consultations of stakeholders, including social partners, and engagement of civil society and the general public In April 2016, a working group managed by the department coordinating technical work (formerly called the Department of Strategic and Energy Policy), with the involvement of several partner departments and external collaborators responsible for modelling, was set up by the former Ministry of National Development to ensure more efficient cooperation. The main stakeholder groups were defined as part of planning the national consultation processes. Within the framework of the one-month sectoral consultations, the request of the ministry for proposals concerning the national targets, and the policies and measures considered necessary for their fulfilment was forwarded to 134 stakeholders in the summer of 2018. The partners requested to cooperate include industrial associations, industrial/sectoral operators, civil society organisations, higher education institutions, research institutes, consulting firms and individual experts. The national objectives and targets defined in the draft NECP, and the policies and measures serving their fulfilment were defined in consideration of the professional processing and evaluation of the roughly 50 proposals received as part of the sectoral consultations. The draft was presented at a number of forums in 2019. These forums were attended by representatives of public authorities, civil society organisations, industrial operators and researchers. The draft has been accessible on the website of the Government since May 2019. Members of two permanent forums, the Advisory Panel on Climate Change (APCC) and the National Environmental Council (NEC), discussed the NECP. The NEC is the advisory, proposing, reviewing body of the Government involved in decision-making concerning environmental policies with national or regional impact. The APCC is a body established for providing scientific support for strategic documents concerning climate change. It is headed by the Minister of State for Energy and Climate Policy. In November 2019 wide ranging professional consultations were held with the participation of scientific bodies, industrial operators, universities, research establishments, CSOs and stakeholders in public administration. iv. Consultations with other Member States Hungary is member of the Visegrád Group cooperation and the High Level Group on Central and South Eastern Europe Energy Connectivity (CESEC), which regularly discusses energy and climate policy matters  with relevance for the NECP.10 The High Level Group on Central and South Eastern Europe Energy Connectivity (CESEC)  established in 2015, with 9 EU Member States and 8 additional countries as members  serves to accelerate the integration of electricity and gas markets in the region. The Visegrád Group cooperation is a regional organisation of Czechia, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. It aims to provide joint representation of the economic, diplomatic and political interests of Central European countries and to coordinate their possible steps. In the course of 2018 and 2019 Hungary held targeted consultations with several Member States on the National Energy and Climate Plan. As a first step of consultations, in November 2018, Hungary participated in the NECP consultations11 organised by the V4 countries and Austria in Bratislava. The meeting offered an opportunity to discuss - on a regional level - the progress of Member States in drawing up the NECP. In addition to practical aspects of preparing the NECP, the following topics were also discussed: renewable energy sources, climate change, energy efficiency, internal energy market and energy security. In July 2019 Slovenia organised a new round of targeted consultations in Ljubljana relating to the NECP. In addition to the host country and Hungary, the event was attended by Austria, Croatia and Italy. Within the framework of the Central Eastern European Energy Conference held in Bratislava, in November 2019 the V4 countries and neighbouring countries discussed the NECPs of Member States, options for boosting ambitions and regional effects. v. Iterative process with the Commission In April 2017, the delegation of the European Commission visited Hungary to obtain information and to clarify certain technical matters. In the course of successful bilateral consultations, the ministry reported on progress relating to the NECP.  The Commission published its recommendations concerning the NECPs of Member States in June 2019.12 These state, inter alia, that the target for the use of renewable energy should be raised to 23 %, it is necessary to significantly increase the targets for 2030 regarding the reduction of both final and primary energy consumption, and measures relating to the above and to market integration, energy security, and research and innovation should be elaborated in greater detail. It is also necessary to further detail analyses relating to the investment requirements and effects of measures.                                                       10 CESEC = Central and South Eastern Europe Energy Connectivity 11 Pentalateral consultations between Austria (AT), Czechia (CZ), Poland (PL), Slovakia (SK) and Hungary (HU). 12 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/hu_rec_hu.pdf  Hungary held personal consultations on the recommendations with the Commission in May 2019.  1.4.
