Current situation of the low-carbon-technologies sector and, to the extent possible, its position on the global market (that analysis is to be carried out at Union or global level) -carbon technologies sector and its position on the global market goes beyond the scope of this document and it is not effective to carry out this assessment in isolation at Member State level. The Czech Republic, however, carefully monitors the state of low-carbon technologies in order to be able to respond to this development. Since 2001, the Czech Republic has been a member of the International Energy Agency (IEA), which also addresses the state of low-carbon technologies and monitors their development with a view to achieving long-term targets in the field of global greenhouse gas e Within TCEP, the International Energy Agency monitors the necessary additional CO2 reduction to achieve the Sustainable Development Scenario, compared to the New Policies Scenario, which breaks down the necessary reduction to individual low-emission technologies / technologies, as well as demand-side measures (in particular increase in energy efficiency).                                                             168 For more information on this service, see NET4GAS website at: https://www.net4gas.cz/cz/media/tiskove-zpravy/zpravy/cesky-rakousky-trh-plynem-se-propojuji-diky-nove-sluzbe-trading-region-upgrade-tru.html  -286-  Chart 106: Additional CO2 reduction in the SDS compared to NPS  Source: Tracking Clean Energy Progress (International Energy Agency) Within TCEP, the IEA evaluates the contribution of individual technologies to achieving the objectives defined in the SPS. Altogether, there are a total of 30 low-carbon technologies (or procedures, these are not just technologies as such), which are ranked in five categories, namely (i) power; (ii) buildings; (iii) transport; (iv) industry and (v) energy integration. Renewable sources are further subdivided into a total of eight sub-categories (i.e. a total of 37 categories). solar PV; (ii) electric vehicles; (iii) lighting and (iv) data centres and networks. 22 technologies were 169 ii. Current level of public and, where available, private research and innovation spending on low-carbon-technologies, current number of patents, and current number of researchers  It is not possible to precisely determine the exact level of public funding of research and innovation for low--egory is not defined and in place in the Czech Republic for the purposes of statistical surveys. The situation is further complicated by the fact that basic research does not have to be clearly assigned to low-carbon technology. Table 107 shows State budget expenditure for research, development and innovation in the period 20162019, when years 2016 and 2017 are actual figures, and years 2018 and 2019 are figures approved within the State budget. On the basis of the National Priorities of Oriented Research, 18 % of the total public expenditure should be allocated to Sustainable Energy and Material Resources (Table 40).

For the energy sector, the relevant categories are JE (non-nuclear energy, energy consumption and use) and JF (nuclear energy). Table 108 provides information about support for JE and JF. It shows that between 2009 and 2015, almost CZK 3.6 billion was allocated in selected public procurement procedures for projects with JE and JF as the main field; the total costs amounted to approximately CZK 5.2 billion. For projects with JE and JF as the secondary field, public support amounted to approximately CZK 1.1 billion with the total cost of over CZK 1.5 billion. Table 109 shows the approved targeted support and total costs for 20162020 (projects approved before September 2016). In 20182025, the energy sector should be allocated public funds for applied research of at least CZK 4 billion from state budged and CZK 5.7 billion of total funds respectively, which corresponds to the approved funds under the THÉTA programme (assuming that all allocated funds are disbursed).

Breakdown of current price elements that make up the main three price components (energy, network, taxes/levies)  Breakdown of current price elements commodities/fuels these prices should concern. According to the requirement for breakdown to price elements, including the network element, it can be deduced that this is the requirement for network commodities, i.e. electricity and natural gas (the prices of heat are very region-dependent). Therefore, below is information on the prices of electricity, gas, and black coal. The Czech Republic also monitors the prices of other fuels/commodities, such as car gasoline and diesel fuel, LPG, light and fuel oil, etc.                                                              172  The document is available at: https://www.vyzkum.cz/FrontClanek.aspx?idsekce=799467  -290-  Electricity prices Electricity prices (as well as prices of natural gas) are available in the publicly available EUROSTAT databases (underlying data are sent by the Czech Statistical Office).

Description of energy subsidies, including for fossil fuels According to the document Energy Prices and Energy Costs in Europe from 9 January 2019, total European energy subsidies have increased in recent years, from EUR 148 billion in 2008 to EUR 169 billion in 2016. This increase was mainly due to an increase in subsidies for renewable energy sources, which amounted to EUR 76 billion in 2016. Subsidies to fossil fuels are estimated at approximately EUR 55 billion. Chart 115 shows financial support for fossil fuels in the EU as described in the above document. Unfortunately, the Czech Republic does not have primary data in this respect. The Czech Republic also reports on subsidies to fossil fuels within its OECD membership. Table 118 provides a summary of energy subsidies. Chart 115: Financial support for fossil fuels in the EU  Source: Energy prices and costs in Europe                                                            177  This information is not publicly available.  -298-  Table 118 lists the identified subsidies in the energy sector. Subsidy titles are summarised only within a single line due to their scope. Information on individual public titles is publicly traceable and the Czech Republic reports them in more detail, for example, through the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan or the National Action Plan for the Development of Renewable Energy Sources. The European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) are the source of a significant part of these funds. These the share of renewable energy sources and improving energy performance. Therefore, the Czech Republic does not intend to systematically phase these subsidies out, also in view of the increased ambition of the EU in these areas by 2030.  Table 119 lists identified fossil fuel subsidies. Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament he definition of the meaning of the IEA definition, only the housing allowance provided under Act No 117/1995, on state social support, as amended, can be considered a fossil fuel subsidy. More information about this allowance is provided in the table.  Regarding the planned phasing out of this subsidy, it may be noted that the Government in its Resolution No 502 of 8 July 2019, on the conclusions resulting from the Clean Air Dialogue and the proposal for further action, ordered the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs in cooperation with the Minister of the Environment to submit to the Government by 31 December 2019 an analysis of the setting of the housing allowance, including an assessment of the possibilities of changing its setting in order to increase the incentives of beneficiaries to prefer environmentally friendly heating methods. Therefore, it is not possible to anticipate the cancellation of this contribution, which also has a significant social character, but based on the above resolution, it should be modified to take environmental impacts into account. The Czech Republic will report on development in this area in the relevant progress report. In this respect, it should also be noted that the combustion of fossil fuels is generally associated with external costs (as well as other areas of human activity) and, more generally, not only fossil fuel subsidies but also externalities should be quantified (this method is already being partially developed by the OECD).   -299-  Table 118: Energy subsidies Subsidies, measures, plans Specification Subsidy titles Operational Programme Enterprise and Innovation for Competitiveness; State programmes to promote energy savings and the use of renewable energy sources (EFEKT); Operational Programme Environment 20142020; Integrated Regional Operational Programme; New Green Savings Programme 20142020; ENERG Programme; Energy Saving with Reason Programme; Operational Programme Transport; Regeneration of panel housel  PANEL or NEW PANEL or Panel 2013+ Programmes; JESSICA Programme; Operational Programme Prague  Growth Pole (part devoted to energy savings in the building sector); Integrated Regional Operational Programme 20142020. Operating Aid for Supported Energy Sources (SES) under Act No 165/2012, on supported energy sources. Following the revision of the Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and the increase of the targets for energy from renewable sources and targets for the reduction of fossil fuels dependence, operating aid for the supported energy sources (renewable, secondary and CHP) has been introduced. The aid is paid on the basis of a price decision by the Energy Regulatory Office. In 2018, SES operating aid totalled CZK 46 128 million, of which RES support amounted to CZK 43 689 million. Operating aid for SES is financed from the state budget and through contributions from final consumers within the regulated price of electricity. In 2018 the contribution from the state budget was CZK 26 185 million. Support for clean and high-percentage biofuels The European Commission in its Decision of 12 August 2015 approved the support for clean and high-percentage biofuels until 2020. Compared to the support provided until the end of 2015, there were several fundamental  -300-  changes. Above all, support for individual types of biofuels is lower and the most widespread biofuels are now subject to partial taxation. Another change is that distributors of pure and high-percentage biofuels can no longer count these biofuels towards meeting the obligation to put a minimum proportion of biofuels into free tax circulation. In accordance with the European Commission Guidelines on State aid for Environment and Energy 20142020, all support for biofuels made from food raw materials (e.g. rapeseed, cereals, sugar beet) will be phased out in 2020. The aid was notified for the following types of biofuels: FAME B100, rapeseed oil, SMN B30, Ethanol E85 and Ethanol E95. Boiler subsidies The boiler subsidies are included in the OP E under the specific objective 2.1. Reduce the emissions from local heating of households that contribute -limit concentrations of pollutants  and they aim to promote the replacement of coal-fired boilers in households. Since the beginning of the programming period, the third wave of boiler subsidies has been running (i.e. three calls of the Managing Authority have been announced) with a total volume of CZK 9.84 billion (approximately 3.5 % of this amount can be used by regions to cover administrative costs and publicity). In the first two waves, a total of 69 719 applications were received in all regions, and 53 153 applications totalling CZK 5.8 billion have been reimbursed. In the currently running third wave of boiler subsidies, only a heat pump, a gas condensing boiler or a biomass boiler may be supported as a replacement for a coal boiler. In the first wave, the acquisition of a coal boiler or a combined boiler for coal and biomass could also be subsidised; in the second wave, support for coal-only boilers was abandoned.    -301-  Table 119: Fossil fuel subsidies Grant Description Planned subsidy reduction Refund of part of excise duties on diesel in the agricultural sector Partial refund of diesel excise duty in the agricultural sector in accordance with Directive 2003/96/EC. In 2019, the refund amounted to CZK 4 380 per 1 000 litres in the forestry, pond cultivation and crop production sectors. In the livestock sector, it was CZK 9 500 per 1000 litres.  Energy tax exemption for natural gas The use of natural gas is exempt from energy tax in the following cases:   when used for the production of electricity (only the subsequently produced electricity is taxed);  when used for cogeneration, where this heat is subsequently supplied to households;  when used directly by households or boiler plants for heating purposes;  when used for non-recreational use of transport ships;  when used for certain mineralogical and metallurgical processes.  In the case of natural gas, energy tax is refunded to persons enjoying privileges and immunities.   -302-  Reduced energy tax for compressed and liquefied natural gas in transport Reduced energy tax for compressed and liquefied natural gas compared to taxes on car gasoline and diesel. The existing tax rates are to be increased (from 136.8 CZK/MWh of gross calorific value to 264.8 CZK/MWh of gross calorific value) on 1 January 2020. However, even after this increase, natural gas tax rates will be significantly more favourable than those of diesel and unleaded gasoline when converted to energy units.  Energy tax exemption for solid fuels The use of solid fuels is exempt from energy tax in the following cases:   when used for cogeneration, where this heat is subsequently supplied to households;   when used for electricity production (electricity is subsequently taxed);  when used for non-recreational use of transport ships;   when used for certain mineralogical and metallurgical processes.  In the case of solid fuel, energy tax is refunded to persons enjoying privileges and immunities.  Mineral oil tax advantages The exemption from or refund of the entire excise duty included in the price of mineral oil is applied in the following cases:   when used in mineralogical or metallurgical processes;  when used for non-recreational flying;   -303-   when used for non-recreational cruises. Costs associated with the termination of mining in uneconomic underground mines and land quarries in the Czech Republic At the end of 1992, the government announced a plan to end coal mining in uneconomic underground mines and quarries in the Czech Republic. By Government Resolution No 691/1992, the State undertook to finance technical work to close mines, to remedy the consequences of past mining activities and to cover the social costs of phasing out mining activities (e.g. health benefits for miners).  Remediation of environmental damage associated with mining activities The Czech Republic decided to use part of the revenues from the privatisation of mining companies to finance the remediation of past environmental damage associated with mining activities that occurred prior to the privatisation of Czech mining companies. Since the end of 2015, the ongoing remediation of past environmental damage is the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. At the end of 2009, four companies were drawing money: (i) Diamo (uranium and coal mining); ii) OKD, a.s. (hard coal mining); iii) Sokolovská uhelná (lignite mining), a.s .; iv) and   Boiler subsidies The boiler subsidies are included in the OP E under the specific objective 2.1.

In the second wave, 6 550 applications for combined coal and biomass boilers and 8 834 applications for gas condensing boilers were approved. Since the beginning of the programming period, the third wave of boiler subsidies has been running (i.e. three calls of the Managing Authority have been announced) with a total volume of CZK 9.84 billion (approximately 3.5 % of this amount can be used by regions to cover administrative costs and publicity).

Investment support for fossil fuel sources Support of reconstruction and modernisation or construction of sources with cogeneration of electricity and heat or support for its introduction. The amount of the subsidy is determined by individual subsidy titles. In this respect, it should be stressed that the use of fossil fuels is not primarily encouraged; the support focuses on modernisation and introduction of cogeneration. For this reason, the aid is not expected to be phased out.  -305-  Operating aid for fossil fuel sources Support for sources burning fossil fuels with cogeneration. The amount of support is determined by the  In this respect, it should be stressed that the use of fossil fuels is not primarily encouraged; the support is aimed at the promotion of co-generation of electricity and heat to save primary energy sources, which is in line with the objectives and focus of EU legislation. Increased use of primary energy sources de facto contributes to reducing the use of fossil fuel. For this reason, the aid is not expected to be phased out. Housing allowance It is paid according to Act No 117/1995, on state social support, as amended  see Title Three, Sections 24 to 28. It is a social benefit to which the owner or tenant of an apartment who is declared to reside in an apartment is entitled if: (a) his or her housing costs exceed the product of decisive family income and a coefficient of 0.30, and in the City of Prague a coefficient of 0.35, and (b) the product of decisive family income and a coefficient of 0.30, and in the territory of the capital city of Prague a coefficient of 0.35, does not exceed the amount of normative housing costs. The Government, in its Resolution No 502 of 8 July 2019, on the conclusions resulting from the Clean Air Dialogue and the proposal for further action, ordered the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs in cooperation with the Minister of the Environment to submit to the Government by 31 December 2019 an analysis of the setting of the housing allowance, including an assessment of the possibilities of changing its setting in order to increase the incentives of beneficiaries to prefer environmentally friendly heating methods.
