Current interconnection level and main interconnectors Zero interconnection level, there is no interconnector. 4.5.1.2. ii. Projections of interconnector expansion requirements (including for the year 2030) It is expected that EuroAsia Interconnector construction will be completed by end of 2023. The statutory permit granting procedure for PCI "EuroAsia Interconnector" started in November 2019 and will be completed until the comprehensive decision is taken by NCA, by end of 2020. Immediately after the completion of the granting procedure, construction phase will begin and will last for three years. Consequently, commercial operation will start by Q1 2024 where an interconnectivity level of 15% will be achieved. 4.5.2. Energy transmission infrastructure 4.5.2.1. i. Key characteristics of the existing transmission infrastructure for electricity and gas Key characteristics of the existing transmission infrastructure for electricity include:  - Transmission Lines rated at 220kV but operating at 132kV - Transmission Lines rated and operating at 132kV - Underground Cables rated at 132kV but operating at 66Kv - Underground Cables rated and operating at 66kV - Transmission Lines rated at 132kV but operating at 66Kv - Transmission Lines rated and operating at 66kV - 132/66kV Interbus Transformers - 132/11kV Step Down Transformers - 132/6,6kV Step Down Transformers - 132/3,3kV Step Down Transformers - 66/11kV Step Down Transformers - 66/3,3kV Step Down Transformers - 15,75/132kV Step Down Transformers - 11/132kV Step Down Transformers - 11/66kV Step Down Transformers -  - Substations (GIS and Open Air)  Currently, there is no transmission infrastructure for gas. 181  4.5.2.2. ii. Projections of network expansion requirements at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) The expansion and upgrade of existing electricity network planned for the period 2019-2028 is described in the Ten Years Transmission Network Development Plan for the period 2019-2028 (Appendix 5). There are no available projections from TSOCy beyond 2028. 4.5.3. Electricity and gas markets, energy prices 4.5.3.1. i. Current situation of electricity and gas markets, including energy prices Although no transactions have been recorded yet, from the 1st of September 2017 the Electricity market allows the participation of new generators and suppliers based on a transitional regulation that allows bilateral contracts between producers and suppliers above a threshold set by CERA: (a) for producers with a production license above 50kW and  (b) for suppliers with contracts for supply of energy to consumers with total agreed power above 10 MW.  Transactions are cleared on a monthly basis. The contracts involve only the provision of energy and exclude the participation of the Electricity Authority of Cyprus (the incumbent) from directly participating in energy contracts. The transitional regulation will be annulled with the commencement of the application of the Trading & Settlement Rules (TSR) in line with the EU Electricity Target Model will take place in end of 2021. Contracts that were concluded in the transitional regulation will be grandfathered in the competitive electricity market Electricity prices for domestic customers between September 2019 - November 2019 were recorded at 24.2 Eurocent per kilowatt-hour (incl. VAT). This is based on the following elements:  1. /MT adjusted to the Real Cost of Fuel. Adjustment is done by multiplying the excess cost (Real cost-coefficient of fuel adjustment.

Currently, there is no gas market.  4.5.3.2. ii. Projections of development with existing policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) Projections of development with existing policies and measures at least until 2040, see Impact Assessment, section 3.2.2 Changes in energy prices between WEM and PPM scenarios
