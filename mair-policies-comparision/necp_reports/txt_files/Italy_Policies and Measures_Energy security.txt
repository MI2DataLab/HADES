INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 202    3.3 Dimension energy security18  i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.319 The main interventions put in place to ensure that the security levels of the electricity, gas and petroleum products systems are sufficiently high and maintained can be attributed to the measures described below. Gas sector   Revision of the Preventive Action Plan for the Italian natural gas system, in accordance with the new Security Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/1938) Update of Annex I to the Ministerial Decree of 18 October 2017. The Preventive Action Plan contains the results of the assessment carried out on the risks that could affect the security of the national natural gas system, setting out crisis scenarios and impacts, and also the measures that can be put in place to maximise supply and contain demand, in order to sufficiently offset any supply disruptions in good time, guaranteeing in any case that protected customers (household customers and public services) are supplied, and the preventive measures for managing and containing the risks. In the 2017 Plan, the capacity of the system to satisfy total gas demand, including in the event of the key infrastructure for supplying gas breaking down, was v-European Regulation. The verification for 2017 delivered a positive result, but the situation has since changed owing to the unavailability of one of the two gas pipelines making up the TENP pipeline system in Germany, which connects the Transitgas gas pipeline in Switzerland to northern Europe. This is all taken into account in the 2019 update to the Preventive Action Plan, currently being consulted by the other Member States, and which provides, among other things, for greater cooperation between Member States, in the light of changes that have taken place concerning national supply infrastructure.   Update of the Emergency Plan for the Italian natural gas system, in coordination with the Emergency Plans of the other Countries connected to the same supply corridors covered by Regulation (EU) 1938/2017 Update of Annex II to the Ministerial Decree of 18 October 2017. The Emergency Plan sets out the conditions for activating the three different crisis levels that may arise as a result of unfavourable conditions, defines the types of measures for dealing with crisis situations and the procedures for implementing them, and identifies the companies and operators in the gas and electricity sector that are responsible for implementing those measures.   Adapting the functions of the gas transport and storage network In view of the scenarios covered by this Plan and the objectives to be achieved as mentioned above, the national natural gas system is expected to play only a minor role in terms of overall use, but will need to be more resilient and flexible as regards absolute performance, in order                                                             18 Policies and measures shall reflect the energy efficiency first principle 19 Consistency shall be ensured with the preventive action and emergency plans under Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2017 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and repealing Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 (OJ L 280, 28.10.2017, p. 1) as well as the risk preparedness plans under Regulation (EU) 2018/2001 [as proposed by COM(2016) 862 on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector and repealing Directive 2005/89/EC]. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 203   to successfully confront not only unfavourable events that could lead to problems in the Italian gas system, but also sudden weather changes that could adversely affect the production of energy from RES.  The national natural gas system has always been flexible enough to cover peaks in heating demand during the winter and variations in thermoelectric demand during the summer. According to the analysis of the data relating to gas consumption associated with the scenario detailed in this plan, in order to keep the transport, LNG and gas storage infrastructure at its current levels of availability and efficiency, the gas system will need to continue providing such flexibility, meeting daily peaks and guaranteeing seasonal coverage. However, the analysis cannot disregard more in-depth adequacy assessments based on time and location, incorporating a dynamic analysis of the relative gas flows: indeed, the actual gas consumption for the local thermoelectric sector will depend on the volatility of the demand for residual heat, which is determined by:  the actual production from plants and any unplanned intermittences (absence of wind or excessive wind, momentary cloud cover, especially dry periods);  the location of renewable energy generation plants;  the spread and location of storage systems. These factors must also be taken into account when deciding on where to locate new, high-efficiency open-cycle gas-fired thermoelectric power plants in order to balance the network (peaking power plants), when they need to be constructed following the closure of coal-fired power plants.   Diversification of supply sources, including via LNG Given the increased uncertainty and the possible critical issues  which have all occurred in the past but never all at the same time  arising from disruptions to gas pipeline supplies, Italy is actively pursuing a strategy for diversifying and increasing LNG supplies (which currently cover around 9% of national gas requirements), with the aim of also supporting the measure of gradually introducing a limit of 0.1% of sulphur content in fuels used by ships at berth in ports and passenger vessels (Sulphur Emission Control Areas) and guaranteeing the presence of more spot supply sources able to compete for the position of marginal source, keeping in line with European prices.   Increasing the use of LNG by maritime transport vessels and port infrastructure The following measures aim to increase the use of LNG by maritime transport vessels and port infrastructure, with benefits not only in terms of the environment, but also the economy and industry:  making the construction of LNG storage and/or distribution facilities in ports exempt from tax;   establishing appropriate port tariffs that encourage the use of LNG-powered vessels;  agreeing forms of funding with the EU in order to build LNG storage facilities and LNG-powered vessels, in line with EU policies;  introducing incentive measures for shipbuilders to construct LNG-powered vessels;  removing barriers, including related to authorisations, to the installation of infrastructure for the supply of LNG to the road network and within ports;  facilitating the supply phase by promoting the construction of small-scale coastal INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 204   storage facilities. To create such storage facilities, the support of the port authorities and guaranteed authorisation procedures with clear timeframes are key;  promoting the creation of micro liquefaction units connected to the gas network.   Petroleum products  The transition to energy production based less and less on fossil fuels will take time and require the national downstream petroleum industry to be kept at the cutting-edge (from both an environmental and a technological perspective), efficient and competitive, thereby guaranteeing the reliability, sustainability and security of the necessary supplies.  The actions planned up to 2030 are as follows:  supporting, over refineries to biorefineries, in line with the increase in national demand for advanced biofuels;  focusing on plants for producing the raw materials needed for preparing biofuels for the biorefineries (the so-oils), so as to create a national production chain to support the transition to advanced biofuels;  advocating reuse of industrial sites by converting them into storage facilities or other productive investments, also in order to safeguard employment levels;  avoiding the unnecessary displacement of personnel currently occupied in the traditional sector of extracting and processing fossil and hydrocarbon products; it is necessary to form a generational pact between those who have been working within the confines of the traditional energy system and those who are looking ahead to the 2030 horizon from a very different working environment;  boosting investments for increasing the conversion of heavy products produced by refineries and reducing the production of fuel oil, in light of the new IMO regulations;  protecting the Italian residue refining industry, in order to allow the market to have access to products that are compatible with the environment, produced by following the highest environmental standards. Electricity sector    Update of the Emergency Plan for the Security of the Electricity System (EPSES) The objective of the Emergency Plan for the Security of the Electricity System is to carry out the rotational disconnection of loads in order to tackle any substantial and prolonged energy shortages and to prevent uncontrolled interruptions of electricity supply, which would cause major social and economic unrest for the entire community. Annex Code sets out provisions for preparing and implementing Rotational Disconnection Plans to be carried out by Distributors, in accordance with the resolution passed by the Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning (IMCEP) in 1979. Every year, the Distributors send Terna, by no later than 31 May, their respective Disconnection Plans, in which the Groups to be disconnected, the various Disconnection Periods (none of which may exceed 90 minutes) and the various combinations according to Level of Severity are identified. The Plan involves all forms of consumption apart from those which may be interrupted (which are subject to other defence plans) and those afforded privileged status, as identified in the IMCEP Resolution (hospital facilities, railway stations and airports). The measures set out in the EPSES will form part of future Risk Preparation Plans, which will need INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 205   to be drawn up in accordance with the provisions laid out in Regulation (EU) 2019/941 on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector in order to increase cross-border coordination of the security and emergency management measures.   Resilience Extreme weather events are becoming increasingly common, due in part to climate change, and can pose major difficulties to the electricity sector and other essential services, in some cases at the same time, in vast areas covering several Regions. Floods have recently devastated Regions in northern Italy (Veneto, Friuli, Liguria), central Italy (Lazio) and southern Italy (Sicily), leading them all to declare a state of emergency. In order to restore the supply of electricity, specialist personnel need to identify and repair the damage suffered by the networks, which requires them to work in adverse weather conditions and in areas that are not readily accessible, thus placing their safety at risk. Electricity infrastructure is overly exposed to such events, and as a result, procedures have been established to identify all interventions capable of making the electricity system more resilient to those phenomena, by means of a technical panel coordinated by ARERA and the Abruzzo Committee set up by the Ministry of Economic Development following the most recent severe disruptions to the supply of electricity in central Italy, which were caused by snowfall. In the medium to long term, on the one hand, action needs to be taken to increase the number of interventions carried out on infrastructure by meshing and reinforcing the network, and also diversify the technologies used. In that sense, for example, the use of underground power lines must be closely examined, since they are more resistant to adverse weather events (see the 2018 Development Plan), although it would take longer to repair any damages they might sustain. Terna has recently introduced a guideline for promoting the increased use of underground power lines. In the short term, meanwhile, mitigation measures need to be put in place, for instance by installing anti-rotation devices to prevent the ice load sag effect, and using remote control. activities that network operators have to carry out in order to reduce the time taken to restore supply, which need to be coordinated with the main entities involved (local bodies, the Civil Protection Department, road operators, etc.) and require the available resources to be provided. Both the operator of the national transmission network and the distributors are required to submit resilience plans that identify the areas and lines at risk and the interventions to be carried out as a priority in order to make the network infrastructure more resilient.   Defence Plans for the transmission network and adoption of measures for constant technological adaptation -fired thermal power plants and the gradual increase in energy production from renewable sources. In-depth analysis and studies of the network will need to be carried out in order to assess what possible countermeasures could be taken in the event of the network deteriorating or in cases of distributed generation (low load).   Capacity market INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 206   The measure, (Ministerial Decree of 28 June 2019) initially approved by the EC in 2018 and then in 2019 in its revised version with new emissions limits for participating plants, provides for annual auctions to be introduced by Terna, open to all technologies capable of contributing to the adaptation objective, in order to supply resources, including those from outside Italy, to cover the requirement expressed by Terna, which is based on a long-term assessment that is updated every year. At the first auction, held on 6 November 2019 for delivery year 2022, the TSO assigned over 40 GW of capacity broken down as follows: 34.7 GW existing capacity (of which 1 GW from RES), 1.7 GW of new power plants and 4.4 GW of virtual capacity from abroad. At the second auction, held on 28 November 2019 for delivery year 2023, the TSO assigned around 43.4 GW of capacity with an increase largely due to new plants of 4 GW, whereas overall existing capacity (35 GW of which 1.3 GW from RES) as well as virtual capacity from abroad (4.4 GW) were confirmed. In both rounds the annual  billion in  billion in the second. The measure is crucial for encouraging long-term, efficient, flexible and less-polluting investments, with a view to rendering the sector carbon-free and achieving the ambitious targets for phasing in renewable sources between now and 2030.   Adapting the rules governing the permits granted to thermoelectric power plants Updating the rules governing the permits granted to thermoelectric power plants, streamlining the procedure in the event of minor modifications being made to existing plants in order to make the system more flexible, as well as governing any possible stages (maximum time frames and methods) of temporary maintenance, incorporating the current stages of permanently shutting down and decommissioning the plant.   Cyber-security Adapting the national cyber-security measures (identification of risks and actions to combat them) with respect to the changes made to the regulations governing that field, resulting both from the implementation of the NIS Directive, and from the planned adoption by the European Commission of a suitable network code for that field. These national measures, together with those coordinated with the other EU Member States, will form part of the Risk Preparation Plan provided for in Regulation 2019/941.  ii. Regional cooperation in this area   Cross-border coordination Working alongside the other EU Member States to define new models for cross-border coordination amongst the TSOs concerning information and initiatives for preventing risks and managing any possible critical issues and emergencies affecting the system. In this respect, the new responsibilities will include drawing up and regularly updating the Risk Preparation Plan, starting from identifying the risk scenarios from both a national and regional perspective, defined according to the methods provided for in the EU legislation in the course of being adopted, and also with reference to the adoption of solidarity and reciprocal support measures between States and coordination in the field of cyber-security   Defining the solidarity measure with other Member States, and structuring them INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 207   Coordination with the TSOs, Ministries and Regulators of the other Member States having a direct interest in the three main corridors for supplying gas to Italy, in order to enter into bilateral agreements that set out emergency measures, their quantifications and the associated economic aspects.   Coordination of the ten-year plans for developing the Italian nation gas pipeline network with the plans of the other European TSOs, and studies into the possible use of the gas infrastructure to also transport hydrogen-containing mixtures In view of the gradual ageing, both in Italy and in Europe, of the natural gas transport infrastructure making up a network that was first constructed over 40 years ago, and also the possible need to adapt that network owing to the introduction of new interconnections or new supply routes that have already been defined, the development plans for the network itself need to be constantly updated in order to ensure continuous supply to the end customers, by replacing the oldest sections and optimising the transport networks by also inputting natural gas/hydrogen mixtures and biomethane. In order to encourage greater use of biomethane, plans have been made to set up a single department for issuing permits, simplify the connection procedures, introduce regulatory measures, and also possibly impose an obligatory percentage quota of renewable gas (including hydrogen from renewable sources) to be input into the networks, this quota being dependent on the actual availability of sustainable biomass, which can be quantified as several billion cubic metres. The intention is also to foster the use of biomethane for all non-electrifiable sectors.   Cross-border cyber-security The issue of cyber-security forms part of the move for increased cross-border cooperation. Following a G7 meeting that took place in Rome in 2014 and focused specifically on energy security, Italy will continue to campaign for the establishment and development of a conducive environment for allowing the competent system operators and agencies to look into effective procedures for implementing the cooperation and monitoring the progress made. This cooperation, which will also involve universities, research institutes and companies from the private sector, will mainly consist of a comparison of the existing national architectures, joint initiatives, prevention and response systems, and research into and monitoring of technology supply chains. With specific reference to the G7, Italy has continued the work that began in 2014 in Rome at the G7 meeting on energy security, by continuing the debate on the threats and cyber-security strategies relevant to the electricity sector and to other energy sectors. Italy is also committed to developing other international cooperation initiatives at a multilateral level, within the framework of the International Energy Agency through the ISGAN Implementing Agreement, and the new Mission Innovation, Challenge #1 Smart Grids initiative.  iii.
