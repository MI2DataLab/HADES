Current interconnection level and main interconnectors64 The interconnection capacity of Romania is currently 7 %, as presented in the Country Report of Romania in 2017 , and it is expected to increase for 2020 to over 9 %, thus facilitating the achievement of the 10 % target by 2020. This increase in the current interconnection level of 7 % to over 9 % will be reached if the interconnection capacity with Serbia is extended.  The total length of the electricity transmission grid is 8 834.4 km and interconnection lines sum up 426.9 km in the total grid. The composition of the electricity transmission grid (ETG) is the following: 81 power stations65, of which: 39 400 kV stations, 42 220 kV stations; 8 834.4 km of overhead power lines (OPL), of which: 3.1 km of 750 kV lines, 4 915.2 km of 400 kV lines, 3 875.6 km of 220 kV lines, 40.4 km of 110 kV lines (interconnection lines with neighbouring countries).

Projections of interconnector expansion requirements (including for the year 2030)66 According to the ANRE 2017 National Report, as regards the 2030 target of 15 % for the interconnection level, the implementation of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and the development of the other electricity transmission grid projects, which are included in the ETG Development Plan for 2018-2027, will have a considerable contribution to the achievement of this target. The European Electricity Network Development Plan will be completed by the six regional groups of the ENTSO-E. CNTEE Transelectrica SA is part of the following regional groups: the Continental Central East and the Continental South East Regional Groups. In order to implement the priorities regarding the European energy infrastructure, the European Commission included certain ETG development projects (included in the National ETG Development Plan) on the Fourth List of European Projects of Common Interest (PCI), as approved on 31 October 2019 in the priority electricity corridor No 3. North -South electricity interconnections in Central Eastern and South Eastern Europe (NSI East Electricity): north-south and east-west interconnections and internal lines for better integration of the internal market in the European market and to enhance takeover of production from renewable sources, which are clustered as follows:                                                 66 With reference to national network development plans and regional investment plans of TSOs The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         o BulgariaRomania Cluster, also known as the Black Sea Corridor, which includes the following Projects of Common Interest:  400 kV d.c. OPL Smârdan-  -(RO).  Together with a project promoted by the Bulgaria ESO-EAD initiator:  400 kV d.c. OPL DobrudjaBurgas (BG). o RomaniaSerbia Cluster, also known as Mid Continental East Corridor and ItalyMontenegro, which includes the following projects of common interest:  Pancevo (Serbia);   the 400 kV OPL Iron Gates-Station by building a new 400 kV station;   stations.  The above projects are included in the latest edition of the pan-European 10-year electricity network development plan (TYNDP 2018) and prepared by ENTSO-E under Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009. Below is a short description of the Black Sea Corridor and Mid Continental East Corridor projects:  Black Sea Corridor: The purpose of this project is to strengthen the electricity transmission corridor alongside the Black Sea Coast (RO-BG) and between the coast and Western Europe. This project, which has a significant contribution to the implementation of the strategic energy infrastructure objectives of the EU, is supported by an increase in the level of interconnection between Romania and Bulgaria and by the development of the infrastructure supporting the transmission of power flows between the Black Sea Coast and the North Sea Coast, and the Atlantic Ocean Coast. Moreover, this project will be conducive to enhanced exchanges in the area, thus strengthening the integration of the regional and European energy market. The development of renewable energy sources of an intermittent nature will boost significantly in the context of an increase in the capacity of the grid to transmit the energy produced from renewable sources from South-Eastern Europe to the main consumption centres and the storage sites located in Central and Northern Europe.  Mid Continental East Corridor: -South electricity y) and it will culminate with an increase in the exchange capacity at the borders between Romania, Hungary and Serbia. Moreover, this project will enable deeper integration of electricity markets and enhanced security in supply in the south-eastern area of Europe. Criteria for determining the interconnection level The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         In the light of the amendments to the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 June 2018 on the governance of the Energy Union, the interconnection strategy will have to consider, apart from the interconnection targets set at EU level, the following indicators of the urgency of measures in this field:  price differential in the wholesale market exceeding an indicative threshold of EUR 2/MWh between Member States, regions or bidding zones;  the nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30 % of peak load;  the nominal transmission capacity of interconnectors below 30 % of installed renewable energy production capacity. According to the data sent by CNTEE Transelectrica SA, two of these indicators are above the 30 % threshold and, for this reason, there is no urgency in the implementation of the measures set out in the abovementioned proposal for a Regulation, as follows:  for the nominal interconnection capacity in percentage of the peak load (the peak load in the winter of 2018 = 9 700 MW was considered), the current value is 113 %67;  For the nominal interconnection capacity in percentage of the installed capacity in renewable energy sources, the current value is 97 %. The minimum available capacity for cross-border trade Regulation (EU) 2019/943 establishes the minimum available capacity of 70 % of the transmission capacity for cross-border trade, in compliance with the operational security limits after taking into account contingencies, from 2016 onward. In this respect, Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 provides for the requirements to develop an Action Plan in order to reach the established minimum capacity. As regards the minimum available capacity for cross-border trade, the electricity transmission operator applied for a one-year derogation from the minimum capacity.  In this context, the application for a derogation was submitted by Transelectrica in November 2019. The reasons underlying the application for a derogation are:  Absence of coordinated capacity calculation at the level of capacity calculation regions (CCR) CORE and SEE Pursuant to Article 16(8) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943, the application of a minimum available capacity for inter-zonal trade is mandatory for borders using a coordinated net transmission capacity-based (CNTC) approach or a flow-based approach. Article 16(8) also states that the minimum available capacity for inter-zonal trade is determined in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 establishing a guideline on capacity allocation and congestion management. Therefore, the minimum available capacity for inter-zonal trade is calculated and monitored for the day-ahead and intraday market time-frames in accordance with Article 14 of Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222. ACER Recommendation No 1/2019 on the implementation of the available capacity for inter-zonal trade in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/943 states that, overall, the minimum available capacity for inter-zonal trade must be monitored for the day-ahead market time-frame. The capacity calculation methodologies for the day-ahead market time-frame of the Core CCR (for the RO-HU border) and the SEE RCC (for the RO-BG border), which were                                                 67 Transelectrica analysis table, New criteria for the interconnection capacities, 2030 The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         developed in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222, are approved by ACER and by the regulatory authorities in the SEE CCR and their implementation deadline is the end of 2020.  The current capacity calculation methodology applied by Transelectrica uses a NTC-based calculation method that does not comply with the requirements of Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222. The NTC calculation is currently made on a monthly basis, with a daily resolution, based on own calculation scenarios on the Romanian interface. Regional coordination is achieved only for the common grid model developed on a monthly basis and the aggregation of the minimum values proposed by the two TSOs per border. The values of the inter-zonal available capacity for the day-ahead and intra-day market time-frames are deducted from those calculated on a monthly basis. The capacity calculation results based on the individual methodology of Transelectrica certainly feature major uncertainties due to the fact that the entry data is estimated as highly uncertain long before the electricity supply day. The application of an available capacity for inter-zonal trade to an uncoordinated capacity calculation increases the risk of breaching the operational security limits for the real-time operation of the NES.  Power flows in cross-border trade with third countries ACER Recommendation No 1/2019 provides that it is possible to take into account power flows at the non-EU borders in the capacity calculation and in the calculation of the available margin for inter-zonal trade if an agreement is concluded with the third country(ies) concerned. Moreover, ACER Recommendation No 1/2019 states that the agreement with third countries should also include the apportionment of costs with remedial actions. Cross-border trade at the Romanian borders outside the EU have a significant impact on the transmission capacity available at the Romanian borders within the EU. Trade at the RO-HU borders of the Core CCR is influenced by the cross-border trade at the RO-RS and RO-UA borders. This is understandable in the light of the fact that Romania and Hungary have common borders with RS and UA. Trade at the RO-BG border of the Core CCR is influenced by the cross-border trade at the RO-RS and BG-RS borders. Compliance with the requirements of Article 16(8) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943, without taking into account power flows in cross-border trade with third countries, leads to an artificial increase in the available capacities at the RO-HU and RO-BG borders and to increased risks as regards maintenance of the NES operational security.  Redispatching and countertrading In accordance with Article 16(4) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943, redispatching and countertrading are relied on in order to maximise the available capacity with a view to reaching the minimum capacity under Article 16(8). These are applied in a coordinated manner and following the application of the cost sharing methodology. The redispatching, countertrading and cost sharing methodologies developed in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 are to be implemented after the coordinated capacity calculation at CCR level has become operational. The application of an individual redispatching process by CNTEE Transelectrica in 2020 in order to reach the minimum capacity under Article 16(8) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 is not feasible. On the one hand, there is no operational experience regarding the redispatching process for increase in the cross-border capacity and, on the other hand, no calculation programmes are available, as required to assess the impact of these remedial actions which generate costs. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         The application submitted by Transelectrica for a one-year derogation from the minimum available capacity for inter-zonal trade in accordance with Article 16(9) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electricity was approved under Decision No 2206 of 20 December 2019 by the President of ANRE. 4.5.2. Energy transmission infrastructure i. Key characteristics of the existing transmission infrastructure for electricity and gas Electricity transmission infrastructure The electricity transmission grid (ETG) consists of overhead power lines (OPL) with rated voltage of 750 kV, 400 kV, 220 kV and 110 kV and power stations with voltage above 400 kV/220 kV, summing up 8 834.4 km of total length of the electricity transmission grid and interconnection lines summing up 426.9 km in total. 83.6 % of the total OPL length were put into service in the period 1960-1979, 14.07 % in the period 1980-1999 and approximately 2.3 % after 2000. It is noticeable that a low rate of OPL putting into service has been recorded after 2000. The OPL usage rate is given by the percentual ratio between their operating period and their lifetime under the rules (48 years according to the latest edition of the Catalogue on classification and normal operating periods of immovable assets). According to the analysis of 2017, a very high usage rate, i.e. 95.7 %, was recorded for OPL put into service until 1979 and they account for 83.6 % of the total overhead power lines managed by the TSO. As regards the total installed capacity in transformers, approximately 20.7 % was commissioned in the period 1960-1979, 22.1 % in the period 1980-1999 and 57.2 % after 2000. Many of the transformers and auto transformers were found to be outdated, i.e. approximately 43 % of their total capacity, among those commissioned before 2000. For those commissioned after 2000, the average usage rate with reference to the installed capacity is approximately 33 %. The usage rate of transformers/auto transformers is determined the same as that of OPL, noting that, in this case, the stipulated lifetime is 24 years. There is a low rate of high-voltage electricity transmission and distribution lines commissioned after 2000, the average being below 4 % of the total length of these categories of electrical installations. Therefore, most of the installations pertaining to electricity transmission and distribution grids currently in operation have a long operational period, predominantly above 35 years. In the category of medium and low voltage power lines (including connections), which were commissioned after 2000, it is noticeable that they account for a higher rate in the total length of this type of electrical installations, reaching 10 % for medium voltage and 20 % for low voltage. The number of power stations in the distribution grids, which were commissioned after 2000, accounts for approximately 9 % of their total number. The number of transformer substations and supply points reached approximately 28 % of the total number pertaining to the two categories of power lines in 2017. Natural gas transmission infrastructure The natural gas is transported through main pipelines with a total length of over 13 350 km (data for the reference year 2018) and through their related installations, equipment and fittings, the gas supply connectors having diameters ranging between 50 mm and 1 200 mm under pressure between 6 and 63 bar; they take over the natural gas extracted from the The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         production sites or imported gas and transport them in order to be supplied to final consumers on the internal and external natural gas markets. The natural gas transmission system (SNT) consists of the following components: over 13 350 km of transmission pipelines and natural gas supply connectors, of which 370 km of transit pipelines; 1 237 natural gas measurement control stations (directions); 58 valve control stations (VCS, NT); 7 imported gas measurement stations; 4 measurement stations mounted on the international natural gas transmission lines (GMS); 3 gas compression stations (GCS); 1 039 cathode protection stations (CPS) and 902 gas odorising stations (GOS). As regards the technical state of gas distribution systems, they sum up a total length of 49 444 km and are owned by the 37 gas distribution operators. 58.1 % of the total length of these pipes are manufactured from polyethylene and have undergone extended development in the past 20 years. Therefore, 31.5 % of the total 49 444 km of national distribution system networks are less than 10 years old, 40.5 % are 10 to 20 years old and only 7.3 % are older than 30 years. The 2019-2028 NTSDP also includes projects to develop the natural gas storage system, two of which are projects of common interest already included on the Third List of TYNDP. It is about 20.6 of SNTGN Romgaz SA - DEPOGAZ SA Natural -- 6.20.4. Moreover, three major strategic projects are also included for Romania, which were proposed by Romgaz-DEPOGAZ Subsidiary and which are included in the 2019-2028 Plan, - for the 2018-2025 time-2020-2025 time-Moldova-2025 time-frame, with an estimated value of EUR 80 million. ii. Projections of network expansion requirements at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) Electricity The national transmission system consists of power lines and stations mostly built in the years 1960-1980 at the technological level of that time.  Due to the maintenance programme and to the refurbishment and modernisation programme, installations have been maintained to date at an appropriate level of technical condition. The following ten years are dedicated to completing the refurbishment and modernisation projects for the installations and equipment under development and new projects will be initiated.

No projections have been issued to date as regards the development of the electricity transmission infrastructure for 2040.  Natural gas National Natural Gas Transmission System  The National Natural Gas Transmission System (SNT) in Romania is operated by SNTGN Transgaz SA, the technical operator of the transmission system (TSO). The natural gas transmission capacity is secured by the pipe and supply connection network with diameters ranging between 50 and 1 200 mm and a total length of 13 350 km of natural gas main transmission pipelines supply connectors, of which 370 km of international natural gas transmission pipelines.  SNT is connected to the neighbouring countries, more specifically Ukraine, Hungary, Moldova and Bulgaria, through the following cross-border interconnection points:  Interconnection with UKRAINE: 1. Orlovka (UA)Isaccea (RO) interconnection pipeline with the following characteristics: DN 1000, capacity = 8.6 billion m3/year and Pmax = 55 bar 2. Tekovo (UA)characteristics: DN 700, capacity = 4.0 billion m3/year and Pmax = 70 bar Interconnection with HUNGARY: 3.

Ungheni (MO)characteristics: DN 500, capacity = 1.5 billion m3/year and Pmax = 50 bar Interconnection with BULGARIA: 5. Ruse (BG)Giurgiu (RO) interconnection pipeline with the following technical characteristics: DN 500, capacity = 1.5 billion m3/year and Pmax = 40 bar The Development Plan for the National Natural Gas Transmission System sets out the development lines of the Romanian natural gas transmission network and of the major projects which the national transmission system operator (NTS) intends to implement in the following ten years. The purpose is to reach a maximum level of transparency as regards the development of the natural gas NTS in order to provide market players with the possibility of timely informing on the existing and planned transmission capacities in order to ensure, by public consultation, that decisions on investments in the natural gas transmission network meet the market requirements. The Development Plan for the National Natural Gas Transmission System (NTS) in the period 2019-2028 meets the requirements of the European energy policy as regards:  securing natural gas supply;   enhancing interconnection of the national natural gas transmission network with the European network;   increasing the flexibility of the national natural gas transmission network;   ensuring the liberalisation of the natural gas market;   integrating the natural gas market at EU level.  The NTS operator proposes major investment projects in the Development Plan for the National Transmission System, in order to ensure the strategic and sustainable development of the natural gas transmission infrastructure in Romania, at the same time aiming at ensuring its compliance with the requirements of the EU relevant regulations. The main projects included in the Development Plan for the National Natural Gas Transmission System for the period 2019-2028 are68: 1. Development of the National Natural Gas Transmission System within the territory of Romania on the BulgariaRomaniaHungaryAustria Corridor The project is purposed to create a natural gas transmission capacity between the interconnection points between the Romanian natural gas transmission system and the Hungarian and Bulgarian ones. For this purpose, an approximately 529 km long pipe must be Horia route and three new  The staged implementation of the BRHA project entails:  Stage I consisting in the achievement of the following objectives: o  o tree gas compression statiostation being equipped with two compression units (one in service and the other as a backup), with the possibility of ensuring bidirectional gas flow;                                                 68 Development Plan for the Natural Gas Transmission System for 2019-2028, as approved by ANRE The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         o the transmission capacity of 1.75 billion m3/year to Hungary and 1.5 billion m3/year to Bulgaria; o estimated investment value - EUR 478.6 million.  Stage II consisting in the achievement of the following objectives: o - o upgrading the three compression by mounting an additional compression unit in each station; o upgrading the existing gas measurement station - GMS Horia; o the transmission capacity of 4.4 billion m3/year to Hungary and 1.5 billion m3/year to Bulgaria; o estimated investment value - EUR 68.8 million. Projected completion date: 2020 for Stage I and 2022 for Stage II  2. Development of the Southern Transmission Corridor within the territory of Romania to take over natural gas from the Black Sea shore The major objective of this investment consists in building a telescopic natural gas transmission pipe, i.e. Tuzla  which connects the available natural gas resources on the Black Sea shore to the Bulgaria-Romania-Hungary-Austria corridor, thus providing for the possibility of transmitting natural gas to Bulgaria and Hungary through the existing interconnections GiurgiuRuse (with Bulgaria) Szeged (with Hungary). Moreover, this pipe will be interconnected with the current international natural gas transmission pipe T1. The pipe is telescopic and comprises two segments:  Segment I: the Black Sea shore-Amzacea, with the length of 32.4 km, to have a technical capacity of 12 billion m3/year;  Segment II: Amzacea-capacity of 6 billion m3/year. The estimated investment value is EUR 360.4 million and the projected completion date is 2021. 3. Interconnecting the National Natural Gas Transmission System with the international natural gas transmission pipe T1 This project is particularly important because:   its implementation will culminate with a transmission corridor between the markets in Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine considering that the new interconnection between Greece and Bulgaria is achieved;   the transmission contract pertaining to the capacity of the Transit 1 pipe expired on 1 October 2016; from the gas year 2016-2017 onward the transmission capacity of the Transit 1 pipe is traded on the basis of bids in accordance with the European Code on capacity allocation mechanisms in cross-border interconnection points and Order No 34/2016 of ANRE;   the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 1938/201769;                                                  69 interconnection with the international transmission pipe T1 has been completed  The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          The project also becomes necessary in the context of taking over into the Romanian transmission system the natural gas recently discovered in the Black Sea in order to sell it on the Romanian and regional markets.  The project will consist in the following:  Phase I: o interconnection works between NTS and the international transmission pipe T1 in the area of the Isaccea measurement station; o    Phase II: o compression station; o  o  The estimated investment value is EUR 77.7 million and the projected completion date is 2020. 4. Developments of the NTS in North-East Romania in order to improve the natural gas supply in the area and to secure the transmission capacities to the Republic of Moldova Considering the need to improve natural gas supply in the north-east region of Romania and taking account of the opportunity provided by the new interconnection pipe between Romania -Ungheni), namely to provide transmission capacities to/from the Republic of Moldova, a series of developments are required for the Romanian natural gas transmission system in order to provide for the technical parameters in line with the consumption requirements in the targeted areas. The project will consist in the following:  -Gher 104 km;  - 61 km;  - installed capacity of 9.14 MW;  - installed capacity of 9.14 MW; Transgaz can secure outflow of 43,8 million m3/year from the NTS to the Republic of Moldova. At the end of the NTS development project in the north-east area of Romania, on the RO-MD route, a flow rate of 1,5 billion m3/year may be secured at operating pressure of 16-50 bar. The estimated investment value is EUR 174.2 million and the projected completion date is 2021. 5. Upgrading the bidirectional natural gas transmission corridor Bulgaria-Romania-Hungary-Austria (BRHA stage 3) Assuming that the transmission capacities required to sell the natural gas in the Black Sea on the Central-West European markets exceed the transmission potential of the BRHA corridor at the second stage, SNTGN Transgaz SA planned to develop the central corridor which practically follows the route of certain pipes in the current system, but which is currently operated under inadequate technical parameters for a main pipeline. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         The project will consist in the following:  rehabilitating certain existing pipes pertaining to the NTS;  replacing certain existing pipes pertaining to the NTS with new pipes or installing new pipes in parallel with existing pipes;  developing four or five new compression stations with a total installed capacity of approximately 66-82.5 MW;  increasing the capacity of transmission of natural gas to Hungary by 4.4 billion m3/year. The estimated investment value is EUR 530 million and the projected completion date is 2025. 6. Project regarding new developments of the NTS in order to take over the natural gas in the Black Sea Considering the natural gas deposits recently discovered in the Black Sea, SNTGN Transgaz SA intends to extend the NTS in order to create an additional point for collection of the natural gas extracted from the marine exploitation perimeters of the Black Sea.  The project consists in the construction of an approximately 25 km long transmission pipe with DN 500 from the Black Sea shore to the existing international transmission pipe T1. The transmission capacity is 1.23 billion m3/year. The necessity of this project emerged from the discussions held/initiated by SNTGN Transgaz SA in 2015 with the holders of exploration and exploitation licences for the perimeters in the Black Sea. The estimated value of the investment is EUR 9.14 million and the estimated completion deadline is 2021 depending on the schedules of upstream offshore projects.  7. Interconnection between the National Natural Gas Transmission System in Romania and the natural gas transmission system in Serbia In the light of the European Energy Union Strategy and of the actions involving the implementation of the objectives of this strategy (competitiveness, sustainability and security in energy supply), Romania is particularly interested in implementing the energy security dimension, in developing the energy infrastructure by diversifying the energy sources and transmission routes, in strengthening solidarity among Member States and in ensuring the efficient operation of the energy market.  The efforts to enhance interconnectivity between the natural gas transmission systems in Member States and energy security in the region also include the project for establishing interconnection between the National Natural Gas Transmission System in Romania and the Serbian system.  The assessed option for exporting natural gas to Serbia is to take over natural gas from the future BRHA pipeline (stage I). The closest point of the BRHA pipeline to the border between  Tthe national natural gas transmission system and the peer natural gas transmission system in -Mokrin route. According to the 2018-2027 -Mokrin corridor, its course being changed from the Arad-Mokrin route in the 2017-2027 NTSDP.

Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness i. Current situation of the low-carbon-technologies sector and, to the extent possible, its position on the global market (that analysis is to be carried out at Union or global level) Compared to the five strategic action lines proposed by the European Commission, the research-concentration of efforts to harness that potential, such tendency being also reflected at sectoral level. The main challenges are related to the absence of funding predictability, the under-sizing of the critical mass of human resources, the low absorption of European funds and the red tape. At European level, the main instrument for promoting and mobilising funding resources in the field of research, innovation and competitiveness in the energy sector is the Strategic Energy leader in the area of renewabecosystem through smart systems, energy efficiency systems, sustainable transport, carbon capturing, usage and storage, and enhancement of security in the use of nuclear energy.
