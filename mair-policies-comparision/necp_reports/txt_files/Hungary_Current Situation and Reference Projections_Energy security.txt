4.4. Dimension of energy security i. Current energy mix, domestic energy resources, import dependency, including relevant risks Domestic primary energy consumption Based on fuel type, fossil fuels continue to dominate the domestic primary energy mix. Hydrocarbons account for a dominant share; in 2017, natural gas  Hungary's key source of energy  had a 32 % share (significantly less than the 45 % share held in 2003), while oil had a 28.5 % share in total Hungarian primary energy consumption. The share of coal/lignite (the Hungarian structure of coal use is primarily based on lignite), however, significantly declined from 21 % to 8 %  subject to minor fluctuations  with the phasing  out of deep mining in Hungary between 1990 and 2017. In parallel with the above trends, the role of renewable sources of energy is gaining relevance in Hungary's energy consumption: the share of renewables doubled between 1990 and 2005, and between 2005 and 2017 (1990 = 2.6 %, 2001 = 5.9 %, 2017 = 11 %). Beyond renewables, nuclear energy is the other major source of energy in the decarbonisation transition, the share of which has been around 15 % for years. Imported electricity accounted for 4 % in 2017.

Coal mining (black coal, brown coal, lignite) played a dominant role in Hungary's energy supply up to the 1960s, which was followed by a sharp decline in the quantity of mined coal. The downturn in coal mining was initially caused by a diminishing heavy industry. The effects of tightening pollutant emissions requirements became more pronounced later on. As a result of the above trends, in 2017 only 53.7 PJ of coal/lignite was produced in Hungary (satisfying roughly 60 % of domestic demand), which significantly falls short of the quantity of 176.8 PJ produced in 1990. Hydrocarbon production peaked in the 1980s in Hungary; a decline also followed in this sector with fluctuations. In the recent period, however, the decline in Hungarian hydrocarbon production halted as a result of successful concession tenders, with even an increase measured in recent years. In 2017, 43.9 PJ (1.05 mtoe) of crude oil and 59 PJ (around 1.7 billion m3) of natural gas was extracted in Hungary147, amounting to a 7.6 PJ (0.18 mtoe) surplus in oil production and a 1.7 PJ (48 million m3) surplus in natural gas production over the year 2015. The increase in nuclear heat generation and particularly the rise in renewable energy production supports the climate-friendly transformation of the Hungarian energy system. In consideration of Hungary's geographical characteristics, energy production from biogenic sources (biomass from forestry and                                                       147 In 2018 Hungary's natural gas production approximated 2 billion m3. Source: Mining and Geological Survey of Hungary  agriculture, biogas, agro-fuels), geothermal and thermal energy, and solar energy are the main sources of renewable energy in Hungary. Owing to the above trends, the composition of Hungarian energy production significantly changed. The share of lignite within energy production equalled 29 % in 1990, but only 16 % in 2005; its current share decreased to below 12 %. A similar trend characterised the share of hydrocarbons in recent years: the share of natural gas in 1990 equalled 26 %, falling to 21 % in 2005 and to 13 % in 2017, while the share of crude oil decreased from 16 % (1990) to 13 % (2005), and eventually to 9 % (2017). The share of energy production from nuclear and renewable sources, however, significantly increased: their combined share reached 65 % in 2017 (36.7 % nuclear, 28.6 % renewable energy).

The composition of Hungary's primary energy consumption significantly increases risks inherent to the Dependence on foreign markets is highest in relation to the purchase of hydrocarbons, where import dependency exceeds 80 %. Although the import dependency rate is higher for oil, the efficiently operating global and regional oil market, the availability of transmission alternatives (pipelines or rail/road), alternatives to pipeline supply (Friendship and Adria pipelines)148 and the emergency oil stockpiling system guarantee efficient pricing and a high level of a security of supply on the Hungarian market. The security of supply is further strengthened by the dominant regional market position of MOL, which has a minority State shareholding. Risks underlying the security of supply are much higher in relation to natural gas, as most of natural gas is imported from Russian sources149. Although the high level of exposure                                                       148 In 2017, 80 % of imported oil (total imports: 9.8 million tonnes) was supplied from Russia, indicating a decline compared to a 95 % dependence on Russian imports in 2012. The recent reconstruction of the Adria pipeline enabled the reduction of dependence on Russian imports and use of new sources of oil supply for Hungary. Owing to the are received through Slovakia. 149 In recent years the largest share of natural gas imports  accounting for around two thirds of domestic consumption  is imported from Russia, but the remaining share on the Hungarian market is - on a molecular basis - also natural gas of Russian origin.  to natural gas imports is offset by flexibility150 provided by Hungary's commercial and strategic gas storage facilities (for details see Chapter 4.5.3), high exposure to imports, dependence on a single supplier, and the central role of Ukrainian transits expose Hungary to price volatility on international markets and to risks inherent to the security of supply. Exposure can be mitigated with a diversified supply portfolio  including the full exploitation of Hungarian conventional and unconventional natural gas reserves and renewable resources, and maintained levels of nuclear capacities, in addition to diversifying import sources  and with energy efficiency measures. The electricity market is also characterised by growing import dependency (~30 %), with a 32-33 % annual rise in the share of net imports within final energy consumption since 1998, with fluctuations. The high import requirement, however, does not cause short-term risks in the security of supply, as the high rate of net imports is accompanied by strong network interconnectivity; the level of import capacities available from the 6 neighbouring countries equals around 50 % of total Hungarian installed power plant capacity, which is significantly higher than the 15 % target value set by the EU. Hungary's lignite reserves and lignite mining are substantial relative to own consumption, nevertheless on average one third of Hungary's coal/lignite consumption is satisfied with imports.

Following the sharp decline caused by the regime change and the increase measured in the middle of the decade, energy consumption in the Hungarian economy declined from 2005. Recent years, however, are again revealing a rising trend: between 2014 and 2017 final energy consumption increased each year from 662.7 PJ to 752.5 PJ. The consumption level in 2017 falls short of the level in 2005 by a small margin (760.5 PJ). The highest increase was observed in relation to oil (33.3 PJ / 0.8 Mtoe) and natural gas (30.7 PJ / 0.87 billion m3) between 2014 and 2017, but electricity consumption also rose by 13.5 PJ (3.75 TWh). Hungary's consumption of thermal energy has also increased since 2014, from 38 PJ to 45.5 PJ. The composition of final energy consumption  similarly to the composition of primary energy production  changed significantly during the past two decades. While Hungary covered 11 % of energy consumption with coal in 1990, today the share of coal/lignite has diminished to a few per cent. The downturn in coal consumption was accompanied by a significant rise in natural gas consumption. The share of natural gas within the energy mix was highest in 2004 (44.2 %); by 2017 the share of gas within final energy consumption dropped to 32.5 %, with moderate fluctuations. The share of oil within the energy mix generally moved between 25 % and 30 % during the relevant period, although this energy source had a share of around 29-30 % in final energy consumption in recent years (20142017). The share of electricity increased from 14.3 % to 18.4 % between 1990 and 2017; during the same period the share of  renewable energy consumption within final energy consumption rose from 3.7 % to 11.6 %151. (It peaked in 2013 with 14.9 %.) In recent years Hungary's thermal energy consumption accounted for 5-6 % of final energy consumption.

According to the definition of Eurostat, gross final energy consumption is the total energy requirement and energy consumption of a country, which includes final energy consumption, power plant own consumption, network loss -explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Gross_inland_energy_consumption)  Megújuló energia Renewable energy  The household (retail), transport and industrial sectors account for the three largest shares within the energy consumption structure. Energy consumption in the household sector152 accounts for the largest share of final energy consumption, equalling 35 % in 2017 within total final energy consumption for energy purposes (263.7 PJ), which is 3.3 percentage points less than in 2005 (38.4 %, 291.8 PJ). The transport sector is ranked second (a 25.2 % share in 2017), closely followed by the industrial sector (24.2 % in 2017). The services sector (including commercial activities) consumes one tenth of energy, while the combined share of the other sectors fell short of 4 % (3.6 %) in 2017.

Kereskedelem és egyéb szolgáltatások Commerce and other services Közlekedés Transport Ipar Industry  In 2017 natural gas (47.3 %) accounted for the largest share of household energy consumption, followed by renewable sources of energy (26 %)  mainly solid biomass  and electricity (15.4 %). This ranking is continued with district heat (7.9 %), coal (2.3 %) and petroleum products (basically propane-butane gas  1.2 %). Based on HEA data153, heating (74 % in 2017) accounts for three fourths of Hungarian household energy consumption. DHW production is also a common source of energy consumption (12 %). Lighting and use of electronic devices account for 9.4 % of consumed energy. Cooking and cooling have a share of 4.5 %, with minimal consumption for cooling (0.1 %). The latter is expected to increase significantly. Based on Eurostat data, the share of oil within the transport sector remains high; the share of oil and petroleum products within final energy consumption approximated 93 % in 2017 as well. In this ranking, oil is followed by renewable energy (3 %), electricity (2.3 %) and natural gas (1.5 %). Gas (34.3 %, consisting of 31.3 % natural gas and 2.9 % gas works gas) and electricity (33.1 %) are dominant in industrial energy consumption. Composition of final energy consumption in 2017: oil (15.3 %), district heat (8.3 %), renewable sources of energy (4.1 %), coal (3.2 %) and non-renewable waste (1.7 %). Natural gas is dominant in the services sector (54.3 %), but the share of electricity (33.2 %) and district heat (8.3 %) is also considerable. In 2017 renewables accounted for only 2.5 %, and the combined share of oil and non-renewable waste was below 2 %. ii. Projections of development with existing policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) Primary domestic energy consumption is expected to exceed 30 Mtoe in 2030 (1 284 PJ). This is a 15 % increase compared to 2017. Much of the increase may be attributable to the generation of the new nuclear power plant units that will replace the substantial electricity imports in 2017; as a result, transformation (repowering) loss must be settled in Hungary. Hungary is expecting a declining trend, however, between 2030 and 2040. Primary energy consumption is expected to be around 23.4 Mtoe (1 189 PJ) in 2040. (Point iii. of Chapter 4.3 and Annex 3 provide detailed results of forecasting primary energy consumption, including the sectoral breakdown.) Final energy consumption  based on the new European methodology  will not exceed 785 PJ in 2030.                                                       153 http://mekh.hu/download/5/13/90000/8_1_Haztartasok_felhasznalasa_eves.xlsx  (Point iii. of Chapter 4.3 and Annex 3 also summarise detailed results of forecasting final energy consumption.) With a ten- dependency is expected to decline. By guaranteeing the predictability of the concession scheme and enhancing the flexibility of the system Hungary can achieve a rise in domestic hydrocarbon production. In an optimal scenario, in 2030 we can expect domestic conventional natural gas production and unconventional production to reach 2.4 billion m3 and around 35 million m3, respectively. A sharp upturn in unconventional natural gas production is expected after 2030; production output may reach 270 million m3 by 2040. The Hungarian electricity sector will undergo substantial transformation during the projected period. Upon analysis of the medium and long-term changes in power plant installed capacities and their forecasts, the analysis of MAVIR Zrt. established that the fate of existing Hungarian power plants, their expected shutdown and decommissioning will be determined by shareholder decisions in due time and manner, after appropriate analysis of the electricity market. The new power plants are needed in the next two decades mainly to replace the shut down units and only to a lesser extent on grounds of growing electricity demand. The nominal gross electric capacity of all Hungarian power plants operating today is expected to significantly decrease by 2033. According to the analysis, current capacity of around 8 600 MW will decrease to around 6 800 MW in five years, with approximately 4 500 MW remaining by 2033, the end of the reviewed -term entry capacity increases of the  New capacities, however, will also be connected to the system. As a result of engaging the new power plant unit capacities of 2 400 MW in production and integrated renewable and other capacities, production may increase from 35 GWh to 57 GWh between 2020 and 2030, and Hungary may become self-sufficient. Import dependency is expected in the longer term (due to the disconnection of the Paks 1 units from the system).
