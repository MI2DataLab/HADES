16  SECTION A: NATIONAL PLAN 1. OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN 1.1. Executive summary 1.1.1. i. Political, economic, environmental, and social context of the plan Cyprus national energy and climate plan (NECP) has been drawn up to perform the requirement laid down in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, in accordance with which each Member State must prepare and submit to the Commission their national energy and climate plan. In October 2014, The European Council endorsed 4 targets on the 2030 climate and energy policy framework at EU level: (a) a binding EU target of 40% less greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990; (b) a target of at least 32% renewable energy consumption; (c) a 32.5% improvement in energy efficiency; (d) an electivity interconnection of at least 15%. On energy security, the European Council endorsed further measures to reduce the EU's energy dependence and increase the security of its electricity and gas supplies. Moreover, under EU legislation adopted in May 2018, EU Member States have to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions from land use, land use change or forestry are offset by at o 2030. The Regulation on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) into the 2030 climate and energy framework was adopted by the Council on 14 May 2018, following the European Parliament vote on 17 April 2018. The Regulation implements the agreement between EU leaders in October 2014 that all sectors should contribute to the EU's 2030 emission reduction target, including the land use sector. It is also in line with the Paris Agreement, which points to the critical role of the land use sector in reaching our long-term climate mitigation objectives. At national level, the drafting of Ministries' Strategic Plans in 2014 with the first reference period 2015-2017 began. These strategic plans have been drafted at Ministry level and are reviewed annually. The annual review concerns the strategic plans for the next financial period, which is the Medium Term Financial Framework and covers a period of three years. Strategic plans include (A) at ministry level: mission, vision, values, strategic pursuits and (B) at ministry / department / service level of each ministry: objectives, activities, performance indicators, performance indicators and costing of goals, objectives and activities of each Department, which is budgeted. Along with the preparation of the budget for each subsequent year and the three-year Medium Term Financial Framework, Activity-Based 17  Budgeting is also included so that this costing can be included in the strategic plans of each MinistrCouncil of Ministers and then submitted to the House of Representatives along with the -the budget based on strategic plans. It is noted that when implementing the budget, the objectives and activities of each Department are also estimated. The strategic documents relevant to the climate and energy policy are the following: (a) National strategy and action plan for the adaptation to climate change; adopted in May 2017 by the Council of Ministers (decision no. 82.555) (b) National Action Plan for the improvement of air quality in Cyprus; adopted in May 2018 (c) EU Council conclusions of 13/12/2019 on climate neutrality by 2050 Long-term preparatory work preceded drafting of all of these plans, with the participation of experts from enterprises, research and development institutions, local governments and their representative organisations. The support of SRSS was used with several studies (Appendix 1) that started from 2015 in order to assist Cyprus to reform the Energy System. In addition, a strategic assessment of the environmental impact of these development documents was conducted. Events that were related to drafting the plan were mainly public, and all of the materials related to the drafting of the plan were published on webpages of the Energy Service and the Department of Environment. Having regard the provisions of Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary System Law (Law No. 20(I)/2014), the implementation of the fiscal measures of the NECP is subject to the approval of the annual Budgets and the three year Medium Term Budgetary Framework. The Impact Assessment was carried out through a technical support study funded by the European Union via the Structural Reform Support Service (SRSS) and implemented by a consortium of local universities and research organisations. The consortium was led by the Cyprus University of Technology and also included the Cyprus Institute and the University of Cyprus. All the deliverables of the above study are available at the MECI website1. The analysis for the impact assessment was based on detailed modelling of the energy system of the country, which was mainly conducted with the OSeMOSYS optimisation model2, for the two scenarios explored in the NECP  the scenario With Existing Measures (WEM) and the scenario with Planned Policies and Measures (PPM). Results of OSeMOSYS were then fed into other models to assess macroeconomic, employment and welfare impacts of the two scenarios. Additionally, a Strategy Environmental Impact Assessment has been carried out for the draft NECP and has been examined under the relevant legal framework.                                                             1 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/EnergySe.nsf/All/4CFADF62B303D228C22584D6004AAB42?Ope nDocument 2 M.

Strategy relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union The implementation of the energy policy while attaining the climate and environmental targets requires a radical transformation of the energy system over the next decade and, therefore, the implementation of significant investments in energy infrastructure as well as in energy efficiency. Major investments have been planned and scheduled in renewable energy, in the transformation of the network and the introduction of smart meters in power distribution, in power transmission networks, in importing and using natural gas for increasing energy efficiency in power generation, in the energy efficiency in households, businesses, public sector and water sector, in transport infrastructures and sustainable mobility as well as in technological research. The national targets for the next decade are looked into in detail in this national climate and energy plan (NECP) on a mid-term basis, up to 2030, and should serve as a basis for an ambitious long-term strategy aiming towards the minimisation of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Therefore, the decarbonisation dimension is the first and foremost component of the NECP structure. The national plan elaborates on the five dimensions of the Energy Union, i.e. decarbonisation (which is broken down into two distinct sections: greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy sources), energy efficiency, security of energy supply, internal energy market, and research, innovation and competitiveness. In preparing this plan, a significant contribution was made by the technical working groups, which, in accordance with the Council of Ministers Decision No. 83.709, provided the required data, developed and processed the relevant sections. This procedure represented essentially the initial stage of consultation with technical experts from all relevant stakeholders playing an institutional role in respect of the topics discussed, which helped ensure the integrity and completeness of this plan. The groups drafted this plan under the supervision of the NECP technical committee. The 13% Renewable Energy Sources (RES) goal for 2020 will be overachieved by Cyprus, despite the fact that the 10% RES in Transport target will be more difficult to be achieved. The new RES targets of 23% by 2030 can also be reached.  The main driver for the further increase of RES in electricity sector (RES-e) is the market parity which was already been achieved. Thus, in Cyprus, electricity from renewable sources is no more promoted through subsidies since 2013, where a net metering scheme and self-consumption has been put in place. In addition, the new schemes3 that were announced in the period 2017-2019 will also operate through the market mechanisms, once those will be put in force. As it was highlighted through a number of studies that were carried out in the process of formulating the NECP and presented in the following chapters, the penetration of RES-e can reach the maximum limit at a very early period, 2023-2024, due to various technical constraints that are related to the isolated nature of the electricity system of                                                            3 -billing scheme for PVs and Biomass (CHP) plants and (2) Commercial RES Plans, the projects of which will participate in the competitive electricity market. 19  Cyprus. After the above period and if Cyprus remains electrically isolated from other electricity networks, the penetration from RES-e will only be increased once RES-e, coupled with storage technologies, materialises. Based on the analysis performed this will be achieved in the post 2030 period. It should be highlighted that in the PPM Scenario with electricity interconnection, the RES-e can exceed the 50% of RES penetration in 2030, while in the case without interconnection the RES-e penetration can reach only 30%.  In addition, renewable heating and cooling (RES H&C) is promoted by support schemes offering grants to households and through obligatory measures to new buildings. The new policy and measures described in the relevant chapters will enable Cyprus to meet the indicative targets in RES H&C, provided that the appropriate funding will be available. RES in Transport (RES-t) will be the most challenging sector. Achieving the 14% RES target, is also affected by the electricity interconnection, since the less penetration of RES-e, cannot contribute to the desired level of transport electrification from RES. Further measures in the RES-t sector are the introduction of support schemes for local biofuels production from waste, modal shift measures through public transport and the introduction of natural gas in the transport sector. The government future plans to exploit its own natural gas reserves could further support the use of natural gas also by CNG/LNG vehicles. With reference to energy efficiency, a number of polices and measures are described in the relevant chapters that will enable Cyprus to meet its national obligatory target on energy savings at end use by 2030. Cyprus strengthened the focus on energy efficiency in the transport sector by increasing the span of policies and measures related to this specific sector. The national indicative contribution to the EU 2030 energy efficiency target has been increased, taking into account the objectives derived from other dimensions of the energy union as well as the national characteristics and the cost-effective energy efficiency potential in all sectors. In the area of energy security, the introduction of natural gas via Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) imports and the development of the necessary infrastructure to import natural gas to Cyprus In addition, Cyprus actively promotes two other important projects of common interest, the end to energy isolation.  As far as the internal energy market is concerned and regarding the competitive electricity market, in 2020 and 2021 it is expected that a number of key projects that are under tendering or implementation will materialize and interconnected, so that electricity is traded on competitive terms, based on the design principles of the Regulation (EU) 2019/943 on the internal market for electricity as applied for Cyprus (Article 64). The completion of the two primary systems, i.e. the Meter Data Management System (MDMS) (completion est. December 2020) and the Market Management System (MMS) (completion est. Oct. 2021) will signify the operation of the competitive electricity market based on the Trade and Settlement Rules v.2.1.0. In parallel, the DSO is in the process of initiating the roll out the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) with 400.000 smart meters (installation will be 20  completed within 7 years) together with a better control of the distribution system (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition/Advanced Distribution Management System -SCADA/ADMS). All the above systems are a prerequisite for the gradual removal of barriers of entry for new electricity market participants and technologies (active customers, citizen energy communities, aggregators, demand response).  Research and Innovation (R&I) has a significant role in the national efforts to improve energy efficiency and energy security, increase the share of renewable energy and tackle climate change. At the same time the best possible production of research work that will provide innovative products and services can add value to businesses and provide useful insights for innovation which constitutes 0.that investments in R&I will rise up to 1.5% of GDP by 2023, thus an annual spending of  The target is also to raise private share in spending from 43% that it was in 2017, to 50% by 2023. Public funding will have the expected results only if it is combined with other measures that will support entrepreneurship in innovation and start-ups. The aim is to bring closer researchers and businesses in order to work together for producing innovative products and services in energy sector. During the NECP drafting and taking into account the Strategic Energy and Technology Plan (SET  Plan) and the Cyprus Smart Specialization Strategy, gave the opportunity for stakeholders to identify priority areas in R&I that will respond to the national targets for decarbonisation, as well as to the market needs. Furthermore, stakeholder engagement has resulted in a number of existing barriers and ideas to overcome them. The newly formed National R&I Governance System is expected to address many of the existing barriers, however further measures with the aim of more effective use of public funding in R&I in energy and climate will be examined up to the next revision of NECP.  Finally, it should be noted, that the final national climate and energy plan for 2030 and the long-term low-carbon strategy will serve as a basis for preparing regulatory acts and instruments, developing strategic plans and implementing financial instruments and tools, towards its implementation. 1.1.3. iii. Overview table with key objectives, policies and measures of the plan Figure 1.1 shows the quantitative targets in the context of attaining the national energy and climate objectives for 2030. Accordingly, Table 1.1 lists the key policy priorities for each dimension of the national climate and energy plan, which are deemed necessary for attaining these objectives. These policy priorities are the axes for developing specific measures under each dimension. All these policy priorities and the specific measures resulting from their implementation are part of an integrated plan for the optimal attainment of the national energy, environmental, socio-economic and development objectives, which requires consistency, horizontal combination and coordination in monitoring the priorities and implementing the measures. A key requirement for attaining the objectives set out in the context of NECP is to 21  understand that the progress made in each individual sector automatically affects that made in the other sectors, and consequently the impact of the measures that are finally planned and implemented does not relate to or affects just one topic and section of the NECP, but has an impact on the overall development of the energy system.  * compared to the respective projection for Cyprus in the 2007 in the EU PRIMES 2007 Reference Scenario Figure 1.1: National energy and environmental objectives for the period 2021-2030 in the context of EU policies Table 1.1: Key policy measures planning priorities PILAR Key policy planning priorities GHG emissions and removals  Promotion of natural gas as intermediate fuels for the decarbonisation of the energy system  Promotion of renewable energy sources  Improvement of energy efficiency in buildings, industry and infrastructure  Reduction of emissions in the transport sector  Reduction of fluorinated gas emissions  Reduction of emissions from agricultural sector  Reduction of emissions from waste sector  Increase carbon sinks Renewable energy sources  Various RES Support schemes for Self-Consumption  Synergies with other sectors (Energy Efficiency, Waste, Security of supply and Internal Energy Market) to promote RES in all energy sectors  Support schemes for RES to participate in the Electricity Market Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and environmental objectives Emissions in the non-ETS sectors to be reduced by 20.9% compared to 2005.

As far as Heating and Cooling is concerned, there is an indicative target of an increase in RES H&C by 1% per year. Both the transport and the heating and cooling targets will be very challenging to achieve, since considerable investments and EU funding will be needed in order to reach the desired levels.  Based on the scenario with existing measures, Cyprus originally set a 19% share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy in 2030. This level of ambition was increased significantly with the new proposed policies and measures to reach 23% in 2030, also in accordance with the relevant EC Recommendation. An overview of the RES policies and measures is listed in Table 3.6 where investments for RES will take place in all three sectors (Electricity, Heating and Cooling and Transport). For Electricity sector the investments without any financial support but with the appropriate framework (revised market rules) will contribute to the RES targets. In the Heating and cooling sector, since there is a saturation for Solar water heaters more emphasis will be given to heat-pumps in the residential sector, while towards the end of the period it seems to be some technical and economic potential for district heating systems in the two tourism areas. Electricity Increased investments in RES Electricity sector (mainly PV, Wind and Biomass) will take place in PPM scenario with total accumulative investments up to 2030 to 1 billion Euros as per Table 1.2. The need of storage systems (both behind and after the meter) is also included in the above tables, but their need might be limited if the Cyprus will get electrically interconnected by 2023. Table 1.2: Annualised investments and fixed costs (Million EUR2016) in RES Electricity Sector (million )  2021 2025 2030 Total 2021-2030 Primary energy production (ktoe), 2021-2030 Annualised investments 40 80 128 838 2853 Fixed costs 14 24 29 235   24  Heating and Cooling Continued investments in renewable energy technologies in buildings, as well as investments in heat pumps lead to an increase in the renewable energy share in the heating and cooling sector. The significant Renewable Energy share increase projected until 2030 will be mainly driven by solar thermal technologies and heat pumps in buildings, while an increase in district heating network is projected during the end of the period. The total estimated investments for the period 2021-2030 will need to increase to 910 million euros, as annual investment cost, cumulative up to 2030. The RES share foreseen in the heating and cooling sector increases and reaches 39% in 2030.  Transport The total investments in the transport sector will contribute to all sectors - RES, energy efficiency and to the reduction of CO2 emissions using less pollutant fuels. It is estimated -900m (2016 prices) to develop a tram line in Nicosia and significantly improve the public transport service and an addsustainable transport will be needed in the period up to 2030. Provided investments (including EU funding) are secured, the RES-t share (using the SHARE methodology) has been estimated to rise to 14.1% in 2030. Energy Efficiency For reaching the cumulative end use savings target for 2030, a mixture of policies and measures will be implemented in all sectors of the economy. These include, inter alia, regulatory and financing measures for households, services and industrial sector, action plan for reducing energy consumption in transport sector, measures in water sector as well as cross-cutting measures such as energy and CO2 taxes, energy efficiency obligation schemes, as well as informative and capacity building measures.  Increased energy efficiency investments especially in the transport sector seem to be the most challenging ones, as it will require considerable EU funding. More market-oriented financial support scheme will be definitely a challenge and mobilization of the appropriate financial and market instruments will be required. The estimated national and EU funds transport sector and more th 1.2. Overview of current policy situation  1.2.1. i. National and Union energy system and policy context of the national plan The national policy framework within the framework of the national energy and climate plan is governed by the respective EU framework for the implementation of which a sufficiently broad regulatory national framework has been developed. In the context of the NECP, the basic key regulatory and statutory framework is set out in the respective sections of the text. 25  1.2.2. ii. Current energy and climate policies and measures relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union 1.2.2.1. Decarbonisation - GHG emissions and removals The policies and measures currently implemented consist of a mixture of policy measures from different categories (technical, regulatory and financial). The energy related policy measures already implemented with a view to reducing greenhouse gas emissions are presented in detail in the subsections that follow. Generally, policy measures to utilize natural gas and promote renewable power generation make the most significant contribution towards reaching the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Also, policy measures for the implementation of energy efficiency improvement measures, especially in transport, along with improvements in waste management towards circular economy also make a significant contribution towards attaining the objective for 2030. Directives 2010/75/EU and 2015/2193/EU, read in conjunction with the decisions on best available techniques have introduced strict emission ceilings (primarily, but not only, for SO5, NOx and PM2.5) for power plants. These ceilings pose significant difficulties in the effort made by existing plants to comply at a reasonable cost, thus constituting an additional constraint. Finally, additional indirect constraints are introduced by the Framework Directive on Waste (Directive 2008/98/EC), as amended by Directive 2018/851/EU, as well as by the draft Directive on the market in electricity. Businesses A new financial support scheme is currently in development that is planned for implementation for 2020 to 2022, to encourage business to take measures towards their reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The scheme started as an initiative, 4 through which the Cyprus Employers and Industrialists Federation, the Cyprus University of Technology and the Department of Environment of the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment, aimed to commit businesses to more actively involved in climate action by reducing their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 8% until 2030 through a voluntary commitment. Currently there are 64 signatories.  Energy Further details are provided in the sections that follow. Policies to reduce emissions from conventional power plants contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the coming period. The most important policy measure relevant to electricity production concerns import and utilisation of natural gas for electricity production.                                                            4 http://www.oeb.org.cy/en/drasis/business4climate/ 26  Promoting RES is a top policy priority to move towards the decarbonisation of the economy. All measures for the penetration of RES in electricity generation, in heating and in transport contribute to this objective.  The implementation of energy efficiency improvement measures, which have been included in the policies for improving energy efficiency in all sectors, also contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Transport The Amendment of the Motor Vehicles and Road Traffic Law (Law 100(I)/2013) for revision of the vehicle taxes and annual circulation taxes, a measure that relates to the tax imposed on vehicles with a view to reducing CO2 emissions, which has been in force since 2014. The latest amendment was decided on 29 March 2019 and has revised the method of calculating the motor vehicle registration fees beyond the CO2 parameter. More specifically, higher fees are now charged for vehicles emitting more than 120 g/km. Furthermore, an additional fee  This action further promotes the use and purchase of low emission vehicles, including zero emissions vehicles. At the same time, incentives for the purchase and use of low/zero emission vehicles including the old vehicle scrapping scheme and financial incentives for the purchase of  million and will come into force in 2020.  Moreover, the Integrated Fleet Management System (Central Government vehicles) includes the installation of an Integrated Fleet Management System by the Department of Electrical and Mechanical Services, on approximately 1800 government owned vehicles. The system was installed in 2017 and i7 million. This measure aims amongst other benefits, to utilise the vehicle refuelling data to compare and high fuel consumption vehicles and replace them where necessary. For the promotion of the use of electric cars, the Electricity Authority of Cyprus has deployed a total of 19 recharging stations accessible to the public in Cyprus. Furthermore, the Department of Electromechanical Services is proceeding with the installation of 10 double fast-charging stations in highways and public roads. This action will be completed in 2020 and its total  million. 3 additional charging stations will be installed by the Public Works Department in 2020 through the European Programme EnernetMob. Regarding public transport, new bus concessions are planned to be put in force in 2020 and will further improve the system. The increase of the use of buses that have low or zero GHG emissions will be implemented for the contract period 2020-2030. Furthermore, the new bus contracts include specific requirements for the use of electric buses and provision for source is available in Cyprus and the prerequisites for doing so exist.  Additionally, towards the improvement of the efficiency of the public transport system, the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Works, has installed a telematic system that manages the bus services and records data. The related website and mobile application contain a detailed map of the routes and the timetable of buses in order to facilitate passengers in real time. This action was completed in 2018 and its cost was approximately  million, including maintenance for 5 years.  27  Concerning biofuels their use was 2.5% at the end of September 2019, and is currently at 5% (December 2019). These percentages will be increased in 2020 in order to meet the obligatory targets. A support scheme is currently under development by the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment for the promotion of local production of biofuels. It is expected to be ready for implementation in 2020 for the period 2020-2022. LPG vehicles were seen as a possible short-term solution, as the construction of 25 LPG fuel stations was planned within the next years and conversions from petrol cars are often cost efficient. Currently, there are only 8 LPG fuel stations moment and the impact of LPG on the RES goals is negligible. A further development of the technology is not foreseen in the long term  as more efficient technologies using RES such as e-mobility take over. Moreover, the import of natural gas and future plans to exploit the reserves of natural gas, located in its economic exclusive zone, could support the promotion of CNG/LNG vehicles instead of LPG vehicles. The cost for this action is covered by private investments. Fluorinated gases The New EU F-gas Regulation adopted in 2014 and applies from 1 January 2015, aims among others in preventing emissions of F-gases from existing equipment by requiring leakage checks, proper serving and recovery of the gases at the end of the equipment's life. For the full implementation of this regulation in Cyprus a proper recovery system needs to be setup and used in Cyprus. Given the high GWP of the F-gases, and their increasing contribution to the national emissions, it is considered crucial for proper recovery to be implemented within the following years. Under the provisions of Article 9 of Regulation 517/2014/EC, on fluorinated greenhouse gases, without prejudice to existing Union legislation, Member States shall encourage the development of producer responsibility schemes for the recovery of fluorinated greenhouse gases and their recycling, reclamation or destruction. Cyprus has recently adopted and harmonized the above Regulation into Cypriot Law 62(I)/2016 and 46(I)/2017. The next step  responsibility scheme. The main provision principle and each producer has to participate in an appropriate scheme for management of f-gases that have been recovered for any reason.  At the same time, certified technicians will be encouraged to return to the scheme any fluorinated gases the have recovered, for a pre-decided profit, through the development of a financial support scheme which is currently designed. Its implementation is expected to start in 2021 for the period 2021-2022. The goal is to achieve 5% recovery by 2030. Agriculture The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) promotes sustainable food production, sustainable farm management and environmentally and climate-friendly practices and methods. The measures that implemented aim at preventing desertification, improving water management, reducing the intensity of natural resources, optimising the use of agricultural land, reducing the use of fertilisers and improving animal waste management, where special 28  emphasis is given to the promotion of anaerobic digestion for the treatment of animal waste. In addition, the Rural Development Programme promotes forestry, which also increases the absorption from the LULUCF sector. Currently, the contribution of measures other than anaerobic digestion overall emissions/absorption balance cannot and have not been estimated. Anaerobic digestion technology may help to address two congressional concerns that have some measure of interdependence: development of clean energy sources and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Anaerobic digestion, as a way of converting biomass to energy, has been practiced for hundreds of years. It is a technology that helps to reduce waste, generate energy and cut down on carbon emissions. The general performance of anaerobic digesters and the diversity of wastes which they can treat have been increasing steadily as a result of new reactor design, operating conditions, or the use of specialised microbial consortia, during the last decades. In Cyprus there are currently operating more than 10 anaerobic digesters, of which the majority is at large animal farms. All available studies show that there is a great potential in Cyprus to further promote anaerobic digestion for the treatment of waste with high organic content.  Even though anaerobic digestion is not clearly stated in the European or national legislation, the technology is preferred by large animal farms to comply with the terms stated on the wastewater and air emissions permits. The technology is strongly promoted by the Department of Environment, especially for the large installations that fall under the Industrial Emissions directive. Relevant national legislation that encourages the promotion of anaerobic digestion is (a) the Control of Water Pollution (Waste Water Disposal) on (Sensitive Areas for to increase. Therefore it is considered important to further promote the use of anaerobic digestion for the treatment of animal waste (target for 2030: 11.5% for cattle waste, 5% for sheep and goat waste, 22.8% for poultry waste and 66% for pig waste). Waste A package of policy measures are contributing towards reducing the quantities of biodegradable waste in solid waste treatment facilities. Measures are promoted for the separate collection of bio-waste, recycling and energy recovery through anaerobic digestion. These measures are primarily aimed at the reduction of the quantities of biodegradable waste in solid waste treatment facilities, not only for electricity and thermal energy generation (e.g. biogas production), but also for recycling. The above measures, which have already been launched in the framework of the National Municipal Waste Management Strategy, will be intensified in the period 2021-2030, as National Planning is currently being revised under the EU circular economy package and the new waste Directives. With the EU Waste Framework Directive being the main guiding force, in conjunction with the need to improve the waste management infrastructure of the country to ensure the 29  appropriate management of waste in line with EU obligations and targets, Cyprus has developed and is implementing, as part of its Strategy, the National Municipal Waste Management Plan of 2015-2021 which is currently undergoing a major revision. The implementation of the Plan is the responsibility of the Department of Environment. The National Municipal Waste Management Plan of 2015-2021 (MWMP) contains quantitative and qualitative targets and enumerates specific measures and actions to be taken in order for the EU targets to be reached. One of the quantitative target is that no more than 95,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste to be disposed in landfills (represents the 35% target of the 1999/31/EC directive). Also the Legal Measures will be focused on the: - Development of local waste prevention and management schemes  - Mandatory obligation for the establishment of separate collection systems by local authorities,  - Establishment of extended producer responsibility (EPR) for streams other than packaging waste,  - Establishment of a landfill tax/levy, - Banning the disposal of certain waste streams from entering into landfills (e.g. green waste, high calorific value waste, etc.) The following measures have so far been implemented:  a) One Sanitary Landfill and one Residual Sanitary Landfill (supplementing MBT unit at Koshi) were constructed and operated (both meet the requirements of directive 99/31/EC). The MBT unit has been in operation since 2010 serving the Larnaca - Ammochostos districts. The Plant was designed in a way that a high separation of recycled and biodegradable material is achieved. Another I.W.M.P (Integrated Waste Management Plant) serving the Limassol district came into operation in 2017. b) The construction of the Green Points Network (22 collection points for various household waste streams bulky waste, green, textile, furniture, WEEE, etc.) has been completed and all Green Points are now in operation.  c) Currently, there is a system for the separate collection of packaging waste from households, operated by the collective system which has been established under the Packaging Directive. The system carries out door-to-door collection in most urban centres, with a number of smaller communities serviced by central collection points. Draft Regulations have been prepared, as set out in the National Strategy for the Management of Municipal Waste, with a view to their adoption in 2020, which define the obligations of local authorities for the management of municipal waste. The Regulations will provide for the preparation of local waste management plans and waste prevention programmes by the local authorities, the obligatory establishment of separate collection systems for a number of waste streams (specifically paper, glass, plastic and metals, including packaging, wood and synthetic packaging and bulky waste), the obligatory establishment of a separate collection systems for organic waste (including food and garden waste), and the adoption of a pay-as-you-throw scheme.  d) The construction works for the rehabilitation/restoration of the old non approved landfills, which are closed at Paphos and Larnaca - Ammochostos districts, were completed. The preparation of studies/documents regarding the rehabilitation/ restoration of the 20 non sanitary landfills of Nicosia district and the 44 sanitary landfills 30  of Limassol district will be completed within 2018 and after that the construction works will begin. A comprehensive study was undertaken in 2005 for the elaboration of a Strategic Plan, an Environmental study and a Feasibility study for the restoration and management of landfills. The purpose of the study was to record all landfills, assess their status and level of risk, create a restoration priority list based on pollution risk assessments, and undertake the appropriate environmental studies as well as feasibility studies for the restoration of the prioritised landfills. These studies were a necessary step for the restoration of all landfills recorded.  The last two (2) illegal landfills were closed in February 2019 and plans for the restoration are underway. According to recent data, these two landfills were fed with approximately 155,000 ton and 200,000 ton of municipality waste each year respectively (reference year 2012). Sixty two (62) non sanitary landfills are planned to be restored appropriately within the following years. According to the preliminary study contacted in 2005, these landfills contain approximately 597,269 m3 of solid waste excluding 2 major landfills that have not been closed yet. Fifty three (53) landfills have been restored the last five years and are being monitored. During their restoration a total of 4,902,000 m3 of solid waste were reallocated and properly buried using composite liners and leakage collection systems. The key features of the strategy that have been included in the GHG reduction Policies and Measures are the following: - Reduction of waste to solid waste disposal sites from sorting at production level (40% from 2021, 55% in 2025, 60% in 2030). - Reduction of organics to landfills to 15% from 2021. - Introduction of anaerobic digestion for the treatment of organic wastes treated by ( 5% from 2021) An additional measure considered and not included in the solid waste management strategy is biogas recovery from old landfills, during their restoration (20% from 2020). Education, training and public awareness Climate change in the context of formal and non - formal education is an issue of interdisciplinary investigation and interconnected with all the issues of environment and sustainable development as a matter of national, regional and international interest. The consideration of climate change in this context relies on the fact that climate change is not a mono-dimensional problem, cut off from the rest of the issues, but could be the apparent cause and consequence of a chain of direct and indirect human effects on all environmental issues.  Access of environmental information to the public is provided through the websites of the relevant Ministries and other governmental agencies. With the ratification of the Aarhus 31  Convention, Cyprus has posed legal obligations for the access of information regarding the state of the Environment. In addition, law no. 119(I)/2004 by which Cyprus incorporated the legislation, seeks to increase public access and dissemination of information, contributing to a greater public awareness in decision making and environmental protection. According to as: state of elements (among others air, atmosphere, water, coastal areas, biological diversity, and the interactions among them), factors (e.g. emissions, energy), policies and measures, reports, cost-benefit analyses. The Cypriot Government gives high priority to public consultation and awareness. Draft legislation related to climate change, energy and environmental issues are open to public consultation before their adoption. The work on education, training and public awareness is continuous and its contribution has not been assessed with respect to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Further details on the issue are available in the 7th National Communication of Cyprus (Chapter 9)5. 1.2.2.2. Renewable Energy Sources Over the period 2008-2018, the Cyprus Government has developed various support schemes, incentives and soft measures in order to support the Renewable Energy Sources penetration, especially in the electricity sector, where penetration was very low (Table 1.3). The overall 2020 RES target of 13% in final Energy Consumption, set by RES Directive 2009/28/EC, was already achieved in 2018, according to preliminary data from Eurostat6. The same applies for the Heating and Cooling sector, where the 2020 target of 23.5% has been surpassed already in 2018 reaching 36.76%. This performance was mainly due to the use of high efficiency heat-pumps and wood biomass, as well as, to extensive use of solar water heaters. The renewable based electricity production over the past 10 years in Cyprus is listed in the Table 1.4. Table 1.3: Share of Energy from RES according to Directive 2009/28/EC [%] 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2020 RES-E 0.59 1.39 3.45 4.93 6.65 7.40 8.45 8.59 8.91 9.36 16.00 RES-T 2.04 1.99 0.00 0.00 1.13 2.68 2.52 2.69 2.59 2.69 10.00 RES-H&C 17.32 18.84 20.02 21.84 22.62 22.26 24.13 24.54 26.13 36.76 23.50 RES 5.92 6.17 6.26 7.14 8.46 9.17 9.93 9.86 10.49 13.88 13.00                                                               5 https://unfccc.int/documents/64731 6 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/38154/4956088/SUMMARY+partial+provisional+re sults+SHARES+2018/25ce9f29-7053-17c5-12a6-8efe878b6031 32  Table 1.4:  Electricity Generation per Technology until 2018 Electricity production from renewable sources (GWh per year) Solar Wind Biogas Total 2008 2.55 0 11.54 14.09 2009 3.83 0 26.52 30.35 2010 6.39 31.37 35.12 72.88 2011 11.94 114.31 51.61 177.86 2012 21.54 185.48 50.02 257.04 2013 47.11 231.04 48.86 327.01 2014 83.59 182.85 50.55 316.99 2015 126.66 221.86 51.24 399.76 2016 147.65 226.7 52.02 426.37 2017 173.73 211.45 51.91 421.68 2018 195.29 220.61 36.10 452.01 From 2015 onwards, all new RES projects are not receiving any subsidy, while self-consumption schemes do not support any subsidy in electricity prices. For household owners and for those having a building permit prior to 2017, there is a support scheme in operation for the period 2018-2020. The grant support is set at 250 Euro/kW installed, with a increased to 300 Euro/kW. Furthermore, a support scheme for vulnerable consumes is in place since 2013,  Table 1.5 presents an overview of the specific grant schemes and the specific subsidy of the electricity produced from renewable sources in Cyprus over the past 10 years. It is also noted that, as of 2015, all new support schemes for RES electricity production receive a tariff based on the current EAC Fuel Cost, calculated according to the methodology set by CERA7. Once the competitive electricity market operates, the respective projects will receive only the market price based on the market rules.  In the Heating and Cooling sector, support schemes have been implemented for providing economic incentives for the installation of solar water heaters in homes, as well as for major energy upgrading projects in existing buildings, where high efficiency heat-pumps for heating and cooling, as well as solar collectors for heating were also supported. Some pilot and demonstration projects on CSP Technologies for heat storage, heat process and solar cooling were also developed with very promising results.                                                              7 https://www.eac.com.cy/EL/RegulatedActivities/Supply/renewableenergy/resenergypurchas e/Pages/default.aspx Table 1.5: Subsidy per renewable energy source in Cyprus for the period 2008-2019 Specific subsidy of the renewable electricity (EUR/MWh) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014-2019 Solar Households 55% Option 2: contract Commercial 40% Option 2: contract Households 55% Option 2: contract Commercial 40% Option 2:  20kW) Option -150kW) 20 years contract -150kW) 20 years contract Households ( 15 years contract Commercial ( 20 years contract  Commercial -150kW) 20 years contract  No FiT Scheme for net-metering and self-generation for all consumers Households In 2018-2020 Grant support   combined with roof insulation Commercial Capacity based support scheme  Wind   20 years contract 0  20 years contract Capacity based support scheme Biomass contract  20 years contract    Capacity based support scheme Biogas 0  20 years contract Capacity based support scheme Even though the 10% RES target in transport seems more difficult to be achieved, the increase of the use of biofuels decided in 2019, coupled with statistical transfer, will enable Cyprus to achieve the 2020 target. More specifically:  Due to the hot climate, in Cyprus only biofuels (mostly 2nd generation) are used. The percentage of biofuels in transport was 2.69%8 at the end of 2018. This percentage will be increased in 2020 in order to meet the obligatory targets. The suppliers of transport fuels (petrol and diesel) are obliged to blend biofuels to conventional transport fuels in order to achieve the target set by the MECI, which is a percentage of biofuels to whole annual sales of petrol and diesel, in energy content.   Incentives for the purchase and use of low/zero emission vehicles including the old vehicle scraping scheme and financial incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles force in 2020.   The Department of Electromechanical Services is proceeding with the installation of 10 double fast-charging stations in highways and public roads. This action will be Programme EnernetMob, the Public Works Department is planning install another 3 charging stations in 2020.   New bus concessions have been decided and are planned to be put in force in 2020. These will further improve the public transportation system. The increase of the use of buses that have low or zero GHG emissions will be implemented by reducing the average age of the public bus fleet from the current 17 years to 10 years, for the contract period 2020-2030. Furthermore, the new bus contracts include specific requirements for the use of electric buses and provisions for the conversion of l source is available in Cyprus. 1.2.2.3. Energy efficiency The national energy efficiency action plan for 2020 has been updated in 2017. Moreover, in 2013 and 2014 Cyprus has set its national planning in order to achieve the cumulative end use savings obligation under article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive (241.588 toe). The plan has been updated in April 2019 and communicated to the European Commission, based on the progress achieved in the first intermediate reporting period of 2014-2016. The update was prepared in order to take into account new measures that came into force after 2016, existing measures with some changes and other measures launched after 2014. Based on the updated plan, Cyprus will achieve the cumulative end use savings obligation under article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive by 2020. The annual progress is reflected in the annual reports9 submitted to the European Commission. Cyprus has set a list of policies and measures in order to achieve the national energy efficiency obligations by 2020.

Key issues of cross-border relevance Key issues of cross-border interest in the fields of energy and climate focus on the transfer of know-how on policies and measures, on the recognition and planning of the implementation of cross-border energy infrastructures, on cooperation to implement innovative and pilot energy projects, on the functioning of energy markets, on cooperation between information systems, and on cooperation as part of financing programmes. Their implementation often takes place in the context of transnational agreements and transnational memoranda of cooperation/understanding. These transnational partnerships and agreements are designed and finalised in close cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 39  Cyprus promotes regional dialogue on the creation of the necessary energy infrastructure. There is regional cooperation between Cyprus and neighbouring countries for the implementation of three projects of common interest in gas and electricity sectors.  The planned regional gas infrastructure EastMed Pipeline project between Cyprus, Israel and Greece, will connect East Mediterranean with Europe and enhance the energy security and diversification of energy sources. Through the EastMed Pipeline, natural gas will be able to flow from Eastern Mediterranean region to Europe. Moreover, it will create synergies and cooperation between countries of the Eastern Mediterranean area.  EuroAsia Interconnector is a project aiming to end the electricity isolation of Cyprus. It is a cross border interconnector between Greek, Cypriot, and Israeli power grids via submarine HVDC power. The project is at a mature stage and has achieved considerable progress. Through the partnership between Greece, Israel and Cyprus the interconnectivity target will be met. 1.2.4. iv. Administrative structure of implementing national energy and climate policies The institution responsible for energy issues in Cyprus is the Ministry of Energy, Commerce and Industry, while climate change is the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment and in particular the Department of Environment. The Department of Environment has a team of seven officers allocated to climate issues, working both on adaptation and mitigation issues. The Ministry of Energy, Commerce and Industry is also responsible authority for the preparation of the National Energy and Climate Plan, with almost all the personnel within the Department of Energy contributing to the above effort. For the purposes of implementing the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action [(EU) 2018/1999]10 and in particular to set out the necessary foundation for a reliable, inclusive, cost-efficient, transparent and predictable Governance that ensures the achievement of the 2030 and long-term objectives and targets of the Energy Union in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change following the 21st Conference of the gh complementary, coherent, and ambitious efforts by the Union and its Member States, while limiting administrative complexity, a new structure for climate and energy governance has been approved by the Council of Ministers (15/11/2017 decision no. 83.709). The core of this new structure (see Figure 1.                                                           10 Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 40  Development and Environment, the Minister of Energy, Commerce and Industry, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Transport, Communications and Works. The Ministerial Committee is co-chaired by the Minister of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment and the Minister of Energy, Commerce and Industry. This committee has to propose the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) to the Council of Ministers which takes the final decision. The proposal of the NECP is prepared by the Technical Committee, which consists of the Permanent Secretaries of the same Ministries. The Technical Committee also monitors the implementation of the NECP and makes proposals for its revisions when necessary. The Technical Committee is co-chaired by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment and the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Energy, Commerce and Industry. The Technical Committee is consulted by the following seven Expert Working Groups: Decarbonisation, Energy Efficiency, Energy Security, Internal Energy Market, Research, Innovation and Competitiveness, Renewable Energy and Transport. Transport is an additional working group created due to the significant contribution of the sector to the national emissions. Each Working Group has a coordinator. All working groups with the exception of decarbonisation are the responsibility of the Ministry of Energy, Commerce and Industry; decarbonisation is the responsibility of the Department of Environment (Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment). The secretariat of the National Governance System for Climate and Energy is held by the Department of Environment. 1.3. Consultations and involvement of national and Union entities and their outcome 1.3.1. i. Involvement of the national parliament One consultation has taken place in the National Parliament on the National Energy and Climate Plan (June 2019), during which, a detailed presentation was made about the mechanism for drawing up the plan and the description of the measures and policies envisaged to achieve the relevant energy and climate objectives, as well as the amount of investment required to achieve these objectives. The final NECP will be presented to the Parliament once this is submitted to the European Commission. The parliament has also been involved in the preparation of the NECP during the face of the public consultation. 1.3.2. ii. Involvement of local and regional authorities In early October 2019, a bilateral meeting was held with the Union of Cyprus Communities energy and climate, the mechanism for drawing up the plan and the description of the measures and policies envisaged to achieve the relevant energy and climate objectives. The NECP was also presented during a special event organized with the Cyprus Energy Agency for municipalities and communities in late October.  41   Figure 1.2: Structure of the national governance system for Climate and Energy 42  1.3.3. iii. Consultations of stakeholders, including the social partners, and engagement of civil society and the general public All relevant stakeholders were involved in the process for the preparation of the NECP from the summer of 2018, through the activity of the working groups and special meetings held for the NECP with various social partners and the civil society.  Several meetings were held for energy and transport issues  A presentation was given for the party of Movement of Ecologists  Citizens' Cooperation on 20 June 2018, on the obligations in the field of energy and climate, the mechanism for drawing up the plan and the description of the measures and policies envisaged achieving the relevant energy and climate objectives.  Similar presentations were given on from July 2018 to March 2019 to research and academic institutions of Cyprus, trade associations and the scientific and technological chamber of Cyprus.   the field of climate and 10 September 2019. The aim of the workshop was to submit proposals within the framework of the consultation on national priorities and policies for a decade in the areas of Research, Innovation and Competitiveness in the field of Energy in order to keep pace with the cutting-edge technologies and at the same time to combine financial opportunities and capacities, and also to update the institutional requirements. The total number of participants amounted to 34, including representatives from academic and research institutions, youth organisations, industries, private firms and institutions of the public sector.  A series of bilateral meeting were held in October 2019 with several environmental and ecological organisations and movements, including youth, trade associations and the scientific and technological chamber of Cyprus. During these meetings more details were provided on the contents of the NECP.  1st of November 2019, during which the proposed policies and measures were presented in detail, along with the impact assessment. The total number of participants amounted to 97, including parliamentarians, representatives from the associations of stakeholders, civil society organisations, companies active in the energy sector, universities / research centres and natural persons. A second event with the same content was organized in collaboration with the University of Cyprus on the 8th of November 2019 during which live streaming and live radio link was provided.
