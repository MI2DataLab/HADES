317 Chapter 5 OVERVIEW OF IMPACT AND INVESTMENT NEEDS 5.1 Analysis of impact of key national planning policies A specific methodological approach has been developed in the context of this national plan to assess the socio-economic and environmental impact of implementing the policy measures to achieve national targets in quantitative terms. The purpose of this analysis is to take into account all the impact on the evaluation of the development scenarios in the energy sector, thus contributing to making sure that the NECP becomes coherent and transparent, as required, with respect to all the resulting impact of meeting the energy and climate objectives. The quantification of the impact under the draft of the national plan on energy and the climate focuses on the impact of the increase of the participation of renewable energy sources on energy consumption and on the measures and policies for the improvement of energy efficiency in the building sector. The macroeconomic impact of a detailed list of clean energy technologies, RES and energy savings was calculated by means of the input-output method. The input-output tables give a full picture of the flow of products and services in the examined economy for a given year, thus reflecting the relationship between producers and consumers, as well as the interdependencies among businesses. The resulting mathematical formulas permit to examine the impact of a change on one or more economic activities across the economy. The three different matrices found in a standard entry-exit table are the following:  table of intermediate consumption  table of final demand  primary input matrix The relevant input-output table for the Greek economy, which includes 65 economic sectors, was used for the analysis. Additionally, the results relate to the gross macroeconomic effects related to the net energy technologies in question and the analysis takes into account the following macroeconomic effects:  Investment effects linked with the construction and implementation of various technologies, including the installation of the relevant equipment and materials. This type of macroeconomic effect is provisional and created prior to the investment (feasibility study, planning, etc.) and the implementation phases. 318  Effects of the operation and maintenance of the technologies considered. Operating costs also include fuels and electricity used for the operation of the technology considered. This type of macroeconomic effect is permanent and lasts throughout the course of the intervention.  Increased consumption results from the implementation of energy efficiency measures in households following the repayment period. More specifically, this relates to additional available funds for household expenses equal to the economic benefit of energy savings. This creates additional demand for products and services, resulting in permanent macroeconomic effects in the period considered. The analysis does not take into account any effects from the reduction in the activity of traditional/conventional energy economy sectors (e.g. electricity generation, marketing of fuels, etc.), due to reduced energy needs resulting from the energy-saving measures or the replacement of electricity generation by fossil fuels. In addition to the macroeconomic effects of clean energy, its impact on public health was also calculated. Air pollution is an serious cause of death and disease around the world. Health effects include an increase in hospitalisations and an increased risk of premature death. In the context of this analysis, the reduction of emissions is quantified by measure, comparing its performance (based on the resulting emissions) with a situation where the measure is not implemented (base-case scenario). Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) have been used widely since the 1990s to assess the international and/or regional burden from diseases. Given the effects of atmospheric pollutants on human health, the DALY measurement is also used as an indicator for the quantification of the health impact of environmental pollution associated with the burden from diseases. Therefore, in this analysis, the quantification of the benefit from the implementation of the analysed clean energy technologies uses DALY. In accordance with the World Health Organisation (WHO), a DALY can be considered as a lost premature mortality in the population and the Years Lived with Disability (YLD) for people who have a specific health condition.   319 On the basis of the results of these analyses on the socio-economic impact and according to the quantitative data of the objectives achievement scenario, total new investments in the field of electricity generation from RES is expected to result in benefits in domestic added value exceeding EUR 12 billion throughout the operation of such systems. Similarly, there are many benefits to creating direct and indirect jobs due to the development and operation of these projects, as it is estimated that more than 37 thousand new full-time jobs will be created and maintained on a yearly basis throughout the relevant period. The impact on the income of involved employees is also particularly significant, as the implementation of related policies and measures will bring about an increase of EUR 5 0.5 billion. With regard to the effect on public health, the expected benefit is quantified at 19.5 thousand DALY on an annual basis. The key priority of planning with regard to the improvement of the energy efficiency of the building stock in the country is to generate significant macro-economic benefits for the country. The energy upgrade of 15% of Greek homes in the decade 2021-2030 as well as the improvement of the energy efficiency of the building stock by means of interventions in the building envelope, are expected to lead to an increase of more than EUR 8 billion in domestic added value and to the creation and maintenance of more than 22 thousand new full-time jobs annually throughout the year. The increase in the income of involved employees is expected to reach approximately EUR 3.4 billion, and the expected benefits for public health are expected to exceed one thousand DALY on a yearly basis. It should be noted that these estimates are expected to be significantly higher if the effects of investments in more efficient equipment on heating and cooling systems and other appliances are taken into account. Overall, Table 43 presents the estimated impact caused by the projected RES penetration and energy upgrading of the building sector by 2030.   320 Table 43: Impact assessment of RES penetration and energy upgrading of the building sector by 2030. Impact RES Energy upgrading of buildings Increase in domestic added value throughout the lifecycle of the interventions (EUR billion) 12.6 8.1 Increase in the income of involved employees throughout the lifecycle of the interventions (EUR billion) 4.8 3.4 Increase in full-time jobs on a yearly basis (thous. jobs) 37.4 22.0 Public health benefit annually (thousand DALY) 19.5 1.1 The above effects are due to the increase in investment over the period 2021-2030 (Chart 58), as identified by the PRIMES model. Expenditure on energy efficient equipment and energy savings is growing at a faster rate than spending on purchasing energy products, while total spending on final consumers is reduced as a percentage of GDP in the period 2021-2030. Annual investment expenditure remains at relatively high levels in all sectors in the 2021-2030 decade, with buildings and transport spending accounts represent the highest percentage.  321  Chart 58: Evolution of investment expenditure by 2030. 322 It is particularly important that, as a result of the energy simulations, the average cost of electricity generation is reduced during the period 2020-2030, despite the radical change in the electricity generation mix. Moreover, Chart 59 shows the evolution of the various strongly differentiated components of electricity costs. Specifically, the fixed cost of capital and maintenance of plants as well as the average cost of networks are increasing, while the variable fuel and operating costs are significantly reduced.  Chart 59: Evolution of electricity costs by 2030. A key conclusion from this analysis is that the energy transition in the electricity sector is achieved by keeping the average cost of electricity generation stable. The result of this simulation demonstrates the economic competitiveness of the objectives and policies outlined, even at the short and medium term, where, while achieving significant environmental and development benefits, there seems to be no burden on consumers in the context of this energy transition. The impact of energy-saving investments is illustrated by the evolution of energy intensity in the final energy consumption sectors (Chart 60). In fact, policies to improve energy efficiency have succeeded in cancelling the restoration of energy intensity to the pre-crisis levels by offsetting the tendency to increase energy consumption. The improvement in the indicator in the period 2021-2030 is higher in the case of industry and the tertiary sector (decreasing by 25% and 22% respectively), while for the residential and transport sectors, the decrease is 18% and 11%, respectively.  323  Chart 60: Evolution of the energy intensity of the final energy consumption sectors under consideration by 2030.  324 5.2 Existing investment flows and planned investment assumptions regarding planned policy measures Achieving medium-term and long-term national objectives through policy measures in key energy and climate fields as detailed above, will result in significant investments in the development of the country by means of enhancing competitiveness in the economy and in employment. The provision for expected investments in the period 2020-2030, in the basic planning axes of the NECP, is shown in Table 44. These investments are expected to contribute significantly both to national economy and to the protection of consumers from price fluctuations in energy products, through the reinforcement of competition in energy markets.

Circular economy, recycling 5,000 TOTAL 43,800   325 A key tool to support these investments, at least in certain categories of investment measures, will be the new programming period 2021-2027, on the basis of which appropriate financing programmes must be ranked, also taking into account the analysis of available resources. The essential characteristics of the new Programming Period 2021-2027 are the following: I. The existence of necessary appropriate conditions (replacing the ex ante conditionalities of the current period), some of which relate to the energy sector. The fulfilment of the necessary appropriate conditions shall be monitored throughout the programming period and any delays in said fulfilment may create difficulties in the financing of the corresponding projects. II. The increase in the significance of reimbursable aids (given by means of financing tools) and the tendency to reduce grants. The increased use of financing tools will result in an increase in available resources for implementing certain categories of energy projects, thanks to the leverage and recycling of resources. Furthermore, it is made possible to combine resources from Funds with other resources in order to facilitate the financing of the projects. In this context, and according to the proposal of the European Commission on the Multiannual Financial Framework, EUR 19 138 million in constant 2018 prices, or EUR  21 582 million in current prices, are allocated to Greece for the period 2021-2027. These funds are provided by the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDP), the Cohesion Fund and the European Territorial Cooperation. In particular, according to the above proposal, available funds for the ERDF correspond to EUR 10 222 million in constant 2018 prices and for the Cohesion Fund to EUR 3 578 million. The proposal for a regulation concerning the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund stipulates that, for countries with a gross national income lower than 75% of the EU average, at least 30% of ERDF resources must be used for Policy Objective 223, pertaining to energy, the climate and the environment. A significant proportion of the Cohesion Fund resources (around 50%) is expected to be allocated to Policy Objective 2.                                                              23 -carbon Europe, by promoting clean and fair energy transition, green and blue investment,  326 Therefore, it is expected that at least a minimum of EUR 3 066.6 million (at constant 2018 prices) from the ERDF and approximately EUR 1 789 million from the Cohesion Fund (at constant 2018 prices) will be available for this Policy Objective. The rates of co-financing by category of regions for the ERDF, as suggested in the Common Provisions Regulation, are as follows:  70% for the least-developed  55% for transition regions  40% for the more developed Please note that all Greek regions fall into the first category, except for Attica and the South Aegean, which are classified as transition regions. The rate of co-financing for the Cohesion Fund as proposed in the Common Provisions Regulation is 70% for all regions. the least developed and transition regions, 81.2% of the ERDF resources are allocated to the least developed regions and 18.8% to the transition regions. In view of the above, an estimate is made of the public resources (EC and national) available for Policy Objective 2. These resources amount to EUR 7 161.2 million at constant 2018 prices. Because of the non-binding timetable for the completion of the negotiation on the regulatory framework, the negotiation on the partnership agreement, and the submission and approval of the programmes, the approval of the programmes of Cohesion Policy 2021-2027 is expected after the first half of 2021. Taking into account the adjustment period of the national institutional and organisational framework, the programmes are expected to be activated at the beginning of 2022. The amount of funding available for the implementation of projects in the Energy Sector and prevention, adaptation and response to climate change will be announced following the adoption of the Operational Programmes in the first half of 2021 and will depend on the maturity of the projects, their compatibility with eligibility rules and their timely preparation, submission and integration.   327 As already mentioned, the actions/projects to be financed in the Energy and Climate Change Sector are primarily integrated in Policy Objective 2. The specific objectives supported by the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund (in particular circular economy, sustainable development and RES investment) under this Policy Objective are the following: I. promoting energy efficiency measures II. promoting renewable energy sources III. developing smart energy systems, networks and equipment for storage at local level IV. promoting the adaptation to climate change, the prevention of risk, and resilience to disasters V. promoting sustainable water management VI. promoting the transition to a circular economy VII. strengthening biodiversity and green infrastructure in the urban environment, and reducing pollution. Restrictions in eligibility result from Article 6 of the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund draft regulation, as well as the intervention areas suggested in the Common Provisions Regulation draft with regard to Funds. In particular, the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund do not support, inter t the present stage of the negotiation, excludes investments in (i) replacement of coal heating systems with natural gas heating systems, (ii) distribution and transportation of natural gas for carbon substitution and (iii) clean vehicles as defined in Article  The intervention areas indicated in the Common Provisions Regulation draft and pertaining to a low-carbon economy are the following:  Energy efficiency and demonstration projects in SMEs and supporting measures  Energy efficiency renovation of existing housing stock, demonstration projects and supporting measures  Energy efficiency renovation of public infrastructure, demonstration projects and supporting measures   328  Support to enterprises specialised in providing services which contribute to a low carbon emissions economy and to resilience to climate change  Renewable energy: wind  Renewable energy: solar  Renewable energy: biomass  Renewable energy: marine (wave, tidal).  Other renewable energy sources (including geothermal energy).  Smart Energy Distribution Systems at medium and low voltage levels (including smart grids and ICT systems), and relevant storage systems  High efficiency co-generation, district heating and district cooling.  Support to environmentally-friendly production processes and resource efficiency in SMEs  Adaptation to climate change measures and prevention and management of climate-related risks: floods (including awareness raising activities, civil protection and disaster management systems and infrastructures).  Adaptation to climate change measures and prevention and management of climate-related risks: fires (including awareness raising activities, civil protection and disaster management systems and infrastructures).  Adaptation to climate change measures and prevention and management of climate-related risks: other risks, e.g. storms and droughts (including awareness raising activities, civil protection and disaster management systems and infrastructures).  Water management and water conservation (including river basin management, specific climate change adaptation measures, reuse, leakage reduction).   329  Management of household waste:  prevention,   minimisation, sorting, recycling measures.  Management of household waste: mechanical biological treatment, heat treatment.  Promoting the use of recycled materials as raw materials. Electricity transmission infrastructures, with a focus on island interconnections, are also being funded in the aforementioned context to facilitate further development of RES, as well as interventions to promote the equitable transition of lignite areas and the promotion of the circular economy. In addition, Policy Objective 324 infrastr An additional source of funding for the NECP may be the national resources of the Public Investment Programme (RIP). From the perspective of transforming the RIP into a National Development Programme (NDP), actions and projects related to energy and climate may be line with the principle of complementarity with European Union co-financed interventions and the effectiveness of policies and commitments undertaken by the country over specific periods. Additional resources for actions related to energy and climate change may be raised in the period 2021-2027 from the Rural Policy Programme, as well as other funds (Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund - Internal Security Fund - Borders and Visa). the Invest EU programme set up by the European Commission to integrate the financial allocations for loans and guarantees within its long-term budget (2021-2027), it is possible to also finance actions/projects related to the energy sector that are expected to contribute significantly to leveraging resources.                                                              24  330 Finally, financing of actions of the Energy Sector may also be included in Policy Objective 125, through which actions of the Energy and Climate Change Sector related to Research and Innovation (e.g. actions involving new, sophisticated energy storage systems, new materials, etc.), entrepreneurship (e.g. measures to upgrade energy for small and medium-sized enterprises) and ICT (e.g. incentives for digital businesses in the field of energy data, etc.) In addition to the resources for the programming period 2021-2027, which are one of the main funding instruments of the objectives of the national energy and climate plan, the NSRF 2014-2020 will also contribute towards this direction, through which projects are funded towards a transition to a low-carbon economy with significant public spending resources of around EUR 2 0.5 billion. These projects are related to energy saving and energy efficiency improvement activities in all sectors (residential, public, tertiary, secondary), promotion of thermal renewable energy and electrical renewable energy using a funding instrument (Infrastructure Fund), as well as projects for the interconnection of islands (Cyclades, Crete), modernisation and expansion of the electricity and gas transmission and distribution network. Funds from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) are also being used to finance major energy infrastructures (Common Interest Projects), which will be used in the coming period with the expansion of Energy Sector eligibility, including, in addition to Common Interest Projects, cross-border cooperation projects in the field of RES generation, as well as smart grid applications. The combination of the above funding with national programmes, through which (Law 4635/2019), which contribute to the transition to a low-carbon economy (energy efficiency, RES, energy infrastructure), are financed, as well as the exploitation of market mechanisms (e.g. RES operating support, enforcement schemes), will activate funds for the implementation of related projects. Analysing and mapping the funding gap, designing and developing new financing schemes and financing instruments and making the most of them by appropriately leveraging the available resources while also mobilising private capital will lead to significantly investments of a significantly greater budget from the funds available through Community and national programmes, effectively contributing to the achievement of the Energy and Climate Policy objectives.                                                              25  331 5.3 Assessment of the interaction and the impact of energy-efficiency/energy-saving policies Based on a bottom-up approach, considering the demand in energy generation, it is easily understood that planning aiming to the improvement of energy efficiency as regards final demand and energy generation and distribution, may help to achieve the national and, by extension, the European objectives on energy and the climate in the most cost-effective manner. The improvement of energy efficiency in this plan is considered a horizontal priority, and the related measures complement the other basic aspects of the planning. Regarding the climate dimension, energy efficiency improvement measures contribute significantly in achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. As for renewable energy sources, measures for the improvement of energy efficiency are of primary importance for meeting the targets associated with the use of RES in cooling and heating and in transport. As regards security of supply, it is clear that the improvement in energy efficiency and the resulting decrease in demand leads to reduced energy dependency of the country, while measures based on demand response are already in force both for electricity and natural gas. With regard to the aspect of the internal energy market, in the context of the measure for the Development of Energy Transport-Distribution, actions will be implemented for infrastructure managers to improve the energy efficiency of infrastructure, aiming to improve energy efficiency in transport, distribution, load management and the interoperability of networks. In addition, the measures for the improvement of energy efficiency in vulnerable households are essential for dealing with the phenomenon of energy poverty. The recognition of the value of energy efficiency as a good practice functioning in a complementary and horizontal manner as regards the promotion of the energy and social objectives of the country is undeniable and demonstrated by both the good practices implemented so far and the way that this aspect is handled in the planning. Good practices that have been followed to date aiming to the horizontal promotion of energy efficiency:   332  Use of resources in the operation of the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS): Part of the resources of the financing tool from the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is used to promote energy efficiency measures and policies by means of improving the conditions of financing such actions.  Synergies between RES and minimum energy performance requirements for buildings: All new and fully renovated buildings must meet with RES 60% of their needs for domestic hot water.  Implementation of low discount rates: To determine the minimum energy performance requirements for buildings and review the related regulation, the country has set the main discount rate at 3%, taking into account the social aspect of the cost-benefit analysis, recognising the multiple non-energy benefits of energy efficiency measures.  Implementation and dissemination of stricter energy efficiency policies: The country has implemented energy efficiency schemes, which are a policy framework that mobilises electricity and natural gas providers, but also providers of petroleum products, to implement energy efficiency measures. Approaches in the context of the national plan for energy and the climate, for the horizontal promotion of energy efficiency:  Ambitious energy efficiency targets: (a) Objective to achieve energy savings in final energy consumption, at 38% compared to the forecast on final energy consumption by 2030 and to achieve lower final energy consumption in 2030 compared to that in 2017; (b) Energy upgrade of 12-15% of the building stock by 2030.  Macroeconomic effects of energy efficiency technologies: In the context of the national plan for energy and the climate and with a view to maximising the non-energy benefits of energy efficiency measures, the impact of key energy efficiency technologies in the sector of employment, on the increase in domestic added value, on revenue and the health of the citizens of the country, was assessed and taken into account.  Optimisation of synergies between RES and energy efficiency: Aiming to the optimal planning of energy efficiency policies, RES policies for heating and cooling, and RES policies in transport, through the study and analysis of a portfolio, the appropriate and optimum combinations of policies were determined, to achieve all related sub-objectives set in the context of the planning, whilst minimising the costs and the risk of the implementation of said objectives.   333 5.4 Risk factors and challenges Based on the structure of the above chapters, beginning with policy objectives, policy guidelines have been set out, complemented by a series of policy measures which may be classified as regulatory and technical. Focusing on technical measures, those usually pertain to the implementation of a technological intervention, which is inevitably accompanied by the mobilisation of investment costs, regardless of who takes up this burden. Therefore, for each policy measure, different combinations may apply regarding the undertaking of the financial burden of the investment for the implementation of the same technology. The selection of the most suitable financial mechanism and instrument, as well as the distribution of the financial burden of each policy measure is a matter directly and closely linked to the success of the implementation of said measure. Therefore, the key planning principles with regard to the taking up the financial burden of the various stakeholders is a process still not placed in the centre of energy planning. The key principles of energy planning include the optimisation of the relation between the cost and the results of policy measures, while defending the interests of all stakeholders and keeping the risk of implementation failure at the lowest possible levels. Therefore, policy measures are being planned and will be implemented for a more efficient management of the structural funds and the national objectives, aiming to the maximum mobilisation of private funds, both from investors and benefitting citizens or businesses, as appropriate. However, in order to achieve that objective, a series of financing mechanisms and instruments will be used, with the ultimate goal of creating appropriate conditions to attract investment, combining different sources of financing, and optimising the efficiency of state funds. In particular, optimising the return on state funds will be achieved by reducing subsidies and granting preferential loans instead of allowing recycling of funds (grants) through special funds, as well as through the creation of financing instruments by selecting, where appropriate, the appropriate combination of grants and loans and combining funds from various sources (Structural Funds, other European resources and mechanisms, national resources, market mechanisms, etc.) Similarly, conditions to attract investments will be created, first, through an appropriate regulatory framework and, secondly, through reasonable rules governing the implementation of each measure. The mechanisms to be considered for enhancing this framework shall include security for first losses from loans, an increase in scale, especially for small projects, by means of 334 aggregation, the standardisation of processes and methodologies to reduce the risk of the parties involved in the case of projects which are hard to manage, the establishment of decentralised or central structures for technical support, the removal of legislative and regulatory obstacles, compliance with transparent and non-discriminatory procedures, which may or may not be competitive, and the implementation of tax incentives. An important challenge is to reduce the risk of not achieving the energy efficiency target set for 2030. Failure to keep final energy consumption at projected levels may jeopardise the quantitative targets set for promoting RES in 2030. In such a case, it will be required to install additional RES plants to generate electricity, to introduce a larger number of RES technologies for heating and cooling, and to find more biofuels, in order to achieve the projected RES penetration targets and corresponding ones. Moreover, the energy security dimension will also be affected, as there will be significant problems with the adequacy of available power and power outage due to the higher availability of gas and electricity required compared to the original design of the respective operators. To avoid this, energy efficiency in schemes will be given greater weight, which will lead to the implementation of energy saving projects through energy efficiency contracts by energy service companies and public-private partnerships, and priority will be given to the implementation of targeted market mechanisms in order to improve energy efficiency. One such mechanism is the existing energy efficiency obligation regime, which will continue to apply until 2030 with the necessary modifications to the regulatory framework improving both the operation and the efficiency of the scheme. Thus, by looking at the achievable techno-economic potential of energy savings in the areas of activity of the obliged parties and the mix of alternative policy measures, target allocation to obligated parties will lead to more equitable and efficient achievement of the objectives. At the same time, the further expansion of the existing scheme will be explored through the operation of a mechanism similar to the one of white certificates with virtual energy equivalents, so that the potential of autonomous actions is available for exploitation by the obligated parties by increasing the potential of the scheme and increasing the alternatives for achieving the energy saving objective. Towards this end, the introduction of competitive energy-saving bidding processes is expected to give significant impetus to improving energy efficiency in specific sectors, such as the tertiary and industrial sectors, significantly improving the cost-effectiveness of the technologies applied, while significantly reducing the risk of implementing the measures. What is more, alternative payment mechanisms for projects between various stakeholders will be investigated, such as payment by 335 means of bills or taxes, any regulatory obstacles will be removed, and the granting of tax incentives to facilitate further energy upgrade actions will be considered. Finally, specific schemes will be explored to tackle energy poverty either through existing policy measures or new ones while utilising both available funding programmes and market mechanisms in line with the requirements of the Energy Efficiency Directive. Accordingly, infrastructure projects will continue to be supported with co-financing from structural funds, whereas, as mentioned above, the main instruments for electricity generating RES stations will include the operating aid scheme and the extended use of competitive procedures, so that the expected private investments may have an increasingly smaller impact on financial support and that the new projects achieve, also depending on market evolution, positive results as regards the reduction of energy costs for consumers. However, emphasis will be placed on support from investment funds, so that access to financing may be achieved under more competitive terms and that the number of investment plans with access to such financial conditions increases. With regard to RES in the areas of heating, cooling and transport, a more efficient use of the programmes of the new financial period 2021-2027 will be attempted, in conjunction with holistic interventions, especially in energy efficiency matters, whereas the objective for strengthening domestic sophisticated fuels production is to plan special actions which will focus on everything, from the development of appropriate supply chains to production. The monitoring mechanism of policies and measures implemented will initially focus on monitoring the evolution of final energy consumption and the implementation of policy measures designed to improve energy efficiency. The purpose of this process is to identify any possible energy balance deviations from what is considered in this plan, which will result from the change in the consumption pattern and its conversion to the corresponding one prior to the onset of the economic downturn due to the improved economic circumstances. Finally, it is crucial for the success of this project to achieve specific milestones in 2020, which will ensure the smooth and effective implementation of the envisaged policy measures.
