87 Chapter 3 POLICIES and MEASURES 3.1 Governance mechanism for the implementation of the NECP, maximising synergies between its cross-sectoral modules To attain the NECP objectives by 2030, it is necessary to put in place a cohesive mechanism for ensuring both the effective implementation of the policy measures included in the present NECP and the redrafting of existing measures and the drafting new ones in order to attain the objectives and maximise synergies between cross-sectoral policies. The key characteristics of the proposed governance for the implementation of the NECP are developed on six main policy governance axes (PGA1-PGA6), as shown in Figure 3 and further analysed below. PGA1: Single governance framework PGA2: Continuity and consistency in the implementation of policy measures by institutional bodies PGA3: Monitoring mechanism for the implementation and performance of policies and measures PGA4: Strategic reference framework for development programmes to be planned and adopted by the network operators and the regulator PGA5: Development and implementation of financing mechanisms and programmes for the attainment of the objectives PGA6: Information and training actions for energy transition and addressing climate change Figure 3: Governance policy axes to attain the NECP objectives in the period 2021-2030. The governance mechanism as a whole will incorporate, also as a procedure, the development of certain critical performance indicators for the cross-sectoral and sectoral measures and policies and how these will contribute to the attainment of the policy priorities set out in this chapter per theme. These indicators will take into account, inter alia, the degree of implementation in relation to the initial scheduling of policies and measures, the cost-benefit ratio of energy and climate objectives and their potential degree of interdependence and complementarity.  88 3.1.1 Governance policy axes The development of a single governance framework, to monitor and assess in a cohesive manner both all the policy measures laid down in the present NECP by 2030 and the is governance framework aims to ensure the centralised and integrated monitoring of the implementation of view to attaining the NECP objectives. This governance framework will help facilitate cooperation and communication between stakeholders both in each Energy Union dimension separately and across the six different dimensions, thus ensuring maximum synergies between the policy measures implemented under all Energy Union dimensions. The Government Committee for Energy and Climate set up and established on the basis of Council of Ministers Act No 31 of 30 September 2019, as well as its support bodies, will play a pivotal role in developing and implementing this governance framework.   energy planning, as well as drawing up the NECP.  Analysing and updating the energy system development scenarios to be looked into.  Planning and promoting proposals for energy policies and actions and making recommendations on taking corrective measures in the event of deviations.  Providing guidelines to institutional bodies. Please note that the single governance framework will apply both to institutional bodies involved in the Government Committee and bodies which, despite not being involved, play an institutional role in implementing specific policy measures at business community and technical activity levels. The required ratification of the NECP by the Government Council for Economic Policy will ensure continuity at a governance level and the commitment of the institutional bodies involved in the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Energy and Climate to cooperate with a view to attaining the specific objectives.  Furthermore, stakeholders should take into account the provisions of the NECP in their own development policies in order to contribute towards the smooth and effective implementation of the policy measures laid down in the NECP.  89 To that end, a coordination mechanism will be developed, consisting of committees or groups intended to ensure the relevance of other related national strategies, such as waste management, circular economy and climate change adaptation. Further details will be provided on the implementation of the single framework by laying down specific procedures to be followed explicitly throughout the period 2021-2030. For example, these procedures will relate to monitoring, controlling and supervising the implementation of the NECP policies and measures and assessing the progress made in attaining the national objectives. The functions and obligations of all bodies involved, except those already explicitly laid down as functions and obligations of bodies and authorities under the national and, in particular, EU legislative framework, will be laid down for each procedure individually, in order to strengthen the supervision and coordination of the relevant actions and to highlight each ibution to the national effort, thus allowing for proper transparency and monitoring of the degree of performance in each area of responsibility. The implementation of the single governance framework will result in ensuring continuity of the policies and measures to be implemented and consistency of both public and private institutional bodies involved in the implementation of these policies and measures. Moreover, the policies and measures will be redrafted subject to uniform rules, taking into account the framework used to draw up the existing NECP, thus ensuring the effective attainment of its objectives under any circumstances. Apart from that, these policies and measures will be used as a basis for identifying and highlighting the need for synergies and complementary actions in all activity sectors of the Greek economy. A fundamental component of the single governance framework is developing an integrated monitoring mechanism  for the policies and measures under implementation. This mechanism will include procedures for ongoing monitoring of both the attainment of the individual NECP objectives and the performance and impact of each policy measure individually, including by the use of relevant critical performance indicators, as explained above. On the basis of Council of Ministers Act No 31 of 30 September 2019, specific functions are assigned to the NECP monitoring working group in the context of the monitoring mechanism to be developed. ter alia:  Recording the progress made in implementing the Energy and Climate Plan.   90  Notifying to the Inter-Ministerial Committee any deviations in implementing the approved measures and policies and attaining the intermediate objectives.  Proposing appropriate new measures or modifying existing ones with a view to attaining the NECP objectives. To develop the monitoring mechanism, it is necessary to implement specific actions, such as defining a methodology for measuring the performance of each policy measure in terms of attaining the objective as well as in terms the socio-economic impact, planning a procedure for collecting the data necessary for measuring performance, and determining the estimated positive and negative deviation compared to the objectives for 2030. Please note that all existing administrative data sources will be used and integrated into a standardised procedure, thus making sure that the collection of necessary data and the associated calculations are carried out accurately and transparently. The setting of indicators intended to help carry out the above operations will constitute a significant component of the monitoring mechanism. In accordance with the practice followed in the context of the Corporate Pact for Development Framework (ESPA), these indicators may be broken down into output indicators, which are used to measure the progress made in connection with major actions, and result indicators, which are used to express the change made in the context of a policy priority. In any case, these indicators will satisfy concrete quality criteria (e.g. clarity, measurement of values associated with specific policies, use of commonly accepted methodologies). The use of indicators which have already been used by international organisations (Commission, OECD, UN, etc.) can provide the basis for the final selection and formulation of all NECP indicators. A vital component of the monitoring mechanism is the process of redrafting existing measures marked with lower performance levels or promoting more intensively those marked with much higher performance levels. In any case, assessing the policy measures under implementation is crucial for taking, in a timely manner, necessary decisions on the mix of existing or new policies that need to be launched in order to prevent putting the attainment of the NECP objectives at risk. The assessment of policy measures will be based on a specific methodological approach, in the context of which the socio-economic impact will be assessed, in addition to the contribution made towards attaining the objectives. That is why it is vital to ensure the methodological cohesion of the policies and measures planned, also including a detailed assessment of their qualitative and qualitative impact, which has already been conducted for all the measures planned.  91 Following the assessment of policy measures, training will be provided for different energy sector development scenarios by 2030, to estimate the level of attainment of the energy and climate objectives set and detect potential deviations on an annual basis. These scenarios will be assessed by developing a specific methodological approach, based on the application of a multi-criteria analysis method and taking into account the socio-economic and environmental impact identified in the context of implementing the policy measures. This methodology aims to identify the most likely energy sector development scenario and to ensure the attainment of the objectives set by potentially adopting that scenario, thus ensuring maximum socio-economic and environmental benefits. Moreover, the objectives set are quantified and cost-accounted and include intermediate sub-objectives even at a sectoral level, to allow for continuously monitoring their implementation and contribution. The objectives are also linked to the adoption and performance of a specific mix of policies and measures. Lastly, all the annual reports on the implementation of the NECP, as required by the relevant regulation, will be based solely on the findings of the monitoring mechanism, resulting from the implementation of its individual procedures. The milestone procedures will be carried out in 2023, 2025 and 2027, when the progress made will be verified at a European level. Apart from that, the NECP will be used as a basis for developing a strategic reference framework for long-term development programmes to be planned and submitted by the relevant network operators to the regulator, taking due account of both the policy mix in place each time for attaining the NECP objectives, on the basis of the monitoring mechanism, and the infrastructure development obligations. As regards in particular the infrastructures planned and the corresponding long-term development plans of the relevant operators, the aim is to monitor the relevant NECP objectives and help attain them. The essential objective of this governance axis is for the NECP to be used as the national reference plan for all development programmes of national bodies and organisations in respect of energy and climate issues, to be taken into account in elaborating strategic and development programmes in all economic sectors and to be supported by an appropriate legislative framework, in the context of the functions of all stakeholders.   92 Naturally, in the course of implementing the NECP, account will be taken of any deviations, firstly for the above bodies to take possible corrective measures and secondly to ensure the energy supply of Greece. A relevant model will be used in designing and implementing financing mechanisms and programmes. More specifically, the ultimate objective of this framework is to utilise existing resources and mechanisms in order to launch the implementation of the mix of policy measures initially envisaged in the context the NECP or those to result from the assessment procedure through the monitoring mechanism, with particular emphasis placed on designing appropriate financing mechanisms in the new programming period 2021-2027, as well as on ensuring the optimal utilisation of other financing funds. In any case, these financing mechanisms and programmes will be designed on the basis of the same guidelines as those set out in the context of the NECP, including, inter alia, maximising the expected leverage of resources, using available public funds more efficiently, adopting innovative funding tools, ensuring more active mobilisation of the domestic financial sector and maximising synergies between different policy objectives. Finally, although not falling clearly within the remit of the governance mechanism, emphasis will also be placed on the central planning and implementation of specific information and training actions for all consumers, to get them acquainted with the requirements and challenges of energy transition and of addressing climate change. This axis aims, through specific actions, to provide comprehensive information and training to consumers and raise awareness among them in energy and environmental issues, for them to adopt eventually an environmentally friendlier lifestyle and to choose environmentally friendly technologies through specific decision-making criteria. In any case, consumers should play a more active role in energy and climate issues and develop social and environmental awareness, whereas it is important that the relevant effort should be planned centrally, also including complementary sectoral actions for the optimal application and implementation of the measures and policies planned under the NECP. Active society participation in the transition is a prerequisite for its successful outcome. In this context, the above actions will focus, inter alia, on the opportunities arising in different areas, such as demand response, own consumption and partnerships.   93 Furthermore, the relevant actions will also focus on social acceptance at a local level, with regard to the development of new RES power plants and energy infrastructures. The electronic tools envisaged under the NECP policy measures for monitoring the licensing framework for RES will further strengthen transparency in the development of new projects by region and will allow for realistically recording the characteristics of projects under licensing and development. Given the interest of consumers and the need to inform them responsibly of the need to change the consumption model, awareness-raising and information actions will be handled uniformly and as a whole in respect of such issues as recycling and circular economy.   94 3.2 Climate change, emissions and removals of greenhouse gases The definition of policy measures on climate change, for reducing GHG emissions and gaseous pollutants in particular, as envisaged in the context of the National Emissions Ceilings (NEC) Directive (2016/2284/EU), in the period 2021-2030 aims to cover eight different policy priorities (PP1.1-PP1.10), shown in Figure 4. PP1.1: Attaining a climate neutral economy, through lignite phase-out, promoting RES in  PP1.2: Actions for adapting to climate change PP1.3: Actions for reducing emissions in the transport sector PP1.4: Actions for reducing emissions of fluorinated gases PP1.5: Actions for reducing emissions in the agricultural sector PP1.6: Waste management strategy plans PP1.7: Circular economy strategy plans PP1.8: Urban bioclimatic restructuring and smart cities PP1.9: Involvement of the financial sector PP1.10: Actions for reducing emissions in the industrial sector Figure 4: Policy priorities for policy measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the period 2021-2030. The 10 policy priorities aim to attain the objective set in the context of the Paris agreement to keep the increase in global average temperature well below 2 °C, and if possible to limit it even further to 1.5 °C, above pre-industrial levels, as well as to fulfil the relevant Union commitment to reduce GHG emissions by at least 40 % by 2030 compared to 1990. They also aim at 95 205010.The policy measures that have been specified in the above policy priorities are analysed separately in the following sections. 3.2.1 Policies and measures to attain the objective PP1.1 Attaining a climate neutral economy, through lignite phase-out, promoting RES in energy mix and interconnecting the autonomous island systems Making the economy independent of lignite, which is a polluting fuel, is a key priority for the Greek government. Therefore, in September 2019 the Prime Minister announced that Greece would phase out lignite by 2028. climate neutral continent by 2050, as well as with international energy developments. It also puts Greece at the forefront of the combat against climate change and of energy transition. The reasons why lignite phase-out is imperative are environmental due to climate change, as well as financial due to the increase in emissions trading prices. This transition to a lignite-free era is feasible RES potential, which is our fundamental national energy resource in the energy mix of the future. The shutdown of all lignite-fired plants by 2028 will take place in a coordinated and responsible manner. The -lignite era in a way that is fair for Western Macedonia and Megalopolis. The table below details the timeframe for the shutdown of lignite-fired plants that are currently in operation, which is to be completed by the end of 2023.                                                              10 European Commission - Clean Planet for all: A European strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate neutral economy https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0773&from=EN 96 Table 14: Timeframe for shutting down lignite-fired plants Lignite-fired plant Rated capacity Year of shutdown Kardia 1 275 2019 Kardia 2 275 2019 Kardia 3 280 2021 Kardia 4 280 2021 Agios Dimitrios 1 274 2022 Agios Dimitrios 2 274 2022 Agios Dimitrios 3 283 2022 Agios Dimitrios 4 283 2022 Agios Dimitrios 5 342 2023 Amyntaio 1 273 2020 Amyntaio 2 273 2020 Florina/Meliti 289 2023 Megalopolis 3 255 2022 Megalopolis 4 256 2023 Therefore, an integrated, multi-faceted and front-loaded plan (Just Development Transition Master Plan) will be developed and presented in mid 2020 under the supervision of the Inter-Ministerial Committee, to serve as a roadmap towards the post-lignite era. The Inter-Ministerial Committee was set up and established in December 2019, also laying down the priorities for drawing up the Master Plan and the timeframe for the actions included therein. The procedure for drawing up the Just Development Transition Master Plan will be coordinated and open to local communities. Consultation will take place at an institutional level with all local bodies involved (regions, municipalities, chambers), whose active participation is a necessary prerequisite for the successful outcome of the project. In drawing up the programme for shutting down lignite-fired plants, account was taken of the unhindered operation of the district heating systems used to cover thermal needs in the energy areas. In this context, all alternatives, such as the development of a natural gas network in these areas, will be looked into.   97 The Just Development Transition Master Plan will include a set of measures and provisions including, inter alia: investment and tax incentives, new infrastructures, new technologies, utilising local natural resources, supporting agricultural production and tourism, retraining workers, securing existing jobs and creating new ones through flexible developmental transformation and through growth in all production sectors. In this direction, studies and expert opinions from different independent bodies with experience and expertise in these issues will be used to ensure the best possible setup of the contributions. Of course, the fact that the Just Development Transition Master Plan will be presented in 2020 does not mean that no targeted interventions have already been made for the benefit of the transition areas. The Greek government does have the political determination and the required know-how to utilise resources that are readily available at a national level and to claim increased funds from EU financing funds. Necessary initiatives have been taken to disburse to the energy areas the Public Power  130 million, owed since 2014, and these areas will continue to receive funding from the revenue of the auctioning of GHG emissions allowances through the Green Fund. Also, under the new European budget for the period 2021-2027, an effort will be made to claim tion Fund, making sure that the areas of Western Macedonia and Megalopolis will meet the funding criteria by having mature projects in place. is also important. Moreover, funds from such programmes as Horizon, Connecting Europe Facility and Invest EU will support this effort. Lignite phase-out is a major change to the national energy map, but also a huge opportunity for Greece. The spirit of innovation that was ushered by the use of lignite will be passed on to the clean forms of energy and the new energy mix of the 21st century. All measures for the penetration of RES in power generation, heating and transport contribute to this objective. Given that natural gas, although a fossil fuel, has lower GHG emissions than conventional fuels, the substitution of diesel or lignite with natural gas is an intermediate policy step forward in reducing GHG emissions. Promoting the use of gas in specific areas of final consumption, in replacement of petroleum products, is also a key priority. 98 Additional reductions in GHG emissions are expected from the interconnection of autonomous island systems with the mainland system, where the operation of local, highly polluting power plants will gradually cease, as detailed in other sections below.  Lignite phase-out ambition to make Europe stand out as the first climate neutral continent by 2050. The -lignite era in a way that is fair for Western Macedonia and Megalopolis. An integrated, multi-faceted and front-loaded plan (Just Development Transition Master Plan) will be presented in mid 2020, to serve as a roadmap towards the post-lignite era, including clear timeframes for the implementation of specific actions. The Greek government does have the political determination and the required know-how to utilise resources that are readily available at a national level and claim increased funds from EU financing funds, from the Just Transition Fund in particular.   99 PP1.2. Actions for adapting to climate change Apart from mitigating emissions, the second pillar of international climate policy, as set out in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is climate change adaptation. Climate change adaptation measures concern both natural and human systems and are drafted on the basis of vulnerability estimates for ecosystems, economic sectors and population groups. and protecting social cohesion. In this context, it is a priority to prepare for the potential impact of changing circumstances on production sectors, as well as to set up an appropriate framework for identifying the sectors and activities that will create new opportunities under these circumstances. In the field of investment, medium- and long-term investment in particular, the relevant planning should take into account environmental risk and the contribution of each investment to the broader adaptation strategy. At a legislative level, it is necessary to include the climate change adaptation dimension in the environmental, physical planning and town planning legislation. The relevant revision of the existing institutional framework covers, inter alia, the general framework for physical planning and sustainable development, the regional frameworks and the special physical planning frameworks for tourism, RES, aquaculture, as well as the water management plans of water districts and then the lower levels of physical planning for urban mobility (sustainable urban mobility plans - SUMPs). The necessary climate change adaptation measures include interventions aimed at the preservation of biodiversity, more efficient use of water resources, forest management, adjustment of building and infrastructure construction standards to current or potential future climatic conditions, protection of coastal cities from rising sea levels, reducing urban sprawl, combating the urban heat island effect, mobility management, as well as a number of actions in various areas such as agriculture, fisheries, energy, tourism and health. Implementing these measures requires the transfer of knowledge from the public administration to the competent bodies in each case, in respect of new opportunities and requirements in policy planning and implementation.   100 The National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change (NSACC)11 lays down the overall objectives, guidelines and tools for implementing necessary climate adaptation measures at national, regional and local levels. The NSACC proposes adaptation policies in a broad range of areas in respect of the environment, economy and society which are expected to be affected considerably by climate change in Greece: tourism, energy, infrastructure and transport, health, built environment, extractive industry, cultural heritage, agriculture and stock farming, forest ecosystems, biodiversity and ecosystems, aquaculture, fisheries, water resources, coastal areas and insurance sector12. The key NSACC aims are, inter alia, to contribute to better decision-making through the dissemination of information and scientific data on climate change adaptation and to promote a set of adaptation actions and policies in all sectors, focusing in particular on the most vulnerable ones. An additional aim is to set up a mechanism for monitoring and assessing adaptation actions and policies, as well as informing and raising awareness among people. The NSACC sets out the strategic framework and the relevant guidelines for the development and implementation of the regional action plans for climate adaptation. In drawing up the regional action plans for climate adaptation, basic selection, prioritisation and time scheduling of appropriate climate change adaptation actions and measures is carried out, also based on the specificities of each region. The development of the 13 regional action plans for climate adaptation is underway, more than 50% of these plans have been completed already, and the relevant process is expected to be completed for all regions in 2020. It should be stressed that, given the fact that the scope of the relevant measures often exceeds administrative boundaries and requires a cross-regional approach, e.g. in respect of river basins, some of the actions need to be planned at a climate zone level. An ever-increasing number of local authorities have started developing local adaptation plans. Mopreparing local physical plans, which is being drafted currently and is expected to cover all municipalities in Greece within 6 years, provides that each one of these plans will include a                                                            11 Its drafting is provided for by Law 4414/2016 12  Bank of Greece. 101 special section laying down climate change adaptation measures at municipal and municipal district levels. -IP AdaptInGR - Boosting the implementation of adaptation policy -financed by the Commission, is the most important project in implementation of the national strategy and of the 13 regional climate change adaptation plans during the current first climate change adaptation cycle (2016-2025) and to prepare for the transition to the second adaptation cycle (from 2026) with appropriate actions at national, regional and local levels. More specifically, the project aims at:  providing education and training to the human resources of the bodies entrusted with the implementation of climate change adaptation actions and policies;  setting up an effective mechanism for monitoring, assessing and updating climate change adaptation actions and policies;  implementing demonstration projects in 3 regions and 5 municipalities in Greece, in priority areas for climate change adaptation, such as flood risk management, coastal zone management, prevention of and response to forest fires in areas prone to increased risk of drought, water resources management, town planning and urban bioclimatic restructuring;  providing information to and raising awareness among people and social partners;  mobilising complementary Union and national funds, as well as other financial instruments, to implement climate change adaptation actions;  disseminating good practices in Greece, Eastern Mediterranean and the EU;  assessing and reviewing the national strategy and regional plans for climate change adaptation, in preparation for the second cycle of implementation of adaptation policies. With regard to the impact of climate change on cultural heritage, Greece has undertaken an international initiative in cooperation with UNESCO and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) in order to identify state-of-the-art solutions for monitoring and protecting the world cultural and natural heritage and strengthening its resilience by the use of new technologies.   102 PP1.3. Actions for reducing emissions in the transport sector Transport is a major source of GHG emissions, and therefore interventions are required to contribute substantially to the transition to low-the energy efficiency, are important in this direction. Examples include the promotion of electromobility in road and rail transport and the supply of power to ships during berthing through the development of necessary infrastructure. GHG emissions in transport may also be reduced by the use of natural gas either in the form of compressed natural gas (CNG) for passenger cars and light vehicles (in cities in particular) or in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for heavy vehicles (on national roads in particular). Other examples of such measures are promoting alternative fuels, including the use of biomethane (in replacement of, or mixed with, natural gas), and the elaboration of sustainable urban mobility plans. Moreover, promoting biofuels and using electricity will contribute to reducing emissions in the transport sector. Urban mobility management is a key aspect of improving transport organisation in cities and regions and contributes significantly to strengthening sustainable mobility and carbon-free transport. Mobility management supports the introduction and use of state-of-the-art and environmentally friendly technologies (bicycles, electric cars, expansion of public transport, micro-mobility vehicles, etc.), to make possible the utilisation of its full potential and to avoid counterproductive developments. Measures to support cities and municipalities in mobility management and awareness-raising consist in strengthening accessibility and pedestrian mobility (setting up greenways and blueways, walkways, soft traffic roads, etc.), promoting the use of bicycles (implementation and improvement of infrastructures), parking policy, change to the supply chain model (cargo bikes, collective transport, operating hours, etc.), policy for reducing the use of private cars (ban on parking/traffic in specific areas, etc.), setting up pockets of reduced vehicle traffic (superblocks, living streets, etc.), promoting car rental and sharing systems, strengthening municipal services (school buses, public transport, etc.), promoting the use of micro-mobility vehicles, strengthening multimodal mobility, improving park and ride spots, improving ICT-based infrastructures and promoting sustainable and safe transport systems.   103 Lastly, physical planning and town planning contribute to reduced GHG emissions by promoting more cohesive urban forms and methods of organisation for cities and their functions, in line with the compact city model, through policies for strengthening density and proximity and mixed land uses, combating urban sprawl, managing, protecting and upgrading the public space, strengthening housing, reconstructing degraded areas, ensuring the energy upgrading of buildings, bioclimatic design (e.g. in a way that contributes to reduced travel by the use of passenger vehicles and a lower carbon footprint), as well as by setting up green spaces, increasing vegetation levels in urban greenery areas and enhancing water bodies (streams, rivers, lakes), which contributes to the natural absorption of pollutants and the improvement of bioclimatic conditions, thus leading to reduced energy needs. PP1.4. Actions for reducing emissions of fluorinated gases A combination of policy measures will be implemented to reduce fluorinated gases not only through preventing leaks and emissions but also through controlling the use of fluorinated gases. Examples of measures include discontinuing the production of new domestic refrigerators and freezers that use fluorinated gases with GWP>150 and the production of fire protection apparatuses that contain HFC-23 fluorinated gases, providing training and certification for technicians carrying out work that involves fluorinated gases, installing leak detection systems in large cooling, air-conditioning and fire protection systems, and using motor vehicles that do not use fluorinated gases with GWP>150. PP1.5. Actions for reducing emissions in the agricultural sector The National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change places particular emphasis on agriculture and forestry in terms of sectoral climate change adaptation policies. It should be stressed that, despite the primary role of this strategy being to make Greece more resilient to climate change impact, priority is given to synergies between adaptation and mitigation actions, through the conservation and sustainable use of edaphic resources and land management practices. The revised Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) introduces specific measures in the context of Green Direct Aid by promoting sustainable food production, sustainable farm management and environmentally and climate friendly practices and methods. The measures to be implemented aim at preventing desertification of rural land, improving water management, reducing the intensity of natural resources management, optimising the use of agricultural land, reducing the use of fertilisers and improving animal waste management. The promotion of organic farming and 104 the increase in organic crops are also key priorities under the next Rural Development Programme, contributing to reduced GHG emissions. Moreover, the Rural Development Programme will promote a more intensified implementation of forestation, which will also increase the level of absorption in the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector. On the basis of the most recent information reported by Greece under Articles 12, 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 on a 13mechanism monitoring, the removal of carbon dioxide emissions (net sink) is expected to continue in the LULUCF sector until 2040.In respect of the share of the different land use categories in GHG emissions/removals, forests and forest areas play the most important role in the entire sector, with a share of approximately 56% of total emissions/removals (absolute values). This trend in the forest category is expected to continue in the period up until 2050. The different policies and measures currently in force, as laid down in the Rural Development Programme, the Public Investment Programme, the ordinary budget and the Special Fund for Forests (Green Fund) of the Ministry of Environment and Energy, are expected to continue financing and supporting actions in this area in the future, thus further mitigating climate change impact. Given the overall financial difficulties in Greece, the policies implemented and adopted and the measures taken aim to maintain and strengthen forest services, in order to preserve and strengthen biodiversity, increase the contribution of forests towards climate change mitigation and make forests more resilient to climate change impact. Moreover, the National Strategy for Forests was published recently by Ministerial Decision No 170195/758/2018 (Government Gazette, Series II, No 5351/28.11.2018). The National Strategy for Forests lays down the principles and guidelines of forestry policy for the period 2018-2038 and sets out the specific objectives under this policy and the necessary resources management of forest ecosystems, adapted to biotic and abiotic conditions in Greece at national and regional levels, which includes a clear technical and economic plan and provides for increased flexibility in order to strengthen the multifunctional role of forest ecosystems. Articles 5 and 6 lay down the three horizontal and four vertical axes, respectively, including their general objectives, courses of action and monitoring indicators. Climate change is the second vertical axis, and the National Strategy for Forests stresses the obligation to interconnect with relevant national, international and EU strategies for forest ecosystems (Article 8). The National Strategy for Forests will be implemented through the Action Plan for Forests. The implementation of the Action Plan for Forests falls under the remit of the Ministry of the                                                            13 https://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/gr/eu/mmr/art04-13-14_lcds_pams_projections/projections/envxkn1eg/ 105 Environment and Energy and of jointly competent ministries and bodies. Furthermore, actions will be promoted for the assessment of the vulnerability of forest ecosystems to climate change, for management aimed at adapting forest ecosystems to climate change, for mitigating climate change by increasing carbon capture and storage in forest ecosystems and for addressing extreme phenomena (e.g. forest fires). More specifically, emphasis will be placed on coordinating actions for preventing and combating forest fires, protecting from insects and diseases and preventing flooding and water scarcity. PP1.6. Waste management strategy plans The waste management sector is an integral part of the national energy and climate planning. Waste that generates large quantities of GHGs requires appropriate treatment in order to be recycled or to be used for energy generation, thus contributing to the combat against climate change and the promotion of circular economy. Bioeconomy, being an important component of sustainable economy, can substitute fossil fuels with renewable resources. For example this can include recyclable organic base products and compostable biodegradable products. In this direction, actions are being promoted for the integrated management of organic waste, consisting in separate waste collection at the source, separate waste disposal throughout Greece and aerobic or anaerobic waste treatment which can produce compost, digestate or other material and/or ensure energy recovery. Also, the separate collection of organic waste is a measure that can contribute to the attainment of the UN sustainable development goals, in particular reducing per capita food waste by 50% by 2030. The objective will be attained to a lesser extent through responsible consumption and reduction in food waste and to a greater extent through increased recycling of organic waste and energy recovery from this waste stream. Provision has also been made for strengthening and upgrading recycling infrastructures, to cover the entire territory of Greece. The EU recycling objective of 60% by 2030 will be attained by supporting local authorities and strengthening the separate collection of four different streams of solid waste (plastic, paper, glass and metal). In the context of a comprehensive waste management plan in Greece, a number of waste treatment plants are to be set up in the coming years with a view to reducing treatment residues and diverting more than 90% of waste from landfills.  106 In the context of (a) the National Waste Management Plan (NWMP) and (b) the Regional Waste Management Plans (RWMPs), integrated plans will be prepared for the treatment of industrial waste, the setup of landfills for hazardous waste in conformity to the strictest EU standards and the systematic collection and management of agricultural and livestock waste. Consideration will also be given to specific interventions aimed at better controlling the management of health care waste and the uncontrolled disposal of excavation, construction and demolition waste, as well as of all alternative sorting systems. Please note that energy generation from secondary RDF (Refused Derived Fuel) or SRF (Solid Recovered Fuel), i.e. residual fuel from the management of mixed municipal waste and waste packaging in waste treatment plants, is compatible with:  waste management and utilisation by the use of state-of-the-art circular economy technologies;  circular economy requirements, as the energy utilisation of residual fuel ranks above landfilling in hierarchy of mixed municipal waste management;  2035. RDF/SRF can be used as secondary fuel in energy-intensive industries (cement, paper, metallurgy) in boilers for steam production or district heating. The advantages of using it are: (a) it is easy to transport and store; (b) it can be burnt in conventional solid fuel burners; (c) its production can be combined with mechanical sorting; (d) it has stable quality as fuel; (e) it has high thermal efficiency; (f) it causes low environmental impact, as CO2 emissions from the its use are lower than those of fossil fuels because RDF/SRF contains a significant percentage of biomass. Different management will be used and specific measures will be taken to address seasonality of waste, aiming to fully cover island areas during the tourist season.   107   Waste management The National Waste Management Plan (NWMP) and the corresponding Regional Waste Management Plans (RWMPs) are under review and will intensify a number of integrated waste management measures, always in line with circular economy requirements. The NWMP and the RWMPs will in the context of the new package of waste directives and of implementing the National Action Plan for Circular Economy, ensure a realistic plan for complying with the EU requirements. PP1.7. Circular economy strategy plans Based on optimised use of resources and extended product lifecycle, circular economy is a catalyst for productive reconstruction and has an important environmental dimension. Similar focus must be given to bioeconomy issues, where it is necessary to develop strategy plans, for the attainment of long-term climate objectives in particular. The transition to more sustainable production and consumption patterns is essential for attaining the global objectives for nature conservation and halting the loss of biodiversity, as well as for ensuring responsible production and consumption, reducing the environmental footprint of products and increasing their lifecycle. Extraction and processing of resources account for more than 90% of the impact on global biodiversity and water and approximately half of the global GHG emissions. Product ecodesign in production, the establishment of financial incentives for circular economy and industrial symbiosis, the elaboration of criteria for adopting green and circular public procurement, sharing economy and the promotion of innovative solutions that create added value, ensure the sustainability of resources and prolong the lifecycle of the products and services provided are part of circular economy. The sectors of bioeconomy, biomass, food and fertiliser, excavation and demolition waste, plastics, textiles and water reuse are areas of focus for the national strategy, which can contribute to the creation of sustainable work cycles, modern and quality jobs and improved quality of life through the provision of resilient and innovative products and services.   108 The contribution of circular economy to improved competitiveness is considered to be very important, and therefore it is necessary for promoting specific actions reflected in the National Circular Economy Strategy, adopted by the Central Economic Policy Council on 17 April 2018. National Strategy actions include, inter alia, the implementation of the national waste prevention programme, the reduction of food waste, the adjustment of the framework for construction of public and private projects by adopting green and circular criteria, the facilitation of the processing and use of secondary raw materials, the development of criteria for the product ecodesign, the promotion of the use of waste as secondary fuel in industry, the creation of an institutional regulatory framework which will facilitate the production of biomethane from organic waste and its feeding into the natural gas network or its use as transport fuel, as well as the management, utilisation and re-use of waste. Circular economy can increase productivity and reduce dependence on non-renewable resources and critical raw materials by increasing the use of secondary materials and waste, as productive resources and useful raw/other materials, by promoting the use of treated hazardous and non-hazardous waste as secondary raw materials and secondary fuels in industry, applying best available techniques under the Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions, thus adding a sustainability dimension to the production model. Under such a model, resources are used for longer periods and their maximum value is increased, and end-of-lifecycle materials are recovered and recycled. This is a more effective and environmentally friendly alternative to the traditional linear economy in which we exhaust, manufacture, use and dispose of resources. Moreover, circular economy is a necessary prerequisite for reducing global GHG emissions and thereby mitigating climate change impact in a way that conforms to the Paris Agreement objectives, while at the same time contributing to the attainment of the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs). Given the anticipated environmental, climatic, social and financial benefits, circular economy is intensively promoted not only by the Commission and other EU institutions, but also by an increasing number of Member States and cities, attracting more and more attention from the business community and from public and private financiers. Circular economy clearly goes beyond waste management and recycling and provides the framework for the development of new responsible business models to ensure to sustainable development and create shared value for all.   109 Apart from that, we should also refer to other initiatives in Greece for promoting the transition commitment in the context of the UN summit for promoting green growth through circular economy, towards implementing the UN sustainable development goals. A key priority in the context of the transition to circular economy is establishing an appropriate institutional framework and incentives for industrial symbiosis. Given now an appropriate framework in place, laying down criteria and technical specifications for the setup of new industrial parks and industrial areas and the modernisation/upgrading of existing ones can contribute significantly to the attainment of industrial symbiosis in Greece, which will ensure financial, environmental and social benefits, in coordination with community and international needs. The appropriate siting of industrial activities, combined with the necessary regulatory interventions and financing instruments for having waste from one industry used as raw material by another is a sufficient and necessary condition for reducing the environmental footprint of industrial activities, reducing dependence on conventional resources, saving energy in industry, encouraging energy recovery and eventually reducing the carbon footprint of industrial activities, thus contributing to the combat against climate change.   110  Application of basic circular economy principles The sustainable development model, which focuses on circular economy principles, contributes decisively towards addressing climate change, ensuring economic development through new innovative investment, creating quality jobs and upgrading production in Greece through industrial symbiosis models and infrastructure modernisation. By adopting such a model, Greece will improve its environmental performance and, based on the precautionary principle, will be able to address the environmental challenges caused by climate change in a holistic manner. development strategy, and its implementation includes, inter alia, a four-year strategic plan that covers the entire range of the value chain: production, consumption, waste management, utilisation of secondary raw materials and fuels, by launching long-term actions under the coordination of a special inter-ministerial body in cooperation with a joint advisory committee consisting of representatives of producers and of the society, thus facilitating consultation with the civil society and the market. Following are key actions to be implemented in the context of the four-year plan: ic procurement, primarily linked to public procurement and services, which will strengthen the demand for secondary materials and boost the national recycling industry. technologies. sewage treatment plants. Waste Management Plans.  guidelines laid down in the Communication from the Commission COM (2017) 34 final of 26 January 2017. initiatives at international and national levels. es and adopting standards for the incorporation of product ecodesign criteria. reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment and launching actions for eliminating the use of single-use plastic products by 2021, combined with the adoption of incentives for businesses in the sector concerned to adapt to the new situation by modernising their equipment and retraining their employees. 111 Combating plastic pollution A key action to be implemented in the context of the EU circular economy guidelines, in particular with regard to combating and mitigating plastic pollution, is transposing into the national legislation Directive 2019/904/EU on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment. On the basis of EU data, single-use plastic products represent a major cause of coastal pollution (single-use plastic products 50%, other plastics 7%, fishing gear 27%), whereas plastic food packages and wrappers, cotton bud sticks and lightweight plastic carrier bags rank high in the top-ten list of such single-use plastic bags, plastic bottles, lids, plastic food packages, straws and cigarette butts were included in the ten most common types of waste collected from Greek coasts in 2017, whereas plastic represented 84% of all the waste collected. In this respect, priority will be given to transposing into the national legislation Directive 2019/904/EU and then launching actions for putting an end to the use of single-use plastic products by 2021, consisting in the adoption, following dialogue, of legislation for decisively combating plastic-caused coastal pollution and providing incentives for businesses in the sector concerned to adapt to the new situation by modernising their equipment and retraining their employees. In this context, emphasis will be placed on specific programmes to combat plastic pollution, adopt responsible consumption patterns and use alternative, non-plastic single-use products, in cooperation with reputed institutions, NGOs and representatives of the plastics industry. Greece, taking a responsible and ambitious stance in the combat against plastic pollution with a view to protecting coastal and marine ecosystems and its tourism, as well as improving the quality of life of its people, has committed to complete the elaboration of a relevant draft law, which will be tabled for adoption in June 2020, i.e. one year earlier than the deadline set by the EU (July 2021), and will also take preparatory action to help the private sector and public administration adapt to the new situation.   112 PP1.8. Urban bioclimatic restructuring and smart cities Cities can play a major role in developing and implementing climate change policies and measures, as they are a link between local action and national and international commitments for climate change mitigation. Urban and industrialised areas in Greece have a significant share in national energy consumption and GHG emissions. Therefore, improvement in town planning and energy management at a local level contribute decisively to reducing energy consumption in cities as well as the carbon footprint. clean energy technologies, coupled with the use of state-of-the-art ICTs, are one of the main traditional and modern ICT infrastructure, thus promoting sustainable economic growth and a high standard of living through prudent management of natural resources and through g conditions for people, by attracting businesses and investment at a local level and increasing the market value of real estate. Smart meters and smart networks will form a key part of these plans, allowing for the monitoring and management of the large amounts of information that are necessary for their harmonious operation and making a substantial contribution to the rational use of energy by final consumers at a city level. In conjunction with the new regulatory framework for the demand response mechanism and energy communities, it is expected to strengthen significantly the role of cities and people in the transition and ultimately in the restructuring of the energy ted to urban restructuring, aiming primarily to improve the standard of living for residents and the operating conditions for businesses. Urban bioclimatic restructuring is associated with energy consumption management, use of cold or photocatalytic coating materials in public spaces, water management in public spaces, lighting management in jointly used areas, use of renewable energy sources in the city (in private and public spaces), smart waste management, green rooftops, green walls, low and almost zero-energy buildings, cycling routes, walkways, city squares, traffic and parking management systems, technological applications for providing information in public spaces, as well as environmental awakening of people. Moreover, proper town planning and architectural bioclimatic design and the use of sustainable materials in bioclimatic design (cool materials, shading structures, plants) are essential requirements for the sustainable development of cities. 113 Individual actions to increase urban greenery, such as the creation of urban green canyons with appropriate tree-planting in roads, urban gaps, free public spaces and squares, protection and promotion of streams and rivers and restructuring of streamside, riverside and lakeside areas, as well as use of modern cold materials and technologies with a high solar reflectance level that lead to energy savings in the built environment, and management of water, wind movement and urban noise are structural components of the sustainable development of cities as they reduce thermal values and the energy and carbon footprint, thus contributing significantly to the mitigation of climate impact and the improvement of the quality of life of people. In the context of a holistic approach, smart governance systems contribute to streamlining city management processes, promoting effective communication, cooperation and engagement of people and ultimately strengthening decision-making and successful adoption of policies, measures and mechanisms at a local level. The aim is to support the relevant integrated actions through active participation of public and private bodies which are active locally and to integrate these priorities in the urban planning of cities. The implementation of energy efficiency improvement measures, which have been included in the policy priorities for improving energy efficiency in the building sector and in industry, including electricity and gas infrastructure, contribute to reducing GHG emissions and, therefore, to mitigating climate change impact. Also, heat generation by high efficiency combined heat and power (HECHP) plants and the use of district heating to meet the thermal needs of buildings, as well as the utilisation of discarded heat for energy generation purposes reduce GHG emissions by reducing the consumption of petroleum products and other conventional fuels. Emphasis will also be placed on tourism given the ever-increasing influx of tourists and the extended tourist season, which tend to increase and change energy needs as well as the environmental and carbon footprint of tourism. A detailed description of all policies and measures for energy transition in tourism are described in section six of this chapter.   114 PP1.9. Involvement of the financial sector The involvement of the financial sector (banks, investment firms, social security organisations, etc.) is pivotal in energy transition and in combating climate change impact. Also, incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria in investment management practices is becoming more and more important at a global scale, just like the case is with sustainable development issues, for capital management companies and the relevant regulatory authorities. At a national level, Law 4403/2016, requires large entities of public interest to make publicly available the management report included in their annual financial statements as well as non-financial data, including information on environmental, social and employment issues (ESG), the protection of human and labour rights, their combat against corruption and related policies, the CSR actions they are implementing and eventually the method they are using to create value for their stakeholders. Moreover, through an analysis of the most important sustainable development issues, companies identify, analyse and give an account for issues that are important for their stakeholders but also for sustainable development, thus setting out in their reports their exposure to energy, climate and other non-financial risks. In this context, companies (including financial institutions and all listed companies) are encouraged to adopt specific international standards for the disclosure of non-financial information, including an analysis and integration of climate risks, apart from other risks, in their business models. 2019, which is a practical tool for companies to identify important issues regarding the environment, society and corporate governance which they have to make publicly available and manage in order to respond successfully to the global trend of investors including such non-financial data. Although the guide is intended mainly for listed companies, it can also be useful for non-listed companies of all sizes and branches of activity, to enhance transparency in sustainable development issues. The implementation of the NECP and the attainment of its more specific energy and climate objectives require the active participation of the financial sector and of the Greek market. The Greek government is planning and constantly providing incentives for making investment towards the attainment of energy transition and climate objectives. Clearly, however, the magnitude of the investment challenge exceeds the financing capabilities of the public sector. That is why it is crucial to get the financial sector (banks, investment firms, social security organisations, etc.) involved, in order to:  115 (a) redirect their capital flows to genuinely viable and responsible investment and green technologies, achieving high private and foreign capital leverage in this direction; (b) effectively manage any financial risks on the markets, resulting from climate change, environmental degradation, social issues and other non-financial factors; and (c) contribute to the transition to a sustainable low-carbon economy, energy savings and more efficient use of energy resources. green investment assessment and classification in a way that is uniform and consistent in all economic sectors, which will result in putting in place the appropriate conditions and incentives for further developing green financing  and financial instruments in the financial sector. In this direction, the Greek financial sector, capital management companies in particular, have signed and adopted the UN global PRI Initiative (Principles for Responsible Investment), thus making a commitment to incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria in their investment decision making and in property policies and practices, to check investment against the ESG criteria and promote them in the investment industry, to collaborate with other bodies and networks in applying the principles and to present annual reports on applying them. Also, financial institutions in Greece have adopted (or are in the process of adopting) the UNEP Finance Initiative  Principles for Responsible Banking. Adopting the principles helps harmonise the banking sector with the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on climate, as laid down by the United Nations. By signing the six principles for responsible banking, the banking sector has accepted the commitments thereunder, thus being encouraged to set objectives for addressing its most significant negative impact and increasing its positive impact, to make sure that they are aligned with, and contribute towards the achievement of, national and international environmental objectives.   116 Also, the Athens Stock Exchange has participated in the UN Sustainable Stock Exchange (SSE) initiative since 2018, promoting the dissemination of best practices for the disclosure of non-financial data, with a view to strengthening sustainable investment on local capital markets. 3.2.2 Financing measures including support from and use of EU funds in this area at a national level As explained above, a significant part of the funding for the implementation of the measures proposed, especially in the areas of waste, rural development and forestation, comes from EU resources and involves infrastructures and programmes that are either implemented within the current programming period (2014-2020) or will be planned in the following programming period (2021-2027) through the corresponding NSRF and Rural Development Programme. Special reference is also made to financing development actions in Greek areas whose economy depends strongly on lignite extraction for power generation, in the region of Western Macedonia and the municipality of Megalopolis in particular, to support just transition in these -producing ue from the auctioning of emissions allowances will be determined through an open public consultation on the basis of the following axes:  Development of clean forms of energy, funded by projects implemented by energy communities with the participation of natural persons, and/or local authorities and/or legal persons governed by private/public law, aiming to promote renewable energy sources and reduce energy poverty. This axis could include, inter alia, biomass/biogas projects, with the participation of local livestock cooperatives and generally autoproduction projects with the possibility of utilising existing energy infrastructure (e.g. distribution and/or transmission networks).  Preventing energy poverty: Developing natural gas networks for safe energy transition in these areas, conversion of district heating networks.  Energy savings: Improving the energy performance of public/private buildings in compliance with the minimum energy performance requirements for buildings and tackling energy poverty. Prioritising the promotion of energy communities with the participation of local authorities as eligible entities.   117  Supporting the primary sector: Promoting energy crops, namely locally produced biomass for the supply of alternative district heating systems, and enhancing local crops with high added value (e.g. saffron, rose, oregano, tea), new innovative livestock activities, and promoting the export activities of existing cooperatives and their verticalised development. Geothermal field utilisation projects could also be included in this axis to support greenhouse crops and greenhouse parks, as well as circular economy operations including the treatment of sewage sludge and the disposal of products as soil improvers, land reclamation and/or irrigation projects, etc.  Interventions in the field of circular economy / recovery of secondary materials, by strengthening the market in secondary materials, laying down technical standards for secondary materials, utilising and trading in secondary materials on the market and including them in public projects, aiming to reduce dependence on mineral resources and eventually protecting the environment and climate by reducing the intensity of primary material production activities.  Treatment and energy utilisation of sewage sludge and disposal of products as soil additives, utilisation of ash, etc. with emphasis on the respective actions/projects/priorities of the National Plan for Circular Economy.  Industrial heritage: Utilising lignite-fired plants to promote the industrial heritage of the lignite-producing areas in Greece.  Implementing integrated action programmes in the field of employment (e.g. new forms of energy, agri-food industry, tourism, subsidising new jobs in companies dealing with systems or techniques for managing and saving energy or energy upgrading, etc.), as well as training programmes in the above areas.  Implementing entrepreneurship and innovation support programmes in various sectors and especially in those mentioned above.  Providing technical support to potential beneficiaries for the maturation of projects/actions for public works. The Just Transition Support initiative will continue over the period 2021-2030 through the use of a potential surplus of auctioning revenue, whereas the possibility of using funds from the Special Account to co-finance actions funded primarily from other sources is already being instruments of the period 2021-2027.   118 3.2.3 Summary of policy measures Table 15 summarises the policy measures foreseen for reducing GHG emissions.   119 Table 15: Policy measures foreseen for climate change and GHG emissions and removals.

Particular importance and emphasis should be given to measures that are highly ambitious in terms of attaining that core energy objective and are necessary to attain a much higher share than that of a reference scenario. More specifically, measures aiming to ensure the penetration of RES in new uses and sectors and the energy coupling of sectors are crucial in order to achieve that share through electrification in final consumption. Furthermore, although the share of RES in power generation even without new measures and policies is expected to rise, the requirement for even higher shares in this sector, being the cost-optimal option, requires combined new measures of both regulatory and technical nature. Finally, setting ambitious objectives for electromobility will allow for attaining this ambitious core objective, but this presupposes the development of an integrated framework and a strategic plan, taking into account the estimated response of the automotive industry. To sup up, the definition of policy measures for the promotion of RES in the period 2021-2030 aims to meet eleven different policy priorities (PP2.1-PP2.11), as shown in Figure 5, covering all sectors in which RES can be developed.   122 PP2.1: Coverage of domestic electricity consumption mainly from RES PP2.2: Reform of the licensing and physical planning framework, speeding up and effectiveness of licensing PP2.3: Participation of RES plants in the electricity market without operating aid PP2.4: Promoting dispersed RES systems and strengthening the participation of local communities and consumers PP2.5: Ensuring the viability and liquidity of the operating support scheme for RES power plants PP2.6: Development and reinforcement of energy networks and optimal integration and operation of RES plants PP2.7: Statutory obligations for a minimum RES share in covering the energy needs of buildings PP2.8: Strengthening the use of RES systems for covering thermal and cooling needs PP2.9: Coupling the energy sectors to ensure maximum utilisation of domestic potential by RES and promoting new technologies PP2.10: Promoting the use of advanced biofuels in the transport sector PP2.11: Promoting electromobility Figure 5: Policy priorities of policy measures for the promotion of RES in the period 2021-2030.  The policy measures that have been specified in the above policy priorities are analysed separately in the following sections. 3.3.1 Policies and measures to achieve the national contribution under the EU-wide binding objective for 2030 Over the following decade, RES will play a major role in the domestic energy mix, whereas in respect of domestic power generation in particular, they are expected to have a share of more than 50% as early as in 2025. While it was necessary to have a support scheme in place for providing operating support to RES plants in the previous period, now there are specific technologies that are mature in commercial terms and their power generation costs are, in a number of cases, more competitive than those of the respective thermal power plants. Owing to the above reasons, the promotion of RES technologies for power generation with minimum operating aid is a key priority for the following period, as this will lead to the gradual 123   reduction in the charges imposed on consumers for the development and operation of RES plants. More specifically, operating aid for the most economically competitive RES technologies in market terms, such as photovoltaics and wind farms, is expected to keep decreasing and eventually to be discontinued in the mid-term, as plants using these technologies will be fully competitive in terms of the electricity market and their operation will require no aid of any sort. Achieving and strengthening that competitiveness in terms of power generation costs is based primarily on the functioning of the competitive bidding mechanism that is already in place. The framework of competitive bidding processes is expected to be extended, supported and modified as appropriate in the coming years, taking into account, each time, the specificities of the Greek energy system and the parameters of the reformed licensing framework, increasing investor interest and ensuring fair competition between the interested parties. Operation of RES plants directly on the electricity market without the need for operating aid The ongoing rapid decline in weighted power generation costs for more commercially mature and competitive RES technologies, i.e. photovoltaics and wind farms, is expected to continue and be intensified over the following period. The expanded implementation of competitive bidding procedures is also expected to ensure full operational competitiveness for these projects in terms of the electricity market, and therefore it will be possible to develop the relevant plants without the need for operating aid, meaning that they will be able to participate in the electricity market directly, subject to the same obligations as those imposed on other participants therein. Developing appropriate mechanisms to make sure that participation in the electricity market is achieved in the most cost-effective manner for the energy system as a whole is a critical parameter. The expanded implementation of competitive bidding procedures is also expected to ensure full operational competitiveness for these projects in terms of the electricity market, and therefore it will be possible to develop the relevant plants irrespective of these bidding procedures and without the need for operating aid.   124 The aim is that most of the competitive RES projects in the following period will not need operating aid in absolute values, while at the same time participating in the electricity market subject to the same obligations as those imposed on other participants therein. The technological development of RES has proved that RES can be competitive in market terms as early as in the following years. This is confirmed by the fact that projects with a reference price lower than the current system limit value have been selected in recent RES bidding procedures. Therefore, RES power plants will be implemented gradually without the need for operating aid, participating in the energy market directly. It is also estimated/expected that RES plants will be implemented / put in operation in the context of bilateral and/or forward contracts between producers and suppliers/consumers or and/or aggregators. These contracts will provide a tool for hedging the risk of consumer price increase and will ensure investment security for producers. RES and electricity market A key axis for the further development of RES power plants is their obligation to participate in the electricity market and to meet the relevant obligations thereunder. The obligation to participate in the RES electricity market above certain limits is a key policy measure, entirely complementary and related to sliding feed-in premium competitive procedures and contracts and it reflects the business and commercial maturity with which new plants producing electricity from RES should now be treated. The limits concerned are being adjusted already by assessing this commercial maturity, to make sure that these obligations are expanded and cover new plants of even lower installed capacity. However, a necessary prerequisite for implementing this policy priority is the operation of the new market model, whose planning parameters will allow for optimal participation of RES plants, with due account taken also of the variable generation of such plants, and will take advantage at a regional level of their low variable power generation costs. New cumulative representation mechanisms are already being developed under these obligations, whereas operation in accordance with the new electricity market model will increase not only the opportunities but also the obligations for the participation of these plants. The aim is to gradually increase this obligation for the new RES projects provided, of course, that they can participate on an equal basis and are not disproportionately burdened. In this 125 context, clear provision will be made for the direct participation of RES plants in the electricity market without their obtaining any kind of aid or guaranteed contract. However, the sliding feed-in premium scheme will continue to be the key tool for supporting RES technologies in power generation as a whole, whereas specific provision will still be made for plants with a low installed capacity to receive fixed price operating support. In this context, a special monitoring mechanism and procedure are already in place aimed at adjusting the reference price of each technology and category of RES plants in respect of projects that have not yet been put into operation, depending on the evolution of the financing costs and of the development and operating costs of such plants. Innovative and pilot RES projects will continue to be eligible for financial support through operating and investment aid on condition that they have been proved to cause an increase in domestic added value and that they contribute to covering local and/or special energy needs. The sustainability of the RES aid scheme is now ensured through the orderly and transparent functioning of the Special RES Account, and therefore this mechanism will continue to function in the best way possible by structuring the available input mechanisms, ensuring its sustainability under all circumstances and offering investment security and certainty to investors. The development of environmental markets through the use of guarantees of origin for RES energy is scheduled for the following period and is expected to function as a complementary market mechanism which will further contribute to the orderly operation of the Special Account. The introduction of guarantees of origin for biogas and hydrogen from various forms of energy and the coupling of guarantees of origin systems for different forms of energy (electricity, fuel gas, thermal and cooling energy) will help increasing the penetration of renewables in final consumption. RES and licensing framework Particular emphasis will be placed in the next period on updating, simplifying and operating more efficiently both the licensing and the physical planning framework for RES. The key aim of this process is to ensure the licensing and ultimately the implementation of the required RES plants in order to attain the national objective. In any case, the development of new projects requires balancing and taking due account of business, environmental and social parameters in a fair and transparent manner, which is the key aim of the licensing and physical planning framework that is currently under revision.  126   The simplification of the licensing procedures for RES plants is one of the top priorities of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy. The aim is to cut down on project implementation times, to accelerate investment in this sector and eventually to strengthen investor confidence and thus attract new investment. In this context, a committee has already been established comprising officials from the Ministry, es capable of reducing the total time needed to complete the licensing procedure to two years, with certain exceptions, in line with Directive (EU) 2018/2001. The digitisation of licensing procedures and the operation of one or more contact points where investors can obtain information about licensing will contribute to the attainment of the objective. Timetable for the operation and deliverables of the committee for reforming the institutional framework for RES licensing The committee has planned to simplify the licensing procedure in 2 stages:  Stage 1 (end of 2019): Simplifying the procedure for granting a generation authorisation and drawing up the necessary legislation.  Stage 2 (by April 2020): Simplifying the licensing process after issuance of the generation authorisation (environmental, connection offer, installation authorisation, operating authorisation and drawing up the necessary legislation). The basic architecture of the information system used to support the licensing procedure will be determined at this stage. Special care will be taken to ensure that the land available for setting up RES plants is allocated in a balanced way. In this context and as regards photovoltaic plants in particular, priority should be given to available land, including forest land and agricultural land. Similarly, as regards wind farms, the reform of the physical planning framework should define specific prohibited areas and redefine the carrying capacity, with due account taken of environmental considerations. The aim is to create a clear-cut framework for the development of RES plants, with no subjective considerations in respect to the siting criteria. 127 As regards the physical planning framework in particular, the categories of areas in which the installation of RES projects is partly or entirely prohibited or which are suitable for such installation will be made known in advance and in a clear and transparent manner, whereas the conditions for installation will be determined taking into account such criteria as the character, environmental protection, carrying capacity and human activities of each area of installation. The specific requirements associated with the development of a special regulatory (licensing and support scheme) and physical planning framework for offshore wind farms and floating photovoltaics should also be pointed out. The multidimensional contribution of dispersed RES generation is indisputable, and therefore it is imperative to maintain and expand the autoproduction and net metering schemes that are already in place. However, it is necessary to follow up on and update the relevant regulatory framework as appropriate, in order to take account of technological developments and to ensure the proper functioning of the electricity networks and the cost-effectiveness of the energy system. In this context, the energy communities scheme is deemed to be an indispensable tool for strengthening the role of local communities and consumers, and therefore the functioning of these schemes will be supported and strengthened by specific tools. Finally, as part of the reform of the electricity market regulatory framework, the necessary adjustments will also be launched to allow for the participation of decentralised energy schemes. RES and networks Energy infrastructure plays a key role in the high penetration of RES plants for power generation, and therefore the design and development of new projects by the operators will incorporate the projections for the penetration of new RES plants and will lay down the necessary adjustments and actions to ensure that its implementation is as seamless and efficient as possible for the functioning of the energy system. A large increase in installed capacity will be required to make possible a higher RES share in the energy mix. Distribution networks will have to be constructed also in a generation-oriented, not just consumer-oriented, manner from now on. The operators of both the transmission systems and of the distribution network should design the networks with due account taken of future RES development, increasing geographical coverage and strengthening and modernising technologically the high and ultra high voltage transmission systems and distribution networks, provided that there is a clear-cut regulatory framework in place which can be used to determine 128 should, therefore, be developed in a way that ensures maximum RES penetration and minimises potential cuts in energy generation. In this context, the best technical and cost-effective enhancement and expansion of energy infrastructure in both the transmission system and the distribution network for tackling congestion that prevents further growth of RES plants in specific areas will also be, for the following period, a core measure for the optimal integration of RES in energy networks. For example, the possibilities of improving the capacity of existing substations (adding transformers) and upgrading them generally should be utilised. Apart from that, new regulatory models for the allocation of charges for new network and system development projects (substations in particular) should be designed, to facilitate the implementation of such projects for connecting small producers. Moreover, the substations already constructed by producers (primarily for connecting wind farms) could be utilised on the basis of the pilot project that is under implementation in order to cover network distribution lines, as this would allow for connecting more RES plants to the network, whereas the regulatory framework would need modernisation in this direction. To that end, DEDDIE has already prepared preliminary studies in order to identify the required enhancement of the distribution network, in terms of the number of high/medium voltage transformers that will be congested and will, therefore, need enhancement and of the corresponding distribution lines that will exceed the RES feed-in capacity and will, therefore, need enhancement too. The aim of such as study is to develop a methodology for determining the anticipated investment costs, to identify geographically critical areas of intervention in terms of enhancing the distribution network and to take into account the demand for simultaneous incorporation of new RES projects when assessing the enhancement of substations. In addition, the development of new financing models to speed up the development of these infrastructures will be launched, whereas management complexity and time lags due to external factors will be limited through more effective planning and transparent consultation procedures. In the above context, energy network operators will examine the interventions planned and identify the costs required for both the required infrastructure and the balancing needs for the operation of these plants.   129 Also, to increase the utilisation of other networks, consideration will be given to the requirement for taking measures to prevent new plants from burdening the electrical characteristics of the networks (e.g. short-circuit level), which should also apply to existing plants undergoing major overhaul of their generating equipment. With regard to the major overhaul of generating equipment (repower), this will gradually start emerging as a priority, upon completion of the lifecycle of existing plants, as this RES capacity will have to be preserved in the areas concerned, albeit with due account taken of the new environmental conditions, the obligations to participate in the market and the need to enhance the networks. In the context of the new interconnections between the autonomous systems on the non-interconnected islands and the mainland system, the utilisation of the existing local RES capacity will be optimised, albeit with due account taken of technical, economic and social parameters. Also, the implementation of the interconnections will favour both the attainment of RES penetration objectives and the energy security of the islands. RES technologies for power generation Moreover, the development of all forms of RES for power generation should be ensured. As regards main technologies in particular, both wind farms and photovoltaics should be developed in a balanced way, given the distinct generation profile of either type of these power plants, in order to address adequacy issues. In addition to that, RES plants will have to be geographically dispersed in order to address adequacy issues, in addition to ensuring balanced development in terms of covering available areas. To attain that aim, an effort is being made, inter alia, to promote photovoltaic systems on rooftops and buildings and small wind turbines, which have developmental and social advantages, as well as to promote offshore wind farms by developing the appropriate licensing framework. Apart from that, innovative RES technologies or RES technologies that have not been used sufficiently and can contribute to further utilising this domestic potential will be considered and promoted, mainly in the form of pilot applications. Projects for the use of wave energy, possibilities for the development of floating photovoltaics and production of hydrogen from RES are some of these applications intended for further analysis in this light. Particular reference should be made to the possibility of using RES systems for desalination. More specifically, upon preparation of the relevant feasibility and cost-benefit studies, an effort will be made to promote the use of small autonomous RES desalination plants to produce 130 drinking water or to cover irrigation needs on the islands and in remote areas in which the electricity network is either non-existent or weak and which are suffering from intense water scarcity. The small autonomous desalination plants will be combined with RES systems, to cover their need for energy. For example, small wind turbines and photovoltaics for power generation can be installed in reverse osmosis plants, while in the case of thermal desalination plants both low-enthalpy geothermal energy and thermal solar systems can be used. Moreover, given the need for stable power in desalination plants, the use of energy storage is required to increase the operating hours of the plant regardless of the availability of the RES systems. In any case, desalination plants will contribute towards strengthening local development, reducing the use of bottled water  which has a high environmental cost also due to the absence of recycling in most of these areas  mitigating the problems of major electricity networks, the seasonality of water needs and reducing GHG emissions due to the reduced functioning of local power plants for as long as these islands are not interconnected with the mainland system. The use of hydroelectric capacity is also a priority, being a resource which should be exploited where available. To that end, the aim is to complete and put into operation the large hydroelectric projects currently under construction, to utilise the potential of irrigation / water supply projects and reservoirs, while further developing small hydroelectric projects. The participation of hydroelectric projects, those with reservoirs in particular, in the domestic power mix is deemed to be critical and necessary for achieving the penetration of uncontrollable RES, with a high share in that mix. Similarly, as regards geothermal energy, given both the new regulatory framework and the investment interest shown recently for exploring and exploiting high temperature geothermal fields, the prospects for the penetration of geothermal energy in the national energy mix are positive both in terms of thermal energy and power generation, whereas no such plants are in operation in Greece yet, despite this being a technologically and commercially mature application at a global scale. Given that the regulatory framework for the utilisation of geothermal energy was updated recently and that the issuance of the necessary regulatory decisions for its implementation has not been completed yet, it will take a reasonable amount of time to assess the results of its implementation. Therefore, it is evident that the implementation of an effective licensing system is a priority for the development of the national policy in the field of geothermal energy. Similarly, it is extremely important to plan and adopt support measures intended specifically to inform local communities in areas with significant geothermal fields.  131 Moreover, the development of both centralised and decentralised storage units is expected to contribute towards the attainment of the goal of optimal integration of RES in electricity networks. The further penetration of uncontrollable RES is expected to pose new challenges to transmission system and distribution network operators, as regards the functioning of the system, due to the stochastic nature of the generation of these units. In order to avoid extensive cuts in renewable generation while at the same time ensuring uninterrupted supply to consumers, increased system flexibility is required, which further stresses the importance of sources of flexibility, such as storage. Apart from that, the stochasticity of RES production is an additional risk factor for producers that are required to participate in the electricity market and assume balancing obligations. Storage systems are expected to play an important role in reducing RES cuts in the system as a whole, to address local congestion problems and to ensure more adequate capacity and better system flexibility. Combining RES plants with energy storage systems, i.e. where they share a common connection point (storage system installed behind the meter or at a point in the distribution network downstream the same point of connection with the high voltage system), can mitigate the impact of RES plants on system operation, smoothing out variations in generation, provided that there are no operating problems. The benefits resulting for system operators include better network stability through the provision of ancillary services (e.g. voltage control, frequency response and power quality), as well as increased network capacity for connecting new RES plants. For producers, the combined use of storage and RES reduces the cuts caused by the inability to feed the energy generated into the system, also allowing for capacity firming by reducing deviations from scheduled generation. Therefore, new prospects are opened up for participation in additional energy markets, such as the balancing market and the long-term capacity compensation scheme, which will increase the profitability and viability of the investment. Both centralised and decentralised storage units require the development of a comprehensive regulatory and statutory framework for their operation in energy markets and their integration in electricity networks. The regulatory framework should be developed in a way that normalises the integration of storage systems in new or existing RES plants without, however, distorting the compensation paid to these plants. The role of transmission and distribution operators in identifying the requirements and characteristics of the development of storage infrastructures, 132   also subject to the provisions of the relevant EU directive and regulation, is expected to be crucial. In this context, the necessary regulations/acts are already being prepared, to make possible the optimal use of these tools. Similarly, demand management and response schemes should be implemented. Participation in demand response schemes should gradually cover not only large industrial consumers, but all consumers, whether individually or through aggregators. In this direction, the coupling of energy sectors to strengthen optimal RES penetration is also a priority as it contributes to the utilisation of excess electricity generated by RES plants with a view to meeting the demand for heating and cooling and load acceptance in transport. This objective can be attained through the development and implementation of an integrated demand response framework, the construction of storage units, the digitisation of the energy sector, the orderly functioning of energy markets and pilot actions to promote smart cities. Combined RES and storage Combining RES plants with energy storage systems, i.e. where they share a common connection point, has very positive results for both the system and RES producers. This combination opens up new prospects for participation in additional energy markets, such as the balancing market and the long-term capacity compensation scheme, and offers ancillary services such as voltage control, frequency response, etc., as well as increased network capacity for connecting new RES plants. In addition to that, for producers, it reduces the cuts caused by the inability to feed the energy generated into the system and reduces also deviations from scheduled generation, thus maximising the options for participation in the individual energy markets.   133 Coupling of sectors The gradual electrification of final consumption areas allows for coupling the energy sectors and achieves a higher share of RES in final energy consumption. More specifically, the coupling of sectors refers to the possibility of linking power generation with different energy sectors, such as power-to-heat, power-to-gas and transport (electromobility). The coupling of energy sectors allows for additional system flexibility, as it enhances significantly the ability to feed RES power into the system. Combined with storage systems and intelligent energy management systems, the consumption of flexible loads can be postponed in order to maximise the amounts of RES energy that can be fed into the system. The coupling of the electricity and the heating-cooling sectors (power-to-heat) through energy-efficient heat pumps is already an economically interesting approach, and there are also other options for converting electricity to thermal energy and then storing it. The options for coupling the electricity and gas sectors (power-to-gas) through storage applications that include conversion of electricity into renewable gas, such as hydrogen, are equally important. The gas produced by using RES energy may be fed into the existing gas network and used as fuel for heating in buildings or in transport. Moreover, an appropriate regulatory framework should enable different sources and different energy operators (hydrogen, biofuels, biomethane) to function on a complementary basis, contributing to most cost-effective and sustainable system functioning. Measures for ensuring the penetration of RES in new uses and sectors, the energy coupling of sectors and the development of relevant pilot and innovative applications are a policy priority in the context of the NECP for the following decade.   134 RES in final energy consumption sectors Maximising synergies with the energy efficiency improvement sector is crucial mainly due to the need to implement the plan for installing smart electricity meters by 2030, to support policy measures under this policy priority. Similarly, consideration will be given also to the possibility of feeding into the natural gas network hydrogen or methane produced from various forms of energy. In this direction, the sustainability and efficiency of such a scheme will be considered initially through pilot applications and, if deemed positive, appropriate measures and policies will be promoted with a view to expanding the scope of these technological applications. The development and optimisation of the licensing framework including drawing up the technical specifications is considered to be a necessary prerequisite for implementing projects relating to the construction of RES district heating networks, feeding biogas into the natural gas network and further exploiting available geothermal fields. Please note that, due to the fact that these measures also contribute to the attainment of the energy efficiency improvement objectives, it is necessary to implement them in order to maximise the synergies of the two sectors of interest. The potential for further RES penetration in buildings remains high and requires adopting specific policy measures for utilising it efficiently. A key tool will be to implement a regulatory framework for the mandatory share of RES in covering the energy needs of the building sector (setting a minimum share rate). In this context, the provisions for nearly zero-energy buildings will contribute to the further penetration of RES applications in the building sector, taking into account technical and economic sustainability criteria, contributing to the attainment of the objectives set in the context of improving energy efficiency in the building sector. The above provisions of the regulatory framework will be incorporated in the revised Regulation on Energy Efficiency of Buildings, while special emphasis will be placed on the exemplary role which public buildings used by the State must play by laying down limits for a minimum share of RES taking into account economic sustainability and energy benefit criteria. In addition, efforts will be made to maximise synergies with both the policy for maintaining the autoproduction and net metering scheme and other policy measures in the field of the energy efficiency of public and private buildings. The use of RES systems for heating and cooling (mainly heat pumps and solar thermal systems) will be strengthened by combining different policy measures.   135 Moreover, the financing instruments available in the context of the new programming period and of the respective operational programmes will be designed in a way that contributes towards promoting the most cost-effective RES systems per final consumer category, also taking into account the contribution towards the attainment of the relevant objective. In addition to the financing instruments, provision has also been made for developing a scheme of special tax incentives for the installation of RES systems for heating and cooling in the domestic and tertiary sectors. To further promote bioenergy, specialised support programmes will be designed both for the development of efficient supply chains for residual biomass / biodegradable matter and for the support and implementation of optimal environmental and energy-efficient bioenergy applications. RES in transport, promoting electromobility The most basic and most effective policy measure to promote the use of biofuels in transport is to keep in place the existing regulatory framework for the obligation to blend biofuels and use biofuels individually. More specifically, the obligation to blend diesel with bioethanol at a rate of 7% by volume, as well gasoline with bioethanol at a rate of 1% for 2019 and 3.3% for 2020 of the energy content of gasoline is already in force, whereas both new enhanced blending obligations and the likely extension of the measure to cover other transport sectors too will be examined gradually. Moreover, the need for developing specific market mechanisms to support the use of biofuels in specific sectors will be explored. Finally, domestic production of advanced biofuels will be supported as appropriate, through the development of a support scheme and/or specific financing tools, focusing on the production of biofuels with the highest domestic added value. The planning of pilot actions for the production and utilisation of RES gaseous fuels in the transport sector will contribute both to reducing implementation costs and improving the technical feasibility of the specific fuels, providing the opportunity for using them more broadly at a later stage. To attain this objective, it is necessary in a number of cases to adopt the necessary regulatory framework for the production of these fuels, for example producing biomethane from organic waste and feeding it into the natural gas network or using it as fuel in vehicles. It is also necessary to lay down the environmental licensing procedure for biogas upgrading technologies, to allow for smoothly implementing the necessary investments.   136 Given the present environmental and economic challenges, moving towards a low-carbon circular economy is a must for any country wishing to meet the challenges of the modern global economic system. For this move to be successful, however, it has to be planned responsibly and rationally. In the transition to a competitive and sustainable economy, the key axis of this strategy is to consolidate low-emission mobility, in line with our commitment under the Paris Agreement on climate change and in accordance with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The transport sector is a highly energy-intensive sector, as it accounts for 25% of GHG emissions in Europe, thus having a significant environmental fingerprint. That is why the transport sector poses the strongest challenge and provides the most fertile ground for the first application of innovative and environmentally friendly technologies, and for the development of actions which will benefit both the economy and the environment, such as electromobility. Given that road transport accounts for the largest percentage of GHG emissions in the transport sector and for much of the air pollution, a cohesive and holistic approach and a streamlined and rational strategy are needed to ensure that the transition to a climate neutral economy will be implemented in a way that combines and serves different purposes, including, but not limited to, attracting investment, creating new business opportunities, promoting research and innovation and optimising the transport system through the development of appropriate infrastructure for alternative fuels. The catalytic role of zero and low emission vehicles (ZLEVs) in this transition is indisputable, as described above. Moreover, CO2 emissions ceilings were laid down for vehicle manufacturers in respect of new passenger vehicle registrations per year, in accordance with Table 16. Table 16: Average CO2 emissions ceilings for passenger car registrations. 2020 Maximum average CO2 emissions 95 gr/km 2021 Reduction of average CO2 emissions to below 95 gr/km 2025 Reduction by 15% compared to 2021 2030 Reduction by 37.5% compared to 2021   137 The application of the new and more rigorous method for measuring CO2emissions, as referred to above, and the more stringent emission rules will require vehicle manufacturers to develop and place on the market low-emission vehicles, and therefore numerous new electric models are expected to become available in the following years, starting from 2020. It should be stressed that the increasing share of RES technologies and the decreasing share of fossil fuels in power generation will make the role of these vehicles more and more important. compared to conventional vehicles, insofar as the carbon footprint of power generation keeps dropping. Therefore, the promotion of electromobility is a key policy objective, which will be contingent upon the completion of the relevant regulatory framework and upon making plans for the development of necessary energy infrastructures for recharging electric vehicles. This also includes measures for electric micro-mobility vehicles, which can replace part of the transport operations carried out with vehicles, provided that appropriate infrastructures are built. To that end, the Inter- national operational plan for the development of electromobility, the management and coordination of all actions and operations for promoting electromobility at an inter-ministerial level, the planning and implementation of an integrated package of incentives and the definition of the physical planning and setup of the regulatory framework for electric charging infrastructures. Despite its small size, the Greek vehicle market is marked with distinct specificities compared to the markets of other Member States primarily due to the significant recession of the Greek market in new passenger vehicles in the period 2010-2018. This is due, firstly, to the heavy taxation imposed on vehicles and, secondly, to the prolonged economic crisis of the last 10 years, which has rendered the market unstable and vulnerable. For example, please note that the average size of the market in new passenger vehicles in the period 2010-2018 stood at 85 890 vehicles, which represents a drop of over 68% compared to its average size in the 2000-2009 period. Please note also that the above sales are broken down into 47 444 vehicles placed on the retail market (55.2% share) and 38 444 vehicles placed on the corporate market (44.8% share).  138 With regard to what Greek consumers can afford, most passenger vehicles registered in 2018 fell under segments A, B and C 14(all three segments having a total aggregate share of 94.6% in 2018, and each one of segments A, B, and C having a share of 16.1%, 45.5% and 31.1% respectively). It should be pointed out that the average financial capacity of the market is EUR 15 000 - EUR 25  The Greek fleet consisted of an estimated 5.15 million vehicles at the end of 2018, with an anticipated increase of 920 000 vehicles by 2030, provided that there is some kind of input-output inventory in place. It should be stressed that it is currently the 4 th oldest fleet in Europe, as over 56% of the vehicles are 10-20 years old and 25% of them are older than 20 years. As regards the penetration of electric vehicles in the Greek vehicle market, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) did not exceed 0.33% of the overall market in August 2019. In view of the above statistics, the setup of the Greek fleet and the average financial capacity of consumers do not favour the penetration of electromobility given the operating conditions of the existing market. It is, therefore, necessary to draw up an efficient package of measures and policies to facilitate the increase in the number of electric vehicles. We can also see why State regulatory intervention is needed if we take a look at the examples of other European countries in which the market in electric vehicles has reached a remarkable size and in which strategies to promote electromobility are being implemented. Such examples include the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. Significant incentives are offered in these countries that make the market in electric vehicles and the charging of such vehicles more attractive, thus resulting in rapid growth of electromobility. A detailed description of the strategies and incentives implemented in various countries is given in the relevant section of Annex A, which deals with existing measures and policies in other countries, as these can serve as a point of reference and a basis for benchmarking for the measures and policies which can be implemented in the domestic vehicle market.                                                              14 A segment: micro city cars, B segment: small cars, C segment: medium cars 139 The national policy for promoting electromobility is drawn up and further specified in five different directions: 1. (profile). 2. Replacing older vehicles with  3. Increasing the existing 0.33% share of electric vehicles in the Greek market to at least 8.7% of new registrations in 5 years (2020-2024). 4. (incentives). 5. Providing the general public with information by organising communication programmes. An integrated package of incentives should be introduced to facilitate a smooth transition towards zero-emission mobility. Also, a specific transitional measure should be put in place to enable access to zero- and low-emission vehicles to consumers, as Greece is one of the Member States with low levels of market penetration of such vehicles15. As explained above, a number of incentives are offered in many European countries, with a view to developing the market in electric vehicles. For example, Annex A lists certain best practices applied in these countries, a combination of which could be applied in Greece too. These incentives are broken down into (a) purely financial incentives (market price subsidy, reduced registration and use costs through tax exemptions, special pricing policy in insurance schemes, reduced tolls, reduced coastal shipping fares for electric vehicles, etc.), and (b) use-related incentives (entry to and daily use in major cities, free parking in municipalities having controlled parking systems in place, supporting the setup of energy supply networks for vehicle recharging, etc.). The above incentives are further broken down into those intended for private vehicles, commercial vehicles, taxis or State vehicles.                                                              15 Recital 20 of the preamble to Regulation (EU) 2019/631 140 which has been put to public consultation, introduces a package of measures for promoting the use of passenger electric vehicles and zero- or low-emission mass transport vehicles. Initially, incentives are granted to companies in order to purchase or lease vehicles featuring anti-pollution technology and make them available to their employees. More specifically:  The gross revenue of an enterprise that leases a vehicle with zero or low emissions up to 50 gr/km CO2 is reduced by an additional of 30% of the value of that vehicle if its retail price does not exceed EUR 40 -  Provision is made for an increased depreciation rate of 25% (depreciation in 4 years) and 20% (depreciation in 5 years) per tax year for purchasing passenger electric vehicles (for up to 9 passengers) with zero or low emissions up to 50 gr/km CO 2, respectively.  Provision is made for an increased depreciation rate of 25% (depreciation in 4 years) and 20% (depreciation in 5 years) per tax year for purchasing passenger electric vehicles (for up to 9 passengers) with zero or low emissions up to 50 gr/km CO2, respectively.  Provision is made for an increased depreciation rate of 20% and 15% per tax year for purchasing freight vehicles with zero or low emissions up to 50 gr/km CO2, respectively.  In the case of employees, partners or shareholders of enterprises, or their relations, the market value of a vehicle with zero or low emissions up to 50 gr/km CO2 and with a retail price before tax of EUR 40 000 is deducted from his/her income from employment and pensions, which currently represents additional taxable income.  To promote the deployment of publicly accessible electric vehicle charging infrastructures, an enterprise is granted a 30% deduction in its gross revenue for the purchase, installation and operation of charging points. Two different scenarios were prepared for assessing the penetration of electromobility in the Greek market:  Scenario A (reference scenario): In accordance with the scenario for the evolution of the annual number of registrations and based on market estimates, electric vehicles will represent 24.1% of new registrations in 2030.  Scenario B (frontloaded scenario with economic growth and increased policy measures): In accordance with the scenario for the evolution of the annual number of registrations and with a view to attaining the ambitious objective with economic growth 141 and increased policy measures by 2030, electric vehicles will represent 30% of new registrations in 2030. The data used to determine the evolution of the share of electric passenger vehicles in the annual number of new registrations on the Greek market are shown in Table 17, and the estimated annual evolution in the period 2018-2030 is shown in Chart 6. Table 17: Data used to determine the evolution of the share of electric passenger vehicles. Scenario Year New passenger vehicles purchased Overall market change Overall market increase Passenger BEVs-PHEVs Annual increase Percentage of BEVs-PHEVs in annual market Scenario A (reference scenario) 2018 103,431 - - 315 - 0,3% 2019 115,000 11,569 11 % 461 146 0.4 % 2020 127,400 12,400 11 % 1,151 690 0.9 % 2021 137,635 10,235 8 % 3,450 2,299 2.5% 2022 148,646 11,011 8 % 6,900 3,450 4,6% 2023 160,538 11,892 8 % 10,349 3,449 6,4% 2024 173,381 12,843 8 % 15,005 4,656 8.7% 2025 187,251 13,870 8 % 20,257 5,252 10,8% 2026 202,231 14,980 8 % 26,333 6,076 13.0 % 2027 218,410 16,179 8 % 33,180 6,847 15,2% 2028 235,883 17,473 8 % 41,806 8,626 17.7 % 2029 254,753 18,870 8 % 52,676 10,870 20,7% 2030 275,133 20,380 8 % 66,371 13,695 24,1% Scenario B (frontloaded scenario with economic growth and increased policy measures) 2018 103,431 - - 315 - 0,3% 2019 115,000 11,569 11 % 461 145 0.4 % 2020 127,400 12,400 11 % 1,265 805 1,0% 2021 137,635 10,195 8 % 3,795 2,530 2.8 % 2022 148,646 11,011 8 % 7,589 3,794 5,1% 2023 160,538 11,892 8 % 11,797 4,208 7.3% 2024 173,381 12,843 8 % 17,436 5,639 10.1% 2025 187,251 13,870 8 % 24,036 6,600 12,8% 2026 202,231 14,980 8 % 31,246 7,210 15,5% 2027 218,410 16,179 8 % 40,093 8,847 18,4% 2028 235,883 17,473 8 % 51,458 11,365 21,8% 2029 254,753 18,870 8 % 66,059 14,601 25.9 % 2030 275,133 20,380 8 % 82,422 16,363 30.0 %   142    Chart 6: Evolution of the share of electric passenger vehicles in the annual number of new registrations on the Greek market. On the basis of the above forecasts, the NECP has set a target of 30% for the share of electric passenger vehicles in the number of new registrations in 2030.  RES and competitiveness Total new investments in RES power generation in the following decade are expected to deliver a return in terms of domestic added value of over EUR 12 billion during their operation. throughout the operation of such systems. Similarly, there are many benefits to creating direct and indirect jobs thanks to the deployment and operation of these projects, as an estimated over 37 thousand new full-time jobs will be created and maintained in the following 25 years.  3.3.2 Special measures for regional cooperation, as well as the estimated surplus energy generation from renewable sources Cooperation with neighbouring Member States is envisaged so that RES and HECHP power plants located in countries within the European Economic Area can take part in the tendering 143 procedures, provided that there is active cross-border energy trade with them. The aim is to enter into a reciprocity pact with these candidate countries laying down the terms and conditions and clarifying all other relevant issues that will allow the bidirectional participation of candidate RES and HECHP projects in specific tendering procedures that will take place in Greece and in the other Member State in the immediate period ahead. The amount of electricity generated by these projects, which may be selected in the context of these tendering procedures, will result from the application of a specific methodology already described and defined in a regulatory act. At present, no provision has been made concerning the use of other cooperation mechanisms either for surplus electricity from renewable energy sources to be transferred to other Member States or for electricity deficiency in order to achieve the national contribution and the pathways presented in relation to the share of RES in gross final energy consumption. In terms of regional cooperation in the context of the TARES project, there is cooperation with the corresponding ministry of the German government for promoting RES in all sectors through the development of measures and market mechanisms. Moreover, as referred to in the section on regional cooperation in planninparticipation through its representatives in CA-RES contributes significantly to cooperation between Greece and other Member States. 3.3.3 Special measures relating to financial support, including support through, and use of, EU funds The key financial instruments include:  Domestic and international financial resources  Special RES Account with specific sources of financial revenue for the operating support of electricity generated by RES  National operational programmes in the context of the new programming period  New investment law  Resources from national and EU research programmes, as well as resources for the implementation of innovative and pilot applications in the context of international collaborations   144 3.3.4 Assessment of support for electricity from renewable sources to be carried out by Member States The proper functioning of the Special RES Account is largely related to ensuring the sustainability of the RES support scheme. This has now been achieved through successive legislation adopted in recent years, to ensure both sufficient and steady inflows of financial resources and to streamline the inclusion of specific revenue categories in it. The transparent functioning of the Special RES Account is also ensured by the monthly record of the detailed and segregated by category and/or technology financial inflows and outflows required for the function performed by the competent body (RES and Guarantees of Origin Operator - DAPEEP), which is posted in the form of a monthly bulletin on a specific publicly accessible webpage (online link). As part of the monitoring of the operation of the special account, forecasts of future inflows and outflows are made for at least the following calendar year in order to establish whether there is need to take measures for its optimal operation and financial liquidity. It should be noted that, specific legislation has been adopted (Law 4533/2018) providing for a special security reserve of EUR 70 million (70 000 000) for extraordinary expenses, which should be taken into account in planning the course of financial inflows and outflows of the special account, respectively. Therefore, in the following period, this mechanism will continue to function optimally with regard to the structure of available inflow mechanisms, ensuring in any case the necessary support of RES electricity for the respective plants in operation. 3.3.5 Specific measures for setting up one or more contact points, simplifying administrative procedures, providing information and training, and facilitating the conclusion of electricity purchase agreements As already mentioned, a key priority for the following period is the updating, simplification and more efficient functioning of both the licensing and physical planning framework for RES. In this context, existing information tools and databases will be improved and new ones will be deployed to allow for optimal provision of related information to the interested parties. The aim is to implement the licensing framework for RES power generation, to observe specific timeframes for the evaluation and issuance of licensing acts, as well as to codify the relevant legislation so that uniform and complete information is provided both to the licensing authorities and the interested parties. In this context, in addition to updating the overall 145 licensing framework, which will take into account the new requirements and possibilities for the operation of these projects, the establishment of one or more central contact points will be promoted, aimed at facilitating both the licensing and eventually the deployment and implementation of the RES plants required to attain the national objective. In respect of dispersed generation by RES systems, as already described in a previous section, there are autoproduction, net metering and virtual net metering schemes in place, with specific technical characteristics, criteria and administrative requirements for including users therein. These schemes also incorporate a specific methodology for the settlement of the electricity generated by decentralised RES power generation systems. The regulatory framework for the operation of these schemes is being updated to take account of technological developments and to allow the use of electricity storage systems, whereas the aim for the future is that these schemes should be modified and adapted accordingly to ensure the smooth functioning of the electricity networks and the cost-effectiveness of the energy system, while at the same time enabling consumers to choose to install and use these systems without facing disproportionate technical or financial obstacles. The development of a specific institutional framework for the promotion of energy communities, which has already been completed and is in place, is deemed to be a necessary tool for strengthening the role of local communities and consumers, and therefore the operation of these schemes will be supported by the use of licensing and operational incentives (e.g. with regard to limits for participation in tendering procedures and possibilities for representation on the electricity market). Moreover, considerable participation of energy communities in net metering schemes (virtual net metering in particular) is expected, thus maximising the benefits resulting for the local economy. 3.3.6 Assessment of the need to build new RES district heating and cooling infrastructures RES potential for the development of district heating applications has been identified on the basis of technical and financial criteria in specific areas of Greece and concerns primarily the exploitation of low-enthalpy geothermal fields, as well as residual solid biomass. In this context, specific feasibility studies have already been developed for the deployment of district heating networks, which in most cases take into account the use of these infrastructures to cover local needs in the domestic, tertiary and rural sectors. 146 The interest in such infrastructure focuses mainly on Northern Greece and/or semi-mountainous / mountainous areas, as well as on certain North Aegean islands where there is both local RES potential for district heating and inter-seasonal thermal needs at a local level. Just as important is the interest in using the existing district heating infrastructures, after lignite is replaced as fuel, and utilising locally available RES, biomass in particular, whereas natural gas can be used on a transitional/complementary basis. The deployment of such infrastructure will  insofar as the financial viability of the investment is ensured in terms of the number of users, the amount of thermal energy consumed and the length of the network under deployment  yield significant benefits in terms of local added value and the protection of final consumers with respect to energy costs. The objective is to deploy, also through the use of financial instruments providing support from national co-financed projects, RES district heating networks using solid biomass and geothermal energy of 30-40 MWth over the following period. 3.3.7 Specific measures to promote the use of energy from biomass The use of biomass for energy generation and/or fuel production in Greece is limited in relation to the availability of residual biomass. It should be used with due account taken of the characteristics of domestic agricultural activities, the competitiveness of its uses and the possibilities of developing supply chains. At the same time, appropriate energy infrastructures should be deployed for using it, depending on the type of use. Focus will be given in the following period on the transition from current conventional energy uses of biomass to more energy-efficient and cost-effective applications over the entire spectrum of the Greek economy, with emphasis placed on sustainability criteria and sustainable management. Flagship policies which are being planned currently consist in promoting advanced biofuels and utilising the production of biomethane by feeding it directly into the natural gas network. With regard to the promotion of the use of biomass-derived energy, the relevant thematic section on the agricultural sector proposes specific measures for meeting the political priorities concerned.   147 3.3.8 Summary of policy measures Table 18 summarises the policy measures planned for the promotion of RES.   148 Table 18: Policy measures planned for the promotion of RES.
