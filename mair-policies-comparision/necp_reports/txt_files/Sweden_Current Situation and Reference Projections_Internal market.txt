4.5 The Internal Energy Market dimension  4.5.1 Electricity interconnection  4.5.1.1 Current level of interconnection and major interconnections. At the end of 2018/beginning of 2019250, Sweden had an interconnection level of 27%. Total import capacity was 10 350 MW and installed production capacity amounted to 39 026 MW. Existing connections with neighbouring countries are shown in Table 31.  Table 31. Current connections and import capacity (max. NTC).

New connections are shown in Table 32. The decrease in interconnection level is caused by the expected significant expansion of domestic renewable production, which thus contributes to the level decreasing.  Table 32.

However, analyses show that the construction of additional connections may be beneficial from a socio-economic perspective, particularly if nuclear power is phased-out in the long term. This is the subject of ongoing analysis by Svenska kraftnät. An estimated service life of 60 years is frequently cited as a benchmark for nuclear power. Nuclear power plants will continue to operate for as long as they are profitable for the owners and safety requirements are met, which may be either shorter or longer than the expected 60 years.  Internal reinforcement of the Swedish national grid is currently under way for the purpose of reducing bottlenecks between electricity price areas and enabling additional connections and interconnections. The Nord-Syd (North-South) programme251, which includes some fifty different projects, is addressing this problem and will run until around 2040.  4.5.2 Energy transmission infrastructure  4.5.2.1 Important characteristics of existing electricity and gas transmission infrastructure.  Existing infrastructure for electricity Sweden is an elongated country, with most electricity consumption occurring in the south and hydroelectric power production in the north. Sweden is split into five electricity price areas, see Figure 32.                                                                                        251 Svenska kraftnät  The NordSyd investment package: Significant reinforcement of the Swedish national electricity grid between electricity price areas 2 and 3 (March 2019). 151 (199) Figure 32 Electricity price areas.

Nuclear power is localised in electricity price area 3, but is expected to be gradually phased-out as the reactors age and/or as profitability decreases.  Wind power is primarily exploited in the north of Sweden, as a result of good project locations and the fact that it is easier to obtain authorisation to build electricity networks there, despite the fact that spot prices are generally lower in the north compared with the south.  The main function of the national grid is thus to transmit electricity from the north of Sweden to the south. This function is supported by the expansion of wind power in the north of Sweden. The configuration of the national grid is shown in Figure 33.  152 (199)  Figure 33. National electricity grid 2017.  Source: Svenska kraftnät.

There are hours during which the transmission from north to south is insufficient. For this reason, Sweden is split up into different price areas on the basis of the structural bottlenecks present in the network. Although structural bottlenecks are to be removed, it is not viable, from a socio-economic perspective, for the same price to always be guaranteed throughout Sweden.  Gas infrastructure The Swedish natural gas system is small in comparison to most other natural to the natural gas network in western Sweden. Gas enters Sweden via the Danish Dragör pipeline. In Sweden, the transmission network is owned and operated by Swedegas AB, which also has responsibility for balancing the Swedish natural gas network. The system of balancing responsibility has changed since the introduction of a joint balancing zone between Sweden and Denmark, which entered into force on 1 April 2019. Imbalances are corrected by the Balancing Area Manager (BAM), which is jointly owned by Swedegas AB and Energinet.  There is also a town and vehicle gas network in the Stockholm area, which is owned by Gasnätet Stockholm AB. The production and supply of gas to the town gas network mainly occurs from a gas plant in Stockholm, which supplies both biogas and liquefied natural gas (LNG).  There are also smaller regional and local gas networks throughout Sweden. Many of these small local networks are mostly used to transport biogas intended for vehicles from a production site to refuelling stations.  4.5.3 Projections for network expansion requirements until at least 2040 (including 2030)  Future need for network expansion                                                       252 All electricity price areas in the Nordic region with the exception of DK1, i.e. electricity price areas that are interconnected via alternating current. 154 (199)  Electricity network Svenska kraftnät has a Ten-Year Network Development Plan253, which is updated every two years. In addition, there is the NordSyd investment package, which includes some fifty different projects whose main purpose is to strengthen the capacity between electricity price areas 2 and 3 and to replace a number of older lines running between these two areas. These projects will run until 2040. However, the actual investments included in the package may be reviewed in the event that requirements change in the period up to 2040.  The network development plan is based on various different scenarios254 for the period to 2040. The most important elements of the scenarios are nuclear power, wind power and electricity consumption. Nuclear power is expected to be gradually phased-out as the reactors age, with no current plans for new reactors. Ringhals reactor 2 was decommissioned in 2019 and Ringhals reactor 1 will be decommissioned during 2020, as per tannouncement. The remaining six reactors will continue to operate for as long as is safe and profitable. It is not possible to predict how long those reactors will continue to operate, but a service life of approximately 60 years is often cited, which would suggest that the reactors will continue to be operational until the first half of the 2040s, depending on the year in which they were commissioned. However, nuclear power plants will continue to operate for as long as they are profitable for the owners and safety requirements are met, which may be either shorter or longer than the expected 60 years. All reactors are located in electricity price area 3.  Wind power continues to expand, driven in the short term by the fact that the electricity certificate system has been extended to 2030. However, wind power is starting to prove commercially competitive without any support system and it now seems that the target set for 2030 in the electricity certificate system255 may be achievable as early as the first few years of the 2020s. One challenge posed by wind power expansion is that most new wind farms seem to be being built in electricity price areas 1 and 2, despite the fact that the majority of electricity consumption occurs in electricity price areas 3 and 4. The potentially lower price for electricity in the north of the country is offset by better wind conditions and generally clearer authorisation procedures.  Future electricity consumption represents a major uncertainty factor, but electrification of both transport and industry processes is a powerful driving force. Sweden and the Nordic region are also attractive locations in which to                                                       253 Svenska kraftnät  System Development Plan 2018-2027 (November 2017). 254 Svenska kraftnät  Long-term market analysis 2018 (SVK 2018/2260). 255 For more information on the objective of the electricity certificate system, see Heading 3.1.2. 155 (199) establish data centres, largely because of their low electricity prices, cool climate, and generally stable markets and political systems.  At European level, moreover, the scenarios for future development of power systems and electricity markets created by ENTSO-E256 are partly based on the various scenarios used by the transmission system operators themselves. These scenarios are partly at European level and partly at regional level, specifically the Regional Group Baltic Sea (RGBS) for Sweden.  Gas network There are currently no development forecasts relating to the Swedish natural gas network.  4.5.4 Electricity and gas markets, energy prices  4.5.4.1 Current situation on the electricity and gas markets, including energy prices  The electricity market The electricity market is made up of a wholesale and a retail market. Electricity is traded between producers and larger consumers on the Norway, Finland, Germany, Poland and Lithuania, and, indirectly, to the whole of Europe. The largest marketplace on the wholesale market is the NordPool spot market. This is a day-ahead market, where trading takes place via an auction process that accounts for transmission capacity in the intraday market, where participants are able to adjust their positions as required. A number of entities that have responsibility for balancing have a financial responsibility for maintaining balance during the planning stage, but, during operating hours, Svenska kraftnät is responsible for maintaining the balance of the electricity system and carrying out necessary positive and negative adjustments, by trading in balancing power on the real-time market, operated in conjunction with other Nordic system operators.  The electricity cost for end consumers consists of the electricity trade price, electricity network price, energy tax and value-added tax (VAT). In addition to the above costs, many retailers pay a fixed annual fee, which they pass on to the end consumer. This annual fee is usually in the range of SEK 100 to 500. All of these costs are subject to VAT.                                                        256 ENTSO-E & ENTSOG  TYNDP 2018, Scenario Report. 156 (199) Electricity traders are obliged to purchase electricity certificates Since 2007, the electricity certificate fee has been included in the electricity trade price.

The natural gas consumed in Sweden mainly comes from the Danish gas fields in the North Sea, via the Dragör line257. Because of the design of the Swedish gas network, the Swedish natural gas market is closely linked to the Danish market. Stakeholders in the Swedish natural gas system may, therefore, also be active on the Danish gas market, particularly Gaspoint Nordic, which has been a member of the pan-European gas exchange platform, PEGAS, since 24 November 2016.  Consequently, competition, price trends and transparency on the Swedish natural gas market are largely dependent on trends in Denmark. The strengthened on 1 April 2019 with the creation of a joint balancing zone between the countries. The project, known as the Joint Balancing Zone258, began in 2017 and has been implemented in collaboration with end consumers, gas suppliers, network owners and supervisory authorities in Sweden and Denmark. Its aim is to increase market size and to ensure even greater security of supply.  All trading of gas in the natural gas network in western Sweden is carried out                                                       257 It should be noted that, during tmarkets will be supplied by imported gas from continental Europe. 258 https://www.swedegas.se/sv-SE/Vara%20tjanster/Systemansvar/Joint%20Balancing%20Zone. 158 (199) through Gaspoint Nordic/PEGAS. Operators must have an agreement in place with the Danish transmission system operator Energinet.dk. Through Gaspoint Nordic/PEGAS, an operator may trade in gas and transport capacity on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Intraday trading also occurs. Energinet.dk, which has responsibility for balancing the market to manage the balance in the Danish natural gas network.  The price on Gaspoint Nordic/PEGAS is based on supply and demand and also forms the basis of what is known as the balancing price used by Energinet to resolve imbalances between market players.  Trading in domestically produced biogas also occurs outside the natural gas market in western Sweden. This happens most commonly when a particular biogas producer produces biogas and sells the gas produced to a specific customer, for example a municipal operator. The price that is set depends on local conditions and may also be affected by the cost of competing fuels, such as the price of diesel.  4.5.4.2 Development forecasts based on existing instruments and measures until at least 2040 (including 2030) An evolution of the price of electricity is being developed as part of the work on the long-term energy scenarios259. The price of electricity follows the TIMES-Nordic model and is based on assumptions relating to fossil fuel prices and prices for emission allowances obtained from the Commission.  Electricity price trends for the EU baseline scenario are shown in Figure 36. The price of electricity is calculated as an annual average for Sweden, which is treated as a price area.  The price of electricity increases from 2030 to 2040 as a result of fuel prices and prices for emission allowances increasing throughout that period.                                                                        259 Swedish Energy Agency   159 (199) Figure 36 Electricity price trend according to the Swedish Energy Agencys EU baseline scenario, SEK/MWh.
