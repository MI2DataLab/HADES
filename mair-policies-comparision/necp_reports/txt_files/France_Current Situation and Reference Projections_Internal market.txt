4.5. Internal energy market  4.5.1. The power grid  Power grids are a key component of energy transition. They connect producers and consumers, guarantee the quality and continuity of electricity supply and anchor France in the European electricity system through interconnections with six other countries.  The mass development of renewable energies under way is leading to a paradigm shift, with a significant change in electricity flows in the grids.   This leads to:  -  different geographical distribution of generation units; -  greater variability of the daily generation.  Figure 74: Change in the geographical distribution of electricity generation/consumption (source: RTE)   263      2019  hiver  2019  winter  2019  été  2019  summer  2035  soirée de printemps avec vent  2035  spring evening with wind  2035   2035  sunny summer day  Production  Production  Consommation  Consumption    The electricity system is evolving from generation that, historically, was almost entirely centralised, via the distribution system, to a generation model that is increasingly diffuse and closer to consumption points: for several years now, most new energy generation facilities have been renewable and connected to the distribution system.  At the end of the third quarter of 2019, 433,000 generation sites were connected to the distribution system managed by Enedis, and thus a total of 27.5 GW of installed power. The vast majority of these sites are low-power photovoltaic plants. For its part, although it represents a limited number of sites (around 1,900, of which 1,700 were connected to the distribution system), wind power counts for around 16 GW of cumulative power (of which 13.8 GW is connected to the distribution system).  The different types of renewable electrical energy have very different characteristics, which have variable impacts on the distribution and transmission systems. In addition to differences in plant size, differences in energy sources have an impact on generation profiles (seasonal, daily and hourly variability), predictability, and even the possibility of modulating generation rates68. Furthermore, the wave qualities or voltage profiles of these generation systems must be taken into account for effective  68 . Please refer to the chapter on security of the electricity supply for more information.   264    grid operation. Moreover, self-consumption, with or without injection of the non-self-consumed surplus into the grid and potentially combined with local storage, can significantly modify the consumption profiles of the sites concerned as seen from the grid (extraction). The net acceleration of the development of self-consumption observed in recent times could therefore have impacts on the coordination of the grid.  The large-scale integration of renewable energies and the development of new uses of electricity such as electric vehicles require the adaptation of the electrical system and the development of flexibility and adjustment solutions, which most often involve the grids.  Organisation of power grids  The operation of electricity transmission and distribution systems is a regulated public service.  The public electricity transmission system is used to transport huge quantities of power from one place reduced cost69. It consists of all the lines operated at a voltage greater than 50,000 V in mainland Metropolitan France. It comprises 106,000 km of high- and very-high-voltage power lines (HVB) and 2,700 substations. RTE, a public-owned company limited by shares, is the sole operator and owner.  More than 90% of current French electricity generation is injected into the transmission system, including the bulk of renewable generation (hydropower) and, in the future, offshore wind farms. This grid directly serves several hundred consumers, most of which are large industrial consumers, representing one quarter of national electricity consumption.   RTE, the transmission system operator, is also responsible for specific tasks in the management of the electricity system, particularly through the management of real-time supply and demand balancing mechanisms.  These are public electricity distribution systems, consisting of medium-voltage structures (HVA, between 1,000 V and 50,000 V) and low-voltage structures (LV, less than 1,000 V), connected to the transmission grid, which deliver the electricity to end consumers.  The public distribution of electricity takes place through local concessions. The authorities responsible for electricity distribution, also called concessionary authorities, are local authorities that own grids (municipalities, most often grouped into departmental energy unions, urban communities or metropolitan areas). Enedis, a subsidiary of the EDF group, which covers 95% of Metropolitan France, currently holds more than 600 concessions. Enedis operates 1.4 million kilometres of lines, 778,500 distribution stations (HVA/LV) and 2,700 source stations (HVB/HVA, providing the interface between the transmission and distribution systems). It serves more than 36 million consumers. A total of 5% of Metropolitan France is served by 140 local distribution companies (LDCs) controlled by local authorities.  The main tasks of the public electricity system operators are grid operation (troubleshooting, running and control of the network, connection of new consumers or producers), calculating the quantities of energy injected or taken off, and upgrading infrastructures to ensure that they are kept in operational condition.    Public power grid usage tariffs  Both electricity transmission and distribution are public services with tariffs that are regulated and set by the Energy Regulatory Commission in four-year periods. These tariffs for the use of public power  69 See the introduction to the new TYNDP (Ten-Year Network Development Plan), RTE, September 2019.   265    grids (TURPE) represent on average a little less than one third of the amounts billed to consumers (including taxes) and cover the investment and operating costs of the system operators RTE and Enedis. In particular, the tariff levels are set based on the investment forecasts of the system operators, so as to ensure that they have sufficient resources at all times to maintain or improve the infrastructures for which they are responsible. The tariffs are supported by incentive regulation mechanisms, in particular to encourage system operators to better control their costs or to improve the quality of supply.  For local distribution companies (LDC) and for system operators in non-interconnected zones (NIZ), revenues are adjusted to actual costs incurred through the Electricity Equalisation Fund.  The TURPE is based on tariff equalisation principles (an identical tariff throughout the country) and on (pricing is independent of the distance covered by the electricity).  tariff structure as part of the energy transition process and a specific regulation for the deployment of smart meters. These tariffs include the introduction of a mobile peak option for medium voltage. From 2017, the Energy Regulatory Commission began a consultation process to prepare for the tariff review in 2020 to enable better consideration of the specific constraints of self-consumption and other new uses.  Since November 2017, small renewable energy generation facilities have benefited from coverage by the TURPE of some of the cost of connection to public electricity distribution systems. This tariff reduction  of up to 40%, depending on the capacity of the installation  facilitates the connection of facilities that do not generally have any choice about their location (particularly photovoltaic panels on roofs).    The public power transmission system  Investment-planning tools  Power grids are long-lived infrastructures; they require substantial investments that need to be planned well in advance. This is especially true for the transmission system, which has an investment time frame of around 10 years. Planning is all the more complex as it relies on several documents, drawn up both at national and European level.  The Third Energy Package for the internal market, adopted by the EU Member States in 2009, introduced a coordinated approach to planning transmission system investments: Every two years, the Association of European Network Operators (ENTSO-E) is required to publish a European 10-year plan for the development of the European electricity transmission system (TYNDP70). Nationally, each transmission system operator draws up its ten-year network development plan (TYNDP), which must be consistent with the plan developed by the ENTSO-E. It is based on existing supply and demand and on reasonable medium-term assumptions of changes in electricity generation, consumption and crossborder grid trade. It describes the primary transmission infrastructures to be constructed or significantly modified over the 10-year period, lists the investments already decided on and the new investments to be made within three years, with a timetable for all the investment projects. Each year, the 10-year plan is updated and submitted for consideration by the Energy Regulatory Commission, which may require changes.  Continuing the development of interconnections  The construction of cross-border interconnections has historically been a response to a supply security rationale and enables the export use of French electricity generation surpluses, especially at night and in summer.   70 Ten-Year Network Development Plan; See http://tyndp.entsoe.eu/    266    Interconnections also offer the possibility of importing electricity from a neighbouring country in the event of a strain on domestic supply, which is an economically efficient solution. Interconnections mean that France does not need to invest in additional capacity to ensure its supply security, and to facilitate the pooling of production investments with neighbouring countries. Cross-border exchanges thus make it possible to have capacity available abroad, with an average contribution of between 8 and 10 GW. In the short term, the planned developments will lead to an increase in import capacity from 11 GW for winter 20162017 to 13 GW for winter 20202021.   With a total of 48 interconnection lines and 12 additional projects by 2030, including three under interconnection capacity was 17.4 GW in exports and 12.5 GW in imports, representing an interconnection rate of around 11.4%. The capacities actually used on average are lower (around 8 to 10 GW), because of the characteristics of the interconnection lines, their availability and the internal constraints on the power grids of each country. By 2030, this is expected to exceed 26 GW of interconnections, reaching at least 16.5%.   The French public power transmission system is currently interconnected with six countries (Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland), as the following figure illustrates.    Figure 75: Interconnection capacities in 2017        Import/export capacities in 2015  +15 GW en export et + 12GW en import  +15 GW exports and +12 GW imports  en 2017  in 2017    The construction of cross-border interconnections has historically been a response to a supply security rationale and enables the export use of French electricity generation surpluses, especially at night and in summer. Interconnections also offer the possibility of importing electricity from a neighbouring country in the event of a strain on domestic supply, which is an economically efficient solution at European level, especially during periods of peak consumption.   267    Interconnections enable bulking of the geographical risks between countries, and this is all the more effective where the specific attributes of each country reduce the correlations of the risks and mitigate the consequences of the occurrence of national tensions. The primary risk uncertainty in France today is the temperature-sensitive nature of demand, and this will continue to be the case over the MEP period; the risk associated with the intermittent nature of renewable energies is currently the major concern in countries with the greatest penetration rate for these renewable energies (Denmark, Germany); the risk associated with hydropower production is dominant in countries where it has a major generation role (Norway, Switzerland, Portugal). Interconnections avoid the need for France to invest in additional capacity to ensure its supply security.  Finally, the development of interconnections facilitates the integration of the European electricity market; it allows neighbouring countries to access electricity at the lowest cost by taking advantage of the complementary nature of their generation mix.  The 10-year development plan for the power transmission system drawn up by RTE in 2019 provides for a doubling of the exchange capacity by 2035 (up to 8 GW by 2025) to reach a capacity of around 30 GW. These figures are consistent with the scenarios in the 2017 RTE forecast report: two of these assume an import capacity of 27 GW and an export capacity of 33 GW to ensure that the system is balanced by 2035.  Given the flexibility challenges of the French and European electricity system, it seems essential to -year network development plan, and to study the appropriateness of developing new interconnections on the basis of a cost-benefit and project acceptability analysis.    Major investment guidelines  The transmission system currently faces a number of trends. The stabilisation observed in consumption nationally masks significant disparities between regions, related in particular to demographic changes; the development of renewable energies is also highly variable locally, in particular in respect of weather patterns. The change in the geographic distribution of generation units caused by the transformation of the electricity mix results in a modification of flows through the grid, which plays an increasing backup and solidarity role between territories, in particular through an expected reinforcement of flows on very-high-voltage lines, up to 400,000 V. As a consequence, the transmission system is key to enabling the integration of large quantities of variable-generation renewables, leading to uncertainties associated with more volatile instantaneous power, in France and in Europe, and the need to manage variations in consumption.  To address these issues and allow the change of mix planned by the MEP, RTE presented a strategy for the transformation of the grid in 20202035 in September 2019 as part of its 10-year plan. The Minister of Ecological and Inclusive Transition wrote to RTE on 13 November 2019 to approve this strategy, which sets out French energy policy in operational terms. She also asked for the use of capping of renewable energies to be minimal and covered by a specific regulatory framework.  To successfully implement this grid adaptation strategy, transmission system investments in the next 10 the new offshore wind farms.  In its 10-year plan, RTE anticipates a need to create and upgrade about 560 km of infrastructures per year between 2021 and 2035, of which around 350 km would be structural adaptations to networks, essentially on the sub-transmission system and underground systems. This involves the upgrading of the old grid, interconnections and the connection of renewables. With major strengthening, the grid can accommodate up to 50 GW of additional renewable installed power (solar and wind farms), on condition that options to provide flexibility are implemented. This threshold will be reached in 2025: after that,  268    more structural reinforcements will be necessary, through reinforcement of certain historical north-south axes. The grid should be able to accommodate 10 to 15 GW of offshore renewable generation capacity by 2035.   The grid transformation strategy presented by RTE in September 2019 is based on the use of flexible solutions that make it possible to limit infrastructure investments wherever possible, through the improvement of digital solutions to optimise electricity flows, participation in the implementation of -nge capacity at the borders, or incentives to change behaviours.  means a significant increase in costs linked to the connection of offshore wind projects, an increase in million per year). This makes it possible to extend the life of the infrastructures and push back certain grid adaptation investments beyond 2025 and particularly 2030, without degrading the operation of the electrical system.   The increased grid costs support the implementation of energy transition over the 20212035 period. The share of costs in the electricity transmission system remains around 10% of the total annualised costs of the electrical system. Seen in terms of generation (+92 GW of renewable energy), the cost associated with the adaptation of the grid to accommodate renewable energies remains limited up to 2035. Orders of magnitude can be specified for land-based renewable energy, with the costs of adapting 64, which should continue  The purpose of digitising the grids is to replace the monitoring and control systems in electrical substations, which have historically been electromechanical, with digital systems to enable better collection of information in real time and improve the coordination of the system. The work of the system operators obviously involves essential research efforts in cybersecurity. This work is carried out under the supervision of the Network and Information Security Agency (ANSSI). System operators also have access to specific telecommunications infrastructures, which are intended to be expanded for this reason.    Public power distribution systems  Major investment guidelines  The development of renewable energies and new electricity uses, including electric vehicles, require that the structure and management of low- and medium-voltage distribution systems be rethought.   Distribution grids were initially designed exclusively as top-down structures, i.e. to route electricity to consumption areas. Nowadays, they accommodate the bulk of new renewable energy installations, creating a need for modernisation procedures to facilitate the two-way operation of the grids.  Moreover, the development of decentralised generation, especially in low consumption areas, may require the creation or reinforcement of grid structures. In this respect, the location of decentralised generation facilities and the size of the installations in relation to decisive in terms of connection costs.  Regarding the integration of electric vehicles, the deployment of recharging infrastructures open to the public should see an exponential acceleration. Investments depend in particular on the nature of the terminals installed (fast or slow recharging), which create more or fewer constraints on the grid.   269    For these two goals  the connection of renewable energies and the connection of recharging infrastructures for electric vehicles  the attainment of the objectives set in this MEP could involve an million in 2028.  These amounts should be viewed in the light of the total investment by Enedis in the distribution system separate investment framework). Generally speaking, after a period of lower investment in grid upgrade works, resulting in particular in an overall ageing of the infrastructures and worsening of the average interruption time, Enedis commenced a new investment cycle several years ago. Projected investment 3.461 billion, up 5.8% compared  each year in the distribution grids, in particular using the resources provided by the TCCFE (final electricity consumption tax) and indirectly by TURPE through the local authority rural electrification support fund (CAS Facé) or fees linked to concessions.  Over the 20202023 period, investment requirements in electricity distribution systems will continue to grow, to continue the upgrading of existing grids and to adapt to the new sources of generation and consumption described above.  The priority programmes include ensuring the security and reliability of substations in dense urban areas, extending the service life of overhead medium-voltage lines in rural areas and upgrading dilapidated underground cables in metropolitan areas. Investments have historically focused on medium voltage , but must also be developed on the electrical equipment of distribution stations and the low-voltage (LV) system located downstream of these stations, which serves the bulk of consumers, in order to limit ageing and eradicate technologies that could cause uncertainties (especially heatwaves and floods) is another significant objective, specifically targeted by the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (PNACC).      Investment planning and governance at national level  In view of this growth in investments in the distribution system and the strategic nature of that grid for the integration of renewable energies and the development of new electrical uses, effective coordination and clear governance are essential in the coming years to ensure good investment management.   While investments in distribution systems are still driven by the specific aspects of local situations (the emergence of grid constraints due to the development of consumption or generation, cable ageing, etc.), governance at national level must make it possible to ensure that investments are consistent and must guarantee a geographical balance.  The NOME law in 2010 established the Départemental Conferences, annual meetings under the aegis of the prefects to present the investment programmes of the various public power distribution system stakeholders, distribution system operators and organising authorities in each department.  The Public Electricity Distribution System Committee (CSDPE), created by the Law on Energy investment policy and those of the authorities organising electricity distribution and local electricity distribution undertakings, relying in particular on the summaries of work provided by the Départemental Conferences to ensure coordination between national and local investment policies and to assess their relevance. Improving the visibility of the full range of investments and of the detailed report on the  270    distribution grids at local level is a key issue for this coordination role and for the formulation of proposals for guidelines on investment policies71.  European cooperation  European cooperation on supply security is implemented in France primarily through participation in the Pentalateral Energy Forum (or Pentaforum)  a regional initiative launched in 2005 to streamline electricity exchanges through the better operation of electricity interconnections and, generally, more efficient coordination of electricity supply security. This initiative has proved to be a priority framework for cooperation among its seven member countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland) through effective dialogue and good coordination between governments, system operators and regulators in the participating countries.  Since 2015, the Forum has contributed to:   the production of two studies evaluating the supply-demand balance of the electrical system for the Pentaforum network, based on shared hypotheses and a common methodology (probabilistic and hour-by-hour model, similar to the RTE forecast report);   performance of an electricity crisis coordination drill with all stakeholders in each Pentaforum country; this exercise is part of the sharing of best practices for the implementation of the European regulations in force and in the process of development;   implementation of flow-based market coupling in the Centre-West region of Europe, marking a new stage in the integration of European electricity systems. By using a more detailed description of the grid to optimise exchanges, the flow-based method significantly improves the convergence of day-ahead prices while maintaining a high level of grid security. This not only reduces generation costs in the countries concerned, but also helps to improve supply security.    n issues of flexibility, integration of intraday markets, and the explicit inclusion of foreign capacities in capacity mechanisms.  Discussions are also taking place with the Iberian Peninsula administrations on these subjects in the context of the High-Level Group created following the Madrid Declaration in 2015. Cooperation within interconnection project between France and Spain.  Finally, Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 provides for the development of grid codes, which has led to the drafting of a European regulation on emergency situations and the restoration of the electrical system. This text has entered into force and shall apply from December 2018. In particular, it will enable the harmonised technical management of electricity crises at European level. A second grid code, established based on a guideline for the operation of the electrical system, enables a harmonised approach to the running of the transmission systems under normal operation and in stress situations (cold snaps, for example).   4.5.1.1. Smart grids  communication technologies, that enable grids to adapt and promote the major ongoing developments  71 . The local aspects of management of these investments is covered in Chapter 7 on Local Involvement.   271    in the electrical system: insertion of variable renewable energies and development of new uses of electricity, including electric mobility and self-consumption.  Expected benefits  Smart grid technologies benefit all stakeholders in the electrical system.  They promote a reinforcement of the role of consumers by enabling them to participate in the optimal operation of the system, particularly through the development of self-consumption, curtailment of consumption and smart recharging.  They enable system operators to optimise their operations: in particular through a better understanding of the constraints and the possibility of remote operation of numerous grid elements, they can run the grid close to its limits, make it more resilient to uncertainties (for example through auto-backup) and avoid expensive investments. Flow optimisation also makes it possible to mitigate grid losses, which currently account for 8% of power consumption.  Smart grid solutions also foster the optimisation of generation installations in order to avoid the need to invest in new fossil-based power generation capacity, enabling management of renewable energy generation where this is possible, and promoting new sources of flexibility through storage.  Economic significance  In-depth studies on the longer-term socioeconomic significance of the various smart grid solutions have been conducted by the system operators with ADEME. These studies concluded that all smart grid solutions identified by system operators by 2030 are economically significant72, with net benefits    It should be noted that the economic benefits of many smart grid technologies are closely linked to the regulatory framework and its ability to provide an economic manifestation of the services actually rendered to the electricity system.    Considerable technical challenges  The main technical issues in the field of smart grids are:    stability of the electricity system, are currently provided to a large extent by the major thermal-based generation installations (nuclear, fossil-fired).   The storage of electricity can meet very varied needs in contributing to the efficient operation of the system: storage of power to meet almost instantaneous balancing needs, intraday storage intended to smooth a consumption or generation load curve, or longer-term storage of up to a few months to adapt to seasonal differences in generation and consumption patterns. Multiple  72 be downloaded from http://www.enedis.fr/la-valorisation-economique-des-smart-grids.   272    technologies are available (batteries, hydrogen, flywheels, pump stations, etc.) and developments must continue to find the optimal technical/economic options.   The management of electric vehicle recharging represents a major challenge in reducing the impact on grids and management of the supply-demand balance. Vehicle-to-Grid (VtG) solutions will make it possible to inject electricity stored in vehicle batteries into the grid.   Many smart grid components rely on the development of software and telecommunications solutions that make it possible to obtain real-time information on the status of the grid and its constraints, to process the data produced effectively and to act remotely on the various parts of the grid, in a manner that is economically efficient, to make data available to the market actors. Because electricity grids are a vital infrastructure, particular attention must be paid to cybersecurity, because the increased number of grid entry points and information exchanges could increase their vulnerability.   Smart grid solutions require the involvement of many types of actors: electricity suppliers, balancing managers, aggregators, suppliers of technical equipment for the grid or for metering, energy solution integrators, software solution providers, telecom operators, car manufacturers, etc. Raising the awareness of each category to the operations and constraints of others is a major challenge in enabling the optimal development of these solutions.  Encouraging the development of smart grids  The development of smart grids in recent years has been structured around the implementation of the France campaign. This plan aims to consolidate the French electricity and IT sectors in new high-growth and job-creating markets. Public support has played a critical role in enabling innovation in the development of smart grid solutions. Many trials have been launched in France over the last several years. As part of the future investment about 20 demonstrators being implemented. These demonstrators promote the grouping of actors with complementary expertise (system operators, manufacturers, SMEs/SMIs, start-ups, laboratories, local authorities, etc.), which accelerates the development of new technologies and new business models. Smart grid solutions tested under real-life conditions have involved, in particular, the insertion of renewable energies into the grids, the development of technological components for modernisation of grid operation, and energy demand management73.  Research is also encouraged, for example with the SuperGrid Institute for Energy Transition (ITE), a collaborative research platform that brings together the skills of industry and public research in a publicprivate joint investment arrangement. The programme aims to develop new technologies for electricity transmission systems, in particular high-voltage direct current (HVDC). SuperGrid receives  All of these mechanisms aim to promote the development of the sector in order to enable it to benefit as quickly as possible from smart grid technologies, in France but also internationally.  The economic significance of smart grid solutions depends largely on the local context: regulatory framework, intermittent energy penetration rate, electricity price, level of grid interconnection with foreign countries, etc.  At institutional level, France is also very active in European and international bodies addressing smart grid themes, for example within the working groups of the International Energy Agency or the Mission Innovation initiative, set up during COP21 in Paris. The discussions in these forums make it possible to leverage the expertise developed in France and to benefit from the expertise of other countries.   73 . The regional programmes Flexgrid, SMILE and You&Grid are discussed in Chapter 7 on Local Involvement.   273    Data: the key issue  The deployment of smart grid technologies is made possible by, and is accompanied by, the production of more and more data on the status of the grid and on consumption and generation, for increasingly detailed (granular) geographical levels and time intervals. These data open up new prospects for energy transition in terms of local governance of grids, especially in relation to multi-fluid planning (electricity, gas, district heating systems):   For consumers, understanding and interpreting smart meter data, which is more accurate and easily available, can support action to control energy consumption.   In terms of grid operation, the data make it possible to use the infrastructures at their maximum capacity and optimise investments.  Internet tools are being rolled out to enable project developers to measure the grid impact of the connection of renewable electricity generation facilities or electric vehicle recharging infrastructures, notably by Enedis; they constitute a real breakthrough.  Moreover, more and more data on annual consumption on a more detailed geographical level  making it possible to maintain data confidentiality where necessary  or on local consumption profiles are made available to everybody on open data portals. They facilitate the development of local public energy transition policies and will enable the effectiveness of these policies to be monitored and evaluated.  Given the proliferation of data that will be provided by smart grids, discussions between stakeholders, suppliers and data users must continue, to achieve a data governance approach that is satisfactory for everyone and serves energy transition. Ensuring the greatest possible clarity on the rules for sharing, use and protection of data is a major issue.     In particular, the tasks of managers of public electricity grids will evolve with the proliferation of the data for which they are responsible. There is a need to ensure that all actors within the electricity system can have access to relevant data in a simple, transparent and secure manner.  The smart meter: a major asset  The deployment of Linky smart meters began on 1 December 2015 and will continue until 2021. More than 23 million meters have already been installed.   The investment The roll-out involves a first capital-intensive phase at the start of the project (from 2014 to 2021), followed by a second phase of ROI. The business model for the meter is balanced over its 20-year service life, i.e. the gains offset the costs of deployment, thus entailing a neutral long-term effect on tariffs.  Smart meters offer two key innovations over existing meters:    a much finer (more detailed) measurement of consumption and information on the quality of the electricity supplied;   two-way communication: the meters can send information and receive instructions using power line communication technology.  Smart meters play a fundamental role in grid modernisation by making it possible for system operators to significantly increase the observability of the low-voltage grid, in particular through more detailed  274    (granular) monitoring of the level of voltage on the low-voltage network, and faster detection of consumption faults and anomalies.  The meters promote the emergence of consumer control services, which they will support. They also support the deployment of new pricing mechanisms, which enable greater transparency on the costs of the electricity system and encourage the right incentives, in terms of transmission tariffs (TURPE) or deals offered by electricity suppliers. Because consumers are able to exercise greater control over their consumption, they will be participating in the optimisation of the power grid and the means of production.  4.5.1.2. The development of flexibility of electricity demand: curtailment  New uses of electricity and their impact on the consumption profile  The uses of electricity are constantly changing, especially for individuals, with the continuous development of new electrical and electronic equipment for comfort and leisure and changing HVAC needs. Furthermore, the target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 is encouraging the transfer of certain uses to electricity in transport and in industry. In particular, the development of electric mobility could have a major impact on the electrical system depending on the recharging management strategy adopted. It is therefore essential to develop solutions for optimising the charging of electric vehicles (regulatory, economic, tariffs, etc.) in order to smooth consumption and limit impacts on the grid and the electrical system.  Curtailment of consumption: a useful lever of flexibility for the electric system  The Energy Code defines electricity consumption curtailment as the action intended to obtain, from a particular consumer and upon request, a temporary reduction of the level of electricity taken off electricity transmission or distribution systems, compared to a forecast schedule of consumption or estimated consumption.  Curtailments help to balance the entire electrical system in real-time, by using short mobilisation delays.  Curtailments are intended to replace peak production resources such as thermal power plants during peak winter consumption periods. They can also help limit the need for grid reinforcement and related costs. Consumption curtailments can be achieved in two ways:   Consumers are encouraged by their suppliers to reduce consumption during peak periods by a higher price as part of their supply contract: in this case, the Energy Code refers to curtailment that is inseparable from supply.  Historically, this type of offer has played an important role, because of the existence of certain pricing options in regulated sTEMPO rates. The phasing-out of certain tariffs (EJP bleu tariff since 1998 and Tempo bleu professionnel from 2004), as well as the end of the yellow and green regulated sales tariffs on 1 January 2016, has led to a marked reduction in the volume of these curtailments, which is now below one gigawatt, despite efforts made to promote the development of this type of demand management and, in particular, opening the TEMPO signal up to competition in 2014. This downward trend should change direction and will be reversed in the coming years through the gradual deployment of Linky meters by 2021, which will enable energy suppliers to offer deals based on the features offered by this meter differentiated according to time, day and season, including the incorporation of mobile peaks. This possibility of offering differentiated deals is further reinforced by the integration into TURPE 5 of hourly/seasonal slots and even, for certain voltage levels, a mobile peak signal, as provided for business customers with medium-voltage connections.   which offers a service that is separable from a supply offer.   275    Recent years have also been marked by a growth in curtailment volumes activated by curtailment operators, economic actors whose added value is to aggregate curtailment capacities at end customers (industrial, tertiary or diffuse) and to use these curtailment capacities over the different time periods of the electricity markets. The aggregation allows for a bulking of capacities and economic optimisation by the operators, which can thus develop innovative solutions to meet the energy and capacity needs of the electrical system.  Different types of consumers and electrical uses among these consumers can, in practice, be curtailed. heating, domestic hot water, or the charging of an electric vehicle. For commercial, industrial or tertiary consumers, curtailment is achieved in particular by interrupting a manufacturing process, shutting down refrigeration systems in tertiary warehouses, or using a local method of electricity generation (generator) in place of extraction from the public power grid.  The consumption curtailments estimation framework  In order to encourage the development of curtailment capacity, France has undertaken an in-depth reform of its electricity market with the aim of opening up all market mechanisms to curtailment, so that they can participate in the same way as power generation facilities.  Industrial curtailments (since 2003) and diffuse curtailments (since 2007) can participate in the adjustment mechanism operated by RTE, which is intended to ensure real-time supply-demand balancing and secure grid operation. In 2018, about 22.3 GWh of curtailment was activated using the adjustment mechanism, for an average capacity of 727 MW deposited on that mechanism.  Curtailments can also participate in the various reserves contracted by RTE for balancing the system74:   transmission system since the launch of a trial on 1 July 2014. In 2018, the primary reserve had about 140 MW of curtailment (almost 10%, with a 12% average level and 20% peaks in late 2018).   Participation in rapid and complementary reserves since 2011, with a gradual increase in opening, which has made it possible to reach a curtailment capacity participation of 530 MW on average in rapid reserves (about 50% of the contracted rapid reserve) and 45 MW in complementary reserves in 2018.  Since 1 January 2014, curtailments can also be exchanged between market players in the energy market generated and 1 MWh of curtailed electricity is strictly equivalent. In 2018, nearly 27 GWh of curtailment was exchanged via this mechanism.  Finally, curtailments can participate in the capacity mechanism, which has been operational since 1 January 2017.  In addition to these market mechanisms, the Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth has also to meet the objectives set in the MEP for the development of flexibilities. The implementation of this system required prior validation of the scheme by the European Commission, under the State aid regime; this involved an approval procedure during which the Commission asked for competitive criteria to be  74 To ensure the success of its system balancing tasks and guarantee its security, RTE ensures that it provides sufficient flexibility reserves at all times, to balance grid injections and extractions. Some of these reserves (rapid and complementary reserves) are mobilised through the adjustment mechanism. Each of these reserves is subject to contracts entered into by RTE and agents that are then paid to make the capacities in question available (irrespective of potential demand).   276    put in place to ensure the competitiveness of the calls for tenders and the proportionality of the support provided to the sector. The system was formally approved on 7 February 2018 for a period of six years, until 31 December 2023. This approval has made it possible to secure the completion of annual calls for tender, with the volume targets for each year detailed below.    Target trajectory  (in MW)  Annual volume of curtailment tenders  Including category >  1 MW  Including category <  1 MW  2018  2200  1900  300  2019  2500  2000  500  2020  2900  2100  800  2021  2000  1000  1000  2022  1800  500  1300    Target trajectory  (in MW)  Annual volume of curtailment tenders  Including catego 1 MW  ry >  Including category <  1 MW  2023  2000  500   1500    Target volumes for each call for tenders   In total, for the year 2019, the volume of curtailment capacity available to ensure supply security during peak periods can be estimated as 2,900 MW. This corresponds to about 2,300 MW of certified curtailment capacity on the capacity mechanism, plus about 600 MW of curtailment performed by suppliers.   Current curtailment pool and outlook for development of the sector  The figure of 2,900 MW of curtailment capacity existing in France should be viewed in terms of the resources that it is technically possible to develop and economically important to establish. This achievable pool depends on several factors, in particular future changes in the electricity mix, the costs of deploying the new curtailment capacity, and the value that the community is willing to devote to support the development of this activity.  Since the previous MEP exercise, several studies  published in 2017  have been conducted to assess curtailment development prospects in France:   the study by ADEME,75 which specifically addressed industrial and tertiary curtailments;   75 . Electrical curtailment in France  Evaluation of curtailment potential by process modulation in industry and tertiary in Metropolitan France, ADEME, 2017.   277     the study by RTE76 which, continuing the initial works on smart grids from 2015, proposed to establish appropriate development targets for the various curtailment sectors (diffuse, tertiary and industrial) up to 2030.  These works lead to the following observations:   the value of curtailments is largely capacity-related (according to ADEME, 95% of the revenues for the sector are capacity-related);   the continued diversification of the electricity mix should reinforce development opportunities for the sector.  In view of the results of the ADEME and RTE studies, the figure of 5 GW of industrial and tertiary curtailment capacity (including interruptible capacity) represents a high threshold: according to ADEME, this amount represents the upper range of the economically achievable pool with a 7778. Still based on the analyses from the transmission system operator, at present, the economically relevant pool would be close to 3 GW. For diffuse curtailment, by 2030, the RTE study envisages a potential:   of 300,000 households, large consumers, equipped with real-time consumption management devices;     coordination of different uses  including heating  using smart meters: with 7 million households for management of hot water, 5 million for the management of electric vehicles and 700,000 for heating.  In view of these elements, a diffuse curtailment potential of around 1.5 GW by 2030 seems consistent. In total, there is therefore a target of 6.5 GW of curtailment capacity  unchanged from the previous MEP  by 2028. Reaching this target will nevertheless depend on changing costs in the sector during the time frame and the level of demand that the system will face for new capacity.  However, it is proposed that a more gradual approach be applied for the interim milestone target for 2023, with this being lowered to 4.5 GW in order to set a smooth growth trajectory for the sector towards this target by 2028.   This rephasing in achieving the target set for 2028  which does not jeopardise the role that the sector will need to play in the long-term  can be explained by the following:   an initially optimistic view of the need for new capacities, which, because it has not materialised, has not made it possible to support the economic development of curtailment at the pace anticipated in the first MEP;   an issue of technical consolidation and enhancement of the reliability of the sector, which has led to the elimination of a certain volume of capacity formerly offered by curtailment operators, on the basis that they did not meet legitimately expected reliability standards79;   76 .

Presentation on consumption curtailments for the CURTE market access commission, organised on 27 January.    278     an issue of changing the support framework for curtailment, in order to best meet the expectations of the industry.  The framework through which the curtailment call for tenders is undertaken is the result of negotiations with the EC competition authorities; they required the implementation of measures to ensure the competitiveness of the call for tenders and the proportionality of the public support provided to the sector.  Adjustments to this framework could be envisaged to take account of the results of the first calls for tenders. To that end, several complementary initiatives have been launched and are now under way in the realm of curtailment, including the following in particular:    A project led by Philippe Van de Maele on the development of consumption curtailment and energy-saving measures in the residential sector.   A discussion led by DGEC, ADEME, CRE, RTE and Enedis, informed in large part by a summer 2019 dialogue regarding curtailment, which seeks to analyse the relevance of the regulatory framework and existing support mechanisms in relation to the development objectives laid down in the MEP. Where applicable, it also aims to make proposals for additional measures to promote the achievement of these objectives.   The year 2020 will be an opportunity to implement the complementary recommendations from these various initiatives. Proposed adjustments should be compatible with EU law on State aid, which may, in some cases, involve discussions with European Commission departments.  These adjustments should be compatible with EU law on State aid, which may, in some cases, involve discussions with European Commission departments.    4.5.1.3. Electricity storage  Electricity storage provides a response to the issues associated with the variability of generation and consumption. Storage makes it possible to flatten production peaks and transfer energy to consumption peaks at different timescales (ranging from a few seconds or minutes to several months or even years depending on the technologies). The storage of energy is therefore a complementary solution to curtailments and to the deployment of smart grids to increase the share of renewable energies.  The services rendered by storage for the electrical system are of different types:    Electricity generation: optimisation of generation (e.g. smoothing, load monitoring, shifting of generation, market arbitrage).   Electricity transmission and distribution: participation in system services according to grid codes, arbitrage with the construction of new lines, optimisation of grid management, voltage control and distribution security.   Consumption: decrease in peak consumption, continuity of supply, self-consumption or even energy autonomy at isolated sites.  At present, the law does not set any target for electricity storage.  State of play for technologies  There are currently a large number of electricity storage technologies, each with various costs, maturity levels and technical characteristics in terms of power, energy, response time and charge-discharge  279    interval times and different energy densities targeting centralised, distributed or diffuse storage markets. By providing responses for different services, technologies offer a certain degree of complementarity. Energy storage solutions fall into three main categories:    facilities using potential mechanical energy such as pumped-energy transfer stations (STEPs), hydroelectric dams, and compressed air energy storage (CAES), which are more centralised storage technologies capable of returning electricity for periods ranging from days to weeks;    facilities using kinetic mechanical energy such as flywheels, which are very short-term storage solutions.       batteries, cells and capacitors are decentralised or diffuse storage technologies that are more suited to very short-term storage (a few seconds or minutes) or short-term storage (a day, for example);   the hydrogen produced by electrolysis is considered a means of inter-seasonal storage through power-to-gas, although electrolysers are also able to operate quickly on demand.      Currently, no electricity storage technology is able to cover all of these services at the same time, and the services provided may also depend on the position of the facility on the power grids.   State of play of storage in France  Pumped-energy transfer stations (STEPs) and hydroelectric dams are currently the major large-scale storage solutions in France (4.3 GW STEPs and 13 GW hydro with reservoir). It is estimated that there is still potential of around 2 GW in Metropolitan France for this technology. STEPs today are still the                 280    conditions to achieve a return on a new investment without short-term grants. There is a further 13 to 20 TWh of thermal storage in hot water tanks.   Development prospects  In electricity mixes with a large share of variable renewable energies, different types of storage are necessary to ensure the supply-demand balance, for example:    In the very short-term, means capable of reacting very quickly, such as batteries, flywheels or super-capacitors, are useful to compensate for a possible drop in frequency, and even faster where the system has less inertia through increased development of photovoltaic or wind power.   Short-term (day-to-day) means such as batteries or STEPs make it possible to manage the evening peak, for example by using any surplus solar production from midday during peaks.   Longer-term (weekly to inter-seasonal) means will make it possible to mitigate, for example, -systems that can be met by STEPs and by other storage technologies such as hydrogen, compressed air energy storage and certain forms of thermal storage.  The needs of each of these types of storage are intrinsically linked to the electricity mix planned for Metropolitan France, but also to those of our European neighbours.  By 2028, over the time frame of the MEP, with the expected penetration of renewable energies and the changes to the electricity mix determined by this MEP, there will be no additional storage needs to ensure the supply-demand balance. The electrical system in Metropolitan France, which is integrated into the European electricity system, already has enough resilience.  This will remain the case until 2035 in the Volt and Ampere scenarios presented by RTE in its 2017 forecast report:   In the Volt scenario (40% renewable energy and 56% nuclear in 2035, i.e. 55 GW), the flexibilities on consumption are sufficient to meet the flexibility needs of the electricity system. The characteristics of the system as laid down by RTE do not make it possible to make a return on investments in additional storage assets.   In the Ampere scenario (50% renewables and 46% nuclear power in 2035, i.e. 48.5 GW), the need for new flexibilities is also low to 2035 and can likewise be provided by curtailment. Storage remains a less competitive solution over this time frame.  however, that this lack of a need for new flexibility depends on the controllable capabilities installed in France, particularly nuclear.  rapidly by renewable energies beneath the 50% threshold and reach 38.5 GW in 2035, additional flexibility will be needed. RTE therefore considers the following flexibilities: +3.5 GW of curtailment, +2 GW of new STEPs and +2 GW of battery storage, based on a process of cumulative flexibilities rather than competition between them.  The development of renewable energies coupled with the eventual decommissioning of the existing nuclear installations may therefore require new flexibility requirements beyond the MEP time frame to ensure the supply-demand balance of the electricity system. Given the time needed to launch certain investments or to develop certain sectors, steps must be taken during the MEP time frame.  With regard to STEPs, the decisions on implementing these projects need to be brought forward, in view of the duration of the procedures and the work to be undertaken (nearly 10 years) and insofar as these  281    decisions must be incorporated into the concession award procedures. Development potential of 1.5 GW of STEPs has already been identified and could be developed as part of the reopening of hydroelectric concessions to be awarded before 2025. It would seem useful to develop this in view of the expected daily and weekly needs of the electricity system from 2030 to 2035.  Moreover, in addition to hydrogen, several uses already involve the development of battery storage by 2028, linked to the rapid drop observed in the cost of this technology (see graph below):   battery usage could be considered to provide system services (e.g. primary and secondary frequency adjustment, as batteries have very fast response times). However, the accessible market potential remains limited (competition with generation and curtailment, total reserves of less than 2 GW);   development of batteries can also be expected by private consumers, in connection with the development of self-consumption, in order to maximise self-consumption rates;   the development of electric vehicles will also spread batteries throughout the country, so new associated f-to-connected to the recharging point;   finally, storage could also make it possible to avoid or defer investments for grid reinforcement in order to avoid local congestion when renewable energies are generating at the same time in grid-constrained areas, thus avoiding the need to cap them.

The batteries tested have a capacity of 12 MW and thus 24 MWh at each site. The trial will take place over three years (from 2020 to 2023). From 2023, the batteries will be operated by third parties and will be able to provide several services: frequency adjustment, generation/consumption adjustment, congestion resolution, etc. The use of batteries instead of grid reinforcement might therefore find an economically viable role during the period covered by the MEP.      4.5.1.4. Self-consumption and local energy generation  Individual self-conswith the notion of self- Figure 77: Illustration of the concepts of self-consumption and self-generation    Réseau électrique  Electricity grid  Autoconsommation  Self-consumption  Autoproduction  Self-generation  La maison consomme tout ou partie de réseau.  The house consumes all or some of the electricity generated by the photovoltaic installation. If self-consumption is not total, the electricity generated is discharged onto the grid.    The photovoltaic installation generates all or some of the electricity consumed by the house. If self-generation is not total, the house consumes electricity from the grid.    In practice, in the majority of cases, consumption sites will need to use the traditional electricity grid for certain periods, either to obtain electricity or to inject excess electricity generated by their local generation installation. Thus, operating on a self-consumption or self-generation basis does not mean being energy self-sufficient.   283    The development of individual self-consumption is now a reality and has accelerated in recent years:   at the end of the second quarter of 2019, nearly 200 MW of capacity was connected for selfconsumption by almost 52,000 installations, i.e. double the amount recorded in the second quarter of 2018;   in 2019, 90% of connection requests or declarations made to distribution system operators for photovoltaic projects concerned self-consumption projects.  Collective self-consumption projects have also been proliferating. There are currently 16 active collective self-consumption operations, representing nearly 200 participants. About 100 operations are in the process of being set up throughout 2019.  This development should continue thanks in particular to the deployment of the Linky smart meter, which will accelerate the development of self-consumption by simplifying all metering devices (a single meter, remote reading, etc.).  Regulatory and support framework  The law defines the concepts of individual and collective self--consumption consists of combining several consumers and producers, which are related to each other within the same legal entity and located in the same building. Since the Law on Energy and Climate was passed on 8 November 2019, social housing owners can be the legal entity behind a collective self--consumption brings together several consumers and producers that are linked together by a single legal entity and located on the low-voltage grid. They must meet criteria, primarily geographical proximity, established by Ministerial Order. The fact that these criteria are established by a Ministerial Order simplifies the procedure for any potential adjustments.   Self-consumption and local power generation represent an opportunity for energy transition and enable consumers to participate in that transition. The aim is that they will continue to develop and grow into a larger share of the energy mix, within a context where:   the generation costs of renewable and particularly photovoltaic electricity installations are decreasing and electricity prices are rising;   electricity generation that makes it possible to meet their own needs.  In particular, if the projects are well dimensioned with regard to consumption needs, self-consumption can bring significant benefits to the community by promoting local loops of consumption and generation, which makes it possible to limit the construction of new lines or the reinforcement of distribution systems.  The development of self-consumption should not be at the expense of other electricity consumers and, more broadly, should not undermine the principle of national solidarity that governs the pricing of the use of public networks. The pricing applicable to self-consumers should reflect the benefits as well as the costs that they can create for the electricity system.  The legislative and regulatory framework specific to self-consumption (both individual and collective) came into effect in 2017. It includes provisions enabling system operators to facilitate self-consumption operations (in particular by equipping collective self-consumption operations with Linky meters), specifies the responsibilities of the participants; and also tasks the Energy Regulatory Commission with developing a tariff for the use of public electricity systems (TURPE) specific to self-consumption.   A specific support framework for developing self-consumption has been put in place:   284     small solar installations on buildings (< 100 kWp) for self-consumption are covered by a purchase contract for 20 years, in which an investment premium is paid for five years coupled with a purchase price for the surplus energy injected into the grid;   power installations between 100 kW and 1,000 kW, regardless of the renewable electricity generation technology used, have access to calls for tenders in the form of a bonus for electricity generated, regardless of whether it is self-consumed or injected into the public grid. This call for tenders is aimed in particular at consumers in the industrial, tertiary and agricultural sectors, economic actors for which self-consumption can bring the most significant benefits thanks to the combination of consumption and generation. The support is currently built in such a way that it encourages maximisation of the rate of selfconsumption.  These support mechanisms will evolve to ensure that self-consumption projects up to 300 kWp are covered by the pricing decree and to make the calls for tenders more attractive.  Work will also be done to establish energy communities, as part of the implementation of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and Directive (EU) 2019/944 on common rules for the internal market for electricity.    4.5.2. Energy transmission infrastructures  4.5.2.1. District heating and cooling systems  District heating systems play a key role in the development of renewable energies and the use of recovered energies, because they enable the mass mobilisation of biomass, geothermal energy and solar power, or the recovery of waste heat from industry, waste recovery units, etc. The Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth has set the objective of a five-fold increase in the amount of renewable and recovered heat and cold delivered by district heating systems by 2030 (baseline 2012), which represents a target of 39.5 TWh.    Baseline situation  2012  Situation in 2016  Target in MEP2016 for 2018  Low target in MEP2016 for 2023  High target in MEP2016 for 2023  7.9 TWh  13 TWh  15.7 TWh  22 TWh  26.7 TWh  Targets set by the MEP adopted in 2016 for renewable or recovered heat consumption by district heating systems  To reach the 2023 upper range, the pace of projects must be increased by a factor of 2.8.  State of play in the sector  In 201880, there are approximately 781 district heating systems in France covering more than 5,781 km and generating 25.4 TWh of heat. 23 district cooling systems cover 202 km of networks and deliver 1.05 TWh of cold. District heating systems supply 2.42 million household equivalents81. While fossil fuels continue to play an important role in supply (of which 37% is gas), the share of renewable and recovered energies (R&R energy) is continuing to increase, reaching 57.1% in 2017 compared to 27% in 2005 and 40% in 2013. The share for biomass has increased most significantly. The market share, or connection rate for buildings to an R&R energy district heating system in France, remains low (around 6% compared  80 . The data are taken from the annual survey on district heating systems conducted on behalf of the statistics department of the Ministry of Ecological and Inclusive Transition.

Considering a minimum density of 4.5 MWh delivered per linear meter for the system to be profitable, the SNCU assesses the potential of district heating systems as delivery of 11 times more than the figures for 2012. By combining these data with renewable and recovered energy resources, ADEME estimates that the maximum potential would be around 67 TWh (i.e. 8.5 times more than in 2012).  An analysis of regional energy and climate plans (PCAET) (now integrated into regional plans for SRADDET) for the previous financial year shows that only three regions have stated a quantitative objective for district heating systems. It would be valuable for the SRADDETs, which will be approved in the coming months, to define objectives in each region (or at PCAET level). This can be achieved by using the national mapping of the development potential of district heating systems82 or the SNCU study, which has published maps indicating regional potential83.  Socioeconomic, industrial and environmental issues  Yields  District heating systems make it possible to use renewable and recovered energies with satisfactory energy efficiency. The average yield of all the systems participating in the annual district heating system survey is about 85%. When plans permit, new systems are built with a low water-flow temperature (< 90 °C), which allows a two-fold reduction in losses compared to a high-temperature system (150 °C). The drop in temperatures also makes it possible to maximise integrations of possible low-temperature sources (solar, geothermal, recovery, etc.).  Current and foreseeable costs  The costs of a district heating system originate largely from the engineering works related to the length of buried pipes. The energy density (or linear thermal density) indicator, which is expressed in MWh of energy delivered per meter of pipe section (MWh/ml) per year, is one of the characteristics determining the viability of an R&R energy district heating system. The costs are highly variable and depend on the type of system being financed. Based on the data from the Heat Fund, which supports the creation, densification and extension of these systems, it is estimated that the investment cost is around 96.   R&R energy district heating systems enable competitive energy supply for users in the long term. The higher the share of renewable energies in the grid and the more the varied the energy mix, the more stable the sale prices of the heat delivered will be.   The characteristics of the sector in terms of employment  heat generation) and employ around 6,800 direct FTEs (jobs in the activities in the value chain). Local employment is promoted during the construction, supply and day-to-day management of systems (engineering, maintenance operation, mobilisation of engineers, technicians, workers and salespeople).   82 . http://reseaux-chaleur.cerema.fr/carte-nationale-de-chaleur-france  83 . Mapping of the development potential of district heating systems in France (SNCU/FEDENE/SETEC ENVIRONNEMENT): http://www.observatoire-des-reseaux.fr/le-potentiel-de-developpement/ 96 Markets and jobs related to energy efficacy and renewables  ADEME  April 2016.   287    French engineering skills are widely recognised and sought after for export.   Densification, creation, extension and greening issues  To achieve the factor of 5 set by law, France will need to continue the densification, extension and greening of existing systems, but will also need to create new ones. District heating and cooling systems are often effective. If they are not, this is also the fault of the inertia of the systems in place. The performance of a feasibility study should enable cities to learn about the importance of district heating systems and to take action on this mechanism. Cities are the regional units responsible for creating and operating district heating systems.    In addition to the creation, densification and extension of systems, the mobilisation of renewable and recovered energies must be accelerated. The average R&R energy rate on all the district heating systems is currently 56% (variable from one year to the next according to weather conditions). Biomass must continue to increase, along with the recovery of waste energies, and in particular heat recovery from waste heat treatment units must continue (a specific initiative will be carried out on the 10 or so units still not connected to a district heating system, when compatible with the regional waste plan). Solar thermal mobilisation could also supplement the energy mix of virtuous district heating systems.  The regulatory tool in force since 1 January 2015 aims to impose a requirement to submit a cost/benefit analysis in order to study the possible recovery of waste heat in a district heating system84. This analysis is mandatory for any new installation of more than of 20 MW or for any substantial change98. This concerns two cases: an industrial installation that must study the possibility of recovering its waste heat in an existing system or in a system being created, but also an energy generation installation in a system that must first study the possibility of recovering the waste heat from existing industrial facilities nearby, before scaling its power. France should capitalise on the benefits provided by this regulation.  Furthermore, it is necessary to maximise the R&R energy ratio of planned and existing district heating systems without jeopardising competitiveness for the end user. The Renewable Energy Directive adopted in December 2018 provides for the option of increasing the average system R&R energy rate by at least 1 point per year from 2020 for all Member States where the rate is yet to reach 60%. Over the last 10 years, the average system R&R energy rate in France has increased by 25 points (i.e. an average of 2.5 points per year), but the challenge is to continue growth between 2020 and 2030. It is therefore proposed that an indicative target rate of 60% of R&R energy in systems be set for 2023 (national average), and then 65% by 2030, combined with the objective in terms of housing equivalent connections.  Ensuring the integration of R&R energy in local policies and plans  The integration of R&R energy should also take place as close as possible to the projects and could be included in Local Development Plans. In addition, specific local actions could be implemented to promote system ranking85-els. This label is based on three criteria: a minimum R&R energy of 50%, competitiveness, and the performance of a in all cases.   84 . https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000029920606&categorieLien=id 98. Modification resulting in a cost of at least 50% of the cost of a new unit.  85 . The ranking of a district heating or cooling system is a procedure that enables a community to make it mandatory to connect to the existing or planned system in certain areas for new building installations.    288    To encourage local acceptance of projects and inform users, the creation of consultation committees between local authorities, operators, subscribers and users must be encouraged. Social housing owners should also be encouraged to develop R&R energy and anti-fuel poverty targets.   Renewable and recovered district cooling systems  There are several system-based cold production technologies:    cold compression units with removal of heat using aerothermal systems (this technology can be considered to be the benchmark solution and   surface aquifer or surface water heat pumps;     free cooling and geocooling (technologies that use the natural temperature of water or of the subsoil without the use of a heat pump); SWAC (sea water air-conditioning) technology;   and waste heat recovery technologies such as the absorption machine or the heat pump in a thermo-frigo-pump assembly that allows the simultaneous production of heat and cold.  In 2017, cold energy delivered by district cooling systems amounted to 1 TWh86. Cold generation in Technologies are being put into operation. Certain technologies are already classified as renewable energy under Directive 2009/28/EC: this relates to free cooling. The current review of this Directive plans to define the criteria for identifying other renewable technologies for the generation of cold.  In France, the Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth Law sets the goal of a five-fold increase in the number of renewable and recovered heat and cold energies in systems by 2030. This is why the Heat Fund is supporting technologies considered to be renewable and recovered technologies nationally from 2018, without waiting for these to be defined by the EU. It is for this reason that this MEP sets an indicative target for the delivery of renewable and recovered cold (see below). Aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) technology could also be developed (see the chapter on low and medium geothermal on New Emerging Technologies. The challenge for district cooling systems is to develop cogeneration of heat in winter and cold in summer using aquifer thermal energy storage.  Environmental challenges  District heating systems have fewer impacts on the environment (apart from the issues specific to supply chains depending on the energy mix). They make it possible to centralise the production of energy and to obtain better energy and environmental performance. This is especially true for the use of solid biomass. In environmental terms, district heating systems supplied mainly by renewable and recovered energies allow very low levels of CO2 emissions (50 to 100 gCO2/kWh for a biomass system) compared to individual fossil-based solutions or systems powered by fossil fuels (above 200 gCO2/kWh).   District cooling systems have a positive impact on the environment as a means of replacing individual refrigeration units87. They enable a reduction in the quantity of coolants, and water vector technologies  86 .

District cooling systems have a very low environmental impact (around 16 gCO2/kWh).    4.5.2.2. The liquid fuels network  The logistics network consists of import depots for petroleum products, located as close as possible to refineries or ports, crude oil or finished product transport pipelines, and intermediate depots before final delivery to consumers through the service station network. Each level of infrastructure is an essential link in ensuring that the country is well supplied. A decrease in consumption will make it unprofitable to maintain the entire network and, in particular, the intermediate depots.  Pipelines are the only infrastructures dedicated to mass transportation of petroleum products. They are used to convey products from import and production areas to consumption sites. In 2018, the quantities of crude oil transported in the two main pipelines are increasing (2.4%). The transportation of finished products remains stable at 34.2 Mt.  Pipeline systems are the predominant means of transportation used to move products out of refineries and import depots as they allow for safe, mass transportation.

The Île-de-France pipeline (PLIF)  260 km: supplies the Grandpuits refinery (south-east of Paris) from the port of Le Havre and can be used as a backup for the supply of the Normandy refinery.    The Antifer-Le Havre pipeline  26.5 km: transports crude oil from the port of Antifer to the CIM (Compagnie Industrielle Maritime) depot, in Le Havre. The product is then transported to refineries in the Basse-Seine area.   Transportation of finished products:   The Le Havre-Paris pipeline (LHP)  1,380 km: supplies the Île-de-France region and the Parisian airports. It also serves the areas of Caen and Orleans-Tours.    The Mediterranean Rhône pipeline (PMR)  and Switzerland (Geneva) from Fos-sur-Mer.   The Common Defence Pipeline (ODC)  2,260 km in France: represents the French part of the Central Europe Pipeline System (CEPS) of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).    The Donges-Melun-Metz (DMM) pipeline  627 km: crosses France from west to east, from the port of Saint-Nazaire to Saint-Baussant. It supplies the region of Le Mans and the east of France. It is interconnected with the LHP and the ODC.   The operation of the pipelines is closely linked to the presence of depots, to enable the shipment and receipt of products. The balance between transport mode and storage capacity contributes to ensuring the security of oil product supplies for the country.    4.5.2.3. The gas system  The natural gas system transports natural gas from import points, LNG terminals and biomethane production facilities to consumers and export points. It includes transmission pipelines, compressors and distribution systems, all operating in synergy with underground natural gas storage infrastructures.  The natural gas transmission system   291    The French natural gas transmission system is used to move gas from import points at the borders (landbased interconnections with other European countries, gas pipeline from the Norwegian Sea and LNG terminals) to delivery points distributed throughout the country (distribution systems and large industrial customers) or underground storage sites.  It is operated by two operators:    consortium made up of CNP Assurances, CDC Infrastructures and the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations) operating 7,498 km of primary network and 24,916 km of regional network.    Teréga: owned by the Italian operator Snam (40.5%), the Singaporean state investment fund GIC (31.5%), EDF (18%) and Predica (10%), it operates 1,155 km of primary network and 3,985 km of regional network.  The gas transmission systems are regulated by the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE). The most designed to be applied over four years and is updated on 1 April of each year.  In recent years, the French natural gas transmission system has been upgraded to facilitate the movement of natural gas within it, to limit the risks of congestion and to streamline trade between southern and northern France, which made it possible to merge the marketplaces on 1 November 2018. The upgrades involve:   The creation of the Arc de Dierrey by GRTgaz (DN 1200, 308 km), which was classified as a project of common interest (PCI), with an invesVoisines (Yonne). This project was commissioned in late 2015. It transports gas from Norway, the Netherlands, Great Britain and LNG terminals on the Atlantic and North Sea to the east and south.   The Val-de-Saône infrastructure project sponsored by GRTgaz (DN 1200, 190 km) is classified between Etrez (Ain) and Voisines (Haute-Marne) and was commissioned in 2018.   The Gascogne-Midi project sponsored by Teréga (DN 900, 60 km): this project is classified as a PCI and involves a partial doubling of the Gascony artery between Lussagnet (Landes) and Barran (Gers), which was commissioned in 2018. Teréga is also upgrading the Barbaira  Investments have also been made to facilitate exchanges of natural gas between France and neighbouring countries, in order to promote the internal market for natural gas. Since the publication in 1998 of Directive 98/30/EC on common rules for the internal market for natural gas, capacity for gas exchange via gas interconnections between France and neighbouring countries has increased by almost 50% in input and multiplied by five in output:   the capacities of the Larrau and Biriatou interconnection points have been gradually upgraded, enabling an increase in the firm capacities from France to Spain from 70 to 165 GWh/day; at the same time, 225 GWh/day in firm capacity has been created in a south-north direction;   the 2001 commissioning of the Oltingue interconnection point has resulted in the supply of 220 GWh/day of firm capacity from France to Switzerland and Italy;   upgrades to the Obergailbach interconnection have led to an increase in 2009 in the firm capacity between Germany and France from 400 to 570 GWh/day;   the new Alveringem interconnection point enabled the creation of 270 GWh/day of firm capacity from France to Belgium in 2015.   292    France is part of the North-South Gas Interconnection Corridor in Western Europe, one of four transEuropean energy infrastructure corridors identified as posing particular challenges for the further diversification of supply routes and improvements in the short-term capacity of gas delivery. France is continuing with the technical, economic and administrative analysis of projects under this framework, in particular:   the MidCat and South Transit East Pyrenees (STEP) projects, involving the construction of a new gas pipeline between France and Spain in the eastern Pyrenees, as well as various levels of enhancements in the French network. These projects are included in the list of projects of common interest adopted by the European Commission on 23 November 2017, as they contribute to the achievemdetermining factors for the Energy Union;   the project to create output capacity to Germany on the Obergailbach interconnection.  These analyses seek to evaluate the significance of projects in respect of their costs and therefore to clarify the decision to go ahead with or abandon these projects. Given the expectation of a decline in natural gas consumption, new gas infrastructures should be avoided, as there will be insufficient time to allow a return on investments. Special care is taken to ensure that the share of financing borne by natural gas consumers does not exceed the benefits they would derive from new infrastructures. In addition, the possible completion of new gas infrastructure projects is envisaged only in the context of meeting optimal environmental conditions, in accordance with the provisions of the Environment Code and under the procedures defined by the law, particularly as regards public consultation.

Natural gas distribution systems are owned by local authorities. They are operated through concession contracts between operators and local authorities, by GRDF (100% subsidiary of Engie), which distributes around 96% of the market, 23 local distribution companies (mostly located in the south-west and in the east), and a few other licensed companies.  They serve more than 9,500 French municipalities and 11 million customers (including almost all municipalities with more than 10,000 inhabitants). This represents just over a quarter of the 36,000 French municipalities, but means that 77% of the French population has access to natural gas.  The 27,000 municipalities not currently supplied with gas have several options for accessing this type of energy:    the extension of the existing natural gas network through the development of a distribution system by the operator of their choice, following selection through a call for applications, subject to approval by the Minister of Energy;   the development of propane networks;   the development of isolated natural gas networks, served by LNG delivered by trucks (transported LNG), subject to the establishment of a suitable regulatory framework.  The issues involved in ensuring good management of distribution systems require progress on:    satisfactory knowledge of the networks: their capacity, their operation, the development of remote monitoring applications, remote operation and the roll-out of smart meters;   the incorporation of renewable gas in increasing quantities, by removing the barriers on the capacity limits of the networks.  The development of biomethane-injection projects may need to increase the flexibility of the distribution systems. Indeed, the amount of biomethane that can be injected into a distribution network is limited by the gas consumption on that network. Upgrades to gas networks, particularly to allow the implementation of backward flows from the distribution system to the transmission system, may be necessary to prevent biomethane production projects located near an existing network from being blocked due to lack of capacity.  Natural gas smart meters  Article L. 453-7 of the Energy Code sets a target of rolling out smart meters for natural gas consumers. Historically, this type of meter was deployed only on sites with high consumption, especially industrial sites.  Through a decision of 23 September 2014, the Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy and the Minister of Economy, Industry and Digital Affairs approved the deployment of the Gazpar smart meter by GRDF, which operates 95% of the natural gas distribution system. A technical  295    and economic study showed that the present net value of the project was positive for local authorities, after considering the earnings outlook for natural gas consumers associated with managing the energy demand induced by the smart meter. After a test phase, GRDF initiated the widespread deployment of Gazpar meters on 1 May 2017. The roll-out of this operation, which involves 11 million meters, is scheduled to continue into 2022. As at the end of October 2019, 4.5 million Gazpar meters were installed, in line with targets.  The Gazpar meter means that the natural gas consumer can be billed based on actual consumption, thanks to a technique for remote transmission of the indexes. The procedures for changing supplier are simplified as a result. Consumers can use information made available to them about their consumption to take steps to manage the energy they consume.  Smart meters will also be deployed by Greenalp and Régaz-Bordeaux. Programmes are being studied by other public natural gas distribution system operators.  LNG terminals  Four LNG terminals are currently in service in France:    Fos-Tonkin (3 Gm3/year) and Montoir-de-Bretagne (10 Gm3/year), owned by Elengy, a 100% subsidiary of GRTgaz.    Fos-Cavaou (8.2 Gm3/year), owned by Fosmax LNG, a subsidiary of Elengy (> 70%) and Total, managed by Elengy.    Dunkerque LNG (13 Gm3/year), owned by consortia made up of the Belgian transmission system operator Fluxys, Axa Investment Manager, Crédit Agricole Assurances and Korean companies IPM and Samsung Asset Management.  In 2018, liquefied natural gas (LNG) arrived in France primarily from Algeria (28%), Nigeria (27%), Russia (13%), Norway (11%) and Qatar (8%).  Since 2011, the utilisation rate of French and European LNG terminals has fallen sharply due to natural gas prices, which are significantly higher in Asian markets than in European markets, leading to an increase in LNG deliveries in Asia, at the expense of Europe. French LNG terminals were used on average at one third of their capacity between 2011 and 2017. The utilisation rate of LNG terminals rebounded sharply in 2018, in a context marked by the activation of new LNG production units.  The Dunkirk, Fos-Cavaou and Montoir-de-Bretagne LNG terminals are covered by capacity subscription agreements extending beyond the period covered by the MEP, which secures their operation for this period.  However, there is uncertainty about the future use of the Fos-Tonkin terminal. In the absence of any new capacity subscription by natural gas suppliers, its operation is currently guaranteed only until 2020. Elengy, the terminal operator, is studying a range of options. If operations are closed down at the Fos- Tonkin terminal, all LNG import capacities on the Mediterranean seaboard will be managed by the FosCavaou terminal alone. Emission capacities would remain unchanged, but at the price of a more restricted operation.  Hydrogen and gas networks  Issues relating to the direct injection of hydrogen into gas networks are being studied. Beyond a certain concentration, hydrogen is likely to raise questions of technical compatibility and safety for the networks (material compatibility, gas burner settings, measurement of quantities delivered, etc.).  4.5.2.4. Recharging infrastructures for alternative fuels   296    The development of alternative fuels, namely Natural Gas for Vehicles (NGV), LPG-C, electricity, hydrogen, etc., represents a significant lever for the transition of the transport sector, in particular for diversifying energy sources. They also make it possible to reduce the environmental impact of travel and provide a significant opportunity for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution and noise emissions. Their development requires the involvement of the Government and local authorities. Undertakings must be guaranteed visibility to facilitate investments in cleaner-fuel vehicle technology.  Directive 2014/94/EU of 22 October 2014 on the deployment of alternative fuels asked Member States to reflect on the development of these energy sources in the transport sector by drafting a framework for national action. France published its action framework in 2017, laying the foundation for the development of these fuels.  The establishment and maintenance of a recharging and refuelling infrastructure network is a major challenge for the development of alternative fuels. The design of the distribution network is adapted to each fuel: electric recharging is divided between recharging at home by private individuals and public recharging; hydrogen recharging stations are developed primarily through identified captive fleets; maritime LNG requires specific development linked to use as a marine fuel; and the NGV distribution system is developing as part of general progress on European mobility. The LPG distribution network is already developed and in use.  Box 15: Alternative fuels  Alternative fuels are defined by Directive 2014/94/EU on the deployment of alternative fuels as:  supply to transport and which have the potential to contribute to its decarbonisation and enhance the environmental performance of the transport sector. They include, inter alia:  - electricity;  - hydrogen;  - biofuels as defined in point (i) of Article 2 of Directive 2009/28/EC,  - synthetic and paraffinic fuels,  - natural gas, including biomethane, in gaseous form (compressed natural gas (CNG)) and liquefied form (liquefied natural gas (LNG)), and  -   Electric recharging networks  Recharging infrastructures for electric road vehicles  To date, this primarily concerns private vehicles and light commercial vehicles. The bulk of recharging of electric vehicles currently takes place at home or at the workplace, and not at recharging points open to the public. In particular, one important issue is facilitating as far as possible the installation of recharging points in residential buildings, especially jointly owned properties, because individuals who are able to charge their vehicles at home will be in a position to load enough power for several days in one night.   Nonetheless, to allow the development of roaming, the deployment of terminals open to the public is necessary, both on the major road routes and more locally, for users who do not have a parking option or who are temporarily living away from their home (holidays). To scope the associated requirements, Directive 2014/94/EU sets an indicative ratio of one recharging point per 10 cars, i.e. a target of 100,000  297    recharging points in 2022 if the sector achieves its target set in the strategic sector contract signed with the Government in May 2018 of putting one million electric vehicles in circulation.   The distribution of the terminals should not be uniform across the entire country. Public recharging needs are more significant in dense urban zones, where the number of private parking places is limited. These urban zones also constitute one of the areas of specific relevance for electric vehicles. It is therefore necessary to provide for a dense public recharging network. In rural areas, the dispersed pattern of dwellings facilitates the installation of terminals at home and public recharging needs essentially relate to ensuring geographical coverage. Finally, high-power recharging points should be positioned along major road routes to allow travel by electric vehicles for long journeys.   Efforts must also be made to guarantee a satisfactory level of service of recharging terminals and to streamline their use. The use of battery-powered electric vehicles for long journeys will only develop if access to high-power recharging facilities is accessible to all. It is therefore necessary to develop an interoperable network that allows users to recharge their vehicles at all terminals without it being necessary for them to have a subscription or to complete any other time-consuming process.   Generally speaking, a massive increase in the number of electric vehicles should not weaken the French electricity system. Total energy consumption by electric vehicles over the next 10 or 15 years (up to 15 million electric vehicles in circulation) can be absorbed without difficulty in view of the developments in generation capacity and other consumption types anticipated over this time frame. The issue here is more power demands. It will be necessary to develop solutions to manage recharging in order to avoid an excessive impact on peak consumption in winter. Conversely, in certain cases, the return of energy -balancing services.    Electric supply at the quayside  The availability of electrical supplies in ports allows inland waterway vessels and ships to avoid the use of onboard generators powered by heavy fuel oil when they are moored at the quayside. Connection at the quayside makes it possible to avoid significant greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants harmful to health in port conurbations. Not all ships have the same power needs: bulk carriers, tankers and container ships require less power than ferries. Cruise ships require significant power given the size of the electricity networks serving the urban areas adjacent to port installations.    Gas-distribution networks  Natural gas for vehicles  France has the largest network of NGV stations for heavy goods vehicles in Europe. The development of NGV stations is linked to biomethane development to ensure European mobility. To ensure that this fuel is adopted by road hauliers, the number of stations should be determined to provide coverage of major road routes along with geographical coverage, which can be defined as a maximum distance or travel time to the nearest station. The National Action Framework for Alternative Fuels has provided some initial development guidelines, so as to ensure the availability of NGV in compressed form in conurbations and in liquefied from along major roads. Calls for projects carried out in 20182019 in the context of the Investments for the Future Programme have made it possible cover the major structural axes designated by the European Commission for the Trans-European Transport Network and areas with more limited services. This series of projects should enable the creation of 119 supplementary stations between 2018 and 2022, compared to 38 stations accessible to heavy goods vehicles when the tender was launched.   The minimum number of stations required in 2023 and 2028 has been estimated as 138 and 326, respectively. Furthermore, the maximum number of profitable stations is estimated as 367 and 845 in 2023 and 2028, respectively.   298    Liquefied petroleum gas  LPG consumption in the world and in Europe is growing strongly. Consumption in France is very stable. There is a dense European network. France is one of the only European countries where the network has decreased slightly in the last 10 years. The network is in place and does not need any public investment. However, it is only used at 25% of its economic profitability. There is real potential for development of this market and the network is able to accommodate bio-LPG.  Hydrogen  which involves helping to deploy stations near to those actors that have chosen to use hydrogen. Thus, the plan for the deployment of hydrogen is based on the roll-out of regional hydrogen mobility ecosystems, in particular through fleets of commercial vehicles:   5,000 light commercial vehicles and 200 heavy vehicles (buses, lorries, regional trains, boats), as well as the construction of 100 stations, supplied with locally produced hydrogen by 2023;   20,000 to 50,000 light commercial vehicles, 800 to 2,000 heavy vehicles and from 400 to 1,000 stations by 2028.    4.5.3. Electricity and gas markets, energy prices  4.5.3.1. Economic elements common to both electricity and gas  The end of 2018 was marked by record oil prices. In a continuing context of rising prices as seen in the second quarter, prices reached their highest level for four years at the end of September, hitting more and thus an increase of +2% compared to the previous quarter. Markets were busy because of fears of restricted supply, in particular with the sanctions in place against Iran and the consequent fall in production, which might not be sufficiently offset. For its part, anticipation of demand was made problematic by fears of a trade war between the United States and China. Coal prices increased over the over the previous quarter. The growth of Asian demand is still one of the primary factors behind the dynamics of the markets. Coal prices also followed the upward trend in other raw materials and thus  The rise in the price of the CO2 allowance begun in the third quarter of 2017 continued during the second 2, it closed in 2018 at a price of 2, indicating that the price has almost tripled in the space of a year. The maximum achieved in this period, which is also the highest value for 10 years, was seen in early September and was 2, before a nonetheless sharp correction took place in the following days. This overall increase reflects a general context of increasing raw material prices but has also been driven by anticipation of the activation of the market stability reserve in early 2019. In the third quarter of 2017, 2,375 MtCO2 was traded on stock markets and through brokers in the form of EUAs compared to 2,421 MtCO2 in 2018, thus a steady traded volume, after a significant increase in the previous year. However, the market experienced a situation of overbuying, which, among other things, explains the price peak in early September and its subsequent correction.  The rise in fossil fuels has a direct effect on prices on wholesale gas markets (largely correlated with the Brent price per barrel).  The increase in the prices of fossil fuels and CO2 allowances also has an effect on prices on wholesale electricity markets: in fact, because the interconnections are often marginal on the French market, the  299    predominant fossil technologies of our neighbours are often the last used, and contribute significantly to the formation of French wholesale prices.    4.5.3.2. Current situation in the electricity market  Consumption  Compared to the third quarter of 2017, French consumption during the same period in 2018 remained stable at around 93 TWh.   Production and trade  Nuclear availability increased slightly, with an average availability rate of 66.6% (+1.5 points compared to the third quarter of 2017). However, given the severe heat waves affecting the nuclear sector, causing the shut-down of certain reactors, this rate is 8.9 points lower than the second quarter of 2018 (75.5%). Thus, nuclear power generation was 87.3 TWh, an increase of +1.4% compared to the same period of 2017. Compared to 2017, a year that was generally marked by a low level of hydroelectric activity, generation as at the third quarter of 2018 grew by 16.7% to 12.2 TWh (Figure 18). However, this fell by -44.9% compared to the previous quarter (22.2 TWh). The quarter was also marked by a 20% fall in wind generation (4.1 TWh) compared to the previous quarter. This reduced demand for hydroelectric generation and the significant drop in wind generation explain the +135.5% rise in generation based on fossil fuels, which increased from 3.1 TWh to 7.3 TWh. The utilisation rate of coal and gas (Figures 16 and 17) was an average of 20% during the third quarter of 2018, compared to 12% and 11% respectively during the previous quarter, when hydroelectricity generation was very substantial. Compared to the third quarter of 2017, this fossil-TWh compared to 13.0 TWh in the third quarter of 2017 (Figure 20), thus an increase of +27.0%.   Exports grew by +6.0%, in particular with an increase of +3.6% in exports during peak hours and +7.3% in exports in non-peak periods. Imports fell by -30.3%, with a drop of -19.3% in imports during peak hours and a -37.2% drop in imports in non-peak periods.  State of play in the wholesale market   On futures markets, the 2019 France Baseline Calendar product price increased by 18% on average compared to the previous quarter, and its German equivalent grew by +20.5%. The prices reached period in 2017, these prices show average increases of +36% for the France Baseline Calendar. M+1 product prices have seen average increases of +48% compared to the second quarter of 2018, and are at (Table 2). In terms of trading on futures markets, the annual product volumes traded (Y+1) fell by -50% compared to the third quarter of 2017 and by -14% compared to the second quarter of 2018. For monthly products (M+1), the volumes traded are up +60% against the third quarter of 2017 and by +39% compared to the second quarter of 2018. Lastly, volumes traded on the Spot market are stable compared to the same period in 2017 but are recording a drop of -12% compared to the previous quarter (Table 3).  State of play in the retail market  As at 30 September 2018, 37.6 million sites are eligible, representing approximately 437 TWh of annual electricity consumption. Customers can use two different types of contracts:   - contracts with regulated sales tariffs (RST), offered only by historical suppliers;  -  contracts at market prices, offered by both historical and alternative suppliers.          300    Table 1: Summary of number of sites    Residential  Non-residential  Situation  (number of sites)  As at 30  September 2018  As at 30 June 2018 As at 30  September 2018  As at 30 June 2018 Total number of sites  32,508,000  32,460,000  5,051,000  5,052,000  Sites supplied at market rates, of which:  Historical suppliers    6,974,000    6,573,000  145,000    1,887,000    1,867,000  730,000  216,000  733,000  Alternative suppliers  6,758,000  6,428,000  1,154,000  1,137,000  Sites subject to regulated tariffs  25,611,000  25,887,000  3,164,000  3,185,000  Market share for alternative suppliers    20.7%    19.8%    22.8%    22%    Table 2: Summary of annualised consumption     Residential  Non-residential  Situation  (annualised consumption)  As at 30  September 2018  As at 30 June 2018  As at 30  September 2018  As at 30 June 2018 Total consumption of sites  153.53 TWh  152.61 TWh  283.95 TWh  289.37 TWh  Consumption supplied at market rates, of which:    Historical suppliers    Alternative suppliers    29.11 TWh    1.1 TWh    28.01 TWh    27.17 TWh    0.75 TWh    26.42 TWh    256.26 TWh    135.78 TWh    120.48 TWh    254.63 TWh    135.64 TWh    118.99 TWh  Consumption supplied at regulated tariffs    124.42 TWh    125.44 TWh    27.69 TWh    34.74 TWh  Market share for alternative suppliers    18.2%    17.3%    42.4%    41.1%     301    State of play in retail electricity markets as at 30 September 2018 (source: CRE)  As at 30 September 2018, approximately 160 non-national electricity suppliers are active in France, including historical suppliers (local distribution undertakings). These suppliers with a local or regional presence in the country offer services to one or more customer segments.  During the third quarter of 2018, 2.6% of residential customers:   - changed supplier   - started supply from an alternative supplier   - started supply from an historical supplier outside their service area.  This rate has been growing steadily since 2012.    4.5.3.3. Current situation in the gas market  Consumption  Gas consumption in France during the third quarter of 2018 fell slightly by 3.4% compared to the same period in 2017. Consumption related to demand from gas-fired power plants to cover unavailability of electrical plants during the summer did not offset the fall in demand. Following on from the second quarter, amounts injected into storage were significant, reaching 68 TWh, and thus an increase of around 50% compared to the same period in 2017. LNG imports fell by 21% (-6 TWh), offset by land-based imports, which grew by 7% (7 TWh) compared to the third quarter of 2017.

The small quantities of LNG and the high demand for injection have been particular factors in driving this increase. Fluctuations in the price of gas on neighbouring markets have been similar, with an average differential -ahead prices have been natural gas supply in the south and the low availability rate for the north-south link (73%), which was thus used at maximum level.

These suppliers with a local or regional presence in the country offer services to one or more customer segments.  The supplier switchover rate has been growing steadily since 2008: during the third quarter of 2018,  2.8% of residential customers:   - changed supplier,   - started supply from an alternative supplier,  - started supply from an historical supplier outside their service area.  For business customers, this rate is over 4%.  Projected changes on the basis of policies and measures up to 2040  The decisions of the Council of State of 19 July 2017 (for natural gas: Decision No 370321) and 18 May 2018 (for electricity: Decisions Nos 413688 and 414656):  - held that RST for natural gas are incompatible with EU law, in terms of the general economic interest objectives pursued;  - accepted the existence of regulated sales tariffs for electricity in that they make it possible to guarantee a stable electricity price, while excluding from their scope non-domestic sites belonging to major undertakings and implying a need for a regular review of their relevance.  On the basis of these decisions, dialogue has been under way for several months with the main stakeholders to define terms for phasing out gas RST for all consumers and electricity RST for the major undertakings concerned, and to determine the necessary support measures for consumers and to enable unrestricted competition. These conditions have been included in the Law on Energy and Climate of 8 November 2019 to ensure compatibility as quickly as possible for regulated gas tariffs, while guaranteeing the phasing-out of those tariffs and ensuring that switchover for customers concerned to market price-driven contracts is open and competitive.  For electricity, corresponding provisions have also been included in the Law on Energy and Climate to ensure compatibility of the legislative provisions in the Energy Code on regulated tariffs with the associated decisions and with the Electricity Directive, which recognises the possibility of regulated electricity tariffs, and limits the scope of those tariffs from 31 December 2020 to residential customers and very small businesses.  4.5.3.4. Energy poverty   Assistance for the payment of energy bills: energy allowance   304    The energy allowance is a payment voucher issued to the lowest income households to combat fuel poverty. This scheme, created by Article 201 of the Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth of 17 August 2015, replaced the social electricity and natural gas tariffs on 1 January 2018. It has a twofold objective:   to provide a more equitable system than the social energy tariffs, which benefits all households experiencing fuel poverty equally, regardless of their heating energy;   to significantly improve target attainment, hampered in the previous system by the complex data checking inherent in the social tariff system.  The energy allowance is assigned on the basis of a single tax criterion, taking into account income level and household composition. It enables the eligible households to pay their energy bills, regardless of the heating method they may use (electricity, gas, fuel oil, wood, etc.). If they wish, beneficiaries may use the allowance to fund some of the energy-saving building work that they undertake in their homes.  The energy allowance was trialled in 2016 and in 2017 in four departments (Ardèche, Aveyron, -de-family composition and the level of reference income (RFR). The eligibility criteria were:     the number of consumption units (CU) in the home;   the fact of having a home that is subject to housing tax (although exemptions are permitted in certain cases).  The results of the trial have been very encouraging: more than 82% of energy allowances were used by the beneficiaries for the 2017 campaign, exceeding the number of households using social tariffs in these regions. The energy allowance has been rolled out nationwide in 2018 to 3.6 million beneficiaries. The Government has decided to increase the value of the energy allowance and modify its scope in 2019. The energy allowance amounts paid in 2018 wiMoreover, the income ceiling for eligibility for the energy allowance will be raised so as to include 2.2 million additional households in the 2019 campaign.    RFR/CU <    RFR/CU <    RFR/CU <    RFR/CU <  1 CU (1 person)      1 < CU < 2 (2 or 3 persons)      2 CU or more (4 persons or more)        2019 amount of the energy allowance, based on reference income (RFR) and household composition (Consumption Unit88)   88 . CU: consumption unit (the first person in the household counts for 1 CU, the second for 0.5 CU and the others for 0.3 CU).   305    To improve beneficiary cover, specific assistance for social housing has been introduced, in order to include the approximately 100,000 residents in the energy allowance scheme.    The winter respite scheme  A winter respite scheme for all households has been put in place in relation to energy: under this scheme, suppliers are required to maintain supply of natural gas and electricity between the 1 November and 31 March. Energy allowance beneficiaries are also protected from power limitations on electricity supply, and are eligible for a reduction in certain fees (in the case of moving house or non-payment).  In the event that a supply interruption is planned outside the winter respite period, its implementation must be strictly managed for all households (reminder notices, deadlines, social services information by the supplier when the power has not been restored within five days of being cut off).  White Certificate (WC) provisions relating to the component intended to prevent fuel poverty  The LTECV has created a specific obligation to achieve energy savings to benefit households suffering from fuel poverty (eligibility determined based on household income). The first accounting period covered the two years from 2016 to 2017, with a target of 150 TWhcumac WC obligation of 700 TWhcumac over the three years from 2015 to 2017). This target has been achieved.  To extend the impetus provided by the introduction in the LTECV of a specific obligation to achieve energy savings to benefit households suffering from fuel poverty, the fuel poverty requirement for the new period of the 20182020 WCs has been brought to 400 TWhcumac, in addition to the original requirement of 1,200 TWhcumac, and thus a total of 1,600 TWhcumacbe invested by the energy companies in the prevention of fuel poverty. A decree currently being issued should extend the period by one year (2021) for this annual obligation, thus bringing the total to 2,133 TWhcumac for the 20182021 period (1,600 between 2018 and 2020).   The ANAH is programme provides financial assistance and social, technical and financial support to households suffering from fuel poverty in order to carry out energy renovations. The programme is funded from the from energy companies (EDF, GDF-Suez and Total) and through the income from the tax on vacant  The beneficiaries of this assistance are the owner-occupiers and co-owners with the lowest incomes, and joint-ownership associations that are in difficulty or disadvantaged (since 2017), as well as landlords, and the assistance is not subject to means testing. The programme covers payments to occupier households of subsidies covering 25% to 50% of the cost of energy renovation works, subject to means testing. The energy gain obtained on completion of the work must be at least 25% for owner-occupiers and 35% for landlords and joint-ownership associations.  In 2019, the total number of heat renovations amounted to more than 106,000 homes. The 2019 programme has been marked by a very strong dynamic on one assistance mechanism (Habiter Mieux Agilité), supported by a possibility of aggregation with the WCs.   loans
