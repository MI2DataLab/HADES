 45   2.2 DIMENSION ENERGY EFFICIENCY Relevant circumstances affecting primary and final energy consumption   Article 6 of the Governance Regulation sets out the contribution-setting process for Member States in the area of energy efficiency. In their contribution, Member States may take into account national circumstances affecting their primary and final energy consumption, including the remaining cost-effective energy-saving potential, evolution of GDP, as well as changes in energy imports and the primary and final energy consumption as well as the main barriers impeding a more ambitious     The diversification of energy sources and supply sources achieved in recent years constitutes an important milestone for Malta. Over the past five years, Malta has transformed its energy mix used for electricity generation from one based on heavy fuel oil and gasoil to a more sustainable energy mix based on natural gas, electricity imports and renewables. The increased efficiency of the new gas-fired generation plant, commissioned in 2017, significantly reduced primary energy demand in Malta.   Nonetheless, increasing population, and corresponding demand in the housing market, and the growth of tourism have intensified pressure on land and scarce natural potable water resources. Steep population and GDP growths in recent years have indeed made it difficult to restrain an increase in amounted to 1.8%, which represents the second largest annual increase in the EU after Luxembourg and is nearly ten times the EU28 average of 0.2%37 National population projections used for the (NSO) and the Ageing population report with adjustments for net immigration and natural increase in 2030. In July 2019, Eurostat published an update of demographsignificantly revised over the medium to long- reaches 661,550. While Maltese authorities are cautious about the Eurostat methodology38 it is    Table 4  National NECP Population projections, thousands  2020 2030 2040 Population  496,790 554,822 573,531    In terms of GDP growth, projections are based on the assumption that the current trend of high annual economic growth peaked in 2017 at 6.6% and will start to slow down and stabilize in the future, although maintaining a relatively strong level of 3.5% by 2030. Based on national projections, it is                                                            37 Based on Eurostat data on population on 1 January [demo_pjan], updated 6.6.19  38 Eurostat projections are underpinned by an upward revision in the net-migration assumption as the Eurostat projection methodology assumes that all migrant workers settle and retire in Malta. On the other hand, local studies establish that foreign workers only stay in Malta for a temporary period, with an average length of stay of foreign workers of 3.5 years.   46  expected that the outcome of GDP and population projections leads to an increase in GDP per capita from over 20,000 EUR in 2017 to almost 30,000 EUR by 2030. Although there is an element of decoupling between energy and GDP, increasing energy demand in absolute terms is expected to continue post-2020.    Malta has the second lowest final energy consumption per capita across all EU Member States, only slightly above half of the EU average. This is a result of different factors including climatic conditions and lack of energy-intensive industry. Heating requirements in Malta are on the lower end of the scale when compared to other Member States, whereas cooling is provided by heat pump technology, which in itself is already deemed as being one of the most efficient technologies. However, this also means that interventions would need to be performed higher up in the marginal cost curve and are often not viable financially. On the other hand, the changing landscape, whereby a higher share of the population is living in apartments as opposed to single unit buildings, and higher expectations with regards to thermal comfort, means that an increasing number of households are resorting to air conditioners to achieve the desired comfort level rather than relying on natural ventilation. Furthermore, the shift from single unit buildings to apartments also implies that the most effective options to reduce the carbon footprint of households i.e. the installation of photovoltaic panels and solar water heaters, are not always a possible option.    A similar situation exists in government owned and occupied buildings. A case study commissioned by the Government of Malta to evaluate possible options to renovate a number of typical government office blocks highlighted that given the low energy intensiveness of activities in the selected buildings, the return on investment for the majority of the renovation options is quite low. Consequently, in some cases the payback period may exceed the expected building or improvement duration.     much higher than the EU average. It must be pointed out, however, that by virtue of its geographic isolation, 40% of the final energy consumption in the transport sector is attributed to aviation. This is a result of both a higher number of tourist arrivals, which has increased from 1.4 million in 2012 to 2.6 million in 2018 (a staggering 80% growth), but also the lack of real alternatives for Maltese citizens to travel abroad, there being no fixed link to mainland Europe. The same can be said for consumption by the road transport sector which, albeit several initiatives to promote alternative means of transport, remains heavily dependent on private cars as the principal means of transportation.  So far studies have shown that there is insufficient activity to support a mass transit system. However, the Government shall continue to monitor demographic changes and developments in transport demand whilst assessing the future viability of such a solution from an environmental and financial sustainability perspective.  The highly built Maltese landscape (over 33% is developed) limits options for exclusive bus lanes or lanes dedicated to other means of transport. The electrification of the transport sector in Malta is expected to follow trends across Europe and uptake largely depends on affordability and availability of vehicles. The Government plans to continue supporting and incentivizing the electrification of the transport sector through grants and specific measures. The Government also intends to establish a cut-off date for the importation and registration of Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) passenger vehicles in Malta. A decision will be taken on this by early 2020.    47  and as an open, service-based economy, Malta is characterised by low energy intensity. In 2017, 0.09 third lowest in the EU behind Denmark and Ireland. Heavy consumers of energy in the industrial and services sectors are targeted through regulations and voluntary agreements encouraging the adoption of energy efficient technologies.   The factors mentioned above along wimarket, such as its small nature, the existence of a single electricity supplier, and the absence of natural gas networks and district heating and cooling networks substantially limit the range of measures available to meet energy savings obligations under the Energy Efficiency Directive.  Notwithstanding this, Malta is doing its share to increase energy efficiency in the various end-use sectors and will continue to implement energy efficiency policies and measures in line with described in the following sections will be implementing a number of measures to promote energy efficiency.   Indicative national Energy Efficiency contribution to achieving Union target performed by PRIMES in 2007.  indicative energy efficiency contribution to the 2030 target is an energy intensity level of 0.07 2005 2005 in 2005. Both trends project a decoupling between energy and GDP; however, the energy intensity projected in this Plan is lower than that projected by PRIMES (Figure 16).   Figure 16 - Malta projections of energy intensity compared to those from PRIMES 2007 database   The primary energy and final energy consumption levels in absolute terms are projected to be 1,051 ktoe and 786 ktoe respectively (Figure 17).     48  Figure 17 - Projected primary and final energy consumption levels in absolute terms, ktoe.    Energy intensity is being defined as the ratio between primary energy consumption and gross domestic product at 2005 constant prices. In projecting primary energy consumption, it is assumed that: (i) renewable electricity and electricity from waste-to-energy plants is dispatched first, followed by a mix of conventional plants running on natural gas and electricity imported over the interconnector: and (ii) the share of distribution losses is constant for the period 2021-2030, based on the average ratio of losses in recent years. The share of electricity imported over the interconnector is projected to vary between 10 and 20%. This is relevant as a change in this share would have a corresponding impact on the projected primary energy consumption in view of the way Eurostat accounts for the efficiency attributed to the interconnector.   Cumulative amount of energy savings to be achieved over period 2021  2030 under Article 7(1)(b) of EED on energy savings obligations As outlined above, single electricity distributor, the absence of natural gas or district heating and cooling networks as well as the small number and size of  fuel suppliers which substantially limits the range of measures available to the policy maker to meet the energy savings obligations. These specific characteristics are compounded by the small size of the energy market. This is fully recognised under article 7(1)(b) of the revised Energy Efficiency Directive, whereby Malta is required to achieve new savings each year from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030 equivalent to 0.24% of annual final energy consumption averaged over the most recent three-year period prior to 1 January 2019.    Malta is experiencing remarkable growth in terms of both economy and population. Real economic growth in Malta in 2017 stood at 6.6%, underpinned by a 2.2% growth in the total population. In line with the sustained economic growth, Malta has also seen an improvement in employment figures which registered a 3.7% increase in 2017. The growth in population, employment and economic activity resulted in a 7% increase in total final energy consumption. The steep increase in population and GDP in such a relatively short time span has made it difficult to restrain energy consumption, 1051786024681012141602004006008001000120020202021202220232024202520262027202820292030Primary energy consumption (excl heat pumps)Final energy consumption (excl heat pumps)GDP 49  which maintained an upwards trend during 2018 and 2019. Figures for final energy consumption are provided in Table 5.  Table 5 - Final energy consumption, ktoe. Year  Final Energy Consumption39 [ktoe]  2016  583 2017  624 2018  661   The provisional average final energy consumption for the period 2016-2018 amounts to 622.7 ktoe. This translates into an average of 1.5 ktoe of new savings required each year (based on an indicative linear trajectory) from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030 reaching 82.2 ktoe of cumulative energy savings by end 2030.   Indicative milestones of the long-term strategy for the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential private and public buildings Malta is aware of its commitments to develop a long-term renovation strategy to support the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU. In line with this obligation, the first long-term renovation strategy shall be submitted by 10 March 2020. In view of this, no indicative milestones of the long-term renovation strategy are included as part of the NECP.

[If applicable] Other national objectives in areas such as energy efficiency in the transport sector and with regard to heating and cooling Malta does not have other national objectives in areas such as energy efficiency in transport and heating & cooling. Measures and actions undertaken by Malta, including in these sectors, are described under Section 3.2 of the Plan.                                                               39 Data is based on the latest national energy balance figures which will be reflected in future Eurostat updates.
