206 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   4.6 Research, Innovation and Competitiveness Dimension  i. The current situation in the low-carbon technology sector and, as far as possible, its position on the global market (Union or global analysis required) Promoting the transition to a climate-neutral society (CNS) In order to reduce GHG emissions and increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources, a number of operational programmes have been adopted in Slovenia envisaging various measures to encourage companies to transition to a climate-neutral society. The key instruments for green economic growth are: promoting research and innovation for the transition to CNS, promoting entrepreneurship for the transition to CNS and demonstration projects. The financial incentives for research and innovation used to achieve climate change targets are planned under the OP EKP (Operational Program for implementing European Cohesion Policy 2014-2020), priority axis: 1 International competitiveness for research, innovation and technological development in line with smart specialisation for increased competitiveness and greening of the economy, priority investment 1.2 Encouraging enterprise investment in research and innovation, and establishing links and synergies between enterprises, R&D centres and the higher education sector. The financial incentives for entrepreneurship development used for the climate change objectives are planned under the OP EKP Priority Axis 3. Dynamic and competitive entrepreneurship for green economic growth, priority investments 3.1. Promoting entrepreneurship, in particular by facilitating the economic exploitation of new ideas and promoting the creation of new businesses, including business incubators. The OP TGP (Operational Program for GHG Emission Reduction Operations by 2020) plans financial incentives for the implementation of demonstration projects in the area of GHG emission reduction in industry, and the Action Plan for Efficient Energy contains a development scheme and other incentives for the economy to market green energy products. Financial incentives for demonstration projects were announced by the Ministry of Economic Development and Technology in 2016/2017. In this context, the ministry launched a public tender procedure in the priority area of the Slovenian Smart Specialisation Strategy Smart Cities and Communities, target area Energy Conversion, Distribution and Management. The tender procedure was for co-financing of the implementation of pilot demonstration projects of companies or consortia of companies, the result of which must be new or improved products, processes or services, developed to the degree that they are endorsed and tested for use in a real environment. The result of the projects must also be a demonstration of their use in a real environment to obtain references from companies for commercialisation. Promoting clean energy innovation and the Innovation Fund The European Parliament, in its resolution of 6 February 2018 on promoting clean energy innovation (2017/2084 (INI)), notes that clean energy research, development and innovation crucially depend on a stable market and the predictability and certainty of a regulatory framework. A stable regulatory framework, however, requires an ambitious and deliverable long-term policy vision, including energy- and climate-related goals and commitments, sustained targeted incentives and patient-equity capital in order to create a level playing field among technologies, thus facilitating innovation, easing energy supply, lowering market entry barriers and making it easier for clean energy innovation to attain the critical mass necessary for market deployment. The resolution stresses the need for greater prioritisation of cross-cutting, cross-sectoral, systemic innovation in energy, as well as the promotion of education and entrepreneurship, since innovation is not only technology-driven. The European Parliament resolution envisages the development of a 207 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   systemic approach to be able to effectively integrate different solutions available or under development, particularly with regard to energy efficiency and the integration of renewables, and calls for European technology and innovation platforms to be used to help identify prospective clean energy innovation meriting targeted support. In 2018, the amended EU Emission Trading System (ETS) Directive (Directive (EU) 2018/410 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2018 amending Directive 2003/87/EC to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments and Decision (EU) 2015/1814 (OJ L 76, 19.3.2018, p.3)) provided the legal basis for a new Innovation Fund to provide funding for innovative low-carbon industrial and energy technologies up to 2030. Technologies receiving support from the Innovation Fund should be able to produce breakthrough solutions or be mature enough for pre-commercial demonstration. Innovative energy projects that contribute to the EU's transition to low-carbon energy require a better investment environment. In this context, the proposed Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union provides that Member States will draw up and submit to the Commission national long-term development strategies for a low carbon economy, supported by stable policies and regulations to promote and support the use of renewable energy and further reduce emissions. For major innovative low carbon energy demonstration projects in line with the recommendations of the ECA95 Special Report, the Commission should, in cases where  in the context of the proposed Innovation Fund and other relevant centrally managed EU funding programmes  large, capital-intensive projects are put forward which need a combination of national and EU support, assess their compliance with national climate and energy plans and obtain clear and transparent commitments from the Member States before allocating EU funds. ii. Current level of public and (where available) private research and innovation spending on low-carbon-technologies, current number of patents, and current number of researchers The 2016 data on research and development activity (R&D) show that, combining all sectors where research and development was carried out, R&D in Slovenia received a total of EUR 812 million or 2.01% of GDP in 2016. Compared with the figure of EUR 853.1 million for the previous year (2015), the amount was 4.8% or EUR 41.1 million less in nominal terms or, expressed as a percentage of GDP, 0.19 percentage points less. In absolute terms the amount of R&D funding has declined most markedly in the business sector (which otherwise spends the most on R&D); nominally, R&D funding in the business sector was EUR 35.9 million or 5.5% less than in the previous year (SORS, 2018).96                                                             95  European Court of Auditors' Special Report: Demonstration of commercial capture and storage of carbon dioxide and innovative renewable energy in the EU: No progress has been made in the past decade, 2018. 96  SORS, 2018, Research and Development Activity, 2016, available at: https://www.stat.si/StatWeb/News/Index/7277.  208 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 72: Share of gross domestic expenditure for research and development in GDP, Slovenia  Source: SORS, 2018  The table below, which shows gross domestic expenditure on R&D by source of funding in 2016, shows that the largest share of R&D is spent by companies (almost 70%), State sources and foreign sources (mostly EU funds).

Then it began to increase gradually. Table 62: Gross domestic expenditure on R&D in Slovenia coming from State sources in the period 2007-2016  2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Funding Sources - TOTAL 500508 616949 656882 745942 894213 928306 935006 890231 853067 811953 State resources 178210 193101 234241 263077 281764 266190 251263 193930 169644 163940 % 35.61% 31.30% 35.66% 35.27% 31.51% 28.67% 26.87% 21.78% 19.89% 20.19% Source: SORS, 2018 According to the final budget, in 2017 Slovenia allocated EUR 170.5 million to the State budget for R&D, i.e. EUR 7.8 million or 4.8% more than in the previous year. This was the second consecutive increase. The share of State budgetary resources for R&D in GDP remained unchanged in 2017 compared to 2016, amounting to 0.40% of Slovenia's GDP. The initial budget for 2018 makes provision for more resources for R&D than planned and spent in 2017. Initial funding from the State budget foreseen for the implementation of R&D in 2018 is EUR 199.4 million, which is EUR 28.9 million more than the State actually allocated to R&D in 2017 (SORS, 2018b).97                                                            97  SORS, 2018, State Budget for Research and Development increased for the second year in a row, Available at: https://www.stat.si/StatWeb/News/Index/7681. 209 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Of the national budget allocated to R&D in 2017, half (49.8%) was for general advancement of knowledge. As in the previous year, the next highest allocation was in industrial production and technology (10.8%) and health (10.5%). The structure of R&D funds planned for 2018 is  in terms of socio-economic targets  roughly the same as the structure of funds disbursed in 2017. The vast majority of the State R&D budget for 2017, specifically 91.7%, was earmarked for the implementation of R&D in the State and higher education sectors; 54.3% was received by the State sector and 37.4% by the higher education sector. The remaining tenth of R&D funding in 2017 was allocated to the business sector (6.6%) and the private non-profit sector (0.9%) and abroad (0.7%) (SORS, 2018b).  Figure 73: State budget appropriations for R&D (final budget), Slovenia  Source: SORS, 2018b In 2016, of all 20 022 natural persons regularly employed in R&D, 11 282 (or 56%) were researchers of both sexes. If the volume of R&D work performed by full-time and part-time employees in 2016 is expressed in full-time equivalents (FTE) to prevent under- or over-estimation of data on R&D workers, we can see that the work done by all the persons who worked in R&D was the same as would be done by 14 403 full-time equivalents, 8 119 of whom would be researchers of both sexes (56%) (SORS, 2018). The data also show that women are still in the minority among researchers. Of all researchers actively working in 2016 (counted as natural persons), 35% were women. If the volume of R&D work carried out in 2016 by researchers and research associates is expressed in FTE, then 33% of all researchers were women. If we look at the distribution of female and male researchers in 2016 in the three most important sectors, we see that it is the same as in previous years: the highest percentage of female researchers was in the government sector, at 50%, while female researchers in the higher education sector accounted for 42%; however, the share of women researchers in the business sector  at 24% - was again extremely low (SORS, 2018). Slovenia does not have accurate data on the number of patents in the area of low carbon technologies. The following is only some of the partial information that is publicly available. The EIO Country Profile for Slovenia for 2017 through the Eco-Innovation Output component reveals that media coverage in the area of eco-innovation (in terms of the number of electronic media) significantly increased in 2017 and 2016 compared to 2015 and that it was higher than the EU average. Similarly, compared to 2015, the number of publications on eco-innovation (per million inhabitants) increased in 2017 and exceeded the EU average. On the other hand, the number of eco-innovation patents is still small and does not reach the EU average (EIO, 2017).98                                                             98  EIO, 2017, Eco-innovation in Slovenia, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecoap/sites/ecoap_stayconnected/files/field/field-country- .files/slovenia_eio_country_profile_2016-2017_1.pdf.  210 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Table 63: Number of patents, media coverage and publications in the area of eco-innovation in Slovenia in the period 2010-2017  Number of eco patents per million population (original data) Number of publications per million population (original data) Electronic Media hits (Original Data) EU AVERAGE 18.34 20.53 1.00 Slovenia 2017 9.82 45.54 1.47 Slovenia 2016 17.89 25.21 1.24 Slovenia 2015 10.31 29.60 0.18 Slovenia 2014 10.00 18.94 0.10 Slovenia 2013 2.56 17.03 0.05 Slovenia 2012 1.99 11.22 0.04 Slovenia 2011 1.99 2.44 0.05 Slovenia 2010 0.00   Source: EIO, 2017.  iii. Breakdown of current price elements that make up the three main price components (energy, network, taxes/charges) Electricity price structure The electricity market is open and competitive, so final electricity prices are influenced by market conditions and factors. The Energy Agency constantly monitors prices on the markets of household and small business customers, obtaining data on prices or offers on the retail market from suppliers on a monthly basis. The Agency analyses the market for large business customers on a semi-annual and annual basis based on data from the EPOS system (e-reporting system for data from energy providers) operated by the Ministry of Infrastructure. The figure below shows an analysis of the structure of the final prices of electricity supplied to typical household customers. The final amount for the payment of electricity supplied to the customer consists of the following (Report on the Energy Sector in Slovenia in 2017, p. 87):  prices of freely generated electricity on the market;  network charges (transmission network charges and distribution network charges);  contributions (contribution to support the production of electricity in high-efficiency cogeneration and RES, contribution to energy efficiency and contribution to the functioning of the market operator);  excise duties on electricity and value-added tax (VAT).  211 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 74: Fluctuations in the final electricity price in Slovenia for a typical household customer (Dc - from 2 500 to 5 000 kWh per year) in the period 2015-2017  Source: Report on the situation in the Energy Sector in Slovenia in 2017, 87. Key to Figure 74:  1st semester - 2nd semester 2015/ 1st semester - 2nd semester 2016/ 1st semester - 2nd semester 2017   VAT + excise duty,  Contributions,  Energy,  Price for using the network  The final price of electricity decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the decrease in the price of electricity in the structure of the final price. In the last three years, the fluctuation of this price has not exceeded the two percent increase relative to the lowest value reached in the first half of 2015 (Report on the Energy Sector in Slovenia in 2017, p. 87). The average final price of electricity supplied for business consumption, excluding value-added tax in the second half of 2017 amounted to EUR 80.7/MWh and decreased by 5.1% compared to the same period of 2016. The decrease in the retail price, however, does not reflect prices on the wholesale markets, as they increased sharply there. Supplier pricing models are tailored to customers and are directly or indirectly linked to wholesale prices. Suppliers may be assumed to have purchased most of the energy for the portfolio they supply in the futures markets when the price of energy was significantly lower (at the end of 2016) (Energy Situation Report for Slovenia in 2017, p. 88). Natural gas price structure The figure below shows the final natural gas prices for typical D2 household gas customers with annual consumption of 5 556 to 55 556 kWh in Slovenia and EU countries. In most countries, natural gas prices have decreased compared to 2016, which is also reflected in the average price at EU-28 level, which has decreased. Estonia had the largest increase in natural gas prices, and the UK had the largest decrease. The price of natural gas in Slovenia remained below the EU-28 average in 2017 (Report on the Energy Sector in Slovenia in 2017, p. 146).  212 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 75: Final natural gas prices for a typical D2 household customer with all taxes and levies for Slovenia and individual EU countries in 2016 and 2017  Source: Report on the Energy Sector in Slovenia in 2017, p. 146.

In more than half of the EU Member States, prices in this consumer group fell compared to 2016, as did the average price for the EU-28. The largest increase in natural gas prices was recorded in Lithuania and the largest decrease in Croatia. The price of natural gas in Slovenia remained above the EU-28 average in 2017 (Report on the Energy Sector in Slovenia in 2017, p. 147).

Description of energy subsidies, including for fossil fuels Subsidies in energy Subsidies in the energy sector in 2017 amounted to EUR 163 million (current prices). They relate solely to support for the production of electricity from RES and CHP. The table below gives an overview of the structure of subsidies awarded per year in the period 2010 to 2017.  Table 64: Subsidies awarded in the energy sector in the period 2010-2017 EUR million at current prices 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 RES and EEU 61 92 143 200 205 178 140 163 Source: PES Analysis - CEU, Borzen-CP Database, FURS, MZI, Eco fund, 2019  Incentives counter to the objective of reducing GHG emissions Incentives counter to the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions have been increasing over the years as consumption of energy products increases. The excise duty on commercial diesel (freight and passenger vehicles) is the highest in terms of share. Their amount also varies according to the number of excise duties on individual energy products, and in the event of tax reduction, the incentive amount also falls. In 2017, such oil and gas incentives amounted to EUR 95 million (at current prices).
