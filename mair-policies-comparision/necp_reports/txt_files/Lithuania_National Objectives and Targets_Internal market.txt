2.4 Dimension internal energy market   Electricity interconnectivity  In 2014, the European Council set a target for electricity interconnection between EU Member States of at least 10% of the total electricity generation capacity installed in a Member State by 2020 and 15% by 2030. Projects of common interest should contribute to this objective. The nominal interconnection capacity of the lines should be 30% at peak load and the nominal interconnection capacity of the lines should be at least 30% of the installed renewable energy capacity. It should be stressed that all these indicators are met in Lithuania  the level of interconnection of electricity systems is more than 60% and the nominal capacity of interconnectors during peak load and the nominal capacity of interconnectors in terms of installed renewable energy generation capacity is more than 60%41. Due to historical factors, Lithuania's high voltage electricity transmission grid is directly interconnected with the high voltage grids of Latvia, Belarus and the Kaliningrad Region of Russia. These interconnections allow extensive exchanges of power with those neighbouring systems. The main challenge for Lithuania and all Baltic countries is to integrate their energy systems into the common European electricity market and to start synchronising with the European mainland electricity grid by 2025. New interconnectors with Sweden (NordBalt  700 MW ) and Poland (LitPol Link  500 MW ) were installed and launched at the end of 2015 and in early 2016. Together with the Estlink I (350 MW ) and Estlink II (650 MW ) between Finland and                                                            40 Approved by Order No 1-107 of the Minister for Energy of the Republic of Lithuania of 24 May 2013 on the approval of the Plan for the application of restrictions on the supply and consumption of petroleum products.  41 TYNDP 2018 Regional Insight Report North-South Interconnections East: https://tyndp.entsoe.eu/Documents/TYNDP%20documents/TYNDP2018/consultation/PCI%20Region/ENTSO_TYNDP_2018_NSI_E AST.pdf 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 43    MW , and this constitutes around 23% of interconnectivity level. In 2016, the price difference on the wholesale market was EUR 7.1/MWh between Lithuania and Sweden (electricity is cheaper in Sweden), EUR 6.1/MWh between Lithuania and Poland (electricity is cheaper in Lithuania) and EUR 0.5/MWh between Lithuania and Latvia (electricity is cheaper in Latvia). It is intended that this difference between the different wholesale markets not exceed EUR 2/MWh. This requires sufficient technical connection capacity to allow electricity to flow from a cheaper area to a more expensive one. Thus, when the price increases in one area, it decreases in another. For the competitiveness of the Lithuanian economy and to attract foreign investment, it is important that the average final electricity price for business and industrial consumers be lower compared to other Scandinavian, central and eLithuania ranked 9th in terms of the lowest average final electricity price for business and industrial consumers in Scandinavian and Central and Eastern European countries (EU Member States). It is important for Lithuania to improve this rate and to move up to positions 13.  Structure of energy transmission  In order to fulfil the elements of the Energy Union, namely energy security and integration into the internal energy market, the following main electricity and gas transmission infrastructure projects are currently being implemented, which are also included in the NEIS and most of them have the highest status that can be granted to a project in Lithuania, i.e. projects recognised by the Government as economic projects of national importance:  Electricity Synchronisation project At present, the Synchronisation Project is the most important one in the field of electricity in Lithuania. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are the only EU Member States whose electricity systems operating synchronously with the Russian IPS/UPS (Integrated Power System/Unified Power System) system, which includes the networks in Russia, Belarus, the former USSR and the Baltic States. Under the agreement between the BRELL countries (Belarus, Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), the current management and frequency regulation of the IPS/UPS system (and hence the Baltic electricity networks) is ensured by a central control centre operated by the Russian electricity system operator. However, as EU Member States, the Baltic States have to link their energy objectives and targets to the strategic objectives of the EU's common energy policy, one of which is to create a fully integrated electricity system market at the economic and technological (interconnection) level. The aim is therefore to disconnect from the IPS/UPS system and synchronise with continental European electricity networks (CENs). Synchronisation is seen as one of the key goals of the EU energy policy. This project is included within the European Energy Security Strategy and the EU Energy Union as a project of common interest and of critical importance to the EU energy security. The goal of Baltic States' synchronisation with the continental European networks by 2025 is also included in the reinforced BEMIP. 13 June 2019, the Lithuanian Parliament adopted the Law on the Connection of the Lithuanian Power System with the Continental European Power System for Synchronous Operation and related legislation. They lay down the basic conditions for organising and implementing the synchronisation process. The La provides that the synchronisation project and the related infrastructure projects will be granted the status of projects of special national significance. This will allow faster implementation of spatial planning procedures for synchronisation projects, the identification of easements and the rapid 2.

Natural gas Gas interconnection Poland-Lithuania (GIPL) In the field of natural gas, the most important project currently under way is the gas interconnection between Poland and Lithuania (GIPL), which will connect the Baltic States and Finland with the single EU gas market, increase security of supply and diversification of supply routes in the region, promote greater liquidity in the regional market and competition between suppliers, and enable a more efficient use of the is due to be completed by the end of 2021. The estimated length of the gas pipeline is around 508 km, of which 165 km will be in Lithuania, with a maximum capacity of 2.4 billion m3/year from Poland and 1.9 billion m3/year from Lithuania. The project is implemented by the Lithuanian natural gas transmission system operator AB Amber Grid and the Polish natural gas transmission system operator GAZ-SYSTEM. The project is included in the list of projects of common interest and its implementation is supported by the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). Project for enhancement of Latvia-Lithuania interconnection(ELLI) A project to enhance the capacity of the Latvia and Lithuania gas interconnection (ELLI) is also being implemented currently. This project will modernise the gas pipelines on the Latvian territory in order to increase the pressure to 50 bar (now 40 bar) and expand  gas monitoring station in Lithuania. The aim of this project is to ensure sufficient capacity between the Baltic States and other European countries, to make use of alternative sources of gas supply and transport routes for the countries of the region, to increase security of gas supply, to contribute to the creation of the internal energy market, to increase market integration and competition, as well as to strengthen energy solidarity between EU integrating the gas markets of the Baltic States into the single EU gas market, this interconnection will become an important part of the route linking the European and Eastern Baltic markets. The project is implemented by the Latvian natural gas transmission system and underground natural gas storage operator AS Conexus Baltic Grid and the Lithuanian natural gas transmission system operator AB Amber Grid. The project is included in the list of projects of common interest and has received support from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). Projects of local importance to improve the reliability of the Lithuanian electricity and natural gas transmission systems are envisaged in the National Plan for the Implementation of Electricity and Natural Gas Transmission Infrastructure Projects42. These projects receive investment from the European Union (the activities financed are described in more detail in Section 3.3. ). The strategy papers include the 10-year development plans for operators (both transmission and distribution), which provide for major projects, development and investment by operators.   Market integration  On 5 June 2019, the European Parliament and the Council adopted amendments to the Electricity Directive and the Electricity Regulation43. These changes are part of the Clean Energy Package and are also referred                                                            42National Plan for the implementation of electricity and natural gas transmission infrastructure projects, approved by Government Resolution No 2014 of 22 July 476 approving that Plan. 43 Regulation (EU) 2019/943 on the internal market in electricity and Directive 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS SECTION A 45   to as the Fourth EU Energy Package due to their importance and scope. Through this legislation, EU Member States have agreed to foster the integration of their national markets and the cooperation of system operators at EU and regional level, to address recurring barriers to the completion of the internal market in electricity (e.g. high degree of regulatory intervention, barriers to the supply of electricity on an equal footing) and to cooperate closely with each other on all issues related to the establishment of an integrated electricity trading region. Priority national targets and tasks for the development of electricity markets 20212030:  to adapt the electricity system to variable and distributed generation of electricity from renewable sources;  to establish an electricity market system that rewards flexibility and innovation;  to develop measures encouraging investment in the development of secure and competitive local energy production and in the development of measures to ensure the adequacy of the electricity system;  to promote competitive price formation by enabling consumers to choose dynamic price agreements, allowing them to respond to price signals in real time and to manage their energy consumption;  to coordinate national energy policies with the neighbouring Member States and exploit the potential of the integration of balancing markets and cross-border energy trading;  to promote fair competition and easy access for energy suppliers in order to allow consumers to take advantage of the opportunities of a liberalised internal market in energy.   Energy poverty  A key aspect of a sustainable internal market is the availability of energy services to all citizens in order to ensure the basic needs and health of consumers. However, Lithuania faces the problem of energy poverty, where it is difficult or impossible for residents to enjoy adequate heating of their homes or access to essential energy services such as lighting or transport.44 Energy poverty is caused by four main problems: energy inefficiency, high energy prices and low household incomes, as well as lack of consumer awareness. The problem of energy poverty is also reflected in energy poverty indicators (see Table 2.4.4.1):  According to the EU income and living conditions survey45, more than a quarter (27.9%46) of the population could not afford adequate heating of their homes in 2018. This is the second highest rate among the EU Member States, which is much worse than the EU average of 7.4%.  In Lithuania, 17.1% of households spent a large part of their income on energy in 2016. This indicator shows the percentage of households in which the share of energy expenditure (electricity, gas, other fuels, heat) in disposable income was more than double the median share of energy expenditure.                                                             5 June 2019 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU. 44 European Economic and Social Committee, 2011/C 44/09. 45 https://www.energypoverty.eu/sites/default/files/downloads/observatory-documents/19-06/member_state_report_-_lithuania.pdf 46 Eurostat, Inability to keep home adequately warm - EU-SILC, 2019.

According to Statistics Lithuania, 14.9% of Lithuanian households experienced hidden energy poverty in 2016. More specifically, the indicator of hidden energy poverty shows the percentage of households whose energy expenditure was less than 50% of the median energy expenditure.  Energy poverty affects socially vulnerable groups in particular: seniors, children, people with chronic diseases, single parents, and the unemployed. Tackling this pressing social challenge requires a comprehensive political approach combining social and environmental policies. In order to address energy poverty, the National Progress Programme 20212030 sets the target of e national indicators with targets for 2025 and 2030 (see Table 2.4.4.2).   Table 2.4.4.2.
