Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    3.5 Research, innovation and competitiveness dimension i. Policy and measures related to the elements in point 2.5 Policy approach to innovation The Dutch government encourages innovation both in generic and in specific terms. The generic pathway of Dutch business policy is aimed at entrepreneurs by stimulating innovation, reducing regulatory and administrative burden, increasing access to capital market funding, good public services for businesses and fiscal and other support for entrepreneurs. This is achieved, for example, through tax measures such as the Research and Development (Promotion) Act (Wet bevordering speur- en ontwikkelingswerk, WBSO), Innovatiebox and innovation credit. Specific innovation policy focuses on nine top sectors. As described in section 2.5, the focus of the top sectors has shifted to the economic opportunities of four social themes and key technologies. The essence of the top sector policy is public-private cooperation. The Netherlands has a strong tradition of public-private partnerships, in which the government, the private sector and knowledge institutions work closely together in the "triple helix".102 102 Within clusters of companies and knowledge institutions, entrepreneurs, researchers and public authorities collaborate on research & innovation focused on societal challenges, international competition strategies and earning power. The knowledge and innovation agendas drafted on the basis of the formulated missions and the key technologies action plan define the innovation approach and the deployment of resources by research institutes, top sectors, regions and departments. In November a Knowledge and Innovation Agreement will be agreed to this effect, in which public and private funding will be included that will be used in the coming years for the mission-oriented top sectors and innovation policy. The nine top sectors will work more closely with the mission-oriented top sectors and innovation policy. With regard to climate and energy, the collaboration primarily concerns the top sectors of Energy, the Chemical Industry, Agriculture & Food, High Tech Systems & Materials, Logistics, Water and Creative Industries. Policies within energy and climate innovation policy The Climate Agreement and the Integrated Knowledge and Innovation Agenda for climate and energy determine the course and commitment to knowledge and innovation. There are thirteen Multi-annual Mission-oriented Innovation Programmes (MMIPs) that interpret the required multi-annual programmatic approach to knowledge and innovation in order to contribute to the missions in 2050 and specific targets for 2030. MMIP1 Renewable offshore electricity: the specific objectives for this MMIP are to apply research and innovation to enable the development of 10.6 GW (49 TWh) or more of offshore wind energy by 2030 and between 35 GW (150 TWh) and 75 GW (320 TWh) of renewable offshore electricity by 2050, at the lowest possible social costs. This is a huge leap in scale for which innovation and research are indispensable. The challenge for the electricity sector is to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 20.2 Mton in 2030. To achieve these targets, the focus will be on resolving a number of bottlenecks that will be elaborated in sub-programmes: 1. Cost reduction and optimisation (secure and affordable upscaling); 2. Integration in the energy system (including storage and conversion); 3. Integration in the environment (ecology and multi-use) MMIP 2 Renewable electricity generation on land and in the built-up environment: The target for this MMIP amounts to generating at least 42 TWh by 2030. Strong further growth is expected for the period up to 2050 and beyond. Generation must take place at the lowest possible cost (30 to 60 euros/MWh by 2030 with a goal of 20 euros/MWh by 2050), and on the basis of optimum spatial, ecological and functional integration of the system in its environment. The sub-programmes that will be developed for this MMIP are: 1. Human Capital Agenda (training enough highly-skilled personnel at all levels); 2. Space and ecology (combining electricity generation and preserving or improving spatial and ecological quality); 3. Implementation and innovation (large-scale implementation of currently available technologies, their continued development and making new technologies available); 4.Sustainability and circularity (from renewable to fully sustainable); 5. Incentives (public and private funding and appropriate incentive instruments).  MMIP 3 Accelerating energy renovation in the built-up environment:CO2 emissions from the built-up environment must be reduced by 3.4 Mton by 2030 compared with 1990. The challenge is to transform more than 7 million homes and 570,000 non-residential                                                  102  http://mission-innovation.net/participating-countries/netherlands/. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    buildings by 2050 into well-insulated properties that are heated with renewable heat and in which clean electricity is consumed/generated. To achieve this mission, technical, process-based and social innovations are needed. This will be pursued via the following three aspects: 1. the development of integral renovation concepts; 2. industrialisation and digitisation of the renovation process; 3. placing property owners and users at the centre of energy renovations. MMIP 4 Renewable heat and cooling in the built-up environment (including greenhouse horticulture): The mission involved in this MMIP focuses on developing an appealing alternative to natural-gas free, with the following intermediate targets by 2030: 1.5 million existing homes and 15% of non-residential and social real estate natural gas-free, making the heat demand more sustainable for greenhouse horticulture using geothermal energy, seasonal storage and low temperature sources (1 Mton CO2 saving in 2030). These targets should collectively achieve CO2 savings of 3.5 Mton by 2030. By 2050, the built-up environment must be completely CO2-free and no longer use fossil fuels to heat buildings. The following sub-programmes have been formulated to achieve these targets: 1. Silent, compact, smart, cost-efficient heat pumps; 2. Delivery, ventilation and tap water systems; 3. Smart compact heat-battery; 4. Renewable heat grids; 5. Large-scale thermal storage; 6. Geothermal energy; 7. Low temperature (LT) sources such as aquathermal and solar thermal.  MMIP 5 Electrification of the energy system in the built-up environment: in this MMIP the emphasis lies on the electricity supply in the built-up environment. System innovations are needed to facilitate the distributed generation of electricity, to smooth out peaks and troughs, to better balance supply and demand and to consume electricity more intelligently, through conversion with other energy carriers and infrastructures. The following four sub-programmes have been formulated to bring about these system innovations; 1. Smart energy consumption in/between buildings and their users; 2. Flexibility of/for the energy system (in the built-up environment); 3. System design for the electricity system in the built-up environment; 4. Trade in/exchange of energy in the built-up environment. MMIP 6 Closing industrial chains: in 2050, raw materials, products and processes in industry are net climate neutral and at least 80% circular. In 2030, 50 percent fewer primary raw materials are consumed in the Netherlands and greenhouse gas emissions from production processes and the waste sector are reduced to approximately 36 Mton of CO2 equivalent. The aim is also to use CCS in a cost-effective way, to ensure that sustainable hydrogen production is on its way to implementation and to make bio-based raw materials the norm. The following five sub-programmes have been established to achieve this: 1. Circular plastics; 2. Bio-based raw materials for products and transport fuels; 3. CCU (Carbon Capture and Usage - the use of CO2 as a raw material); 4. Circular non-ferrous metals; 5. CCS MMIP 7 A CO2 free industrial heat system: in 2030, power-to-heat solutions and the use of renewable heat sources result in an emission reduction of at least 5.3 Mton CO2 and energy savings of 93 petajoules. This means the industrial heat system is sustainable up to 300Â°C, in particular through efficiency and heat reuse and storage, and through the roll-out of ultra-deep geothermal energy. The goal for 2050 is to make the heat supply completely CO2-free for all temperature levels. Consequently the demand for heat is drastically reduced through the application of efficient processes and is achieved using renewable sources. The following sub-programmes have been formulated to achieve these targets: 1. Maximising process-efficiency; 2. Heat reuse, upgrading and storage; 3. Deep and ultra-deep geothermal energy for industry; 4. The application of climate-neutral fuels; 5. System concepts for heating and cooling. MMIP 8 Electrification and radically renewed processes: this MMIP strives for the following five goals focusing on five sub-programmes; 1. Production of hydrogen, molecules and innovative renewable fuels: investment costs for large-scale water 2. Electrical appliances and electric-powered processes: cost-effective electrochemical production processes for basic chemicals and fuels have been developed by 2030 and are ready for upscaling to bulk processes; energy-efficient electric-powered processes are standard technology by 2025; 3. Increased flexibility and digitisation: process digitisation is accepted as best practice and widely rolled out by 2025; 4. (Radically) renewed processes: at least three radical breakthroughs in CO2-intensive processes have been proven at the pilot level. 5. Social implications of industrial electrification: by 2050, production processes will also be fully climate neutral and optimally electrified.  MMIP 9 Innovative propulsion and use of sustainable energy carriers for mobility and MMIP10 Efficient transport movements for people and goods: MMIP 9 and 10 must jointly ensure that the climate targets for mobility are within reach103 by accelerating the development of and                                                  103 Reduce CO2 emissions to no more than 25 Mton (7 Mton lower than at present) and to virtually zero by 2050. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    scaling sustainable mobility solutions and optimising solutions in relation to the overall mobility system. Furthermore, it must stimulate economic green growth and future-proof employment by; 1. connecting to proven expertise from the Dutch business community and knowledge institutions; 2. by focusing on areas in which a market is still under development worldwide; 3. by connecting to other mobility functions in the Dutch economy, for example, with regard to the trade and production of fuels. Lastly, these MMIPs must connect the climate challenge to other social challenges within mobility, including security, health and accessibility. The related sub-programmes formulated to achieve this are; 9.1. Zero-emission propulsion technology and vehicles; 9.2. Energy distribution for electric vehicles and vessels; 9.3. Distribution of hydrogen and other energy carriers for fuel cell vehicles and vessels; 9.4. Distribution and use of renewable fuels containing carbon; 9.5. energy-efficient vehicles. 10.1 Knowing what moves people; 10.2 CO2 reduction through new mobility concepts for passenger transport; 10.3 CO2 reduction through innovations in logistics; 10.4 Knowledge and tools to support the transition (public perspective) for adaptive programming.  MMIP 11 Climate-neutral production of food and non-food: The target related to MMIP 11 is to optimally reduce greenhouse gas emissions produced by the agriculture and land-use sector. For 2030 this means that all current technical options have been implemented and for 2050 that technical potential is available to reduce rumen fermentation by 95% and that housing and storage no longer produce methane emissions. There is a reduction target for nitrous oxide emissions amounting to a reduction of 0.3 Mton of nitrous oxide emissions by 2050. The focus is on two themes, which are: 1. emission reduction in soil and land use (nitrous oxide and peat meadows); 2. emission reduction for livestock farming (rumen fermentation and manure storage). MMIP 12 Land and water optimally designed for CO2 capture and use: In addition to an increasing demand for food and animal feed, the demand for biomass as a raw material and biofuels will increase, as will the capture of carbon in nature. This contributes to emission reductions in agriculture and other sectors. In this MMIP, knowledge and innovation are applied to design land and water for the purpose of increasing biomass production. This objective entails a large number of significant knowledge and innovation tasks. The following sub-goals have been formulated: the development of Blue Space for large-scale, profitable and sustainable seaweed production in 2050; Biomass cultivation with doubled photosynthesis in 2050; Consumer biomass carbon footprint halves in 2050 as a result of purchasing choices; 50% of the protein supply for human consumption will consist of (possibly new) plant-based sources in 2050; Climate-proof nature captures more CO2 every year, while preserving biodiversity, and increasing biomass harvest in 2050; An energy consumption reduction to zero emissions in 2030 and generation of 100 petajoules in 2050 by scaling-down initial post-harvest treatments.  MMIP 13 A robust and socially supported energy system: we are on the verge of an energy transition that requires a transition process that makes it possible to take adequate, high-quality and efficient decisions from a system perspective, and to implement the design and operation of an affordable and accepted energy system. The level of reliability, security of supply and safety must remain the same as the current level. MMIP 13 develops knowledge and innovation to ensure this is achieved. The six sub-programmes of this MMIP focus on various aspects of the challenge related to the integrated energy system challenge, and concern the following; 1. Knowledge and integrated decision-making; 2. Inclusive energy transition; 3. Integrated energy infrastructure; 4. Flexible energy markets; 5. Storage and conversion; 6. Operational management and digitisation. Implementation Implementation of the MMIPs is scheduled to begin in 2020. Incidentally, this does not mean starting from scratch, but building (at least in part) on efforts that were previously set in motion primarily with the Top Sector Energy Policy and energy innovation policy. When implementing the MMIPs, it is important that the research and innovation subsidy schemes (including for energy) are devoted as much as possible to facilitating the MMIPs and 103 Reducing CO2 emissions to a maximum of 25 Mton (7 Mton lower than the current situation) and reducing them to practically zero by 2050. are mutually reinforcing or can naturally overlap. The focus is on facilitating programmes/sub-programmes more than in the past instead of individual innovative projects, involving the users or buyers of the innovation more closely and earlier, as well as shaping the interaction with other transition and implementation policies. After all, to get innovations effectively implemented and scaled up in the market, it is important that the right incentives for this are available. In addition, setting specific preconditions can stimulate innovation without the need for a subsidy scheme. This requires close interdepartmental cooperation, with and between the various knowledge institutions and the business community, but certainly also international cooperation. By focusing on the MMIPs, the Netherlands contributes to the challenge in the SET plan and the underlying implementation plans, the Innovation Challenges within Mission Innovation and the Technology Collaboration Programmes of the IEA. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    The government's efforts will focus on building up and boosting the required innovation ecosystems. In addition, the financial subsidy support from climate and energy innovation policy will primarily focus on system innovations that the market cannot generate on its own. Examples include flexibility of the energy system, among other things through the storage and conversion of renewable energy, as well as ecological and spatial integration issues of large-scale electricity generation. Policy approach to the labour market, training, employment in relation to the transition The transition has an impact on the labour market. Tens of thousands of extra employees will be needed in the manufacturing industry, by grid operators and energy companies, in the installation and maintenance sector, in the chemical industry and at construction companies. In the traditional industries on the other hand, others may be at risk of losing their jobs. The nature of many current jobs will also change, which means that other skills and thus future-oriented development will be needed. Close cooperation between the organisations involved is needed to increase the number of well-qualified employees and to make the energy transition more inclusive. On the basis of their models, the CPB and PBL estimate that the overall climate and energy policy has a limited effect on the supply of labour or the total demand for employees. On balance, climate policy does not lead to an increase in the demand for labour, nor does it trigger an extra supply of labour.104 In the longer term, employment effects on climate and energy policy are estimated to be marginal. There will, however, be shifts in employment, which may also be accompanied by tension on the labour market (temporary shortages). In addition, the policy is accompanied by transition effects. The demand for labour is decreasing in fossil-oriented sectors and is increasing in sustainability-oriented sectors. The extent of the transition effects depends on the extent to which workers and companies adapt to changing circumstances. If such adjustments were not made at all, according to a so-called "matching model" used by the PBL, the demand for labour would increase by 1 to 2% more in 2030 than in the absence of climate policy.105 The PBL expects that the demand for labour will increase in all provinces, but that the extent to which this occurs will vary considerably per province. Employees and businesses alike will have to respond to changes on the labour market. A share of the current workforce will have to retrain or upskill. Not only professional knowledge is important, but also the ability to adapt to new tasks in a sector that will continue to develop. Boosting the labour market and education policy, as formulated in the advice issued by the Social and Economic Council (SER) in 2018,106 is an important pillar for achieving a successful transition to a sustainable economy and is necessary for capitalising on opportunities for the economy and employment, and for absorbing social risks such as job losses in fossil-oriented sectors. In a recent recommendation, the SER states that considerable efforts (including policy efforts) will be needed to prevent this transition from stagnating due to a shortage of qualified personnel.107 In the context of the Climate Agreement, agreements have been made to establish sectoral educational and labour market agendas. The SER advocates for efforts to develop a proactive labour market policy with sufficient training facilities in the regions. It is obvious that special attention should be devoted to the regions in which the five industrial clusters are located. There are already shortages in the manufacturing industry as well as in the installation and maintenance sector of well-trained personnel. The Labour Market and Training section of the Climate Agreement describes in detail the initiatives aimed at strengthening the labour market and training policy.108   First of all, it is necessary to attract more people, with appealing jobs, good working conditions and prospects for career progression and employment. The government and government organisations, including the UWV (Employee Insurance Agency), provide the necessary preconditions to ensure that workers and job seekers, including people with a disadvantage on the labour market, are able to take control of their life and work. This certainly also applies to workers who see their duties/job change. Secondly, for the sake of productivity and high quality of work, it is important that current and future workers and companies continue to develop much more than they do now through responsive, tailor-made learning, in close collaboration with the business community, the authorities and trade unions. Finally, it is necessary to use targeted technological and social innovation to increase productivity and organise work in a smarter way around the available manpower.                                                  104 Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB) (2019).

This requires a curriculum that prepares pupils accordingly. In the context of the Climate Agreement, it has been agreed that a special committee will be set up in the SER that will take an integrated approach towards consideration of the labour market and training issues. The SER will promote and connect national, regional and sectoral initiatives and facilitate the development of sectoral training and labour market agendas. It has been agreed in the Climate Agreement that sectoral education and labour market agendas will be developed (and updated periodically) to include an implementation agenda for the coming five years and an action agenda for the coming year. Depending on the nature and scope of the tasks and the existing sectoral agreements and structures, the approach and the level of ambition may differ per sector. To address the employment effects of the energy transition, the government is creating a facility for employment effects of the energy transition; it is intended to provide from-work-to-work guidance and upskilling and reskilling. The government hais for the period up to 2024.109 ii. Cooperation with other Member States in this area, including information on how the SET plan objectives and policies are being translated to a national context In terms of energy innovation, especially for a relatively small country like the Netherlands, establishing close cooperation on the international playing field is crucial. This can strengthen the knowledge base, lead to economies of scale, accelerate the innovation process and provide economic opportunities. In addition, it may be attractive to apply any innovations that have been developed abroad first, as a testing ground. By collaborating (or reinforcing collaboration) on a number of strategically chosen subjects at an international level, we will be able to realise our ambitions in the field of energy and climate change in a cost-effective manner, strengthen our knowledge base and competitive position and give prominence to Dutch solutions in a highly globalised energy market. The starting point for this international cooperation is the Climate Agreement, the associated Integrated Knowledge and Innovation Agenda for climate and energy and the 13 Multi-annual Mission-oriented Innovation Programmes that have been elaborated. The Netherlands participates in targeted partnerships on energy innovation at an international level, including through the European Strategic Energy & Technology (SET) plan, the European Research Area network and Horizon 2020, the International Energy Agency, Mission Innovation and the Clean Energy Ministerial. This ensures the climate and energy innovation policy contributes to the missions and objectives in the national Climate Agreement and the energy and climate targets at EU level.110 The following table shows how the MMIPs contribute to efforts at the international level, including the Implementation Plans of the SET plan. In general, the Netherlands is involved in all IWGs with Dutch representation, but with regard to Consumers, Concentrated Solar Power, Ocean Energy and Batteries & e-mobility, the Netherlands does not participate with its own budget. With regard to Mission Innovation, the Netherlands has not joined the Converting Sunlight, Clean Energy Materials and Smart Grids challenges.                                                  109 Letter to Parliament on the employment implications of the bill to ban coal in electricity generation of 13 June 2019  Parliamentary document 35167 no. 7. 110  September 2016).

For example, the Netherlands chairs the working group on the theme of offshore wind energy. After all, offshore wind energy plays an important role in achieving the targets in the Climate Agreement. The Netherlands is one of the leaders in the field of offshore wind energy and is highly ambitious within the framework of the national Climate Agreement. In addition, the Netherlands plays a leading role in the strengthened international collaboration on the North Sea and shares the Presidency of the CCUS working group with Norway. This allows the Netherlands to help direct and supervise the activities that are crucial to the ongoing development of CCUS and provide concrete projects from Dutch research institutes and businesses. In addition, the Netherlands takes part in all SET IWGs with the exception of Consumers, Concentrated Solar Power, Ocean Energy and Batteries & e-mobility, as mentioned above. In this way, the Netherlands' focus within the context of the SET plan aligns effectively with the national focus in the IKIA and the MMIPs. Within the occasionally broader SET plan programmes as well, the focus of the Netherlands is on comparable priorities. Within the SET programme on energy efficiency in industry, for example, the Netherlands' participation is mainly focused on alternative, more sustainable high-temperature processes (through the electrification of processes, new separation processes and new processes for the steel industry, such as Hisarna). Within the programme, the Netherlands additionally focuses on HT heat recovery techniques and systems. The Netherlands does not have a separate subsidy pot for the SET plan or other international cooperation partnerships. We do, however, actively promote SET topics in the ERA-net co-fund context (for example ACT and Solar). The Dutch schemes are also open to foreign participants (company or knowledge institution), provided that the activities benefit the Dutch economy or other Dutch interests. Furthermore, companies must have a permanent base or a subsidiary in the Netherlands. European Research Area Network (ERA-NET) The Netherlands also takes part in the networks of the European Research Area Network (ERA-NET). The ERA-NETs serve to coordinate the research programmes within the individual Member States and to encourage collaboration between national research councils and research funding agencies. The principal activity of the ERA-NETs is usually the organisation of joint calls for research proposals. In addition to the above-mentioned networks in which the Netherlands participates, as included in the above table, the Netherlands is also part of the Eco Innovera ERA-Net. Other international cooperation Mission Innovation112 Through Mission Innovation, the Netherlands works alongside a group of 23 other leading industrialised nations and the European Commission to accelerate energy innovation by striving to double public investment in energy innovation in the period leading up to and including 2020. Accordingly, Mission Innovation contributes to the realisation of the agreements of the Paris Climate Agreement. With the financial impulse from the current government of 300 million euros per year up to and including 2030 for the climate, the Netherlands has satisfied its commitment to doubling public investment as of 1 January 2019113. Participation in Mission Innovation provides opportunities for Dutch research institutes and businesses to attract additional private funding for energy innovation. The Netherlands is deliberately focusing on a number of innovation challenges that                                                  111  September 2016). 112 For the Dutch commitment to Mission Innovation, see: http://mission-innovation.net/participating-countries/Netherlands/and the Letter to Parliament "State of affairs related to activities in the field of energy innovation" (30 September 2016) and "Dutch participation in Mission Innovation" (26 May 2016). 113 As a baseline for its participation in Mission Innovation, the Netherlands has boosted 100 million euros in RD&D spending on average per year with an effort to double this commitment by 2020. With spending in 2018, this has risen to 205 million euros. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    align with its national commitments. These concern the innovation challenges related to Heating & Cooling, Sustainable Biofuels, Carbon Capture and Off-grid access to electricity. In the spring of 2018, the Netherlands also joined the new innovation challenge in the field of hydrogen. The amounts for public-private investments are shown in the table below. These figures specifically concern MI-related RD&D.   Public-private investments in Mission Innovation related energy RD&D (RVO, 2019) International Energy Agency The Netherlands is active within the IEA and the technology network and participates in half of the Technology Collaboration Programmes (TCPs) (20 out of 38). A TCP supports the work of an independent international group of experts, who in turn help governments and companies to manage energy technology programmes and projects and related topics. Through this collaboration, these experts work on promoting research, development and bringing energy technologies to the market. The Netherlands participates in the following TCPs: Buildings and Communities (EBC TCP), Energy Efficient End-Use Equipment (4E TCP), Energy Storage (ECES TCP), Heat Pumping Technologies (HPT TCP), Demand-Side Management (DSM TCP), Smart Grids (ISGAN TCP), Industrial Energy-Related Technologies and Systems (IETS TCP), Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (HEV TCP), Bioenergy TCP, Hydrogen TCP, Ocean Energy Systems (OES TCP), Photovoltaic Power Systems (PVPS TCP), Solar Heating and Cooling (SHC TCP), Wind Energy Systems (Wind TCP), Gas and Oil Technologies (GOTCP), Greenhouse Gas R&D (GHG TCP), Fusion power, Nuclear Technology of Fusion Reactors (NTFR TCP), Stellarator-Heliotron Concept (SH TCP), Energy Technology Systems Analysis (ETSAP TCP). iii. Financing measures in this area at national level, including European Union support and the use of European Union funds The Netherlands' commitment to innovation consists of both a specific and a generic approach. Below is an outline of the schemes that can be used for energy and climate innovations. Generic innovation schemes Future Fund This fund makes funding available for innovative and fast-growing SMEs and for fundamental and applied research that will also benefit future generations; through the co-financing of investments in R&D and innovation, the facilitation of access to and funding of (risk) capital for businesses and the co-financing of European and international partnerships in the field of research and innovation. This fund includes:  Innovation credit  The Seed Capital Scheme  Dutch Venture Initiative (DVI-I and II)  Early-stage Funding (VFF)  Co-investment venture capital instrument/EIF  Start-ups/SMEs  Smart Industry Technology MI Baseline MI First-year RD&D Spending MI Second-year RD&D Spending MI Third-year RD&D Spending  (local currency) (local currency) (local currency) (local currency) Time period covered (month/year) e.g. Jan 2015 to Dec 2018  2016 2017 2018      TOTAL BUDGET 118.1 168.0 192.9 242.0 Total private investments (estimated range) 71-87 119-145 174-212 171-209 % private investments 40% 44% 50% 44% Total private investments 79 132 193 190  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030     Feasibility studies TO2 innovative start-ups  Innovation Box A special rate box within corporate income tax. Profits falling within this rate box are taxed at a rate of 7% instead of 25% R&D tax deduction scheme A scheme under the Salaries Tax and National Insurance Contributions Reduced Remittances Act (Wet vermindering afdracht loonbelasting en premie volksverzekeringen, WVA). The R&D tax deduction is based on wage costs of employees carrying out research and development work and on other costs and expenditure involved in research and development. Small Business Innovation Research Programme (SBIR) SBIR is a flexible procurement method through which the government is able to challenge entrepreneurs to solve specific social issues by means of innovative products and services. Dutch National Research Agenda (NWA) An investment programme in innovative and socially relevant research via the 25 routes of the National Research Agenda, allowing knowledge to be developed for scientific breakthroughs and social challenges. The research programme covers all disciplines and focuses on the entire chain of fundamental, applied and practice-oriented research. An additional structural investment was announced in the Coalition Agreement for fundamental and applied research. A share of these extra funds is earmarked for the National Science Agenda: an additional 70 million euros will be available in 2018, rising to 108 million in 2019 and 130 million as of 2020. Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy co-financing with Horizon 2020 for public-private partnerships (JTI) and innovative SMEs (Eurostars) Horizon 2020 funds a number of multi-annual programmes in which Member States can participate. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy co-finances a number of those programmes that focus on top sectors and innovative SMEs. Boosting Horizon 2020 Alongside the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy coordinates Dutch participation in the European Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. The Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO) advises and trains potential participants. In order to lower the participation threshold, public knowledge institutes are given an allowance via the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) for indirect costs that are not covered. European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy co-finances EU regional structural funding programmes. The main objectives of the programmes are innovation and the low-carbon economy. Generic top sector policy In addition to generic innovation schemes, a number of instruments can be used that are aimed at the nine top sectors in the Netherlands. This concerns the following schemes: Regional and Top Sector Innovation Incentive Scheme for SMEs (MIT) This scheme provides incentives for innovative projects by SMEs across the regional borders that are consistent with the innovation agenda of the top sectors. The MIT provides a number of different instruments that entrepreneurs can apply for: n), networking activities  PPP allowance The PPP allowance is provided for private contributions for public-private partnerships for research and innovation within the Top Sectors. The TKI applies for the allowance and distributes the funds between the public-private partnerships. Large PPPs may also apply for the allowance directly. For every euro that a company pays in a private R&D contribution to a research organisation, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate adds Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    allowance must be used for R&D.  Specific energy and climate innovation schemes Finally, energy and climate innovations can also apply for specific energy and climate schemes. As specified above, these schemes will focus as much as possible on facilitating the MMIPs. This concerns the following schemes: The tender schemes for the Top Sector Energy/MMIPs (2019 and beyond) The tender schemes for the Top Sector Energy are aimed at stimulating specific issues within the programme lines of the Top Consortia for Knowledge and Innovation (TKIs). These schemes are fine-tuned and adjusted each year. From 2020 onwards, these schemes will focus on the MMIPs that fall under the electricity, industry and built-up environment sectors as well as the overarching system integration theme. Renewable Energy Scheme (HER) Funding for cost-reducing innovations that could make it cheaper to generate renewable energy in the future. Climate technologies and innovations in transport demonstration Scheme (DKTI) The objective is to challenge NGOs, companies and knowledge institutes to formulate new ideas and solutions to help speed up the transition to ultimately achieve zero emissions in transport and mobility. The scheme thus implements agreements from the Energy Agreement (2014), the Climate Agreement (as of 2019) and the Sustainable Fuel Vision, which set the long-term climate objectives for the transport and mobility sector. The subsidy ceiling and the maximum subsidy in this tender varies per project type, per category of transport mode. Energy Investment Allowance Tax deduction for investments that provide energy savings (deduction of up to max. 45% of the investment costs from the taxable profit). Environmental Investment Rebate (MIA) and the Arbitrary depreciation of environmental investments (VAMIL) Tax deduction for investments in innovative environmental investments in fields including climate, mobility, agriculture, construction and the circular economy.
