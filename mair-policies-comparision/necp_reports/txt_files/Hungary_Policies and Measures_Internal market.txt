3.4.2 provides information on PCI projects. 3.4. Dimension of the internal energy market83 Chapter 3.3 covers a number of measures improving the security of supply and strengthening the internal energy market. This section specifically addresses measures more closely related to the topic. Performance of obligations prescribed in European and Hungarian legislation, aimed at strengthening the internal energy market, is necessary to achieve the goals. In relation to ththe implementation of the Energy Union. The European Commission proposed and prescribed measures to complete the internal energy market by way of Directive (EU) 2019/94484, Regulation (EU) 2019/94385 and Regulation (EU) 2019/94186. Regulation (EU) 2017/193887 should be noted in relation to the gas market, which serves the establishment of smooth operating conditions on the European gas market.                                                       83 Policies and measures shall reflect the energy efficiency first principle. 84 Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/HU/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32019L0944). 85 Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electricity (recast) (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/HU/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32019R0943). 86 Regulation (EU) 2019/941 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector and repealing Directive 2005/89/EC (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/HU/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R0941&from=EN). 87 Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2017 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and repealing Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/hu/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32017R1938).   3.4.1. Electricity infrastructure i. Policies and measures to achieve the targeted level of interconnectivity as set out in point (d) of Article 4 Hungary surpasses the 15 % target expected by the EU by a large margin. Based on market simulation tests, however, a dual-system 400 kV connection (with one installed system) between Debrecen and Oradea is a potentially recoverable capacity increasing investment. This transmission line has been included in the network development plans prepared by MAVIR Zrt. for years as an investment proposed for implementation.  ii. Regional cooperation in this area88 During implementation of the projects, communication is continuous between the system operators, and cooperation is particularly good between operators of the Slovakian and Hungarian electricity systems (MAVIR Zrt. and SEPS89). Additional information is provided in the chapter on the security of supply (point ii. of Chapter 3.4).  iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds Point iii. of Chapter 3.4.2 provides information on PCI projects.  3.4.2. Energy transmission infrastructure i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.2, including, where applicable, specific measures to enable the delivery of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and other key infrastructure projects Electricity market  Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2013 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and repealing Decision No 1364/2006/EC and amending Regulations (EC) No 713/2009, (EC) No 714/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 (hereinafter                                                       88 Other than the PCI Regional Groups established under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013. 89     1577/2019 of 15 October 201990, the Government supported the declaration of the projects referred to in point i. of Chapter 2.4.2 as projects of common interest.  information on other electricity market projects.91 Gas market  Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 347/2013, by Government Decision No 1577/2019 of 15 October 201992, the Government supported the declaration of the projects referred to in point i. of Chapter 2.4.2 as projects of common interest.  Point ii. of Chapter 2.4.2 provides information on other gas market projects.  Measures planned for rationalising the utilisation rate of Hungarian gas pipelines: The further significant expansion of the Hungarian pipeline system is not justified; the cross-border capacities should be further expanded only to the extent necessary for allowing the diversification of purchase routes and ensuring the availability of strategic and commercial options. This, too, would only be necessary if development is implemented on a market basis. Development would increase and diversify liquidity on the Hungarian natural gas market, which benefits consumers. The main task is to make better use of and rationalise the existing infrastructure. We aim to phase out distribution pipelines with a low utilisation rate (below 10 %) from the publicly funded system by offering heating alternatives with low carbon intensity. Details are provided in point vi. of Chapter 3.2. The adaptation of the network enabling the feed-in of hydrogen is an alternative for the phasing out of distribution pipelines with a low utilisation rate and may also play a key role in meeting climate protection targets. The production of hydrogen (and synthetic gases) and its feeding into the distribution system also reduces dependency on natural gas, and offers a cheap, flexible energy storage option. We therefore aim to establish conditions and incentives necessary for supplying hydrogen and other gases of  The option of free connection generates development worth billions of forints for distributors at sector level.                                                       90 Government Decision No 1577/2019 of 15 October 2019 on measures concerning the declaration of certain investments as projects of common interest relating to the trans-European energy infrastructure.

Hungarian Official Journal. Volume 2019, issue No 167 (http://www.kozlonyok.hu/nkonline/MKPDF/hiteles/MK19167.pdf).  To ensure cost-effectiveness, the system should be reconsidered along the following lines:  Obligation of consumers without actual, constant consumption to pay a fixed fee;  Binding of free connection to actual consumption as early as the submission of the connection application, subject to financial consequences;  In relation to pipelines built to satisfy not actual consumption of gas, deadlines for the construction of each new pipeline should not be applicable. Chapter 3.3 provides additional information relating to the transit role (as a means of improved use of the infrastructure). ii. Regional cooperation in this area93 During implementation of the projects, communication is continuous between the system operators, and cooperation is particularly good between operators of the Slovakian and Hungarian electricity systems (MAVIR and SEPS). The chapter on the security of supply is also relevant in relation to this topic. (Point ii. of Chapter 3.4) iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds The following Hungarian projects received CEF funding: Electricity market -activity, in 2014 MAVIR was awarded non-reimbursable financial aid within the framework of the CEF in the amount of 139 034 EUR, with a 50 % co-financing rate, for costs incurred up to 31 September 2017. Gas market In relation to the Romanian-Hungarian (RO-HU/BRUA) project, FGSZ Zrt. has so far received financial support within the framework of the CEF94 for the following activities: In 2015, in relation to the project concerning the planning application of the Hungarian section of the RO-HU-AT natural gas transmission corridor, 1 377 000 EUR non-refundable aid was awarded within the framework of the CEF, with a 50 % co-financing rate (total estimated project cost: 2 754 000 EUR). FGSZ Zrt. eventually submitted the report closing the project  after multiple modifications  at the end of July 2018 to the INEA95.                                                       93 Other than the PCI Regional Groups established under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013. 94 Connecting Europe Facility.

In 2016, FGSZ Zrt. was awarded 922 500 EUR aid for the environmental impact assessment and environmental licensing of the Hungarian section of the RO-HU-AT natural gas corridor, with a 50 % co-financing rate (total estimated project cost: 1 845 000 EUR). Pursuant to the aid contract, FGSZ Zrt. was required to submit an interim report on activities carried out in 2017, which it submitted to the INEA in June 2018. 3.4.3. Market integration i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.3 Electricity market (i) Measures planned for ensuring the availability of flexible capacities guaranteeing safe operation and system balancing: With the substantial increase in renewable energy production, to ensure the reliability of the system it is necessary upgrade the capabilities of existing power plants, ensure the entry of new flexibility service providers to the market, and develop demand side responses. Since these services will mainly be used by system operators and distributors, they are expected to develop incentive schemes ensuring a growing offer of such capacities. Flexibility is also relevant for and is therefore also discussed in relation to the security of supply. Flexibility measures are summarised in point i. of Chapter 3.3. (ii) Facilitating and supporting the establishment of independent aggregators: It is essential to create a legal framework supporting the establishment of independent aggregators. It is also necessary to encourage the introduction of simple or combined services/final customer fees on the market, which may result in products based on the consumption flexibility of smaller consumers. These products can be introduced on the market of system level services and on local flexibility markets operated by distributors, with the aim of voltage and congestion regulation. To this end it is necessary to define the (distribution and transmission) roles of aggregators and licensed grid operators, and their cooperation. Additional information on energy communities is provided in Chapter 3.1.2. (iii) Measures aimed at preparing the electricity grid for the growing spread of decentralised capacities: This is also a relevant topic in relation to the security of supply. The proposed measures are described in point i. of Chapter 3.3. (iv) Market coupling: Beyond the increase of cross-border capacities, it is also necessary to increase market coupling and to improve the efficiency of operating interconnected markets. To this end, it is also necessary to further enhance the coupling of both intra-day and day-ahead markets on the electricity market, and to efficiently operate these markets.   Day-ahead market coupling96 - NTC-based interim coupling project The project aimed at the interconnection of the 4M MC and MRC (Multi-Regional Coupling) regions through the HU-AT, CZ-AT, CZ-DE, DE-PL, PL-CZ and PL-SK borders, based on an NTC based capacity calculation methodology, was launched at the end of December 2018 with the approval of the national regulatory authorities concerned. The project would provide a temporary solution before implementation of the Core FB MC, based on the current NTC based capacity calculation methodology and allocation. The target set by the CACM Regulation97  implementation of day-ahead market coupling  could thereby be met earlier, and implicit capacity allocation could be applied at these borders before introduction of flow based capacity calculation in the Core region, resulting in the more efficient allocation of cross-border capacities and a higher level of social well-being. The live launch is expected at the end of the third quarter of 2020. - Core Flow-Based Market Coupling Project (Core FB MC project) Pursuant to the CACM Regulation, the TSOs and NEMOs are jointly responsible for establishing single day-ahead coupling (SDAC) in the territory of the European Union. After approval of the Market Coupling Operator (MCO) Plan by regulatory authorities (the HEA in Hungary), the PCR solution was also officially declared to be the basis for the joint day-ahead market coupling operator function. The day-ahead target model is currently implemented within the framework of the Core Flow Based Market Coupling Project (Core FB MC). The project was set up for implementing flow based capacity calculation and allocation based on the target model, with the joint involvement of Core NEMOs and Core TSOs. The prerequisite for implementing the project is implementation of the day-ahead core capacity calculation methodology (Core CCM). The current target date for launching the live environment is May-September 2021.  Intraday markets A key task in the coming period will be to also strengthen market integration on the intraday and balancing markets. Significant progress is expected in both areas. Hungary joined the XBID98 (Cross-Border Intraday Market Project) in November 2019; during the next two years European platforms enabling the                                                       96 See also Chapter 4.5.3 in relation to the current situation. 97 Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 of 24 July 2015 establishing a guideline on capacity allocation and congestion management (Text with EEA relevance). 98 The XBID project serves implementation of the single intraday market coupling (SIDC) target model referred to in Article 2(27) of the CACM Regulation with participating European States. The target date for the live launch of the XBID is 19 November 2019.  purchase of balancing energy will also be established. To ensure the financial sustainability of development, renewable electricity generation should be concentrated on the wholesale market to the extent possible. We support that the system operator also be able to enter into international agreements enabling the joint purchase and allocation of balancing capacities. The establishment of the EU institutional framework for these processes is under way; the Hungarian system operator has the additional task of developing options for the effective sharing of resources and short-term trade in the Balkan region as well.  Pricing of balancing energy and integration of balancing platforms (balancing markets) Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) products and specific balancing products shall be based on marginal pricing (pay-as-cleared) unless all regulatory authorities approve an alternative pricing method on the basis of a joint proposal by all transmission system operators following an analysis demonstrating that alternative pricing method is more joining of the balancing platforms, which is expected in mid-2022. There are, however, no legal barriers to the earlier introduction of marginal pricing. Upon request by the MIT, the system operator is assessing the effects of introduction, which may result in the earlier implementation of the provision. The other element of scarcity pricing, the abolition of price limits on the balancing markets  which leads to changes only on the Hungarian mFRR99 market, considering that price limits have already been abolished on the aFRR100 market  is prescribed under Article 10(1) of the Regulation by 1 January 2020. The HEA launched an SMP investigation101 of mFRR market concentration. In Decision No 2606/2019, the HEA required MAVIR Zrt. to apply positive mFRR balancing energy price caps from 1 January 2020, and to draw up and introduce from 1 January 2022 a procedural methodology ensuring identification of essential suppliers. Integration of balancing markets  balancing platforms: - IGCC (International Grid Control Cooperation) The IGCC is an early implementation project concerning the European platform for the EB GL imbalance netting process, which aims to fulfil EB GL requirements as soon as possible. Hungary is currently an observer of the IGCC project; its joining as a full member is in progress. The methodology is expected to be finalised in the first quarter of 2020. The implementation deadline is the first quarter of 2021. - PICASSO (Platform for the International Coordination of Automated Frequency Restoration and Stable System Operation)                                                       99 Manual Frequency Restoration Reserve. 100 Automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve. 101 Investigation of substantial market power.  MAVIR Zrt. joined the project on 12 January 2018. The PICASSO project was initiated by 8 TSOs of five countries, which aims to plan and further develop operating platforms that collect the tenders of all stakeholder TSOs and enables the optimal allocation of market products (energy balancing from automatic frequency restoration reserve, energy balancing with aFRR) to ensure adequate satisfaction of participating TSO needs. The methodology will be finalised and approved by ACER by the deadline in January 2020. The implementation deadline is the third quarter of 2022. - MARI (Manually Activated Reserves Initiative) Hungary is currently a full member of the MARI project. MARI is an early implementation project concerning the European platform for exchanging balancing energy from EB GL manually activated frequency restoration reserves, which aims to fulfil EB GL requirements as soon as possible. The methodology will be finalised and of 2022. - TERRE (Trans-European Replacement Reserves Exchange) TERRE is an early implementation project concerning the European platform for exchanging balancing energy from EB GL replacement reserves, which aims to fulfil EB GL requirements as soon as possible. The methodology has been approved. A live environment is expected in the first quarter of 2020. MAVIR ZRt. is an observer in the project and is currently not planning to join. (v) Measures planned for increasing cross-border capacities  see Chapter 3.3 and Chapter 3.4.2. (vi) Encouragement of the market launch of innovative energy supply solutions Point i. of Chapter 3.5 provides information on the topic.  ii. Measures to increase the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production, e.g. smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, real-time price signals, including the roll-out of intraday market coupling and cross-border balancing markets In relation to real-time price signals it is necessary to adjust market gate closure times to real-time trading. In relation to the other topics, the answer is provided under point i. and in Chapter 3.3. Gas market To strengthen integration on the gas market consultations are under way between Hungary and Croatia of cross-border tariffs. Negotiations on market integration  which may also contribute to the improved use of Hungarian storage capacities  commenced in July 2019.   The promotion of gas market integration in the region is our strategic goal going beyond the LNG project; a market free of cross-border tariffs, operating with single wholesale price signals can lead to more effective competition, lower prices and greater security of supply. We are therefore also exploring market coupling options with Slovakia, Slovenia, Austria and Romania. In parallel with the promotion of market integration, we also aim to further strengthen the liquidity and regional price signalling function of CEEGEX, the Hungarian gas exchange.  Sector coupling Market integration is understood not only within a regional context, but it also covers, inter alia, coordination of the operation of gas and electricity markets. The two markets are connected at a number of points, most obviously in relation to gas-fired power plants. Institution-building measures are important in uture, however, sector coupling may also extend to new areas, such as the replacement of gas based heating and cooling with electricity based on renewable energy sources and heat pumps in regions with infrastructures with a low utilisation rate or which are not connected to the gas network. Use of the natural gas network for energy storage purposes offers a new, innovative alternative, which, inter alia, can facilitate integration of electricity generation from weather-dependent renewable resources through hydrogen or methane, and its feeding into the gas network. iii. Where applicable, measures to ensure the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including, inter alia, via aggregation, on all energy markets prevent the network connection of renewable producers, transparency and economic efficiency should be improved in allocating network connection capacities. To this end, non-discriminatory capacity auctions could be held, for example, on a regular basis.  Mandatory participation of producers with a connection capacity of more than 0.4 MW should be prescribed in voltage regulation.  Instead of the mandatory participation of renewable electricity generation in the FIS balance group managed by the system operator as balance responsible party, encouragement of joining a market balance group, with maintained aid conditions, to promote market integration. Since renewables producers must contribute more to the reliable operation of the system in the future, we will establish the technical and regulatory conditions ensuring the downward regulation of renewables. iv. Policies and measures to protect consumers, especially vulnerable and, where applicable,  energy poor consumers, and to improve the competitiveness and contestability of the retail energy market Encouraging more active consumer involvement can contribute to enhancing the level of protection for consumers. A fundamental prerequisite for active consumer participation on the market is the regulation of consumption in cases where this is not yet possible. It is necessary to significantly expand use of smart meters in the electricity and natural gas sectors. The establishment of  aims to positively encourage distributors to introduce new products and innovative technologies, and to expand options of suppliers for prioritising digital administration. (Further details are provided in point 5.iii. of Chapter 3.3.) The key technological task is the introduction of smart metering equipment that are also capable of managing time zone dependent tariffs. Installation of a large number of smart metering equipment also comprises part of the programme aimed at establishing innovative system balancing, therefore options for their domestic manufacture should also be considered. v. Description of measures to enable and develop demand response, including those addressing tariffs to support dynamic pricing102 In relation to this topic the answer provided under point i. of this chapter and point i. of Chapter 3.3 are relevant. 3.4.4. Energy poverty i. Where applicable, policies and measures to achieve the objectives set out in point 2.4.4 The Government of Hungary is firmly committed to maintain sustainable overhead costs for Hungarian households in the future, while also ensuring the earning power of energy companies. The simultaneous fulfilment of the two objectives demands a complex strategy that extends to energy efficiency, an increase in optimisation of supply methods. Strengthening competition on the domestic and regional commodity markets, the improved cost-effectiveness of grid operation and development - e.g. based on smart equipment and the elimination of duplication - and the promotion of digital solutions in serving consumers may offset the impact of a possible rise in international energy prices. In the course of the planned reform of eligibility for universal service and the development of various service packages we will ensure that the energy fees of the most deprived persons do not increase. We are drawing up a programme to improve conditions for vulnerable customers. As part of this process we plan to assess the conditions of vulnerable customers and to draft targeted programmes adjusted to the                                                       102 In accordance with Article 15(8) of Directive 2012/27/EU.  needs of the social groups concerned. When planning the energy efficiency obligation scheme, it should support vulnerable consumers. (Points 3.1.2.iii. and 3.2.viiii. provide details on the most expedient financing instruments aimed at supporting the most deprived social groups (upgrades implemented under the obligation scheme, increased use of decentralised heating solutions and electricity production penetration).) We plan to extend the subscription based electricity connection scheme for households living in buildings that are deteriorated or unsuitable for renovation, which ensures the electric heating of at least one room for families with small children. We are also planning future awareness raising, information and consulting campaigns. These can also promote low-cost energy efficiency investments that can be implemented by home owners themselves, resulting in substant-of-the-  3.5. Dimension of research, innovation and competitiveness i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.5. The Energy Innovation Council (EIC) set up by the Minister for Innovation and Technology in October 2018 has defined possibilities of intervention in the following areas: 1. Innovative system balancing (flexibility storage and demand management, active system operation by distributors); 2. Encouragement of the market launch of innovative energy supply solutions; 3. Energy efficiency innovation programme; 4. Facilitation of the use of Hungarian natural gas reserves; 5. stributors and suppliers in innovation; 6. Transport greening; 7. Encouraging use of renewable energy sources; 8. Support of nuclear innovation; 9. Encouraging innovative seasonal electricity and heat storage solutions. To ensure the system balance we are planning to encourage the spread of innovative technologies and operating modes that support improvement of the dispatchability of the electricity system by also minimising the necessity of network development investments and allow the integration of decentralised energy production based on renewable energy sources to the extent possible. The proposed programme focusses on insulation’.
