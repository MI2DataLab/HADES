3.3 DIMENSION ENERGY SECURITY  Policies and measures related to elements set out in 2.3  Melita TransGas Pipeline Malta is working actively on the development and implementation of the Melita TransGas Pipeline Delimara (Malta) to Gela (Italy), that would end its isolation by connecting the island to the trans-European Natural Gas Network. This would allow the transportation of gas from the tion and provide the basis for the development of an inland gas distribution market.  MTGP Project has been selected as a Project of Common Interest (PCI 5.19) under the priority corridor econd and third PCI lists. It poses a means to fulfil EU strategic energy policy goals on energy solidarity between Member States, the formation of an Internal Energy Market, diversification of sources, reduced dependency on a single  90  supply source and improved energy security. Indeed, the conclusions of the European Council of isolated from the European gas and electricity networks after 2015 or see its energy security implementation. succeed the obligations of the Ministry for Energy and Water Management (as the previous Project Promoter of PCI 5.19) for the implementation, construction and commissioning of the MTGP. The company would also be entrusted with the operation of the transmission infrastructure and has taken the role of the prospective Transmission System Operator.  The Maltese Government fully supports the implementation of the MTGP, including it in all the plans and programmes aiming to ensure diversification of gas supply sources and increase security of supply by connecting Malta to European gas networks. As portrayed in Figure 103, the peak demand and electricity generation demand are projected to continue to increase.  Whilst the Electricity Supply Study is expected to present optimal solutions to meet the expected growth in electricity demand, the range of solutions are limited within the context of the present configuration:   The LNG facility at Delimara (tender issued in 2013) was sized in such a way as to ensure that together with the installed power generation, interconnection capacity and projected growth in PV installations, the electricity system would be able to meet peak load and demand whilst ensuring the desired level of system adequacy.  However, the latest national electricity demand projections, developed for the purpose of this NECP, indicate a much steeper growth in demand (peak demand reached 510MW in 201964), which is expected to be sustained in the short to medium term. This requires urgent solutions, to be in place to maintain the present level of security of supply. The size and operational limitations of the LNG facility impinge on the range of possible options;     The present LNG facility also has inherent limitations such as the inability to provide natural gas to the power plants during specific (bad) weather conditions, which could lead to a situation where supply to consumers would need to be curtailed should this occur during periods of high demand;   The main purpose of the LNG facility was to enable the country to switch from heavy fuel oil to natural gas in the shortest possible time, but was always intended as a short term solution in view of the pipeline project.  This is also reflected in contractual arrangements between Enemalta and the suppliers of LNG which provides for a gas-exit clause after 10 years of operation to coincide with the projected commissioning of the pipeline;   The LNG facility is designed to service exclusively the power sector. The LNG supplier and operator of the LNG facility is not allowed to supply other clients with gas in view of its                                                            64 https://www.enemalta.com.mt/news/high-electricity-demand-registered/  91  obligations under the assigned SGEI (to ensure the desired level of security of supply) and  Commission Decision SA.45779. This restricts the development of an inland market for natural gas.   It is expected that the commissioning of a natural gas pipeline, which would be subject to the rules of 3rd Energy package, would provide a good basis for the development of an internal market for natural gas.   The Government of Malta therefore considers the pipeline as an essential element for the development of its electricity system necessary to provide the desired flexibility, reliability and level of security of supply with regards to future solutions which are deemed critical to meet additional demand.    Moreover, in view of the climate change policies at the EU level, the implementation of the pipeline will eliminate the GHG emissions from the current liquefaction, shipping and regasification activities necessary for the LNG supply.   its economy and will ensure that at the design stage features are included which do not preclude its use to carry green fuels such as biogas and hydrogen should the distribution of these products over the European gas grid becomes mainstream in the future. Such a development would greatly effective RES resources and clear trend towards electrification.     The project envisages a gas pipeline interconnection between Gela (Sicily-Italy) and Delimara (Malta) currently designed as a 22 inches (560mm) diameter, 159km length and with a bi-directional flow capacity of 2 Bcm/y at standard conditions.   MTGP has been repeatedly included in the national Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP) of the Italian TSO (SNAM Rete Gas) confirming that it facilitate the connection to the national network, when the progress of the project will prefigure an   At European level, MTGP (ENTSOG Project Code: TRA-N-031) has constantly been submitted and included in the Union-wide TYNDP of 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2018 elaborated by ENTSOG pursuant to the Regulation (EC) No 715/2009.   MTGP has already benefitted from the co-financing of studies through the TEN-E and Connecting preparatory studies, including those completed and the ones to be conducted in the next stages of the project implementation up to the end of 2020:    the Pre-feasibility study and Cost-Benefit Analysis, completed in April 2015, determined that the project is feasible and identified the most economical project technical configuration;    92   the Basic Design study completed in June 2017 identified the optimal 1.2km wide offshore route corridor, landfall areas, on-shore routes, connection points and sites and areas of the terminal stations in both Delimara (Malta) and Gela (Sicily), and enabled the start of the permitting procedures in both Malta and Italy;    in 2018 activities related to the environmental studies, a preliminary marine route survey and the front-end engineering design were commenced.    a cross-border cost allocation decision was issued jointly by the Maltese and Italian National Regulatory Authorities on the 4th of June 2019 which states that Malta should bear 100% of the costs of the MTGP project and as such, no monetary transfer is needed between Italy and Malta.   The project promotor is seeking financing avenues including the possibility of bringing onboard a strategic partner.  A Final Investment Decision, is expected to be taken by the end of 2020.   This will be followed by the publishing and award of an engineering,  procurement and construction (EPC) contract. Table 7 provides an overview of the preliminary project implementation plan.

Its aim is to strengthen and secure the functioning and resilience Unit is to direct and advise owners and operators of critical infrastructure regarding necessary internal systems to identify vulnerabilities and risks, and the planning for contingencies. It ensures that the necessary risk assessments are carried out, and contingency plans are in place and reviewed on an ongoing basis.  It also coordinates and supports general emergency preparedness plans for response to national emergencies, including coordination with other European Member States and the  93  European Commission. LN 434/2011 identified energy as a key critical infrastructure (CI), and specified the following subsectors: electricity, oil and gas. Each designated critical and emergency organisation is required to identify Security Liaison Officers (SLOs) and Emergency Liaison Officers (ELOs), which act as the points of contact for security related issues between the owner or operator of the critical CI possesses an Operator Security Plan (OSP) and has in place equivalent security, technical, communication and organisational measures.  Under LN 434/2011, every owner or operator of a designated critical infrastructure is required to draw up and maintain an Operator Security Plan (OSP). In this regard, Enemalta has developed an OSP for the generation sector and for the distribution sector, with the overall goal of ensuring a reliable supply of energy, identifying measures to ensure the protection of critical assets/systems and ensuring safety measures are in place, and drawing up contingency plans for restoration and recovery times in the case of loss of assets/systems.  Cyber-security in the energy sector Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union is transposed into national legislation through the Measures for High Common Level of Security of Network and Information Systems Order65 (Legal Notice 216 of 2018). The order establishes the Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Unit (CIIP unit) within the Critical Infrastructure Protection Directorate, responsible for monitoring the application of the Order, which includes the establishment of criteria for the identification and designation of essential services within Malta as well as identifying the designated operators of essential services in Malta. The CIIP unit is also tasked with encouraging the use of European or internationally accepted standards and specifications relevant to the security of network and information systems. Electricity, oil and gas undertakings are included as operators of essential services in the energy sector.  The requirements and tasks of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) within designated operators are also spelled out in the legislation. CSIRTMalta, the national CSRIT Unit within the CIIP Unit, supports critical infrastructures (CIs), Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs) and other sensitive infrastructures in Malta on how to protect their information infrastructure assets and systems from cyber threats and incidents. CSIRTMalta also promotes the sharing of unclassified information which is useful against cyber-attacks and provides alerts and warnings to its constituents and internal autonomous CSIRTs.  A number of measures are currently being prepared by the Critical Infrastructure Protection Directorate to enhance the cyber security across multiple sectors, including energy. This includes the following:  (i) Identified Operators of Essential Services are encouraged to establish their own Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) under the local transposition of the NIS Directive (L.N. 216 of 2018).                                                               65 Measures for High Common Level of Security of Network and Information Systems Order (Legal Notice 216 of 2018):http://justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lp&itemid=29161&l=1    94  (ii) CSIRTs within Operators of Essential Services (OES) are encouraged to take part in CSIRTMalta constituent program and uptake a number of recommended measures such as access to the Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) and take part in regular training workshops. (iii) CSIRTMalta managed to successfully apply to an EU funds program and acquired 1.2 million EUR in funds to assist OES's CSIRTs in purchasing equipment and necessary training such as MISP training and TAP devices.    Cyber-security risks were also considered within the existing contingency planning, such as the Risk Assessment and Preventive Action Plan and Emergency Plan under the Gas Security of Supply Regulation. The Critical Infrastructure Protection Directorate (CIPD) was consulted during the development of these plans to ensure that gas facilities are classified with respect to designated essential services, that the appropriate cyber-security measures are in place which enable the manual override of electricity and gas facilities in the event of a cyber-attack.  Gas Security of Supply The Security of Gas Supply Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2017 requests the competent authority of each Member State to carry out multiple tasks, which includes the development of a gas security of supply national Risk Assessment, a Preventive Action Plan and an Emergency Plan. The Ministry for Energy and Water Management, as the designated Competent Authority for Malta, delegated these tasks to the Energy & Water Agency. In line with Annex I of the same regulation, Malta forms part of four risk groups, which are also required to prepare a Risk Assessment and the regional chapters for the preventive and emergency action plans:  North African gas supply risk groups:  Algeria: Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Malta, Austria, Portugal and Slovenia  Libya: Croatia, Italy, Malta, Austria and Slovenia  South-East gas supply risk groups:  Southern Gas Corridor  Caspian: Bulgaria, Greece, Croatia, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Austria, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia  Eastern Mediterranean: Greece, Italy, Cyprus and Malta Article 20 (2) of the Regulation states that, for the time being, the obligations related to the work of the South-East gas supply risk groups shall remain on hold and start only from the date when the major infrastructure/pipeline enters the test operation. On the other hand, the Libyan and Algerian risk groups have completed the common risk assessment and the relevant document has already been submitted to the Commission.  National Risk Assessment in line with Article 7(3) of the Regulation was completed and submitted to the European Commission in December 2018. The Risk Assessment considered the loss of the gas facility at Delimara on a day of peak demand with a likelihood of occurring once in 20 years. As the only use of natural gas in Malta is for electricity generation, the Risk Assessment considered how the loss of the LNG facility would impact the supply of electricity. Since meeting electricity demand is more sensitive to within-day peaks as considered within-day peak periods. The Risk Assessment identified that should the single largest  95  piece of gas infrastructure be lost, Malta would be unable to meet all gas demand should this coincide with an exceptionally high energy demand day. The -demand can be met by relying on all other sources of electricity, such as gas-oil-fired generation units, the electricity interconnector and indigenous PV generation. However, the Risk Assessment also demonstrated that whilst solar PV contributes in aggregate and in daylight hours, peak electricity demand in afternoons and evenings cannot be completely met without gas for electricity production. The Risk Assessment also highlighted the strategic national importance of the Delimara site and the need to ensure its security and resilience against natural hazards and man-made threats. Multiple risk scenarios were identified and adapted to gas security of supply.  Article 8(2) of the Regulation requires that Member States develop a Preventive Action Plan containing the measures needed to remove and mitigate the risks identified in the Risk Assessment and an Emergency Plan outlining the measures to be taken to remove or mitigate the impact of a disruption of gas supply.  The Preventive Plan established a list of preventive measures in place, or to be adopted, to address the risks tied to a disruption of gas supply, as well as the measures and obligations of relevant stakeholders which contribute to the prevention of a gas disruption of supply. The list of preventive measures includes physical security arrangements, periodic technical and engineering inspections and monitoring, national security measures, legal, statutory and operational obligations, as well as measures promoting the use of RES, energy efficiency measures, measures promoting the diversification of sources of energy supply, as well as measures available at regional level identified within the relevant Risk Groups. Malta does not have household gas customers, SMEs or essential services that are connected to a gas distribution network or gas district heating network. Nevertheless, customers are vulnerable if the supply of gas is restricted or stopped through the reduced availability of electricity. To minimise the impact from a gas supply disruption, Malta will maintain a formalized procedure for prioritising electricity supply to these groups of vulnerable customers.  The Emergency Plan defined three main crisis levels related to a disruption of gas supply: early warning, alert and emergency, and outlined the roles and responsibilities of specific actors, such as the competent authority (MEW), natural gas undertakings, the electricity distribution system operator, the national regulatory authority, the Civil Protection Department and other stakeholders per each crisis level. The Plan also identified the measures and actions to be taken to mitigate the impact of a disruption of gas supply on the electricity sector and the mechanisms and provisions in place to ensure the appropriate coordination and exchange of information between the main actors in the gas and electricity sectors. Apart from the escalation process, going from one crisis level all the way to an emergency situation, the Plan also outlines the measures and responsibilities for the process of de-escalating an emergency situation back to business-as-usual.  The Preventive Plan and Emergency Plan are being submitted to the European Commission by the end of 2019 and will be made public thereafter. The risk assessment, preventive action plan and emergency plans shall also be updated every four years. This periodic reporting cycle allows Member States to assess the risks leading to a potential gas supply disruption and identify the necessary preventive measures and emergency measures on a regular basis. The Melita Trans Gas Pipeline would implementation of new preventive and emergency measures. This would be reflected in future  96  updates of the plans under the Gas Security of Supply Regulation should the pipeline come into operation.  Risk Preparedness in the Electricity Sector Enemalta plc, as the designated Distribution System Operator in Malta is responsible for ensuring the security of electricity supply within the Maltese Islands. In this sense, the Competent Authority and Enemalta, are obliged to comply with Regulation (EU) 2019/941 on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector repealing Directive 2005/89/EC. The Regulation sets out a common framework of rules on how to prevent, prepare for and manage electricity crises whilst ensuring that measures are taken in a coordinated and effective manner, including solidarity measures between Member States. As per the Regulation, Member States are required to ensure that all relevant risks relating to the security of electricity supply are assessed, identify electricity crisis scenarios and subsequently establish Risk-Preparedness Plans, which consist of national and regional measures to prevent, prepare for and mitigate electricity crisis. This Risk-Preparedness Plan will be developed in line with the Regulation.  Taking cognizance of the obligations arising out of the now repealed Directive 2005/89/EC, Enemalta conducted a risk assessment in the second half of 2018. This covered the assets and systems pertaining to power generation and power distribution, together with all the legal obligations imposed on Enemalta in relation to its role in power generation and distribution.  The assessment focused on national risks such as marine oil spills, pandemics, earthquakes, major mass casualty incidents, terrorist attacks, irregular migration, drought, flood, severe weather, release of major hazardous materials, cyber-attacks, and others. In addition, it took into consideration risks identified in the ; this included risks arising from incidents occurring to sites, major damages to plants, etc. The assessment was built on a number of safety reports which have been conducted by Enemalta in this regard in the past.  A specific risk assessment was also conducted in relation to the security of electricity supply, identifying crisis scenarios in relation to system adequacy, system security and fuel security on the basis of the following risks:   Rare and extreme national hazards;   Accidental hazards which lead to a breach of the N-1 security criterion; and   Consequential hazards including consequences of malicious attacks and of fuel shortages.  The risk assessment ran multiple crisis scenarios to develop an understanding of the interaction and correlation of risks at national level between different assets, and the interaction and correlation of risks across the border from Sicily in relation to the interconnector. Also, simultaneous crisis scenarios were simulated.   Oil Supply Disruption Emergency Plan EU Directive 2009/119/EC amended by Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2018/1581, which requires Member States to maintain minimum stocks of crude oil and petroleum products, was  97  transposed into national law through Legal Notice 109 of 2013 and amended by Legal Notice 156 of 2019. Regulation 18(2) of this legal notice requires the REWS to develop contingency plans that would be implemented in the event of a major supply disruption. In this regard, REWS prepared the Oil Supply Disruption Emergency plan, to be activated in the event of difficulties arising in the supply of crude oil and petroleum products. This is in the process of being finalised. The document outlines the strategic approach to be taken in the management of an oil supply disruption emergency in Malta. The Plan ensures that, as far as possible, the institutions, information, hardware and infrastructure are available, ready, and coordinated to perform efficiently and expeditiously in any emergency involving oil supply, while allowing a certain freedom and flexibility to respond effectively to any circumstances as they arise. It also highlights the arrangements to be established between the oil industry, the REWS and the European Commission for the safe and effective management of oil supply emergencies. The scope of the original plan does not cover natural gas.  Under the Contingency Plan, an Oil Supply Disruption Task Force may be appointed on an ad hoc basis, depending on the disruption/interruption event that arises. The Task Force would be made up of high officials representing the Ministries responsible for energy and for finance, the Regulator for Energy and Water Services, and oil suppliers and importers, under the Chairmanship of the Minister for Energy and Water Management. The Task Force would be in a position to collaborate with high fuel consumers potentially affected by an oil supply disruption. If the emergency is the consequence of a natural disaster, the Oil Supply Disruption Task Force would work closely with the Civil Protection Department, which has the overall responsibility for emergency response to such events. The Task Force would also advise the Minister on what measures, proportionate to the situation, to take, monitor, analyse and report to the Minister on the situation and events, during activation of the contingency plan. Finally, when the shortage is declared over, the Task Force is required to take stock of lessons that could be learnt and update the Plan where required. Emergency stock holding obligations In Malta, the national emergency stock holding obligation is delegated to fuel importers and calculated on the gross inland consumption attributed to each importer. The national emergency stock holding obligation on aviation kerosene (Jet A1) constitutes an exception whereby the emergency stock is held by the Regulator on behalf of the Government. The emergency stock holding obligation must be met through emergency stock holding tickets in Malta or any other EU country, except in those cases where the importer has a legal title to storage (ownership or lease) and may claim emergency stocks held as physical stocks. The composition and location of the security stock holdings may vary. For instance, during the first and second quarters of 2017, approximately 92% of the total amount of emergency stocks was in the form of tickets located abroad, with the balance being held locally as either physical stock or tickets. In contrast, during the third and fourth quarters of 2017, 51% of the emergency stocks were located in Malta while 49% were held as tickets abroad.  Petroleum Exploration Activities Malta has no indigenous energy sources that would provide a secure energy supply for the immediate future and is dependent on imported fuels and electricity to meet its national demand. Domestic  98  extraction of natural gas would enhance diversification of primary sources of energy, and exploitation of crude oil would reduce  dependence on foreign sources for this commodity, although a reliance on foreign refinery capacity would likely remain. In this regard, the Government will continue to promote petroleum exploration opportunities, seeking to attract more investment in this sector, and thus intensify offshore exploration around Malta. Where disputed boundaries exist, the Government will continue to negotiate with neighbouring countries to arrive at mutually acceptable solutions that would enable oil exploration to take place. Although exploration for petroleum has been ongoing since 1954 when the first onshore exploration licence was granted, no commercial discovery has yet been made. However, the level of interest shown by oil companies in Malta attests to the potential of its petroleum geology. Indeed, Malta's central location in the Mediterranean and its proximity to proven petroleum systems with producing exploration. Most of the past exploration activity has been focused offshore in an area of over 75,000 km2 subdivided into areas and blocks, most of which are open to the oil industry for exploration.  So far, 13 exploration wells have been drilled, two of them onshore. Such exploration activity has identified good, drillable prospects in the sedimentary basins offshore Malta, analogous to existing producing fields in the Central Mediterranean. Most of these prospects are yet untested, making the possibility of a commercial discovery reasonably good. Under national legislation, subsoil natural petroleum resources belong to the Government. According to the Petroleum (Production) Act (Cap. 156), the Government has the right to issue licences to companies to explore and produce petroleum. Two licences are available under the Petroleum (Production) Regulations (S.L. 156.01): (i) an exploration licence which gives rights to suitably qualified oil companies to execute a technical work programme, including the acquisition of geophysical data but with no rights to produce petroleum; and (ii) an exploration and production licence which gives rights to oil companies to drill exploration wells and, in case of a commercial discovery, to produce such petroleum. Exploration and production of petroleum in Malta enjoys a favourable legal regime. Under current legislation, the administrative process of granting exploration and production licences is short and of a duration compatible with the decision-making process of oil and gas companies.  Although the Government will continue to promote petroleum exploration opportunities, these should not be seen in contradiction to the long-term decarbonisation goals of the Union and its Member States, which are at the forefront of the Energy Union Governance framework and the NECP. ble and effective indigenous renewable energy sources, whilst already having moved to a more sustainable energy mix based on natural gas and the electricity interconnector. The role of gas-based generation will be important to sustain energy demand in the medium-term on the road to decarbonisation of the energy system in the long-term.  Energy Storage solutions The Government is closely monitoring the development of the energy storage market considered essential for further deployment of photovoltaic capacity and for optimization of the power system by providing for demand management and peak demand shaving. This may postpone the requirement for new power generation facilities. In this regard, the Government will be assessing cost-effective,  99  technically viable options to increase the desired level of security of supply and further integration of low carbon technologies.  Malta is also limited. For instance, the predominant large-scale energy storage solutions, such as pumped-storage hydropower are not available in the Maltese context. As per projections under the  is expected to increase from 112 MW in 2017 to 266 MW by 2030.  Policies and measures to promote the deployment of renewable sources of energy, including solar PV generation, are described in more detail under the Decarbonisation dimension. Demand Management Demand side management is currently limited to differentiated night and day tariffs for non-residential consumers with an annual consumption of 5 GWh or more. There is only one supplier of electricity in Malta and therefore the onus to meet the energy demand, including peak demand is on Enemalta plc. as the DSO.  Enemalta maintains a gasoil-powered back-up generation plant having a total nominal capacity of 180 MW which is used in case of an emergency and which provides black start capability.   Regional cooperation  The role of the CIP Unit, in charge of coordinating and supporting general emergency preparedness plans under Legal Notice 434/2011 on the identification and protection of critical infrastructures, includes collaboration with other European Member States and the European Commission.  Malta also cooperates with other European Member States on national emergency stock holdings. In 2017, emergency stocks for Malta in the form of tickets were located in the Netherlands, Spain, Ireland Sweden, Finland, Italy, Slovenia and Belgium in 2017. During this year, Malta held emergency stocks as tickets for the United Kingdom, Sweden and Cyprus. These arrangements are approved by the competent authorities of the Member States, in the case of Malta by REWS.  Regional cooperation is expected to be most prevalent with respect to the implementation of the MTGP pipeline. The execution of the technical and environmental studies for the development of the PCI are being conducted in close consultation with the Italian TSO, PCI one-stop shop (MISE) and Central Government Authorities (MATTM), the Sicilian Regional Authorities including the Gela Council, as well as the concerned Sicilian stakeholders. Such continuous cooperation will ensure that any critical issues raised at this early stage of the project, especially in relation to the permitting process, will be considered in the planning and design stages. Public consultations in Marsaxlokk (Malta), Rome, Palermo & Gela were also held in April 2018 for this purpose. A second public consultation will be held during the statutory procedure of the permitting process. As regards the permitting process, inter-ministerial discussions with the Ministry of Economic Italy, which has been designated as the the PCI permit process in Italy, commenced in May 2014 through a high-level meeting held in Rome between the Maltese Government and MISE, with representation from Snam Rete Gas, the Italian Regulatory Authority, the Maltese Regulatory Authority and presided by the  100  Maltese Ambassador for Italy. Following this initial meeting, a number of follow-up meetings were held during the past two years with various authorities and stakeholders. In May 2017, a letter of intent was also signed between Government of Malta and the Sicily Region formalising the intention of both parties for collaboration in terms of permit granting. Regional cooperation is also an important element under the Security of Gas Supply Regulation. As mentioned above, Malta forms part of the active Libyan and Algerian Risk Groups. The Common Risk Assessments for Algeria and Libya confirmed that Malta is not at significant risk from disruption to gas supply from either country. The only source of natural gas in Malta is imported LNG. To date, LNG used in Malta has not been sourced from Algeria or Libya. The Regional N-1 analysis demonstrated that the technical capacity of remaining gas infrastructure within these Risk Groups is adequate to meet maximum gas demand in the event of a disruption to the single largest piece of infrastructure. The Regional chapters of the Preventive Plan and the Emergency Plan also identify various mechanisms developed for cooperation between Member States, such as the exchange of relevant information between Competent Authorities, risk groups, and the Gas Coordination Group organized by the European Commission.  Should the MTGP pipeline become operational, the risk to Malta in the context of these risk groups will change and the risk to gas security of supply will be reassessed accordingly. The gas pipeline would also open up a new range of regional measures and cooperation mechanisms for the prevention and mitigation of a disruption of gas supply, including solidarity arrangements between neighbouring and interconnected Member States and interconnection agreements between adjacent TSOs.  Under the new Risk-Preparedness Regulation in the electricity sector, Member States are required to act and cooperate in a spirit of solidarity in order to prevent or manage electricity crises. Regional and bilateral measures have to be agreed upon by Member States for the purpose of protecting public safety and personal security and outlined in their Risk- national Risk-Preparedness Plan will be developed in the coming future and will take into account solidarity mechanisms, in particular through the electricity interconnector with Italy.    [If applicable] Financing measures in this area at national level, including EU support and use of EU funds As explained in previous sections, EU funds are being sought to develop the Malta-Italy gas pipeline. Funding was also sought to carry out a Technical study and CBA for LNG as marine fuel in Malta. Future development of storage infrastructure may also seek EU funding to ensure the realization of projects, which whilst providing significant economic benefits, would otherwise turn out to be financially not viable. Apart from funding mechanisms falling under the Multiannual Financial Framework, Malta will continue to seek to tap direct EU funding opportunities.
