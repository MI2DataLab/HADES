40  2. National objectives and targets 2.1. Decarbonisation dimension 2.1.1. GHG emissions and removals 2.1.1.i. The elements set out in Article 4(a)(1)  Annually binding national limits pursuant to the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR)  The Effort Sharing Regulation stipulates that Germany must achieve a mandatory reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from non-ETS sectors of 38% by 2030 (compared to 2005). Germany will be assigned annual emission budgets on the basis of a linear emission reduction trajectory, starting with the actual average for the 2016-2018 period and ending with the final emissions goal for 2030.  Binding goal under the LULUCF Regulation (Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry)  For the first time, all EU Member States must meet a LULUCF objective defined under European law. The e land accounting categories eligible pursuant to Article 2 of the LULUCF Regulation must not exceed total credits by the end of the two stipulated 5-year periods (2021 to 2025) and (2026 to 2030).  2.1.1.ii. Where applicable, other national objectives and targets consistent with the Paris Agreement and the existing long-term strategies. Where applicable for the contribution to the overall Union commitment of reducing the GHG emissions, other objectives and targets, including sector targets and adaptation goals, if available   drop in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55% by 2030 compared to the baseline year of 1990. This must also be seen in the context of the commitment made under the Paris Agreement based on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in accordance with which the rise in average global temperatures must be kept well below 2°C and where possible 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels in order to minimise UN Climate Action Summit on 23 September 2019 in New York, to pursue the long-term goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero emissions by 2050. Germany is therefore working together with the EU Member States in order to achieve the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero emissions by 2050 in Europe. In December 2019, the heads of state and government in the EU agreed on the goal of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050. In the Meseberg Declaration of 18 May 2020, the German and French governments welcomed the 2030 to between 50% and 55% compared to 1990. France and Germany emphasise the need for a meticulous impact assessment in particular with regard to impacts on the competitiveness of the European economy and on the social system as well as with regard to a shared understanding of sector-specific contributions and corresponding measures.  Table A5: GHG reduction goal*   2030 Reduction compared to 1990 in [%] at least 55 * Goal based on the Energy Concept and the Climate Action Plan 2050  The Federal Government confirmed these goals in its Climate Action Programme 2030. The national climate goal for 2030 is also underpinned with sectoral goals. Although Germany works towards its national objectives independently, its efforts in this area also contribute to achievement of the EU goal. The Federal Government takes this to mean that Article 14(3) of the Regulation on the governance of the energy union and climate action does not apply in this respect.  2.1.2. Renewable energy 2.1.2.i. The elements set out in Article 4(a)(2)  In addition to the GHG removal targets referred to in Section 2.1.1., decarbonisation will be further promoted through an increase in the share of renewables in energy consumption. Rising carbon prices under the EU 41  emissions trading system will mean that the funding needed to cover surcharges payable under the Renewable Energy Sources Act will diminish as a result of concomitant increases in the trading price of electricity. The European Union has set itself the binding goal of increasing the share of renewables in gross final energy consumption to at least 32% by 2030. This goal will be reviewed in 2023 with a view to increasing it yet further. The Federal Government aims to achieve a 30% share of renewables in gross final energy consumption by 2030 (share in 2020: 18%). This goal was enshrined in the Energy Concept published on 28 September 2010 (Energy Concept 2010).  It is important to ensure that the goal is achieved through concurrent increases in the share of renewables in the electricity, heating and cooling, and transport sectors, since two of these sectors taken together (the heating and cooling sector and the transport sector) account for two thirds of energy consumption. The Federal Government uses a reliable, predictable trajectory as the basis for continuous growth in renewables. The indicative trajectory for the total share of renewables in gross final energy consumption follows a linear increase from 18% in 2020 to 30% in 2030. This corresponds to an annual increase of 1.2 percentage points (see Table A6).  If a Member State falls below the EU trajectory, progress made in terms of the growth of renewables will be measured (according to the Governance Regulation) against reliable reference points of 18% of 2020-2030 growth in 2022 (i.e. total share of renewables equalling 20.2%), 43% in 2025 (i.e. total share of renewables equalling 23.2%) and 65% in 2027 (i.e. total share of renewables equalling 25.8%).  Table A6: Indicative linear trajectory for growth in renewables measured against gross final energy consumption*  2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030           * Indicative trajectory based on the Energy Concept   2.1.2.ii. Estimated trajectories for the sectoral share of renewable energy in final energy consumption from 2021 to 2030 in the electricity, heating and cooling, and transport sectors  The sectoral trajectories are secondary to the main trajectory for the total share of renewables in gross final energy consumption. They add a further level of detail below that of the main trajectory and allow progress to be monitored.  Electricity  In addition to the replacement of coal cogeneration with gas cogeneration and the reduction of coal-fired power generation, the purposeful, efficient, grid-synchronous and increasingly market-oriented expansion of the use of renewable sources of energy is a crucial component in the achievement of the national climate goals in the energy industry. On 9 October 2019, within the context of the Climate Action Programme 2030, the Federal Cabinet decided on measures designed to promote the expansion of the use of renewable energies and implement the goal of achieving a 65% share of renewable energies in electricity consumption in 2030. The current legal framework (Renewable Energy Sources Act 2017, see Section 3.1.2) stipulates a share of 35% for 2020 and a range of 40-45% for 2025. Based on a current forecast share of 43% in 2020, a range of 48-54% is expected for 2025, which includes the uncertainties regarding technological developments. The target of 65% in 2030 reflects the decision taken within the context of the Climate Action Programme.  Table A7: Indicative sectoral targets for electricity for 2020, 2025 and 2030share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption  2020 2025 2030 35% (pursuant to the Renewable Energy Sources Act 2017)  (forecast) 40-45% (pursuant to the Renewable Energy Sources Act 2017) 48- (forecast) 65%  42  As part of the upcoming amendments to the Renewable Energy Sources Act, of which the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy is to produce a draft, amendments are expected to be made to the targets and the technology-specific expansion trajectories in the Renewable Energy Sources Act. As a result, this indicative trajectory may change. Any changes will be communicated at the earliest opportunity, possibly in the NECP progress report.  Growth of renewables must be stepped up significantly, not only to achieve the national climate goal in the energy industry, but also to cover the additional electricity demand resulting from efforts to achieve the national climate goals in the transport, buildings and industry sectors (sectoral coupling).  Heating and cooling  Although buildings consume the largest share of energy used for heating and cooling purposes (around two thirds of final energy consumption for heating and cooling), process heating and cooling in industry also play a decisive role (around one third of final energy consumption). The Federal Government adopted a strategy for the energy transition in the buildings sector back in 2015, in the form of the Energy Efficiency Strategy for Buildings. Implementation of the Energy Efficiency Strategy for Buildings thus makes a key contribution to the achievement of goals relating to the use of renewables for heating and cooling, and also to increasing energy efficiency (see Sections 2.2. and 3.2.).  According to the Renewable Energies Heat Act and on the basis of the recast version of the EU Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (Renewable Energy Directive, RED II), the target share of renewables in final energy consumption for heating and cooling is 14% by 2020. According to the recast version of the Renewable Energy Directive, the EU Member States are obliged to take action to increase the share of renewables in the heating and cooling sector by 1.3 percentage points a year between 2020 and 2030. The increase is calculated as a yearly average for the periods 2021-2025 and 2025-2030, hence a share of 20.5% has been set for 2025 and a share of 27% has been set for 2030. The Federal Government has used this ambitious goal for the heating and cooling sector as the basis for its contribution to achievement of the EU goals for 2030. The above also makes it clear that future growth in renewables must be accelerated significantly if the national climate goals for 2030 are to be met in the areas of industry (in particular process heat) and buildings (in particular space heating).  Table A8: Indicative sectoral trajectory for heating and cooling  share of renewables in final energy consumption for heating and cooling*  2020 2025 2030 14% 20.5% 27% * Indicative trajectory is based on the EU Renewable Energy Directive  Transport  According to the recast Renewable Energy Directive, parties supplying fuels to the market will be obliged to increase the share of renewables consumed in the transport sector to at least 14% by 2030 (mandatory target, double counting permitted). This target is to be achieved in Germany inter alia through developments in respect of the greenhouse gas reduction quota, which increases in 2020 from 4% to 6%. No national targets have been set to date for the period beyond 2020. The Federal Government will fulfil its obligation to transpose the Renewable Energy Directive into national law and will ensure alignment with the goals of the Climate Action Plan 2050. Changes to the GHG quota between 2021 and 2030 and any further measures required are currently being examined. In addition, a steep rise in carbon pricing is likely to result in higher demand for electricity and renewable fuels in the transport sector.  Table A9 shows the share of renewable energies in the transport sector in accordance with the provisions on EU statistics (RED II), whereby the figures were ascertained in a projection on development as part of the implementation of the Climate Action Programme 2030 (see Section 5.1.i; Prognos (2020). Projections, such as the underlying projections, which cover a long period up until 2030 and 2040, are naturally fraught with uncertainties.

In the upcoming consultations within the Federal Government regarding the transposition of RED II into national law in the transport sector, there may be specific concretisations and adjustments compared to the projection. As a result, this indicative trajectory may change. Any changes will be communicated at the earliest opportunity, possibly in the NECP progress report.  The Federal Government plans to increase the share of renewables in the transport sector significantly by 2030, inter alia in view of the ambitious carbon savings goal enshrined in the national Climate Action Plan 2050. The most effective way of increasing the share of renewables in the transport sector is to use renewable electricity, preferably directly but also in converted form in areas where electricity cannot be used directly. The market ramp-up phase for e-mobility, in particular in the road transport sector, will be crucial for ensuring increased use of renewables in the transport sector. Renewable electricity or sustainably produced biomass will need to be used to produce sustainable alternative fuels. Projects funded by the Federal Government include electric battery-powered, hydrogen/fuel cell-powered and gas-powered vehicles as well as plug-in hybrids. There are also plans to fund the production of advanced biofuels and renewable electricity-based fuels.  2.1.2.iii. Estimated trajectories by renewable energy technology that the Member State projects to use to achieve the overall and sectoral trajectories for renewable energy from 2021 to 2030, including expected total gross final energy consumption per technology and sector in Mtoe (million tonnes of oil equivalent) and total planned installed capacity (divided by new capacity and repowering) per technology and sector in MW  Technology-specific growth of renewables does not represent a goal in and of itself; it merely indicates the ways in which a goal can be achieved and is intended to promote the achievement of targets in the electricity, heating and cooling, and transport sectors. The sectoral technology mix is flexible.   Electricity  The Renewable Energies Act 2017 currently sets out technology-specific trajectories for the electricity sector. On 9 October 2019, within the context of the Climate Action Programme 2030, the Federal Cabinet decided to increase the share of renewable energies in electricity consumption to 65% by 2030. The legal implementation of this specification is scheduled for 2020 as part of the amendments to the Renewable Energy Sources Act.  The share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption is, in addition to the expansion trajectories, heavily dependent on the development of electricity consumption (inter alia efficiency and sectoral coupling). If, as presumed, gross electricity consumption in 2030 is 580 TWh, 377 TWh of renewable electricity or approx. 200 GW of installed capacity from renewable energies and therefore a considerable increase in the expansion of the use of renewable energies will be required in order to achieve the 65% target. Provided that, for example, the planning and approval processes for onshore wind energy and the grid expansion can be successfully expedited, the following goal for the expansion of the use of renewable energies in 2030 will be pursued.  Table A10: Indicative technology-specific shares for renewable energies in the electricity sector in 2030  Renewable technology 2030 electricity generation in TWh* 2030 installed capacity in GW* Onshore wind 140-145 67-71 Photovoltaics 90 98 Offshore wind 79-84 20 Biomass 42 8.4 44  Hydropower and others  21  6 * Indicative targets are based on the Climate Action Programme 2030  Calls for tenders will be published with a view to achieving the gross increase. In order to expand onshore wind energy, obstacles need to be removed in particular with regard to the wind farm planning and approval processes but also with regard to the availability of land. Measures need to be implemented which ensure sufficient competition and acceptable solutions for the construction and operation of wind farms on site and ewable energies. Subject well as the transmission system operators with a view to the connection cables of offshore wind farms, the expansion trajectory for offshore wind shows an increase in installed capacity to 20 GW in 2030. The technology-specific trajectories may need to be regularly reviewed depending on further political developments and any progress made. According to the Renewable Energy Sources Act 2017, 150 MW of biomass capacity was to be tendered out each year until 2019, and then 200 MW each year between 2020 and 2022. The Federal Government will in due course submit a proposal for the annual volume to be tendered from 2023 onwards.  From 2021 onwards, many older installations will pass the 20-year mark and cease to be eligible for bonuses under the Renewable Energy Sources Act. These plants will be gradually dismantled or repowered on the basis of technical or financial considerations. This will apply to many onshore wind farms from the early 2020s, and also to bioenergy plants from 2025 onwards. Support is to be available for the options for repowering onshore wind energy. Special calls for tenders were published as part of the Renewable Energy Sources Act from 2019 onwards in addition to the volumes of calls for tenders planned up until then as an additional effort towards achievement of the climate goals. In total, an additional 4 GW of capacity will be tendered out by 2021 for solar and onshore wind respectively. Depending on the specific nature of the projects, they will come online as early as 2020 or in the years following. The capacities tendered will not count towards the current 52 GW ceiling for PV systems. The special tendering proce(Federal Government bill dated 5 November 2018). The Federal Government will submit a proposal for the amendments to the Renewable Energy Sources Act in the summer. Any changes will be communicated at the earliest opportunity, possibly in the NECP progress report.  The challenge in this respect is also to achieve better synchronisation of renewables and grid capacities. The measures which need to be implemented within the transmission system in order to ensure that the electricity grids have the necessary capacities in this respect will be investigated when the Network Development Plan 2019-2030 is produced.  Heating and cooling  Increasing the use of renewable energies in the supply of heating and cooling is a major component in achieving the renewable energy share of 27% in Germany in 2030 in accordance with the Renewable Energy Directive. The measures are divided into incentives for encouraging the continued dissemination of renewable energy-based heating technologies in buildings and for encouraging the switch to increasingly decarbonised district heating.  The buildings funding programmes (see Section 3.2.) have been designed so as to be open to different types of technology, whereby in addition to the biomass boilers that have been dominant up until now a continued increase in demand for heat pumps is forecast on account of the improvement in energy standards. This applies in particular to newly constructed buildings which, in accordance with the Renewable Energies Heat Act, must cover a proportionate share of the heating and cooling requirements with renewable energies.  The structure of district heating production will change dramatically in the next few years. Due to the phase-out of coal-fired power generation, the majority of district heating produced by coal cogeneration plants will disappear by 2030. The major drivers behind the expansion of the use of renewable energies for the production of district heating are the various types of funding available through the Renewables Bonus in the Cogeneration Act, through the investment grants in the Market Incentive Programme and through the Heating Networks 4.0 programme as well as its expansion to include funding for existing networks (federal funding for efficient heating networks), which is expected to be implemented from 2021 onwards. Further details on this topic can be found in Section 3.2.  Transport  The Federal Government intends to implement the requirements set out in the recast version of the Renewable Energy Directive in the transport sector. These include the provisions stating that parties supplying fuels to the market must increase the share of renewables in the transport sector to at least 14% by 2030. 45  This share was calculated on the basis of the following agreed multiplying factors: a factor of 4 for renewable electricity in the e-mobility sector, a factor of 1.5 in the rail transport sector, a factor of 1.2 in the air and sea transport sector, and a factor of 1 or 2 for progressive biofuels (chosen at national level). The share of first-generation biofuels must not exceed 7%.  Germany plans to limit the share of first-generation biofuels allowed under the Renewable Energy Directive to 5.3% in 2030 in accordance with the status quo in 2020. By way of contrast, the share of advanced biofuels will increase by 2030 to at least 1.75% (single counting) or 3.5% (double counting). The total quota is also to be achieved on the basis of electricity from renewable sources for e-mobility and rail transport. Furthermore, conventional fuels are also expected to be produced and accounted for in a more climate-friendly way on account of the deployment of more efficient processes and the use of primary and intermediate products made using renewable resources. The implementation is expected to be technology-neutral so as to ensure that the best and most cost-effective technologies on the market are the ones that succeed.  The minimum quota of 14% for the share of renewable energies in the transport sector set out in RED II will or the European targets for non-ETS sectors. A more ambitious approach to transposing RED II at national level with the aim of achieving real emissions savings should therefore be adopted.  Table A11 shows the indicative technology-specific shares for renewable energies, which were determined as part of a projection of the implementation of the Climate Action programme 2030 (see Section 5.1.i; Prognos, 2020). Projections of this type, which cover a long period up until at least 2030, are fraught with uncertainties.

For the transport sector: up to 2020 RED I; from 2021 RED II.  It should be noted, in this context, that the Renewable Energy Sources Act is to be amended. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy will submit a draft for this. Furthermore, a bioenergy dialogue process is currently being planned in order to analyse and discuss criteria and measures for the distribution of biomass across the sectors. The figures in the table are projections. Any changes will be communicated at the earliest opportunity, possibly in the NECP progress report.  2.1.2.iv. Estimated trajectories on bioenergy demand, disaggregated between heat, electricity and transport, and on biomass supply by feedstocks and origin (distinguishing between domestic production and imports). For forest biomass, an assessment of its source and impact on the LULUCF sink   The bioenergy used will be more heavily based on waste and residues in the future. As such, it is important for all waste and residues to actually be captured; the principle of cascading use must therefore be taken into account. There are no plans to expand the cultivation areas for bioenergy and no expansions are being considered due to land surface area restrictions. The sustainability criteria of RED II must also be used for imports (from the internal market and from third countries). Taking all aspects into account, the maximum biomass available in Germany for bioenergy is currently approximately 1 000 to 1 200 PJ / a (domestic potential).  Although the use of biomass is dropping in significance in the electricity sector according to forecasts to date, it will increase in importance between now and 2030 in the heating and cooling sector and the transport sector. The downward trend for biomass in the electricity sector is attributable to the fact that it is a relatively cost-intensive renewable source of energy compared to other technologies such as wind and photovoltaics. This applies in particular to the generation of electricity from renewable feedstocks, and also in view of the need to provide variable output and flexibility. Whilst allowing for the limited potential of sustainable biomass production, biomass can be a more cost-effective option than, in particular, electricity-based fuels for achieving national climate goals when used to generate energy for air transport, sea transport and heavy goods transport, for high-temperature processes in industry, and for buildings which cannot be insulated or are difficult to insulate on account of technical or legal restrictions.

The figures in the table are projections. Any changes will be communicated at the earliest opportunity, possibly in the NECP progress report.   2.1.2.v. Where applicable, other national trajectories and objectives, including those that are long term or sectoral (e.g. share of renewable energy in district heating, renewable energy use in buildings, renewable energy produced by cities, renewable energy communities and renewables self-consumers, energy recovered from the sludge acquired through the treatment of wastewater)   Share of renewables in heating and cooling networks  The Federal Government intends to achieve a further increase in the share of renewables in heating and cooling networks. The share of renewables in heating and cooling networks has followed an upward trend to date, and the Federal Government intends to grant financial incentives and adopt legislation to ensure that this continues to be the case. For further details, see Section 3.1.2. According to the recast Renewable Energy Directive, the EU Member States are obliged to work towards an annual increase of 1% in the share of renewables in heating networks between 2020 and 2030 (calculated as a yearly average for the periods 2021-2025 and 2025-2030). This ambitious goal is also enshrined in the NECP. The expected share of renewables in heating networks in 2021 is accordingly around 21%, with the figures for 2025 and 2030 being 25% and 30% respectively.   Table A13: Indicative trajectory for the share of renewables in heating networks*  2020 2025 2030 20% 25% 30% * The trajectory is based on the EU Renewable Energy Directive  Use of renewable energy in buildings:  A share of renewables of 24-32% (depending on the transformation pathway) must be achieved in the buildings sector by 2030 in order to achieve the energy and climate goals (see Section 2.2.i.). The precise details of this increase depend on the supporting measures to be fleshed out in the course of national processes in the buildings sector
