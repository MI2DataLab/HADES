3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 129 3.2 ENERGY EFFICIENCY DIMENSION 3.2.1 Measures for compliance with the obligation to save energy. Sectoral approach  Article 7 of the Directive on Energy Efficiency (Directives 2012/27/EU and 2018/2002/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council) establishes the obligation to demonstrate cumulative final energy savings up to 2020 and 2030, with the latter calculated from 1 January 2021 until 31 December 2030, in accordance with the cumulative scheme applied in the Directive's first implementation period, from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020.  This cumulative savings target must be reached by implementing a system of energy efficiency obligations on energy providers or through the application of alternative measures of a regulatory, fiscal, or economic nature, or related to information and communication, which must be executed by the public authorities.  In this section of the INECP, we present the ten principal energy efficiency measures designed to meet the final energy saving obligation arising from the application of Article 7 of the Directive on Energy Efficiency.  Spain accepts the commitment of meeting this energy-saving target and proposes measures to ensure a uniform annual effort throughout the period in question, from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030, such that the mechanisms for action included in this Plan, as well as the public support identified as necessary, have the goal of ensuring the demonstration of new and additional final energy savings equivalent to 669 ktoe/year.  The system of energy efficiency obligations is regulated in Spain through Law 18/2014 of 15 October 2014, approving urgent measures for growth, competitiveness and efficiency. This Law also created the National Energy Efficiency Fund, with no legal personality, as an instrument for implementing mechanisms for financial and economic support, technical assistance, training and information, and other measures intended to increase energy efficiency across all sectors. The National Energy Efficiency Fund will extend its validity to 31 December 2030, in accordance with the approved Energy Efficiency Directive review.  In addition to the mechanisms that could be developed with the resources of the National Energy Efficiency Fund, the Target Scenario of this Plan considers regulatory and fiscal mechanisms to enable the greatest and fastest market penetration of efficient technologies, the greatest electrification of transport and energy demand in construction, the active participation of demand in managing the energy system, own consumption and distributed generation, and also a greater contribution of thermal renewable energies to the coverage of final energy demand.  In particular, it highlights measures for energy efficiency and energy saving in the rail, maritime and air transport sectors, not considered in the measures developed with the resources of the National Energy Efficiency Fund. As a result of the investments considered in the Infrastructure, Transport and Housing Plan (PITVI) for 2012-2024 and successive years of the Ministry of Public Works (currently MITMA), greater energy efficiency will be promoted for the conventional rail system, to make it more efficient and competitive, and directing it towards covering the daily metropolitan transport needs of people and goods, as far as possible. In parallel, energy 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 130 efficiency measures will be promoted for air and maritime transport.  Moreover, the Ministry of Finance will lead an exhaustive analysis on the potential complete review of the environmental tax policy of Spain. There is a general consensus that it is an instrument with great potential to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. The fundamental objective is the internalisation of the negative externalities derived from the use of certain fuels or technologies, so that in the decision-making process the energies or technologies with the lowest environmental impact are selected. This review of environmental tax policy will enable Spain to move rigorously and efficiently towards an environmentally sustainable economic model.  The Energy Efficiency Dimension of this Plan presents 17 energy efficiency measures, of which 10 have been designed, taking a sectoral approach, with the aim of meeting the energy-saving obligation arising from Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive. The transport sector is highlighted, with four measures that will significantly contribute to the cumulative final energy-saving target for the 2021-2030 period, with almost 14 Mtoe of savings. The transport sector is followed by the industrial and residential sectors, with 10.3 Mtoe and 6.7 Mtoe of savings, respectively. The services sector and agriculture and fisheries are those with the lowest contributions, with 4.7 Mtoe and 1.2 Mtoe, respectively:  Figure 3.3. Cumulative final energy saving by sector in Spain 2021-2030 (ktoe)44    Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019                                                             44 The quantification of energy savings included in this chapter includes those necessary to ensure compliance with the energy-saving target associated with Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive, formulated in terms of cumulative final energy saving from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030. Spain agrees to meet this cumulative energy-saving target, which will be translated into a greater or lesser volume of annual savings in each of the financial years, depending on whether the energy-saving and energy-efficiency measures are concentrated in the first or second half of the decade. The objective of decarbonisation of the Spanish economy by 2050 will require increased enforcement of energy-saving and energy-efficiency measures, particularly with regard to transport and the reduction of traffic in urban and inter-urban environments, with regard to the cumulative energy-saving target of Article 7. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 131 Figure 3.4. Cumulative final energy saving by measure in Spain 2021-2030 (ktoe)  Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019  In Annex F, more detail is provided on these policies and measures that will enable Spain to meet the challenge posed by such a quantitative leap in the achievement of energy savings.  The 10 measures mentioned above are subdivided into instruments, some of which were already planned and implemented in the previous period and learning has been gleaned from the experience. Others will be implemented for the first time in the 2021-2030 period, such as the green tax reform, the new Climate Change and Energy Transition Act, the new Sustainable Mobility and Public Transport Financing Act, the review of the amendment of the legislation affecting the maximum mass and length of road freight transport, the new municipal by-laws to restrict access to city centres for the most emitting and polluting vehicles and the promotion of the renewal of delivery fleets, among other fleets.  With respect to instruments that had already been used previously, such as lines of aid for transport electrification or energy upgrading of housing, budgets are being stepped up to achieve the leap in scale needed to achieve the objectives.  In addition, we must consider that these sectoral measures are complemented by the horizontal and financial measures defined in sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.4 below. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 132 Transport sector  Measure 2.1. Low-emission zones and modal shift measures  a) Description The objective of this measure is to reduce final energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions by acting on urban and metropolitan transport by means of significant changes in modal distribution, with greater use of the most efficient modes of transport, and less use of private vehicles with low occupation, encouraging shared use, as well as modes of transport that do not consume energy, such as walking and cycling. In this sense, it is important to stress the importance of good urban design for the purpose of encouraging less polluting and less emitting modes. It is particularly important at the time of undertaking new developments in order for the sustainable mobility variable to be incorporated from the very start of the design modification. The measure is intended to reduce the use of private vehicles, so this INECP considers it feasible to reduce passenger traffic (passengers/km) in urban environments by 35% by 2030, and to reduce inter-urban transport by approximately 1.5% annually; remote working, shared vehicles, the use of non-motorised vehicles and shared public transport will enable these targets to be achieved. It is of great importance to enable adequate funding of public transport that will make it possible to improve quality and service, attract more users and in this way contribute to improving air quality in urban environments. To encourage changes in transport demand, it is necessary to make the most of the opportunities offered by the digitalisation that comes from information and communication technologies (ICT) applied to mobility management (fleet management, parking, traffic restrictions, autonomous vehicles, etc.), as well as the concept of mobility as a service (MaaS), as opposed to payment for ownership. The new generations, users and companies of the future, are growing up in this environment. The main driving force behind the modal shift is the establishment, from 2023 in all towns and cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants within Spanish territory, of low-emission zones, i.e. the delimitation of zones with limited access for the most polluting vehicles with the highest emissions. This measure, one of the most important in this Plan, aims to transform towns and cities to ensure greater quality of life by improving air quality. The measure includes a wide range of actions of different types to enable the investment in infrastructure that will enable the necessary modal shift to take place. The proactive involvement of local authorities will be decisive in this measure. In that regard, this measure is defined with a broad approach, beyond the scope of the actions that have been implemented since 2015 financed from the National Energy Efficiency Fund. In this Plan, the participation and coordination of all the regional administrations, and also the support of private initiatives and financial entities in particular, are fundamental for raising investment. Therefore, the drive to develop regional legislation in the autonomous communities with regard to transport, in coordination with the terms established at national level, will be one of the priorities. It is also important to pay due attention to the Land Use and Sectoral Plans, since provisions and criteria are adopted at this higher level of planning that then take shape in infrastructure and urban development projects where the modes of mobility and transport have been heavily influenced. All this is consistent  Specifically, its execution will be promoted through public support programmes for the measures contained in the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans that must be implemented by the local authorities (with the support of other regional administrations, and where applicable, the General State Administration) and the Workplace Travel Plans implemented by companies. This measure is consistent with the sustainable transport priorities established in Articles 102 and 103 of Law 2/2011 on Sustainable Economy.    3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 133  b) Expected cumulative and annual energy savings for each measure and/or quantity of energy savings in relation to any intermediate period The estimated savings for this measure are 5,622.9 ktoe of cumulative final energy savings in the 2021-2030 period, out of a total 13,888 ktoe that represent the total for the transport sector.  c) Responsible bodies The public authorities responsible for the execution and follow-up of the measure are MITECO/IDAE and MITMA (in coordination with other ministerial departments with cross-cutting responsibilities in the area of transport), together with the autonomous communities, and, in particular, local authorities.  d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at town and city councils, regional councils, and other extra-municipal bodies for regional representation, as well as public or private workplaces and companies or activity centres (airports, train stations, industrial complexes, education or health centres, universities, leisure parks, shopping centres, etc.). It is also aimed at transport authorities and companies, as well as logistics centres.  e) Eligible actions Eligible actions are those that achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions and final energy consumption, by means of significant changes in modal distribution through: Implementation and development of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (PMUS): with measures such as the universalisation, from 2023 in all cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants in Spain, of the delimitation of central areas with restricted access for the most emitting and polluting vehicles (a measure also included in the Climate Change and Energy Transition Bill). Likewise, regulations on the occupation of public land will be promoted with sustainable mobility criteria, traffic restrictions at times of greater pollution, the promotion of car sharing, the regulation of parking, the promotion of the use of bicycles, the improvement and promotion of public transport, etc. The implementation and development of Workplace Travel Plans (PTT): with measures such as shared transport services within companies, the promotion of bicycles, public transport, remote working, etc.  f) Mechanisms The mechanisms for action that will enable the planned energy-saving targets to be achieved are as follows: Legislative measures: the future Law on Climate Change and Energy Transition. Amendment of Article 103 of Law requiring its implementation in companies with more than 250 employees (large companies) and the creation within these companies of the role of Transport Coordinator, in order to increase the number of companies with a Transport for Work Plan. Other legislative measures include those implementing the relevant regional laws on transport within -laws, particularly among communities with more than 50,000 residents, concerning restrictions on private transport, parking management, shared vehicles, traffic calming, traffic lanes reserved for public transport and other measures intended for sustainable transport. Finally, the Law on Sustainable Mobility and Financing of Public Transport will be drawn up at national level. This law will comprehensively address the needs of society with regard to the new models and requirements related to mobility and will pay special attention to generating sufficient economic resources to provide public transport  especially in metropolitan areas  with financial resources to offer a high-quality service and facilitate the urban modal shift to which this Plan has committed.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 134 Public support programmes: programmes to promote the implementation of the measures and actions contained in the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans and the Workplace Travel Plans; the design of financial instruments that will make it possible to mobilise the necessary investments in rail infrastructure to increase the share of transport of goods by rail. This measure is consistent with system. An example of this is the 2019-2025 Strategic Plan for Integral Support for the Automotive Sector, which MINCOTUR presented, following talks with the sector, and which seeks to help the sector during the energy transition. Information: preparation and updating of guides and manuals on sustainable urban transport; maintaining a platform aimed at citizens and transport managers on the IDAE website, which includes these guides, as well as useful information to promote the implementation of the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans and the Workplace Travel Plans; support for the creation of mobility observatories in different areas of action, forums and work groups on sustainable mobility. Communication: conducting specific communication and information campaigns to support this modal shift and the rational use of private vehicles for urban travel; developing and promoting institutional campaigns for the promotion of public transport and support for new sustainable transport, including the granting of awards and commendations to exemplary projects.  g) Financial requirements and public support This measure has high financial requirements. The estimated public investment is EUR 3.14 billion over the 10 years of the Plan, assuming that all municipalities implement a PMUS in the 2021-2030 period, prioritising the less investment-intensive measures. This investment could be co-financed using the ERDF funds under the Operational Programme for the 2021-2030 period. In addition to this investment needed to enable a successful modal shift and the transformation of the urban model, there must be a significantly smaller amount  around EUR 265 million  to promote the implementation of Transport for Work plans in companies, through public aid. The actions included in the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans will be accomplished using public finances from the relevant administrative bodies (where applicable, taking the framework of the national and European programmes into account) and in the case of Transport for Work plans, public spending is estimated to be 50% of the investment, equivalent to EUR 132.5 million.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 135 Measure 2.2. More efficient use of the means of transport  a) Description The objective is to reduce final energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions by promoting actions for the more rational use of the means of transport, including improved management of vehicle fleets on the roads, implementing efficient driving techniques for professional drivers (with potential fuel savings of around 10%) and standardising loads and dimensions for the transport of goods by road to surrounding countries. In this regard, it is important to highlight the notable increase in the urban distribution of goods within cities, caused by the boom in e-commerce that generates a large number of deliveries of small loads that require a high number of trips and a multitude of delivery vehicles. This affects traffic congestion, energy consumption, pollution and GHG emissions. It is also considered that a significant percentage of the vehicle fleet in 2030 will be used through shared mobility services, resulting in fewer vehicles in the fleet, as well as a shift from a culture of vehicle ownership to one of shared service. This measure is consistent with the 2012-2024 Infrastructure, Transport and Housing Plan from the Ministry of Public Works (currently MITMA), which seeks to improve the energy efficiency of the conventional rail system through technological improvements and better energy use, as well as promoting energy efficiency measures in air and maritime transport.  b) Expected cumulative and annual energy savings for each measure and/or quantity of energy savings in relation to any intermediate period The target for this measure is 2,221.4 ktoe of cumulative final energy savings in the 2021-2030 period, out of a total 13,888 ktoe that represents the total for the transport sector.  c) Responsible bodies The public authorities responsible for the execution and follow-up of the measure will continue to be MITECO/IDAE, MITMA, together with the autonomous communities, following a model of joint management and joint financing of the measures and actions for energy efficiency that respects the distribution of the relevant responsibilities in Spain.  d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at public and private companies and bodies with vehicle fleets for road or rail transport of people or goods, or public works and services vehicles.  e) Eligible actions Eligible actions include the application of energy audits to vehicle fleets, the installation of centralised technology systems and applications intended to improve efficiency, and the delivery of fleet management courses for staff, as well as training for professional drivers in efficient driving techniques for industrial vehicles, as well as on rail transport. Legislative measures: review of the necessary regulations to standardise the loads and dimensions of national lorries with those of neighbouring countries. An increase in the average load of these vehicles from 2021 will lead to a consequent reduction in the number of vehicles per kilometre and consumption for the same mass transported. Prior to the adoption of this measure, MITMA, together with the actors involved, will analyse the impact of the maximum permitted mass and size limits on road freight transport costs, including external costs, all within the framework of the legislation in force. MITMA will also analyse the influence of this measure on the functionality of the road network and durability of pavements, and in particular on the structural capacity of the crossings (bridges and viaducts) that make up the road network. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 136  Incorporation into municipal by-laws of aspects that facilitate the rationalisation of last mile distribution, including the progressive incorporation of more efficient and less polluting vehicles to carry out such distribution.  f) Mechanisms Public support programmes: aid programmes through grants aimed at companies. Voluntary agreements: agreements signed with sectoral associations and accreditation of companies with efficient fleet management systems. Communication: development of demonstration and promotion activities aimed at companies.  g) Financial requirements and public support The measure aims to raise a total investment amount of EUR 73 million, with EUR 22 million of public support.   Measure 2.3. Renewal of the vehicle fleet a) Description The objective of this measure is to improve the energy efficiency of the vehicle fleet by promoting the upgrade to more energy-efficient vehicles. The average age of vehicles is around 12 years. New vehicles on the market, regardless of their power source, are more efficient, and therefore their addition to the fleet gradually reduces overall consumption. By encouraging the purchase of more efficient vehicles, savings will be made in addition to those obtained through natural replacement of the vehicle fleet. Special emphasis should be placed on the renewal of vehicles in urban delivery fleets, as well as taxi services, as these do the most mileage in city centres by far.  b) Expected cumulative and annual energy savings for each measure and/or quantity of energy savings in relation to any intermediate period The objective of the measure is a saving in addition to that arising from the natural replacement of the vehicle fleet (considered in the projections of the Baseline Scenario included in this INECP) equivalent to 2,519.6 ktoe of cumulative final energy savings during the 2021-2030 period, out of a total 13,888 ktoe that represents the total for the transport sector, by promoting the upgrading of the fleet to more efficient vehicles.  In the case of passenger carwill be specially promoted (without prejudice to the promotion of an alternative classification based on technologies, according to the Directorate-a). In the remaining categories, we will try to ensure that only vehicles that achieve a minimum proven reduction in average annual CO2 emissions of 25% benefit from the measures.  c) Responsible bodies The public authorities responsible for implementing and monitoring the measure are the Ministry of Finance, which is in charge of the tax reform of the General State Administration, local authorities and the autonomous communities, which are responsible for certain taxes affecting vehicles, such as the Motor Vehicle Tax (IVTM) and the Special Tax on Certain Means of Transport (IEDMT) or registration tax.  d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at the general public and companies with vehicle fleets.  e) Eligible actions The purchase of more efficient vehicles. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 137  f) Mechanisms Taxation: The Ministry of Finance, in collaboration with local authorities, in the line already initiated by the General Tax Directorate, will analyse the convenience, viability and time periods for reform of the current Motor Vehicle Tax, levied by the local authorities, which taxes the ownership of roadworthy vehicles, according to the type of engine or fuel. This Plan considers it necessary to re-orientate the weighting of the current rates using criteria based on the emission of pollutants, which could be based on the European Standard or the environmental ratings of the Directorate-General for Traffic, in order to penalise older vehicles, which generate more emissions and pollution as well as consuming more and therefore emitting more CO2. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance will analyse a green tax reform for the automotive sector, so that consumer purchasing decisions are guided towards vehicles with lower pollutant emissions and lower GHG emissions. Legislative measures: In coordination with local authorities, we will promote the application of traffic restriction and parking management measures on public highways by local councils, so that the oldest vehicles, which have the highest fuel consumption and pollutant emissions, will be penalised. Financing programmes: Creation of financing instruments, through collaboration agreements with financial entities, aimed at SMEs and self-employed people in the goods transport and taxi services sector, to encourage the renewal of their vehicles as they may have difficulty in finding financing through ordinary channels, encouraging such renewal to be directed towards low-emission technologies.  g) Financial requirements and public support The total related investment, by individuals and companies, is estimated to be EUR 76.68 billion45 for the 2021-2030 period.  Measure 2.4. Promotion of electric vehicles  a) Description  The objective of this measure is to reduce the energy consumption of the vehicle fleet by electrifying the fleet. This will mainly be done with electric vehicles (defining electric vehicle as both vehicles with batteries and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles), making a greater penetration of renewable energies in the transport sector possible.  The current penetration of electric vehicles in the fleet is very low (54,079 vehicles in 2018, including battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and extended-range electric vehicles) and barely noticeable for fuel cell vehicles. Increasing their number will provide a series of advantages for manufacturers, in terms of compliance with the CO2  reduction targets of EU regulations, compliance with the urban air quality requirements indicated in Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, reduced dependency on petroleum products, and improved demand management by acting on the curve of electricity system charging, provided that smart charging is promoted. The mass electrification of vehicles will only be obtained when price parity is reached between electric 2025, due to the expected reduction in the price of batteries. This measure and Measure 2.3 establish the basis for new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, excluding those registered as historic vehicles not intended for non-commercial [sic] use, to gradually reduce their emissions, so that no later than 2040, they will be vehicles with emissions of 0 g CO2/km, in accordance with European regulations.                                                               45 The total related investment was calculated taking the total price of the new vehicles into account. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 138  On the other hand, it is estimated that by 2030, a significant percentage of electric vehicles will be used through Mobility as a Service (MaaS), which will encourage achieving significant percentages of electric vehicles in the fleets. A key aspect for the progressive incorporation of electric vehicles will be the deployment of the public recharging infrastructure. In this regard, on 9 December 2016 the National Action Framework was adopted in response to the transposition of Directive 94/2014 of 29 September 2014 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure. The National Action Framework meets the indicative target of the abovementioned Directive of having at least one charging point for every 10 electric vehicles. At present, the public electric vehicle charging service is liberalised in Spain and it is the companies themselves (and since the enactment of Royal Decree Law 15/2018 of 5 October 2018, any consumer) who are responsible for deploying the public charging service according to demand and the interests of the sector. However, the various public administrations, each in its own area of action, must ensure that deployment is carried out in an orderly manner and in response to existing demand, for which purpose economic, regulatory and information measures will be implemented to facilitate the development of this infrastructure. In this sense, the Climate Change and Energy Transition Bill provides for establishing the obligation to install at least one public charging point at service stations with sales of petrol and diesel fuel greater than or equal to 5 million litres per year, which (once approved) will provide a significant boost to the public electric vehicle charging network. At the same time, the autonomous regional administrations are drawing up their own plans for the development of electric vehicles in which they also promote the creation of a charging network accessible to all users. The development of the electric vehicle and its recharging infrastructure also has an impact on the energy security dimension (see Measure 3.4), as well as on the contribution of services to the electricity system through aggregation that allow for a greater integration of renewables (see Measures 1.2 and 4.4).  b) Expected cumulative and annual energy savings for each measure and/or quantity of energy savings in relation to any intermediate period The measure will provide annual savings proportional to the number of electric vehicles introduced into the fleet, which will occur progressively. This INECP considers that a fleet of 5,000,000 vehicles will be reached in 2030 (passenger cars, vans, buses and motorcycles), and therefore accumulated final energy savings over the 2021-2030 period are estimated at 3,524.2 ktoe/year, out of a total of 13,888 ktoe that represents the total for the transport sector.  c) Responsible bodies The public authorities responsible for the execution and follow-up of the measure will continue to be MITECO/IDAE (in coordination with other ministerial departments and, in particular, with MINCOTUR and the Ministry of Finance), together with the autonomous communities, following a model of joint management and joint financing of the measures and actions for energy efficiency that respects the distribution of competences in Spain. The local authorities will be administrative bodies contributing to the measure as a result of exercising their relevant powers concerning monitoring air quality in cities.  d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at the general public and companies with vehicle fleets.  e) Eligible actions The eligible actions for this measure include:  The purchase of new electric vehicles.  The deployment of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles.  f) Mechanisms   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 139 The mechanisms for action that will enable the planned energy-saving targets to be achieved are as follows: Legislative measures: to adapt the regulations on construction requirements for new buildings, in particular the Technical Building Code, to the provisions of Articles 8(2), 8(3) and 8(5) of Directive (EU) 2018/844 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings and Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, which establishes the conditions for developing the minimum infrastructure necessary for the smart charging of electric vehicles in building car parks. This adaptation must be carried out in line with the necessary amendments to the legislation and promotion plans to allow both slow and fast charging on roads and services sector buildings, in order to enable electric vehicle development in line with the figure of five million established by this INECP for the year 2030. Public support programmes: aid programmes through grants that multiply the budgets available under the previous programmes (MOVELE, MOVEA, MOVALT, MOVES) to individuals and companies for the purchase of electric vehicles, as well as the installation of charging points. -efficient and sustafor an indefinite period, the Government is authorised to establish a system of aid for actions to support transport based on criteria of energy efficiency, sustainability and promotion of the use of alternative energy, including the creation of appropriate energy infrastructure; this authorisation has enabled the allocation, both in 2017 and in 2018, of EUR 50 million annually to incentivise measures related to more sustainable transport, including the purchase of electric vehicles and the necessary recharging infrastructure, both public and private. The budgets provided by the autonomous communities and local authorities will be added to this budget with the aim of incentivising the purchase of less polluting vehicles and the deployment of recharging infrastructure. Taxation: the Ministry of Finance will analyse the appropriateness and feasibility of a tax reform in the automotive sector, aimed at internalising the environmental externalities of fossil fuels, which could consider, among other things, reforming the Special Tax on Certain Means of Transport (IEDMT) or vehicle registration tax to update the CO2 emission thresholds above which the tax46 or other taxes on the purchase or use of the vehicle are paid. The reform would bring forward the date of price parity between combustion vehicles and electric vehicles, which would contribute to accelerating the use of electric vehicles beyond the requirements of the Regulation on CO2  emissions for passenger vehicles and light vans, encouraging citizens to purchase zero-emission vehicles. Communication: design of an ad hoc communication strategy focused on providing information on electric vehicles, the price and location of recharging points, the supply and provision of vehicles, etc. collection related to recharging/refuelling points for alternative fuels and the unique identification codes related to e-CEF call for proposals in which 16 European countries participate. The first project will provide a national access point to the charging point network, both electric and hydrogen, with a visual map of these points available on the geoportal of MITECO website, as well as identifying them with a unique code, providing their coordinates and other relevant information for citizens. The second will provide citizens with information that will allow them to compare the refuelling costs of different types of vehicles, thus meeting the requirements of Directive 2014/94/EU.                                                              46 74% of vehicles currently registered are not liable for this tax as they are not over the limit of 120 g CO2/km. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 140 The communication strategy will use the channels with the greatest impact, both specialist and general: MITECO geoportal, web platforms, smartphone applications, social networks, workshops and events.  g) Financial requirements and public support The total investment associated with the use of electric vehicles will be approximately EUR 132.403 billion47. The estimated public financial support to develop this measure in the 2021-2025 period, meaning an aid line of EUR 200 million/year in the 2021-2025 period (with funds from the General State Budget and the autonomous communities), totals EUR 1 billion. In the 2025-2030 period, it is estimated that price parity will have been reached and no public support will be required.  Industrial sector  Measure 2.5. Improvements in the technology and management systems of industrial processes a) Description This measure aims to facilitate the use of final energy-saving technologies, mainly in small to medium enterprises (SMEs) and large companies in the industrial sector, particularly for facilities not included in the EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS). This measure will improve the energy efficiency of industrial processes and guarantee final energy savings (and consequently, significant reductions in GHGs), thanks also to the implementation of energy management systems. On one hand, the measure promotes the achievement of a greater volume of investment in the replacement of industrial equipment and facilities with poor energy performance by equipment and facilities with high energy efficiency or, directly, with the best available technologies (BAT); it will also consider the replacement of auxiliary energy-consuming systems. On the other, it also promotes the achievement of a higher number of investments in the implementation of energy management systems in industry. These systems should include activities for measuring energy consumption variables and the installation of features to monitor and control process parameters, as well as the implementation of IT and digital systems for analysis, monitoring and control. The aim is to achieve optimal functioning of the facilities, reduce energy consumption and costs, and provide information rapidly and precisely, which is necessary to improve the energy management of industrial facilities. In all cases, the energy management systems should comply with the UNE-EN ISO 50001 Standard on energy management systems or a substitute for this where applicable. This measure has been designed in a similar way to the programmes to promote energy efficiency in the industrial sector launched in Spain by the National Energy Efficiency Fund, from May 2015 to 2019. The improved energy efficiency of equipment, systems and industrial processes is another objective in addition to those included in this INECP, which aims to achieve the energy transition while ensuring an improvement in competitiveness and employment. The programmes to promote industrial competitiveness that were implemented during the previous implementation period of Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, using the method of repayable loans, on behalf of the ministerial departments with responsibility for industrial policy, have directed public aid to production processes that are advanced, efficient and environmentally friendly, in a way that is consistent with the energy and climate strategy and has synergy with the measures to promote the use of renewable energy sources in industry.                                                            47 The total related investment was calculated taking the total amount of new vehicles into account. This concept is not used in the economic impact evaluation of the INECP (see chapter 4). The abovementioned evaluation only considers the difference between the investment made in a conventional vehicle when it is replaced (Baseline Scenario) and the smaller amount than that obtained by considering the total cost of the new vehicle. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 141 Raising new investment in equipment, systems and processes and implementing energy management systems in the form described, as a consequence of authorised public funds, will lead to new and additional final energy savings in the industrial sector during the new implementation period of the Energy Efficiency Directive, which corresponds to the period covered by this INECP. The public funds will come either from the National Energy Efficiency Fund, or from the General State Budget or European funds. In this last case, these public budgets can be directly channelled to the promoters or industrial companies through ad hoc programmes or through the National Energy Efficiency Fund, which can be used as a priority intervention tool in the public sector to raise investment in energy efficiency. Furthermore, the incorporation of renewable energies in the industrial field is specifically addressed in Measure 1.5.  b) Expected cumulative and annual energy savings for each measure and/or quantity of energy savings in relation to any intermediate period The measure aims to achieve 10,256 ktoe of cumulative final energy savings during the 2021-2030 period.  c) Responsible bodies The public authorities responsible for the execution and follow-up of the measure will continue to be MITECO/IDAE (in coordination with other ministerial departments with responsibility for industrial policy) together with the autonomous communities and local councils, following a model of joint management and joint financing of the measures and actions for energy efficiency that respects the distribution of competences in Spain.  d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at companies in the industrial sector, preferably manufacturing, as well as energy providers that make investments on behalf of clients within this sector.  e) Eligible actions The eligible actions include those which achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions and final energy consumption, by improving technology in industrial equipment and processes and implementing energy management systems. By analogy with the programmes to be implemented during the first period of the Energy Efficiency Directive, any actions consiaction where the basic recovery period for the eligible investment exceeds the useful life of the facility executed.  f) Mechanisms The mechanisms for action that will enable the planned energy-saving targets to be achieved are as follows: Public support programmes: aid programmes through grants or repayable low-interest loans within the framework of Community regulations on State aid. Voluntary agreements: voluntary agreements signed with representative associations in sub-sectors with more intense energy use can promote the more rapid adoption of efficient technologies in the industrial sector.  g) Financial requirements and public support The total related investment is estimated to be EUR 7.37 billion, with public support of EUR 1.647 billion. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 142 Residential sector  Measure 2.6. Energy efficiency in existing buildings in the residential sector  a) Description The measure aims to reduce the energy consumption of existing residential buildings used for housing This measure must be entirely consistent with the Long-term building renovation strategy, developed by MITMA, which will be updated in 2020, in compliance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council and the State housing plan, which is the basic tool for promoting urban and rural regeneration and renewal that has been implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities. This INECP considers that the energy efficiency certification of buildings (Royal Decree 253/2013 of 5 April 2013) constitutes a very useful tool for the promoters of upgrade activities with regard to new investments in existing buildings, whatever their use. However, and insofar as improving the energy rating of buildings can be achieved by acting on their thermal envelope or on the thermal installations for heating and/or air-conditioning and domestic hot water (DHW), this Plan prioritises investment in the thermal envelope (facades, roofs and walls) with regard to improving the thermal installations, considering that the reduction in thermal demand should first be addressed in order to avoid heating and/or air-conditioning equipment that is oversized to meet that demand. The description given of the measure takes the Programme of aid for the energy upgrade of existing buildings as a reference point. It was launched in Spain in October 2013 under the title of the PAREER programme, extended in May 2015 as PAREER-CRECE, and in force until 2018 under the name PAREER II. This programme is considered to have been a successful experience, precisely due to the fact that more than 85% of the funds channelled to energy upgrade projects have been for actions to improve the energy efficiency of the thermal envelope (PAREER-CRECE). This programme may be promoted in the new implementation period of the Energy Efficiency Directive due to the existence of upgrade offices in certain regions that identify projects and provide technical advice to communities and owners for developing proposals. Public aid through grants and financing is then provided for the part not covered by the subsidies. description of the energy features of the building as a starting point for conducting an energy assessment. This certificate will contain information on all the features subject to intervention from an energy perspective (thermal envelope, thermal installations for heating, air-conditioning and domestic hot water, lighting and monitoring and management systems), as well as information on the normal conditions of operation and occupation, the conditions for thermal comfort and indoor air quality, etc. Each certificate should include recommendations to improve the optimal or profitable levels of energy efficiency of the building, or part of it, which can include an estimate of the time periods for the return on investment during their life span.  b) Expected cumulative and annual energy savings for each measure and/or quantity of energy savings in relation to any intermediate period The measure aims to achieve 4,755.9 ktoe of cumulative final energy savings during the 2021-2030 period.  These savings will be the result, firstly, of acting on the thermal envelope of 1,200,000 dwellings throughout the period, starting with 30,000 dwellings per year in 2021 and finishing with 300,000 dwellings per year by 2030. This quantitative planning is indicative, and the decisive factor for the targets of this Plan are the total energy savings achieved. The exact ratios for the upgrading of dwellings that will be undertaken for each year will be defined precisely in the future Long-term strategy for energy upgrading in the building sector in Spain, which is the responsibility of MITMA. Secondly, they will result from the renovation of thermal installations (centralised and personalised) in more than 300,000 dwellings per year. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 143   Figure 3.5. Annual indicative forecast of dwellings with an energy upgrade, 2021-2030   Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019  c) Responsible bodies The public authorities responsible for the execution and follow-up of the measure will continue to be MITMA, the Ministry of Finance and MITECO/IDAE, together with the autonomous communities, following a model of joint management and joint financing of the measures and actions for energy efficiency that respects the distribution of competences in Spain. d) Target sectors The beneficiaries of this measure will be the owners of existing buildings for housing purposes, whether they are legal or natural persons, public or private, communities of owners or groups of communities of owners of residential buildings for housing purposes, or companies which operate, lease or hold concessions for residential buildings for housing purposes, and in all cases, the energy providers. e) Eligible actions Eligible actions will be those which achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions and final energy consumption, by improving the services that have more weight in the energy consumption of buildings, such as heating, cooling and the production of domestic hot water, where the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) shows itself to be an important tool to manage energy and improve energy efficiency:  Thermal envelope: action will be taken on the thermal envelope of buildings to achieve a reduction in demand for the heating and cooling of buildings. The energy efficiency actions may be applied to facades, roofs, floors, external woodwork, windows and solar protection, etc.  Thermal installations: action will be taken on the thermal installations for heating, air-conditioning, production of domestic hot water and ventilation, governed by the Regulation on Thermal Installations in Buildings. The measure covers the incorporation of renewable energy sources to meet demand, in accordance with the targets for final renewable energy consumption considered in this Plan. The actions may include, but are not limited to, the following: o the replacement of equipment for the production of heat and cold, and the transport of heat-carrying fluids, including upgrading the thermal insulation of pipeline networks and appliances, to reduce losses in the transport of fluids; o the installation of systems of cost-free cooling from external air and of heat recovery from extracted air; o systems of automation and/or control and regulation of equipment and/or facilities, for energy-saving purposes, as well as systems to account for, remotely manage and digitalise energy consumption; o new installations of centralised systems of urban or district heating and cooling, or systems which serve several buildings, as well as the upgrading and extension of existing systems. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 144 f) Mechanisms The mechanisms that will enable the planned energy-saving targets to be achieved are as follows: Taxation: the Ministry of Finance will lead an exhaustive analysis of taxation in the residential sector to internalise the positive externalities entailed by improving the energy efficiency of the buildings related to this sector. Legislative measures: the transposition into national legislation of the new requirements for energy efficiency and renewable energies established by the new European Directives for new and existing buildings in the residential sector will be a necessary condition for the success of the planned support and financing programmes to promote the upgrading of housing. In addition, it is proposed to associations a legal form that will enable them to access the private financing available on the market. Legislative measures established by the autonomous communities within the scope of their responsibilities in relation to housing and other matters will also be relevant. Public support programmes: aid programmes through grants and financing for the energy upgrade of existing residential buildings, improving the energy rating. The programmes will prioritise actions that affect a high number of buildings: actions of urban regeneration and upgrading that affect areas identified as priority areas (districts) within the framework of housing policy. do not affect the entire building, only the individual homes of private owners to upgrade the sealing of gaps (windows and woodwork), roofs and facades independently, boilers and heaters, etc. In any case, the public support will be linked to compliance with social criteria, obtaining high levels of energy ratings or improvements by 2 or more letters, and the implementation of comprehensive actions that simultaneously act on the thermal envelope and on the thermal installations of buildings. Financing programmes: creation of financing instruments, through collaboration agreements with financial institutions, as they may have difficulties in finding such financing through ordinary channels. Training: the training of the agents involved in the energy upgrade process (planners, project managers and those responsible for external monitoring of energy standards) is essential for the successful implementation of public support programmes. In addition, training on energy efficiency should be strengthened in the financial institutions that are key agents in driving new investments. Information: guides and manuals on aspects related to the energy upgrade will be developed and updated. Likewise, observatories, forums and work groups will be strengthened, maintaining a web platform aimed at companies and agents from the sector that includes good practices concerning energy upgrading. Communication: specific information and communication campaigns will be conducted, which may include campaigns aimed at the creation of local or regional upgrade offices. g) Specific measures or individual actions on energy poverty The development of this measure will be carried out in line with the 2019-2024 National Strategy against Energy Poverty (see Measure 4.11 of this Plan) and the Just Transition Strategy, both approved in 2019. Interventions that take place in households in a situation of energy poverty will have higher aid intensities. h) Financial requirements and public support The total estimated public support for the development of this measure in the 2021-2030 period amounts to EUR 5.509 billion, which will largely come from European structural and investment funds under the new financial framework, and which will make it possible to mobilise an investment volume of EUR 22.431 billion in the whole period.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 145 Measure 2.7. Renewal of residential equipment  a) Description  The objective of this measure is to reduce energy consumption through the improved energy efficiency of household appliances, or more generically, household devices that consume energy. Given that a significant number of domestic power-driven devices, and household appliances in particular, are renewed at the end of their life span, this is considered to be a good time to encourage buyers to replace them with appliances with a higher energy efficiency rating, from among those available on the market. The new and additional savings derived from this measure (additional to those that will be obtained from application of the Eco-design Directives) will be those associated with bringing forward the decision to upgrade equipment (in relation to the time when it would have been replaced, following natural replacement levels), and the fact that the measure will stimulate the purchase of equipment with energy performance above the average of that on the market in each year of the implementation period of this Plan. The priority will be appliances whose energy consumption makes up a large part of consumption in the home, such as fridges, fridge-freezers and freezers, washing machines, dishwashers, ovens and cookers. With a national estimated quantity of 76 million appliances (fridges, freezers, washing machines, dishwashers and televisions), the measure aims to achieve savings as a consequence of improving the energy ratings (with reference to the energy label) with regard to the benchmark category in the market at the time the replacement is made. Considering that 6.6 million new white goods are sold each year, the target proposed implies the market penetration of 2,443,000 appliances/year of the highest category of energy efficiency.  b) Expected cumulative and annual energy savings for each measure and/or quantity of energy savings in relation to any intermediate period The target for this measure is to achieve 1,976 ktoe of cumulative final energy savings during the 2021-2030 period.   c) Responsible bodies The public authorities responsible for the execution and follow-up of the measure will be MITECO/IDAE, together with the autonomous communities, following a model of joint management and joint financing of the measures and actions for energy efficiency that respects the distribution of competences in Spain. The Public Administrations will collaborate to implement this measure among consumers and users, who must always play an active role by signing up to voluntary agreements.  d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at the domestic sector.  e) Eligible actions  The actions proposed in this Plan are mainly communication actions to promote the awareness and use of more efficient household appliances, awareness of energy ratings and their importance as a decisive factor in the responsible and efficient purchase and use of household equipment. These communication actions will form part of a general strategy that will be of a permanent nature, aimed at citizens as the principal actors.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 146  f) Mechanisms The mechanisms for action that will enable the planned energy-saving targets to be achieved are as follows: Voluntary agreements: voluntary agreements signed with associations of manufacturers, distributors and retailers of household appliances, in order to coordinate information and communication campaigns and actions in relation to consumers, as well as the training of sales staff. Training: training activities will be designed and implemented in relation to this measure, which as a guideline may include, but are not limited to, training courses on energy efficiency for household appliances, aimed both at sellers of household appliances and citizens, organised in collaboration with associations of manufacturers, retailers and consumers, both on site and virtually. Information: up-to-date information on energy ratings will be provided on the IDAE website, to promote information among end users of more energy-efficient appliances and systems. Communication: we propose the implementation of a specific aid line for actions that contribute to promoting the purchase of more efficient household appliances, particularly highlighting energy savings and environmental commitment in the related communications. It should be consistent with the general communication strategy for the Plan, based fundamentally on information, training and expert and sectoral forums) with advertising support that is also segmented. This line of communication will be developed continuously over time, intensifying to coincide with peak purchasing periods, in coordination with associations of manufacturers, distributors and retailers, supporting them from IDAE to activate their own communication initiatives. Additionally, communication actions will be developed focused on the efficient and responsible use of equipment.  g) Specific measures or individual actions on energy poverty The development of this measure will be carried out in line with the 2019-2024 National Strategy against Energy Poverty (see Measure 4.11) and the Just Transition Strategy, both approved in 2019. Interventions that take place in households in a situation of energy poverty will have more aid.  h) Financial requirements and public support The public financial support will be used for communication campaigns. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 147 Services sector  Measure 2.8. Energy efficiency in services sector buildings  a) Description This measure aims to reduce the energy consumption in existing buildings used for services, owned publicly or privately, through energy upgrade activities that will improve their energy rating. As stated in Measure 2.6 of this Plan, on improving the energy efficiency of existing buildings in the residential sector, the certification of energy efficiency (Royal Decree 253/2013 of 5 April 2013) is a very useful tool for the promoters of upgrade activities when making new investments in existing buildings. The measure includes two different mechanisms: 1) Article 5 of Directive 2012/27/EU) to autonomous community and local administrations; 2) the energy upgrading of buildings through public support programmes and financing similar to the Aid programme for the energy upgrade of existing buildings (PAREER), in force since October 2013. The first refers to the extension of the mandate contained in Article 5 of Directive 2012/27/EU to all autonomous regional and local administrations, ensuring fulfilment of the proactive and responsible role of the public sector and resulting in a saving on the energy bill of the public administrations. The second refers to the continuation of public support programmes and financing for the energy upgrade of buildings in the services sector (similar to the PAREER programme).  b) Expected cumulative and annual energy savings for each measure and/or quantity of energy savings in relation to any intermediate period The target for this measure is to achieve 1,378.8 ktoe of cumulative final energy savings during the 2021-2030 period. These savings will be the result of the energy renovation of 5 million m2/year of public and private building stock.  c) Responsible bodies The public authorities responsible for the execution and follow-up of the measure will be MITECO/IDAE, together with the autonomous communities and local administrations, following a model of joint management and joint financing of the measures and actions for energy efficiency that respects the distribution of the relevant responsibilities in Spain.  d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at existing buildings used for services, publicly owned by any administration, as well as privately owned. The beneficiaries of the aid programmes will be the owners or holders of existing buildings, whether they are legal or natural persons. In the event that the aid beneficiaries are legal persons of a private nature, the programmes will be adjusted to the regulations on State aid.  e) Eligible actions Eligible actions for building upgrades will be those that achieve a reduction in CO2  emissions and final energy consumption, by improving any services with a greater weight in the energy consumption of buildings, such as heating, cooling and the production of domestic hot water:     3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 148  Thermal envelope: action will be taken on the thermal envelope of buildings to achieve a reduction in demand for the heating and cooling of buildings. The energy efficiency actions may be applied to facades, roofs, floors, external woodwork, windows and solar protection, etc.  Thermal installations: action will be taken on the thermal installations for heating, air-conditioning, production of domestic hot water and ventilation, governed by the Regulation on Thermal Installations in Buildings. The measure covers the incorporation of renewable energy sources to meet demand, in accordance with the targets for final renewable energy consumption considered in this Plan.  Lighting systems: action will be taken on the indoor lighting systems of buildings, adapting them to the energy efficiency values required depending on how each zone is to be used; implementing lighting regulation and control systems based on the activity in each zone of the building and adapting lighting levels depending on the sunlight available.  f) Mechanisms The mechanisms that will enable the planned energy-saving targets to be achieved are as follows: Legislative measures: extension of the mandate arising from Article 5 of Directive 2012/27/EU to all public administrations. Public support programmes: aid programmes through grants and financing for the energy upgrade of services sector buildings, improving energy ratings. Training: training for agents involved in the energy upgrade process (planners, project managers and agents responsible for external monitoring of energy standards, as well as those in charge of designing and managing energy facilities in public buildings) is essential for the successful implementation of public funding programmes. In addition, training on energy efficiency should be strengthened in the financial institutions that are key agents in driving new investments. Information: guides and manuals on aspects related to the energy upgrade will be developed and updated. Likewise, observatories, forums and work groups will be strengthened, maintaining a platform aimed at companies and agents from the sector on the IDAE website with databases and good practices concerning energy upgrading. Communication: specific information and communication campaigns will be conducted.  g) Financial requirements and public support The total estimated public financial support to implement this measure in the 2021-2030 period is EUR 2.166 billion, which, to a large extent, will come from European structural and investment funds corresponding to the new financial framework, which will mobilise approximately EUR 3.671 billion of investment.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 149 Measure 2.9. Energy efficiency for cooling equipment and large air-conditioning systems in the services sector and public infrastructure a) Description The objective of this measure is to reduce electricity consumption in the services sector, and it can be divided into two: 1) measures to upgrade large air-conditioning systems, cooling equipment and refrigeration and freezing compartments; 2) measures to improve the energy efficiency of publicly owned infrastructure, mainly street lighting systems and water treatment, purification and desalination facilities. The first aims to reduce consumption in refrigeration systems for the storage and conservation of perishable products in refrigerated warehouses and logistics facilities supplying urban areas, large air-conditioning systems for services sector buildings (airports, hospitals, shopping centres, offices, etc.) and in small installations, units and deep-freeze boxes used in grocery stores, shops and retail areas. The second aims to make Spanish street lighting compliant with Royal Decree 1890/2008 of 14 November 2008, approving the Energy Efficiency Regulation for street lighting, by regulating maximum lighting levels based on the activities carried out in particular areas and the impact of lighting on other areas, as well as increasing the minimum energy efficiency of light sources. In addition, it aims to improve the energy efficiency of facilities for the treatment, supply and purification of water, by reforming existing facilities and introducing criteria for energy efficiency and low energy consumption in the specifications of calls for tender related to purification projects. b) Expected cumulative and annual energy savings for each measure and/or quantity of energy savings in relation to any intermediate period The measure aims to achieve 3,350.4 ktoe of cumulative final energy savings during the 2021-2030 period. c) Responsible bodies The public authorities responsible for the execution and follow-up of the measure will be MITECO/IDAE, together with the autonomous communities and local authorities, where applicable, following a model of joint management and joint financing of the measures and actions for energy efficiency that respects the distribution of competences in Spain.  d) Target sectors The measure is aimed at the services sector, either natural or legal persons owning large refrigeration (more than 70 kWe) or air-conditioning systems and the owners of small installations, through units and deep-freeze boxes, in grocery stores, shops and retail areas. In relation to public infrastructure, the measure is aimed at the local authorities and concession holders for the management of municipal public services.  e) Eligible actions Eligible actions are those that achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions and final energy consumption, by improving energy efficiency through:  Sub-measure 1. Cooling equipment. Cooling equipment that improves energy efficiency through the incorporation of monitoring and control systems, the recovery of condensation and/or evaporation heat, and other equipment with high energy-saving capacity (multi-layer or capacity for variation of the condensation and/or evaporation temperatures). In the case of refrigeration units, the installation of covers or doors and replacement of lighting systems by new systems with lower energy consumption and heat dissipation.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 150  Sub-measure 2. Public lighting and water infrastructure. Replacement of bulbs with more energy efficient ones, improving the reflective and directional quality of the light and installation of systems to regulate the light flow of light sources and switching on and off, enabling variation throughout the night ba In the case of facilities for the treatment, purification and desalination of water, improving efficiency by reforming the facilities for pumping and treating water, and generally, applying any upgrade that will mean a reduction in energy consumption.  f) Mechanisms The mechanisms for action that will enable the planned energy-saving targets to be achieved are as follows: Public support programmes: aid programmes through grants and financing for this type of equipment and infrastructure. In the case of actions on publicly owned infrastructure, these programmes will have the additional technical assistance necessary for defining the technical specifications and public procurement.  g) Financial requirements and public support The total estimated public budget required to develop this measure in the 2021-2030 period is EUR 3.947 billion for a volume of mobilised investment of EUR 6.333 million. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 151 Agriculture and fisheries sector  Measure 2.10. Energy efficiency in farms, irrigation  communities and agricultural machinery  a) Description The measure aims to reduce the consumption of energy on farms, in irrigation communities and agricultural machinery through the modernisation of existing facilities and upgrading of machinery and/or replacement of tractors and seeding machines. The measures will be implemented in synergy with those aimed at the promotion of renewables in this sector  in this last case, giving continuity to the PIMA TIERRA Plan, launched in 2014, which has enabled improvement in the energy ratings of tractors and agricultural machinery (following the methodology developed by the Agricultural Mechanics Section and the IDAE).  b) Expected cumulative and annual energy savings for each measure and/or quantity of energy savings in relation to any intermediate period The target for this measure is to achieve 1,203.9 ktoe of cumulative final energy savings during the 2021-2030 period.   c) Responsible bodies The public authorities responsible for implementing and monitoring the measure will be MITECO/IDAE, together with the autonomous communities.  d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at the owners of farms and the owners or holders of tractors or agricultural machinery.  e) Eligible actions Networks for capturing, storing, transporting, distributing and applying irrigation water will be eligible, as well as energy-consuming facilities in agricultural buildings and agricultural machinery.  f) Mechanisms The mechanisms for action that will enable the planned energy-saving targets to be achieved are as follows: Public support programmes: aid programmes through grants and financing aimed at farms and owners of agricultural machinery. Information: the development of guides and training workshops mainly aimed at irrigation communities.  g) Financial requirements and public support The total estimated public financial support to implement this measure in the 2021-2030 period is EUR 929 million, which will mobilise more than EUR 3.896 billion of total investment.  3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 152 3.2.2 Horizontal measures in relation to energy efficiency  As discussed in section 2.2.1, the reduction in primary energy consumption proposed in this INECP is equivalent to an improvement in the primary energy intensity of the economy of 3.5% per year up to 2030. This improvement in primary intensity is the result not only of the catalogue of energy end-use efficiency measures to comply with Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive, but also of considering other technological, regulatory and social developments.  These include energy efficiency improvements resulting from technological developments; compliance with new regulations and directives; an increase in the vehicle occupancy rate in urban areas due to the penetration of vehicle sharing; savings in the air, maritime and rail sectors resulting from sectoral policies; improved efficiency in energy distribution; greater penetration of renewable energies in the electricity generation fleet, etc.  In addition, six horizontal measures are proposed that will have an impact on the achievement of the energy efficiency objectives detailed below.  Measure 2.11. Promotion of energy services  a) Description The role of energy providers was incorporated into the Spanish legal order by means of Royal Decree-Law 6/2010 of 9 April 2010 on measures to promote economic recovery and employment. Since then, Spain has approved plans and programmes with the main objective of promoting the procurement of energy providers by the public sector, as part of the duty of proactive responsibility towards the common good incumbent on it. The recent publication of the Eurostat guide on accounting for Energy Performance Contracts (EPCs) has enabled the removal of one of the main barriers making it difficult for public administrations to invest in the energy upgrade of their buildings (among other possible improvements in energy efficiency) in a scenario characterised by the need to maintain control of the public deficit.  b) Expected cumulative and annual energy savings for each measure and/or quantity of energy savings in relation to any intermediate period The objective is to achieve improved energy efficiency during the 2021-2030 period via savings and efficiency actions through energy service companies.  c) Responsible bodies The public authorities responsible for implementing and monitoring the measure will continue to be MITECO/IDAE, together with the autonomous communities and, especially, local authorities.  d) Target sectors This INECP considers energy service providers to be part of the new business fabric required to achieve the energy efficiency targets proposed for 2030. Following this principle, the different regional administrations, through the energy agencies  either IDAE, at national level, or others at autonomous community or local level  will provide new contract templates adapted to the recommendations of Eurostat and compliant with the new Public Sector Contracts Law.  3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 153 Within the private sector, the procurement of energy services with different contract templates is a reality that will be strengthened in the time frame of this Plan by the removal of regulatory and administrative barriers to own consumption. The new regulations on own consumption will enable the appearance of the roles of energy prosumer and aggregator, and ultimately of new business models based on the generation of energy from renewable sources and the reduction of demand. e) Eligible actions Eligible actions are those that achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions and final energy consumption, both primary and final. f) Mechanisms The mechanisms that will make it possible to achieve the expected savings will be focused on: legislative measures that develop new contract models, promoting these companies in the different aid programmes, as well as information and communication.   Measure 2.12. Public sector: proactive responsibility and energy-efficient public procurement a) Description Proactive responsibility In addition to procuring renewable energies (Measure 1.16), the regional administrations must take proactive responsibility for the promotion of energy efficiency, leading the process of energy transition to a decarbonised economy by 2050. Energy-efficient public procurement Spanish legislation has a regulatory framework that promotes the use of energy saving and efficiency criteria in the procurement processes for goods, services and buildings by the public administrations48. The Ecological Public Procurement Plan of the General State Administration, its autonomous bodies and Social Security management entities (2018-2025), approved on 7 December 2018, has been added; it is defined as an instrument for promoting and facilitating economic growth based on the establishment of a circular, low-carbon economy. Furthermore, Directive (EU) 2019/1161 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 amending Directive 2009/33/EC on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles has been adopted. This will oblige the contracting authorities of public administrations to have a minimum   b) Expected cumulative and annual energy savings for each measure and/or quantity of energy savings in relation to any intermediate period The objective is to achieve improved energy efficiency during the 2021-2030 period via savings and efficiency actions in the public sector.  c) Responsible bodies The public authorities responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the measure will continue to be MITECO/IDAE, together with the autonomous communities and, especially, local authorities.                                                              48 Law 15/2014 of 16 September 2014 on rationalisation of the Public Sector and other administrative reform measures, the thirteenth additional provision of which includes certain energy efficiency requirements for the purchase of goods, services and buildings for public administrations included in the State Public Sector, and Law 9/2017 of 8 November 2017 on Public Sector Contracts, which requires the creation of assessment criteria that include environmental, social and innovation criteria aligned with the European policy on green public purchasing. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 154 d) Target sectors The public sector.  e) Eligible actions Eligible actions are those that achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions and energy consumption, both primary and final.  f) Mechanisms In this INECP, the mechanisms are summed up in the upgrading of 300,000 m2/year in the General State Administration, above the 3% required by the Energy Efficiency Directive. In addition, achieving the improvement of energy efficiency by 39.5% by 2030 requires the adoption by the remaining regional administrations of at least the mandatory objective for the General State Administration, of upgrading 3% of the built and air-conditioned surface area of the public building stock. In this respect, this National Plan considers an upgrade of 3,390,000 m2/year of autonomous community and local authority public buildings to be achievable. It will therefore be necessary to promote cooperation between the managers of public buildings at national level and at autonomous community level49. Specifically for the building stock of the General State Administration, the following actions are proposed:  The prior definition and scheduling of upgrade actions for the building stock of the National State Administration, including annual targets for each Ministerial Department, in a way that guarantees that the annual upgrade target of 3% of the surface area is achieved50. These actions should be planned and financed with the European funds envisaged up to 2023 in Thematic -regional Operational Programme and future operational programmes.  Maintaining the inventory of General State Administration buildings through the web platform Sistema Informático de Gestión Energética de Edificios de la Administración General del Estado, SIGEE-AGE) and strengthening of the network of energy managers and supervisors assigned to the organisations and buildings of the General State Administration.  The launch of information and training activities aimed at the managers and supervisors of the buildings of the General State Administration through specialist publications, virtual platforms and social networks.  Promotion of own consumption and the use of renewable energies in public buildings and the procurement of energy service providers.  Innovative public procurement mechanisms (Measure 5.5) should contribute to the advancement of energy efficiency in the public sector.                                                                    49 The autonomous regional and local administrations are pioneers in the procurement of energy providers and in the use of energy performance contracts and public-private partnerships to finance energy efficiency actions. All the autonomous communities are implementing or planning to implement energy efficiency plans in their public buildings. 50 From 2014 to 2018, 1,457,075 m2 were renovated, which represents a 105% achievement of the upgrade targets established in Article 5 of the Energy Efficiency Directive. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 155 Measure 2.13. Energy audits and management systems  a) Description Spain has transposed the Energy Efficiency Directive through Law 18/2014, mentioned above in relation to Article 7 of the Directive, and Royal Decree 56/2016 of 12 February 2016, which transposes the Directive with regard to energy audits, accreditation of energy providers and energy auditors and promoting efficiency in the supply of energy. Royal Decree 56/2016 imposes an obligation on large companies to conduct energy audits every four years, or as an equivalent to this obligation, the implementation of a system of energy or environmental management. The audits must be conducted by duly qualified energy auditors (Article 4 of Royal Decree 56/2016). The inspection must be carried out on a random selection of at least a statistically significant proportion of the energy audits performed in each four-year period. In order to facilitate the conduct of the inspection, the Administrative Register of Energy Audits has been created, which is public and free of charge. It had received information on 35,000 energy audits by 3 December 2018.  b) Expected cumulative and annual energy savings for each measure and/or quantity of energy savings in relation to any intermediate period The objective is to achieve improved energy efficiency during the 2021-2030 period via savings and efficiency actions.  c) Responsible bodies The autonomous communities and the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla are the administrations responsible for establishing and applying the independent inspection systems on companies liable for the obligation.  d) Target sectors The business sector.  e) Eligible actions Eligible actions are those that achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions and energy consumption, both primary and final.  f) Mechanisms The programmes of public aid and support for financing defined in Section 3.2.1 of this Plan with a sectoral focus will use the obligatory energy audits as the main assessment tool to define the eligible investment required to achieve the savings. They will also promote energy audits in small and medium-sized enterprises that are not affected by the obligatory nature of the Directive.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 156 Measure 2.14. Training professionals in the energy efficiency sector a) Description employment of between 253,000 and 348,000 people with respect to the Baseline Scenario. These data include the increase in employment relating to the energy efficiency dimension, which is estimated at between 56,000 and 100,000 jobs. The aim of this measure is to identify both professional and academic training needs, arising from the expected growth in all sectors related to improving energy efficiency. b) Expected cumulative and annual energy savings for each measure and/or quantity of energy savings in relation to any intermediate period The aim is to achieve improved energy efficiency over the 2021-2030 period.  c) Responsible bodies The bodies responsible for designing and implementing this measure include bodies from the General State Administration, such as the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training, the Ministry of Universities, MCI, MITECO, SEPES and INCUAL, that technical bodies such as the IDAE will collaborate with, as well as other administrations and organisations, autonomous communities, local authorities, energy agencies, sectoral associations for energy saving and efficiency, renewable sector associations, training companies, trade unions and professional associations, among others.  d) Target sectors The training sector, both professional and academic.  e) Mechanisms The sectors identified in the energy efficiency dimension (transport, residential industry, services, and agriculture and fisheries) are in a continuous process of technological improvement related to energy saving and efficiency, making it essential to provide continuous training and refreshers for qualified personnel. It is therefore necessary to promote continuous training at both professional and academic qualification levels, developing and implementing new qualifications and specialities where necessary. As with the cross-cutting measures proposed in the decarbonisation dimension, in terms of training, the Plan proposes working on identifying the professional profiles needed to increase energy efficiency in Spain and thus achieve the energy efficiency objectives set out in this Plan. The process starts by determining the professional profiles needed throughout the value chain associated with the energy efficiency improvement measures in the Plan. Qualification levels will then be adapted to the needs of the labour market resulting from the application of the INECP. Work will be done with associations from the sectors identified in the energy efficiency dimension and trade unions so as to promote the formation of those profiles that are deficient. It is also necessary to improve the energy-efficiency technology knowledge of the professionals who can assist in the development of energy efficiency in a cross-cutting manner. This is the case, inter alia, with professionals from financial institutions, where a better knowledge of these technologies among the financial intermediaries that direct the investments would make it possible to increase financing for energy efficiency projects. At the same time, measures will be established to promote and provide information on the employment opportunities offered by the investments in energy savings and efficiency that will take place during the energy transition.  Given the speed at which energy- and environment-related technologies are developing, it is necessary to monitor and continuously adapt the measures adopted, in accordance with possible technological changes of an innovative nature.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 157   Measure 2.15. Communication and information concerning energy efficiency  a) Description The communication and information measures included in this INECP must address the requirements established in Articles 12 and 17 of the Energy Efficiency Directive, as well as leading to the necessary transformation of energy consumption habits required by the process of transition to a decarbonised economy by 2050.  b) Expected cumulative and annual energy savings for each measure and/or quantity of energy savings in relation to any intermediate period The aim is to achieve improved energy efficiency over the 2021-2030 period.  c) Responsible bodies MITECO, through the IDAE, will have a central role in defining and strategy. The IDAE has regularly developed institutional communication campaigns that have made it possible to demonstrate energy savings within the framework of Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive, and it has developed audio-visual projects, publications and training platforms aimed at consumers in different sectors. The IDAE also has experience with the creation and management of social network profiles in relation to energy efficiency.  d) Target sectors All energy-consuming sectors and the financial sector.  e) Mechanisms The main vector of the communication strategy of this Plan is the fight against climate change and the close link between energy consumption and polluting emissions, with special emphasis on local pollution and transforming the models of towns and cities. Insofar as this Plan is based on the willingness to design a just transition to a new energy model, the communication strategy should provide information in a way that is easy to access by the most vulnerable consumers, to enable them to participate in the necessary social transformation and reduce energy poverty. In addition, this Plan proposes actions aimed at financial institutions as the agents needed to mobilise the additional EUR 83.54 billion of investment with respect to the Baseline Scenario, which will make it possible to improve energy efficiency by 2030. These actions should improve the awareness of the financial agents to reduce the perception of investment risk for energy efficiency and saving which often penalises the promoters of this type of project and limits their access to finance.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 158 Measure 2.16. Other measures to promote energy efficiency: the transition to highly efficient co-generation  a) Description Co-generation has a strong presence in the industrial sector, where approximately 92% of the installed capacity is located, the remaining 8% being found in the services and residential sectors. The fuel mainly consumed by co-generation plants is natural gas, which represents 84% of electricity production and 86% of heat production, although there are also facilities that consume other conventional fuels or renewables. It is estimated that 2,400 MW of co-generated capacity will have exceeded its regulatory life span by 2030, and the priority financial rules will no longer apply. The age of existing facilities, as well as the necessity, in some cases, of redesigning them to adapt to new circumstances in the processes, means a potential loss of efficiency in terms of better outputs from the current turbines and engines. On the other hand, the large-scale introduction of renewable power generation technologies established in the National Plan sets a challenge for co-generation as a support system that contributes to the stability of the system, and offers the flexibility that the operation of the electricity system will require in order to reach the established targets for energy generation from renewable sources. Based on the above, a measure is proposed for the 2021-2030 period that promotes high-efficiency co-generation for a total of 1,200 MW with an optimised design based on: useful heat, electrical own consumption, flexibility of operation with regard to the electricity system and high efficiency, which would contribute to all the objectives set out in this Plan.  b) Expected cumulative and annual energy savings for each measure and/or quantity of energy savings in relation to any intermediate period This measure represents a saving of 1,471 ktoe of cumulative primary energy during the 2021-2030 period.  c) Responsible bodies The calls for tenders must be made by the Ministry for Ecological Transition (MITECO). MITECO and the Autonomous Governments of the Canary and Balearic Islands and the cities with a Statute of Autonomy must collaborate on drawing up specific programmes for territories not on the mainland.  d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at companies in sectors that realise a co-generation installation.  e) Mechanisms The mechanism set out is the competitive tendering procedure, with a multi-annual schedule of tenders, in order to determine a cost-effective remuneration scheme for the application of public funding, supported by the necessary administrative measures to take advantage of the existing infrastructure. The need for facilities to be very highly efficient will be included in the application criteria for tenders, with design optimisation based on useful heat and electric own consumption, and flexibility of operations with regard to the requirements of the system operator. Given the importance of the own consumption of both useful heat and electricity in the design of the installation and in obtaining the required efficiency rates, inspection plans will be carried out to ensure the effective use of the heat contributed to the process by co-generation, as well as the levels of electricity own consumption.     3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 159  3.2.3 Energy efficiency in gas and electricity infrastructure Spain has introduced measures to remove tariff incentives that undermine the efficiency of the generation, transmission, distribution or supply of energy or that hinder participation in the response to demand, in market stability or in the procurement of ancillary services. It has recently eliminated barriers to own consumption so that the energy system can begin the gradual transition to a model of distributed electricity generation, usually of low capacity. Since Law 24/2013 of 26 December 2013 on the Electricity Sector was approved, and as a result of the approval of Royal Decree 216/2014, progress has been made on improving the participation of small consumers in the efficiency of the system and the response to demand. Royal Decree 1048/2013 has introduced incentives that contribute to reducing losses in networks; the first is intended to ensure continuous improvement in the level of losses in order to achieve an increase in remuneration without penalties, while the second is intended to reduce fraud.  This INECP accepts the conclusions and proposals of the evaluation reports on the energy-efficiency potential of gas and electricity infrastructure approved by the National Commission on Markets and Competition in June 2016. The measures considered to promote energy efficiency in the national electricity infrastructure include promoting design criteria based on efficiency, increasing line and cable sections, improving capacity factors and increasing voltage, upgrading substations, optimising the low-voltage network and the grid system, demand management, optimising the use of smart meters and reducing fraud. Particularly for gas infrastructure, both for transmission and distribution networks and in regasification plants, a mechanism has been established to identify losses in the facilities, in order to incentivise the reduction of these by the owners.  3.2.4 Financial measures  Measure 2.17. Financial measures: National Energy Efficiency Fund  a) Description  The National Energy Efficiency Fund constitutes the main instrument to support national initiatives on energy efficiency during the application of the current INECP. This Fund, created by Article 72 of Law 18/2014, will be in force from 2021 until 31 December 2030.  Article 20 of the Energy Efficiency Directive enables Member States to create a National Energy Efficiency Fund, and the revised Directive 2012/27/EU expressly recognises that the parties bound by the framework of the system of energy efficiency obligations set out in Article 7, will be able to comply with the energy saving obligation through financial contributions to this Fund of a quantity equivalent to that of the investments required by compliance with the obligations arising from that Article.     3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 160 The Fund can receive contributions from other sources, from the General State Budgets and principally from the European structural and investment funds (ERDF Funds) to promote a low-carbon economy. Returns on the ERDF funds can be expected for the 2014-2020 programming period (considering that S-regional Operational Programme had EUR 2.104 billion for a low-carbon economy and that the projects will be able to be executed for the different investment priorities identified up to 2023) and the future programming period up to 2030. In addition, the National Energy Efficiency Fund will have resources derived from the return on the loans granted within the framework of calls already implemented since 2015 (Annex F contains more information about the National Energy Efficiency Fund). In total, this INECP will mobilise EUR 83.54 billion of additional investment in energy efficiency, will require nearly EUR 30 billion of public funds (national and European), in the form of direct public aid and public support for the financing of energy efficiency projects. This Plan aims to revitalise and integrate financial institutions as the necessary agents to mobilise investments in energy efficiency and renewable energies, given that the energy transition must take place with the cooperation of all the public and private agents and all the Regional Administrations, regardless of their nature.
