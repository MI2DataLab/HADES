        100  3.2 Dimension Energy efficiency   (i) Energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative policy measures under Article 7a and 7b and article 20(6) of Directive 2012/27/EU and to be prepared in accordance with Annex III to this Regulation  In the Energy Agreement from June 2018 it was agreed that the current Energy Savings Obligation scheme will end by 31 December 2020. The scheme will be replaced by competitive subsidy schemes related to private enterprises and buildings.  Denmark will therefore from 2021-2030 fulfil the saving obligations under Article 7(1) in the EED by alternative policy measures (article 7 b). The main measures to fulfil the saving obligation will be:  A competitive subsidy scheme related to private enterprises: 300 mio. DKK per year in 2021-2024  A competitive subsidy scheme related to buildings: 200 mio. DKK per year in 2021-2024  Efficiency of existing buildings by other measures  Subsidy scheme to replace oil burners with heat pumps in buildings outside the district heating and gas grids: DKK 20 million per year in 2021-2024 The subsidy scheme related to private enterprises allocates DKK 300 million for each year in the period 2021-2024. The scheme is planned to be implemented as a subsidy scheme with a competitive bidding procedure. Subsidy is granted based on the ratio of subsidy per saved kWh in the individual projects. Subsidies are first granted to the project with the lowest costs per saved kWh, then to the one representing the second lowest costs, and so forth. The scheme is aimed at achieving energy savings in businesses, and is open to energy saving projects in all types of energy in all private sectors in Denmark and all types of activities in Denmark including:  Industry/manufacturing  agriculture, fisheries, forestry and horticulture  construction and manufacturing  energy in private service and retail  The scheme primarily targets energy savings in the delivery of services and manufacturing of products, with the main focus it is a prerequisite that more than 50 % of the total savings in any given project is in process energy. This means that savings in e.g. space heating and cooling are only eligible when combined with savings in process energy. The subsidy scheme related to buildings allocates DKK 200 million for each year in the period 2021-2024. The scheme is planned to be implemented as a competitive based subsidy scheme aimed at achieving energy savings in buildings.          101  Financial aid will be given to owners of buildings who have renovated their buildings in accordance with a specific list of energy savings belonging to the subsidy scheme. In order to achieve as much savings as possible the projects will compete in relation to the amount of energy savings per square meter in the application. Furthermore the energy label for buildings is planned to be used in the scheme, and data from the label used for documentation. To help realization of energy savings in private buildings there will also be focus on campaigns aiming at support realizing the potential for energy savings.    Efficiency of existing buildings by other measures is significantly increased through the requirements to the renovation of buildings in the building codes, as well as through information campaigns regarding technological opportunities and financial measures available to building owners.    Subsidy scheme to replace oil burners with heat pumps in buildings outside the district heating and gas grids allocates DKK 20 million for each year in the period 2021-2024. The scheme is planned to be implemented as a subsidy scheme with the objective to replace oil burners with heat pumps in buildings located in areas without access to district heating or the gas grid.   Table 10 shows the calculated cumulative effect of these measures.

This is partly due to the use of a frozen policy scenario, wherein only measures from the period 2021-2024 are included.   The Danish Government has committed itself to an ambitious climate policy, which aims to  by 70% by 2030, relative to 1990 levels. Moreover, the Danish Government is committed to fulfill the energy saving obligations under article 7. Measures and instruments contributing to the obligation will be outlined in the upcoming climate action plans. The climate action plans will, amongst other things, include energy efficiency measures, including energy saving requirements for public sector buldings and a national strategy for sustainable construction. Moreover, the Government is working on a plan for the implementation of article 5 in EED in the period 2021-2030. In addition, the Danish Government will work towards increased electrification of the transport sector, industry and society in general, which can also result in energy savings.  (ii) Long-term renovation strategy to support the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, including policies, measures and actions to stimulate cost-effective deep renovation and policies and actions to target the worst performing segments of the national building block, in accordance with article 2a of EPBD  Denmark will submit its long-term renovation strategy separately, as soon as it is finished, but no later than the 10th of Marts 2020.  (iii) Description of policy and measures to promote energy services in the public sector and measures to remove regulatory and non-regulatory barriers that impede the uptake of energy performance contracting and other energy efficiency service models The Danish Government has implemented the following measures to promote energy services in the public sector: The Government has developed a general concept for OPP (= Public/Private Partnerships), which encourages public authorities to enter into partnerships with private partners in order to reduce costs and increase efficiency in the public sector. OPP-projects play an important role in construction and renovation of buildings in the public sector. The core of the concept is that construction or renovation and maintenance of public buildings is carried out by private partners, while the public pays an agreed rent for the use of the buildings based on a long term contract. ESCO-projects can be considered as a special class of OPP-projects with focus on energy renovation. ESCO-projects can be considered as a special class of OPP-projects with focus on energy renovation. In an OPP ESCO project (ESCO = energy service company) a private ESCO will take on the responsibility of financing and implementing energy savings in a public building or buildings. Sometimes the ESCO will also handle the future operation of the installed energy installations. The ESCO company and the owner of the building or buildings will usually sign an energy performance contract, where the remuneration of the ESCO company depends on the actual energy savings obtained.           103  It is compulsory for local authorities to consider the use of OPP whenever they decide to carry out new construction or renovation of buildings.  OPP-projects are supported by standard contracts and manuals, which have been developed by the Government for local authorities. Furthermore, the Government is disseminating information on ESCO and how to use the ESCO-model in relation to energy performance contracting as a tool to improve the energy efficiency in buildings owned by local and regional authorities. It is estimated that there are no regulatory barriers to the use of energy contracting. This is documented by the fact, that there has been an increase in the use of ESCOs in the public sector. Over the last years 22 % of all municipalities have chosen to carry out energy efficiency projects using energy performance contracting with private partners. To overcome non-regulatory barriers, the Government is disseminating information on ESCOs to regional and local authorities. (iv) Other planned policies, measures and programmes to achieve the indicative national energy efficiency contributions for 2030 as well as other objectives referred to in point 2.2 (for example measures to promote the exemplary role of public buildings and energy-efficient public procurement, measures to promote energy audits and energy management systems45, consumer information and training measures46, and other measures to promote energy efficiency47) Energy audits for large enterprises  As regards energy audits and management systems (EED Article 8) Act No 345 of 8 April 2014 contains the overarching requirements for energy audits of large enterprises, which entails an obligation for large enterprises to carry out a mandatory energy audit every four years on their total energy consumption, including processes, buildings and transport. The enterprises can also fulfil their obligation by using and maintaining a certified energy management system or a certified environmental management system that includes an energy audit as part of the management system. The minimum requirements for energy audits are stipulated in the Executive Order 1382 of 29 November 2018 on energy audits in large enterprises, which was issued pursuant to the Act. To accommodate that non-SME companies should do energy audits which are cost-effective the opportunity to do a simplified energy audit for companies with a yearly energy consumption lower than 1.000.000 kWh/yr will be implemented in a new Executive Order. The requirements are now in the process of being updated and a new Executive Order is expected to be adopted on 1 January 2020.   Consumer information and training In regards to consumer information and training and with a reference to Articles 12 and 17 in the EED, the Danish Energy Agency  will draw up an action plan for the information                                                            45 In accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2012/27/EU. 46 In accordance with Articles 12 and 17 of Directive 2012/27/EU 47 In accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2012/27/EU.         104  campaign on energy efficiency at end-user level. The aim is to promote energy efficient solutions and purchasing and energy efficient behaviour among end-users. The information campaign focuses on end users with home owners, the public sector, and commercial enterprises as specific focus areas.  Improving the energy efficiency of buildings and support energy efficient behaviour in connection to the use of buildings is a priority in the Danish public and consumer information campaign. This involves preparing material on energy efficient solutions, information on building regulations, and better access to information and knowledge about ation with the end users concerning energy efficient solutions both in private households and in public and private enterprises.  BedreBolig is a scheme offering advice, which was launched in autumn 2014. There is no financial support to the building owners via the scheme. The scheme is being administered by the Danish Energy Agency. The aim of the scheme is to make it easier and clearer for building owners how to renovate their homes by offering a one-stop shop with comprehensive, expert advice throughout the energy renovation process.  Training and awareness-raising about energy efficiency are also important elements in the Certificate and BedreBolig-scheme contains a large element of training. In connection with the schemes, training courses has been set up for craftsmen, construction engineers, engineers, architects etc.  The Energy Agreement from June 2018 includes measures to improve the use of data and digitalisation to promote energy efficiency. Special emphasis is put on using data to improve the quality and use of the Energy Performance Certificates (EPC), which are produced in accordance with the Directive Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. The EPC is based on a physical review of the building where an energy consultant collects information about the building. The improved EPC scheme will use automatic digital validations in the electronic calculation programs, so that the energy consultant's registrations are assessed even before the EPC is issued to the building owner. It is expected to increase the quality of the approximately 60,000 EPCs that are issued annually, where in 2018 alone, approximately 150,000 profitable savings proposals were indicated. Also, the Danish Energy Agency is working on simplifying the access to the EPC-database and making it more searchable, so that building owners and other stakeholders can make better use of the many data behind the EPC. Furthermore, the Energy Agreement includes measures to improve consumer information and awareness targeted at end-users and energy service companies with the view of improving energy efficiency and the market for energy services.   The Knowledge Centre for Energy Savings in Buildings is a service for craftsmen and educational institutions concerning energy efficiency improvements. The centre has worked with industry organisation within the area of mediating knowledge to its members, and         105  provides on regular basis courses to support the general further education of craftsmen. Furthermore, educational efforts are carried out by the labour market training centres.  The building job scheme  The building job scheme is a tax incentive scheme for energy efficiency in buildings. Energy efficiency is not the primary goal of the tax scheme, but it is a clear derivative effect and many parts of the scheme are directly targeted at improving the energy efficiency in buildings, for example through the installation of heat pumps, new windows etc.   The building job scheme allows for a tax deduction of ca. 26 % on up to DKK 12.200 (EUR 1.848) of the salary to craftsmen salary (expenses to materials are not included).   Energy-efficient public procurement A revision of Ministerial Order regarding energy efficiency in state institutions No 9477 of 2 July 2014 will impose a requirement for energy efficient public sector procurement including the procurement of products, services and buildings where this is cost-effective, economical feasibility, in accordance with wider sustainability, technical suitability, as well as sufficient competition. Furthermore, the Government will provide general information on energy efficient procurement through the following websites:  https://sparenergi.dk/offentlig/vaerktoejer/indkoebsanbefalinger http://www.csr-indkob.dk http://www.gronneindkob.dk/  (v) Where applicable, a description of policies and measures to promote the role of local renewable energy communities in contributing to the implementation of policies and measures in points i, ii and iv Denmark facilitates public meetings at the local level, to promote and share expertise on energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy by home owners. These meetings are organized and funded by the Danish Energy Agency with participants from SparEnergi.dk and the local municipality. The meetings especially contribute to the information campaigns described in section iv and the transition from oil boilers to heat pumps.   As part of the Danish commitment to comply with the DIRECTIVE (EU) 2018/2001 article 18 a qualification scheme is managed by the Danish Energy Agency. The qualification scheme validates the qualification of the installer to ensure energy efficient installations and is promoted at the citizen-oriented homepage SparEnergi.dk and at local energy meeting for citizens. (vi) Description of measures to utilize energy efficiency potentials of gas and electricity infrastructure48  In 2015 The Danish Energy Agency together with the Danish TSO Energinet, The Danish Energy Association and the Danish DSO, HMN Natural Gas published the report                                                            48 In accordance with Article 15(2) of Directive 2012/27/EU.         106  Potentialevurdering for energieffektivitet i el- potential for energy efficiency in the Danish electricity and gas infrastructure). The report was published to meet the obligations in directive 2012/27/EU, art. 15(2). The report both addresses the energy efficiency potentials for transit and distribution in the electricity and gas sector and gas storage. Electricity infrastructure  In order to increase the capacity on critical electrical transmission lines, the Danish transmission system operator Energinet has implemented a system for dynamic line rating which adapts the capacity to the current ambient conditions. Also System Integrity Protection Schemes are used to allow a higher loading without jeopardising operational security. Furthermore, Energinet is in close cooperation with other European TSOs to develop a Common Grid Model which features a harmonised approach for congestion forecasts across Europe. While some aspects of those activities result in greater grid losses, all these actives combined with improved simulation models allow a high utilisation of the transmission system which enables more renewable energy to be integrated.  Energinet is now also preparing procedures to support the use of excess heat to district heating fr-profit basis, where it is socioeconomically activities, the utilization of the heat generated through electricity losses, decreases the loss of value for the Danish society as a whole. Gas infrastructure  The energy loss in the Danish gas net is very low and is approximately 0,06 % of the total gas being transported. The energy loss of gas from storage is expected in the same ratio. Efficiency potentials are primarily related to the choice of components; compressors and boilers and the choice of pressure and temperature. As an example, all compressor drives in the Danish system are electrical powered. The gas net is continuously optimized and components are renewed with more energy efficient components, when the old components are replaced.  Because of the very low net loss it is not possible to point to significant efficiency potentials, which is not being taken care of in the continuous maintenance of the grid. (vii) Regional cooperation in this area, where applicable  Nordic Co-operation on Energy Efficiency The Nordic cooperation on energy efficiency was until 2019 conducted in the networking group on energy efficiency (NGEE). The group consisted of experts from the Ministries and energy authorities in the Nordic countries. At present, much of the regional cooperation on energy efficiency is being conducted by the networking group on ecodesign and energy labeling. The main objectives of the co-operation in this area are to promote Nordic co-operation on energy efficiency initiatives and to implement EU/EEA directives and programs.         107  Below are some recent examples of Nordic energy efficiency co-operation.   information which will help Nordic politicians, government officials and other interest groups to further develop the market for these solutions and as a key objective to identify serve as a starting point for discussions concerning the different options for regulatory   Mainstreaming energy services and EPC in the Nordic countries The objective of the project is to strengthen the Nordic market for energy services and EPC by  - creating networks among local authority clients and facilitators in the Nordic countries,  - increasing exchange of information and mutual capacity building, and by - mainstreaming the way of conducting energy efficiency projects.  Nordic cooperation ecodesign and energy labelling The Nordic cooperation on market surveillance and policy work on Ecodesign and Energy Labelling is conducted in the Nordsyn working group. It is cooperation among Nordic market surveillance authorities (MSAs) and policy agencies. Ecodesign and Energy Labelling supplies nearly half the energy savings target set by the EU in 2020. Effective regulations and efficient market surveillance is essential if this is to be realized and Nordsyn aims to improve the efficiency of Nordic market surveillance and policy input. Nordic authorities, producers and consumers benefit from Nordsyn while green growth and energy efficiency are supported. The results and structure of Nordsyn can also be used to improve market surveillance in other EU countries.  Nordsyn sub projects In 2018, Nordsyn focus on 1) the strategic Nordic product heat pumps with two studies on how the products work in reality in the Nordic climate; 2) an information film on the new product database and coming revised energy labelling; 3) a Nordcrawl2 project in which the previous developed Nordcrawl web crawling tool will be applied to give valuable input to market surveillance and policy work.   Earlier projects include: Barriers for market surveillance cooperation (2012 and 2013-2015), Working methods (2013-2015), Information material (2013), Strategic Nordic products  Heat pumps (2014), Challenges for market surveillance  difficult products (2015-2017), Effects of market surveillance (2013-2014), Cooperation with customs (2013-2014), How small countries work with ecodesign and energy labelling (2013-2014), Energy labelling online information film (2016), Heat pump list prospect (2016), Strategic Nordic products - Windows (2017-2018), Heat pump reality studies phase 1 and 2 (2017-2018), Recycler interview study (2017-2018).          108  Results from Nordsyn The most appreciated result of Nordsyn is that the Nordic countries now regularly share questions, commission answers, discussions, test results and plans. Even though the core of Nordsyn is continuous contact and exchange of market surveillance results, Nordsyn has also given the possibility to perform a number of projects that improve Nordic market surveillance and knowledge of legislation among producers, retailers and consumers.  Effects-project: This study showed a prevented energy loss worth 28 million Euros for a market surveillance cost of around 2 million Euros in the Nordic countries, and an overall rate of 6.3% non-compliance. These results show that the market surveillance is cost efficient, especially when countries cooperate.   Strategic Nordic products Heat pumps-project: The project resulted in an overview of legislation, national work and recommendations. Some of these recommendations are further studied in the 2017 and 2018 heat pump projects.   Challenges-project: The project contains a number of product studies on how to perform market surveillance on complex products (ventilation units, transformers, professional refrigeration etc.).  (viii) Financing measures, including Union support and the use of EU funds, in the area at national level  The financing of energy efficiency initiatives is generally speaking not a major barrier for most projects in Denmark. This is due to a well-established practise of furnishing loans for energy efficiency projects through home equity loans. The low interest rates of the past decade have further increased the possibility for acquiring affordable loans for both private citizens and business and has made the projects more profitable by lowering interest payments. This is supplemented with flexible rules for establishing new finance measures such as green bonds and the possibility for establishing special finance facilities for energy projects. The Danish pension funds and other parties are able to participate in energy projects by pooling project in cooperation with other actors as well as through ESCO and OPP schemes.           plan, including all the measures in the Energy Agreement from June 2018, are funded through the state budget.  -2022) is funded by EU through Horizon2020.
