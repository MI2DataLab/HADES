The indicative milestones for 2030, 2040 and 2050, the domestically established measurable progress indicators, an evidence-based estimate of expected energy savings and wider benefits, and their contributions to the Union's energy efficiency targets as included in the roadmaps set out in the long-term renovation strategies for the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU In accordance with Directive 2018/844(LTRS) will outline these milestones and indicators. The current LTRS is available on the Department's website. The next LTRS will further reflect the commitments in the National Development Plan (NDP) Plan. For 2030 these include:  500,000 homes retrofitted to a B2 Building Energy Rating or cost optimal by 2030  Public sector buildings to have a B Building Energy Rating (or carbon equivalent) by 2030  One third of all commercial buildings to have a B Building Energy Rating (or carbon equivalent gains) by 2030 For 2050 these include:  In 2014 Ireland adopted a National Policy Position for an 80% reduction in CO2eq emissions by 2050 compared to 1990 levels for the electricity generation, built environment, and transport sectors   a net zero target by 2050 at EU level   47 iii. Where applicable, other national objectives, including long-term targets or strategies and sectoral targets, and national objectives in areas such as energy efficiency in the transport sector and with regard to heating and cooling The Climate Action Plan defines a roadmap to a net zero carbon energy systems objective by 2050 for Ireland and sets out a coherent set of policy actions and targets to 2030 that will set us on track to achieve that goal. In terms of energy efficiency, a number of actions contribution.  Buildings  The Plan sets out targets for the significant improvement of the energy efficiency of our building stock with a target of 500,000 existing buildings to be retrofitted to a B2 Building Energy Rating or cost optimal by 2030  All new dwellings will be built to NZEB standard from 1 November 2019. All new "Buildings other than dwellings" are built to NZEB from 1st Jan 2019.   One third of all commercial (including mixed use) buildings to have a B Building Energy Rating (or carbon equivalent gains) by 2030 Heating  A shift to alternative heating sources is also set out in the Plan, with targets of 600,000 heat pumps installed over the period 2021-2030  Effectively ban the installation of oil boilers from 2022 and the installation of gas boilers from 2025 in all new dwellings through the introduction of new regulatory standards for home heating systems. Progressively phase out oil and gas boilers in existing dwellings through a combination of incentives, information and regulatory measures  Phase 2 of the social housing retrofit programme to bring dwellings more than 40 years old (30% of the social housing stock) to a B2 equivalent BER Transport  In the transport sector the Plan sets out actions to accelerate the penetration of electric vehicles into sales of cars and vans on the route to reach 100% of new vehicle sales by 2030, so that 936,000 electric vehicles will be on the road by 2030;  The Plan also commits to make growth less transport intensive through better planning, remote and home-working and modal shift to public transport  Increase the renewable biofuel content of motor fuels   48  Set targets for the conversion of public transport fleets to zero carbon alternatives Agriculture  The plan also aims to deliver substantial verifiable greenhouse gas abatement through the adoption of a specified range of improvements in farming practice  Electricity Generation  The Plan aims to increase reliance on renewables from 30% to 70% adding 12GW of renewable energy capacity (with peat and coal plants closing) Public Sector  A 50% energy efficiency target for the Public Sector by 2030  Public sector buildings to have a B Building Energy Rating by 2030
