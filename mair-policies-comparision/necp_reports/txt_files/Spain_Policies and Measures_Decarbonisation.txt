3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 80 3.1 DECARBONISATION DIMENSION It should be noted that the electricity generation and transport sectors are responsible for the greatest reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In the former, this is a consequence of the measures associated with the deployment of renewable technologies (and the gradual move away from carbon). In the latter, it is a consequence of a range of actions, among which the modal shift towards low-emission or emission-free means of transport stands out, and of the cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants, access to which will be increasingly restricted for the most polluting vehicles. In the interest of methodological consistency, this last measure is explained in detail in Section 3.2 (Energy Efficiency Dimension), where it appears as Measure 2.1. Low-emission zones and modal shift measures (promoting more efficient modes of transport).  The Plan proposes 26 measures that seek to decarbonise the economy. Of these, 15 aim to specifically promote a renewable technology or a technology relating to one of the three energy uses; four measures take a cross-cutting approach to all renewable sources, technologies and uses; one measure concerns the application of emissions trading; three measures target non-energy non-ETS sectors; and two measures relate to the land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector. Lastly, there is a measure on taxation.  3.1.1 Measures to promote renewable energy  To achieve the decarbonisation objectives, it is necessary to significantly develop renewable energies in general and renewables in the electricity sector in particular, as well as to electrify a significant proportion of the demand. With the measures proposed below, renewable energies are expected to account for 42% of final energy demand and 74% of production in the electricity system by 2030.  In the case of renewables in the electricity sector, the projections analysed in the Plan account for the entirety of the investment and the operating and maintenance expenditure required to make the planned increase in the use of renewable energies for generating electricity profitable. The design of the market and remuneration mechanisms for the electricity system that will be implemented will determine how these investments and this expenditure will be mobilised, as well as their sources and the mechanisms through which the investments will be recovered.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 81 Measure 1.1. Development of new facilities for generating electricity using renewables a) Description Over the 2021-2030 period, the installation of 59 GW of additional capacity for generating electricity using renewables is planned. To this end, it will be necessary to take advantage of the strengths of each available renewable technology. In the case of mature technologies, their main strength is their demonstrated capacity to make high-energy contributions, minimising the amount of public aid required. Therefore, it makes sense for the development of new facilities to continue to be supported through competitive tendering mechanisms, such as the tender procedures launched in Spain in 2015, adapted as necessary to improve their efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, as regards technologies that have not reached technological maturity (for example, marine energy or, at a more advanced stage, offshore wind energy), it is necessary to adapt the public support mechanisms to the specificities of each technology and of the different territories (in particular those not on the mainland), so as to take account of the fact that they are still unable to compete in terms of generation costs but they could in future contribute new potential and added value to the system by diversifying the technologies, energy sources and location of these. Finally, participatory citizen projects have additional advantages given their benefits such as having the greatest socio-economic impact or increasing social acceptance and public awareness of the merits of renewable energies. Consequently, it is necessary to develop specific measures to promote them.  b) Objectives addressed Development of renewable energies, citizen participation and innovation.  c) Mechanisms The following mechanisms are planned for the development of new renewable energy facilities:  Calls for tenders for the allocation of a specific remuneration scheme Regarding the tenders, Article 6 of the Climate Change and Energy Transition Bill, which was submitted to public consultation that began on 22 March 2019, provides the following: 1. Procedures for financial entitlements will be organised annually to promote the construction of at least 3,000 MW of renewable facilities each year. This installed capacity target may be formally reviewed according to the evolution of the decarbonisation of the Spanish energy system. 2. To encourage predictability and stability in the revenue and financing of new facilities generating electricity from renewable energy sources that are built, new remuneration frameworks will be developed by regulation for the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources, based on long-term recognition of a fixed price for the energy generated. 3. The abovementioned remuneration frameworks will be granted through competitive tendering procedures in which the product to be tendered for will be the electricity to be generated and the variable on which it will be offered will be the remuneration price of this electricity. 4. In the competitive tendering procedures that are organised, it will be possible to distinguish between different energy generation technologies depending on their technical characteristics, manageability, location criteria, technological maturity or anything else that may guarantee the transition to a decarbonised economy, in accordance with EU regulations. 5. Until the new remuneration frameworks and their granting procedures are developed via regulations, the calls provided for in paragraph 2 will take place pursuant to Article 14(7) of Law 24/2013 of 26 December 2013 on the Electricity Sector and its implementing regulations.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 82  Local participation in renewable generation projectsMechanisms will be established via regulations to promote a diversity of actors and the existence of participatory citizen projects, with the aim of promoting both social and territorial cohesion and a just transition, and to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the new decarbonised generation model. A support mechanism will be established through which participatory citizen projects can enter into a contract of sale for their electricity at a fixed price tied to the result of the tenders. An annual quota will be reserved for participatory citizen projects and will be granted to the first that request it and comply with the requirements until the energy quota is met. Furthermore, the question will be assessed of whether the projects that join the support mechanism could have public guarantees to facilitate financing and make it cheaper. In addition, options will be assessed for designing tenders that favour projects that take into account the social component through, among other things, citizen participation in financing or the existence of a profit-sharing plan, in which part of the revenue is allocated to activities agreed with local agents.  Specific programmes for developing technologiesSome energy generation technologies (for example, marine energy and energy from offshore wind in deep waters), although they remain uncompetitive, have great potential. For these, a specific tender schedule is proposed with a reduced power capacity that will make it possible to accommodate demonstration or flagship projects. Depending on the specific needs in each case, the tender could be supported with public financing. In the case of offshore wind power, the reduction of its generation costs in actual and planned installations in the short term in Europe already shows a high potential in Spain with floating technology on the 2030 horizon. Therefore, the support mechanisms and capacity volumes in the competitive calls for tenders will be adapted to the growing levels of competitiveness of this type of power, paying attention to its contribution to the consolidation and competitiveness of the industrial fabric and its synergies with other strategic sectors (shipbuilding, shipyards, civil engineering, electro-intensive industries). In addition, and taking into account the high energy potential and a solid base of companies in incorporated into the periodic reviews of this National Plan.  Specific programme for territories not on the mainlandAid programmes are planned for new renewable energy facilities, in particular those that can provide a guarantee of power. This programme is justified by the fact that the electricity systems in territories not on the mainland are subject to special regulations that mean that conventional backup technologies are being use to a greater extent and that generation costs are higher. Furthermore, investment and operating costs are higher than those of sites on the mainland, such that it would not possible to compete on a level playing field with them as regards renewables tenders.  d) Responsible bodies The calls for tenders must be made by the Ministry for Ecological Transition (MITECO). MITECO and the Governments of the Canary and Balearic Islands and the cities with a Statute of Autonomy must collaborate on drawing up specific programmes for territories not on the mainland.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 83  Measure 1.2. Demand management, storage and flexibility a) Description The integration of the new renewable capacity provided for in this Plan substantially modifies the with a predominantly passive demand, to a new model where generation variability must be managed using all the tools available for this, both large-scale storage within the generation systems themselves or separate from them, as well as demand management that makes the consumption curve more flexible, adapting it to the generation. On the other hand, new demands arise, such as electric vehicle charging, which through smart management can be an additional tool to facilitate demand and network management. In fact, increasing the flexibility of the system is one of the actions that contributes to achieving the objectives for electricity generation from renewable sources set out in this INECP. The contribution to further integration of the electricity market is addressed in Measure 4.4. In addition, depending on the characteristics of the geographical areas, the rapid changes in consumption and generation dynamics can pose challenges for the management of distribution networks. In this sense, distributor use of the services that may be offered by the distributed energy resources in their area emerges as a possible cost-efficient alternative to solve network congestion or other challenges at local level. In turn, and as stated in Measure 1.14 on promoting the proactive role of citizens in decarbonisation, regulatory changes at Spanish and European level and technological development promote the transition of citizens from being passive consumers to actors and producers, and also enable them to participate in demand management through energy efficiency systems, the provision of electric vehicle charging services or other energy services. It is necessary to promote and communicate to citizens the tools available to them to become actors in the energy system and to thus benefit from the economic savings available through changes in consumption patterns, while adding value to the system as a whole. Furthermore, in an increasingly digitalised society, the significant deployment of smart meters will enable consumers to access information on their energy consumption data in real time, to become more involved in the energy market and to adjust their consumption according to market signals. Due to the level of discharges in an electricity system with a high penetration of renewables, this surplus energy represents an opportunity that can be exploited with a complex storage system. There are different technologies for the use of these discharges, through their energy transformation and subsequent storage. Among other alternatives, it would be possible to use the potential renewable discharges for conversion into hydrogen, since there is the possibility of storing this fuel, as well as mixing it with natural gas in the transmission network, which means exploiting the potential for coupling the gas and electricity sectors for joint demand management of both sectors. All this requires regulatory developments, market organisation and business models to exploit the potential of distributed energy resource management in general, and demand management in particular, both for the benefit of the system to enable the integration of renewables and grid management under the best conditions of cost-efficiency and security of supply, as well as to ensure that consumers, individually or in aggregated form, directly or through other figures, can participate in the provision of these services.  b) Objectives addressed  Activation and promotion of demand management in various sectors (transport, residential, industrial and services sectors); promotion of citizen participation in demand management; boost of the digitalisation of users in the energy sector.  c) Mechanisms   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 84  Development of the regulatory and legislative framework for demand management It is necessary to determine the technical requirements for participants offering energy from renewable sources, energy storage managers and those providing demand response services, to participate in existing and developing markets. Furthermore, to ensure the participation of small consumers, it is necessary to develop the figure of the aggregator, and in particular the independent aggregator, as well as their right to enter the electricity market without the consent of other participants. This development must address the allocation of clear roles and responsibilities for electricity companies and customers, which will enable the exchange of and access to data on an equal and non-discriminatory basis, while protecting relevant information, and establishing a mechanism for resolving disputes between those providing aggregation services and other market participants, including responsibility for deviations.  Development of legislative framework and promotion of storage With regard to storage, 6 GW of additional power is installed (including pumping and other storage technologies), providing greater capacity for managing generation. The decrease in the costs of renewable energy for electricity generation and storage is significantly altering the profitability assumptions for the different technologies, and therefore the future composition of the storage technology mix will depend on technology development and the relative merits of each alternative. In any case, it is necessary to provide for the figure of storage operator in the sectoral legislation to prevent this figure from being penalised by having to be assimilated to a producer/consumer. To ensure that the electricity system has the abovementioned storage capacity, the need to establish remuneration frameworks will be analysed. Such frameworks will complement the price signals of the energy markets and the system balance perceived by these installations, taking into account the degree of maturity of the different storage technologies. The design of these mechanisms will be determined by capacity analyses carried out by the system operator over the different time horizons and will be integrated, where appropriate, into any capacity mechanisms developed in accordance with the principles set out in the internal electricity market legislation. To contribute to the fulfilment of the renewable energy objectives established by law, the use of non-flowing public water resources to generate electricity in any new concessions granted will prioritise support for the integration of non-dispatchable renewable technologies into the electricity system. To this end, reversible hydropower plants will be promoted in particular to enable the management of renewable production, respecting a flow regime that makes it possible to comply with the environmental flows of the water bodies affected and supporting river basin regulation under conditions of extreme phenomena, so that it is compatible with the efficient management of water resources and their environmental protection. Regulations may enable mechanisms that will make it possible to apply a pumping, storage, and turbination strategy to any new concessions granted in order to maximize the integration of renewable energies, always conditional on the fulfilment of environmental objectives in the river basin plans. In addition, it is important to note the increase in thermal storage that will occur, associated with concentrated solar power (CSP) installations. Installations that increase their installed capacity by 5 GW between 2021 and 2030 and that have nine hours of storage using molten salt tanks.  Promotion of the coupling of sectors The coupling of sectors, i.e. the alignment with other uses of the energy, such as electric vehicle charging, heat or cold generation for industrial or air-conditioning uses, hydrogen production, etc., makes it possible to introduce manageability in the electricity demand while also responding to other uses of the energy, making it possible to reduce discharges and take advantage of more economical energy for certain uses.  Managing distributed energy resources in local markets Development of the legal framework to enable and encourage distribution network operators to obtain flexibility and balancing services from distributed generation suppliers, demand response or energy storage, as a cost-efficient alternative to more conventional network management mechanisms. In this sense, the IREMEL project between IDAE and OMIE analyses the potential and needs associated with this possibility.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 85   Options and signals suitable for consumers Users who wish to do so should be able to make choices and act on their energy consumption with a contract associated with dynamic pricing. This should allow them to adjust their consumption according to real-time price signals that reflect the value and cost of electricity or transmission over different time periods. This will require the identification and removal of the legal and administrative barriers that make it difficult for consumers to choose when to consume, store and/or sell self-generated electricity on the market, or to participate in all electricity markets (disproportionate fees or administrative charges, etc.). It is also necessary to analyse the possibility of legislative development for bilateral contracts and energy exchanges between self-consumers and consumers through platforms to encourage peer-to-peer exchange and to monitor transactions.  Advice, promotion of active clients and activation of other agents involved Information and awareness-raising campaigns for citizens on the possibilities and options available, and the benefits they bring, to promote their participation in the market, responding to price signals. It is also necessary for consumers to have information concerning their energy rights to facilitate the best decision-making on all the options available to them.  Development of qualified human resources In line with Measure 1.17 on training professionals in the renewable energy sector, training programmes will be launched for builders, developers, installers and architects, with the intention of promoting the inclusion of any elements necessary to implement demand management measures (home automation, building automation, Internet of things, big data, two-way electric vehicle chargers, storage, systems automation, smart meters, etc.), from the design phase of new buildings (residential and services), and in the refurbishment of existing ones.  One-stop shop and simplification of procedures in the processes linked to demand management and the integration of renewable energies The current administrative approval processes may make it difficult to develop demand management. The existence of a one-stop shop that can guide the applicant and act as an intermediary throughout the administrative procedure to apply for and grant permits, will reduce the difficulties and complexity of the processes linked to demand management and integration of renewable energies.  Pilot projects for demand and storage management Promotion and development of pilot projects for demand and storage management, new figures that can participate in this management and its application, inter alia, in local energy markets.  d) Responsible bodies MITECO, IDAE (Institute for the Diversification and Saving of Energy), CNMC (National Commission on Markets and Competition), REE (the Spanish national grid), distribution network operators (electricity and gas), electric vehicle recharging infrastructure operators, regional governments and sectoral associations.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 86 Measure 1.3. Adaptation of electricity grids to integrate renewables a) Description The production of electricity in Spain using renewables represented 46% of the installed capacity of the entire generator stock at the end of 2017. In comparison with other European countries, in 2017 Spain was in sixth position in terms of renewable generation capacity, with a renewables share as a proportion of total generation above the European average. This level of penetration is even more commendable, given that the renewable technology with the highest share in the electricity system is wind energy without storage (which contributed 18.2% of the electricity generated in 2017), since this is a technology with low capacity for manageability. This level of integration of renewables has been possible thanks to (CECRE). CECRE has been a world-leading centre for more than a decade, managing and monitoring, in real time, the energy generated by wind farms, which are assigned to generation control centres that  The Plan seeks to cover 74% of electricity consumption with renewables by 2030. To minimise discharges of renewable energy, to link electricity generation and demand, to maximise the use of grid capacity and to reduce the need for fossil-fuelled thermal power stations as a back-up system, it is necessary to strengthen and grow the transmission and distribution lines in Spanish territory, including peninsular connections, non-peninsular systems and interconnections between island systems. It is equally important to develop the appropriate legislative framework and to promote certain actions that allow progress to be made towards a more flexible electricity system, which minimises discharges and makes better use of existing infrastructure, through the use of storage and demand management and updated connection criteria. In fact, increasing the flexibility of the system makes it possible to achieve the renewable energy generation objectives set out in this INECP without increasing the capacity of natural gas combined cycles as a backup technology.  b) Objectives addressed To address the new needs of electricity grids in such a way that they enable the integration of renewables, the participation of new actors and security of supply, both for onshore and offshore infrastructures.  c) Mechanisms It is necessary for the system to properly accommodate the large renewable energy generation capacity promoted by the Plan in a way that ensures the security of the system. The following actions are planned for this purpose:   Adaptation of electricity transmission and distribution network planning The development and strengthening of the electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure must be adapted to the forecast development of renewable generation through the creation of new transmission nodes and the strengthening of existing ones, as well as the development of new international interconnections, transmission infrastructure under water and in systems not based on the mainland. In that regard, it is considered essential that the public and the administrations in the territories where these network infrastructure activities are planned participate in the planning of these activities in order for the plans to be implemented properly.    3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 87  Specifically, the planning of the transmission network, for which the State is responsible, must take into account that in the coming decades the environment in which it will operate will undergo substantial changes as a result of the factors established in this Plan. In addition to the traditional requirements of security of supply and reliability, of the technical criteria established, as well as the economic criteria, of economic and financial sustainability of the electricity system and the compatibility of the development of the electricity transmission network with environmental restrictions that seek to minimise the overall environmental impact, it is necessary to incorporate the following principles in order to speed up the development of infrastructures to fulfil the objectives of maximising the penetration of renewables into the electricity system, minimising the risk of discharges and in a manner compatible with the safety of the electricity system; renewable energy transmission in areas where there are high levels of renewable resources and where it is environmentally possible to exploit and transport the energy generated, both onshore and offshore; maximising the use of the existing network, renewing, expanding capacity, using new technologies and re-using existing installations; removing existing technical constraints and reducing network losses. Finally, energy is a factor in the siting of economic activity, so the planning must provide an demands identified, including those derived from the development of high-speed rail infrastructure and electric vehicles, thus contributing to the generation of wealth, employment and structuring of the territory. In addition, the planning procedure will be revised so that it is compatible with new European directives and regulations. The development of projects in the electricity transmission network with particular effect on the internal market is specifically addressed in Measure 4.3 of this Plan.   Digitalisation and management The design and operation of the transmission and distribution networks will have to deal with important challenges such as the existence of a greater distributed generation with higher levels of intermittency than the current levels, as well as the transformation of the traditional model of one-directional energy flows from the generation centres towards a model of bidirectional and intermittent flows. Likewise, to optimise investments in a context of strong penetration of renewables and growing electrification of the economy, the networks will have to carry out a significant digitalisation process that will allow them to improve their monitoring, control and automation systems. Additionally, the digitalisation of networks will make it possible to carry out effective demand management and to integrate new services for consumers such as smart charging systems, storage or demand aggregators. One mechanism for promoting this is the remuneration schemes for regulated electricity distribution and transmission activities, which enable the necessary progress in digitalisation, encourage innovation and the application of alternative solutions to traditional investments that may entail savings for the system, and recognise the greater level of interaction between network operators and users, all within a context of greater penetration of distributed energy resources connected to the network. The transmission and distribution system operators will also play an important role in the penetration of new renewable generation so that it can be integrated safely into the system. In this sense, Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/631 of 14 April 2016 establishing a network code on requirements for grid connection of generators sets out the importance of close cooperation between generation installation owners and network operators. The latter will be responsible for verifying the conformity of the technical requirements that must be met by the new electricity generation modules in accordance with the provisions of the abovementioned regulation.   Definition of the network connection capacity In order to enable the new renewable energy generated to be transferred without oversizing the network it is necessary to review the criteria used to define the access and connection capacity of each node on the network, so that it is according to the maximum permissible power 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 88 transfer and the associated safety conditions and not according to the peak capacity of the installation to be connected. In addition, incentives should be provided to optimise network connection capacity, including through the hybridisation of renewable and/or storage technologies. Furthermore, it is necessary to guarantee the transparency of the connection capacity available on the network, with the aim of facilitating the development of new renewable capacity in the right locations. In this sense, the General State Administration and the CNMC will, within the scope of their respective competences, develop the regulatory framework that establishes the conditions and procedures necessary to process and obtain permits for access and connection to the networks. This regulatory development will contribute to achieving the objective of penetration of renewables and will adopt measures aimed at avoiding speculative behaviour for the benefit of any agents interested in developing projects.   Operating procedures The operating procedures will be reviewed and updated in line with economic and technological changes. d) Responsible bodies General State Administration (MITECO, CNMC, MCI), REE, distributors and managers of distribution networks and autonomous regional administrations.      3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 89 Measure 1.4. Development of own consumption using renewables and distributed generation  a) Description Own consumption with renewables brings energy generation closer to its consumption and, therefore, reduces losses, increases the involvement of consumers in the management of their energy and reduces the territorial impact of renewable production. Turning consumers into producers is a way to expand possible future sources of financing for the development of renewables. The following applications should be highlighted in this regard:   Collective own consumption and starting point for local energy communities Collective own consumption, developed in Royal Decree 244/2019, enables several consumers benefit collectively from the same nearby generation facilities, located within the community, which means that they can take advantage of the generation capacity and, therefore, of the investment. To make the most of this option it is necessary to streamline the economic and administrative costs involved and, in particular, to promote training and capacity-building programmes for the citizens and communities that can take advantage of collective own consumption so they can have the human and technical resources that will allow them to identify, process, execute and manage the projects, as well as to mobilise the necessary investments. This can entail them forming local energy communities, an objective that is promoted by Measure 1.13 of this Plan.  Combating energy poverty As set out in the 2019-2024 National Strategy against Energy Poverty (see Measure 4.11 of this Plan), own consumption systems can be a tool for mitigating energy poverty. In this sense, the housing and the activities of the social services should take account of the potential of own consumption to reduce electricity bills and the energy dependency of vulnerable families and groups. Measures promoting own consumption should also aim to make it affordable for everyone in society and, in particular, for those vulnerable consumers who are excluded from own consumption under market conditions without specific measures. Furthermore, collective own consumption schemes and more dynamic energy management mechanisms enable the public administrations and social organisations to manage situations of energy poverty not only through economic aid but also through the allocation of a share in collective own consumption promoted by these public administrations or social organisations, which would directly reduce the energy bills of consumers at risk of energy poverty.  Own consumption as a measure of competitiveness Energy is a cost factor in the majority of economic activities, for which reason energy price increases or variability can be particularly damaging to the competitiveness of businesses. The generalised installation of own-consumption facilities linked to economic activities (particularly in high-energy consumption environments like industrial parks) will enable energy costs to be reduced and stabilised in the long term. In this regard, special attention should be paid to the development of own consumption at irrigation facilities, given that this is a sector with intensive energy consumption and that the cost of energy is a fundamental factor in setting the prices of irrigated agricultural products. In order to achieve the successful uptake of this measure, it will be imperative for the administrations and irrigating communities to work together.  3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 90 Likewise, the involvement of the residential tourism sector will be sought in the promotion of electricity own consumption, due to the improved costs that can be achieved by the industry in the medium term, its knock-on effect on other sectors of the economy and the added value that it brings to the tourist offering in our country faced with European customers who are increasingly concerned about the climate crisis and energy transition. b) Objectives addressed Decentralised generation, generation using renewables, and public participation. c) Mechanisms The following mechanisms are planned to promote the development of own consumption:  National Own consumption Strategy The own consumption objectives will be set out in the future Strategy for the 2021-2030 period. As part of this strategy, the penetration potential will be analysed for each type of consumer (residential, services or tertiary, industrial), so that indicative objectives can be set for the period, which will be ambitious but achievable. The required technical-economic sustainability of the electricity system will also be considered, enabling both the distribution networks and the structure of the electricity tariff to be adapted to the new generation scenario. In any case, the deployment of own consumption in Spain will be monitored quantitatively and qualitatively, in accordance with the monitoring mechanisms provided for in Royal Decree 244/2019.  Soft financing This facilitates the mobilisation of private investment, enabling the return of financing based on the economic savings made as a result of the own consumption of the energy generated.  Management by third parties or the energy services model Under this model, companies specialising in energy services, such as electricity traders, invest in own consumption facilities and maintain them, selling the energy produced to consumers under favourable terms. This avoids the consumer company, family or administration having to make an investment in or take charge of an activity of which they have no experience.  Measures to promote local involvement Given the local nature of own consumption markets, it is necessary to implement promotion measures at the municipal, regional or, where applicable, island level, in particular by simplifying processes (e.g. the simple prior notification in the case of installations on buildings that are not protected for heritage purposes) and properly integrating the measures into urban planning instruments. The General State Administration will coordinate the development and monitoring of best practices with local, island and regional bodies for this purpose.  Promotion of own consumption in vulnerable sectors Promotion of experiments that take advantage of the potential of own consumption legislation to develop systems in which public or private self-consumers can share their generation surplus with vulnerable households, as well as other specific measures aimed at mitigating fuel poverty.  Manual for own consumption in urban environments The IDAE will produce a manual for the implementation of own consumption energy systems in urban environments to facilitate decision-making by municipal authorities.  d) Responsible bodies Local and autonomous regional administrations, with the general framework defined by the General State Administration, specifically the ministries responsible for energy (MITECO) and finance, and the IDAE.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 91 Measure 1.5. Incorporation of renewables in the industrial sector  a) Description The introduction of renewable energies in industry contributes to progressing towards the decarbonisation of the economy and the use of competitive energy alternatives. La Energía en España 2016final energy demand in the industrial sector accounted for around 24% in 2015. Renewable energy sources (primarily biomass) covered 7% of this demand. There is thus potential for biomass, as well as other thermal renewable energy sources (particularly, biogas and solar thermal energy) to contribute more heavily to the decarbonisation of the industrial sector. As for the possibilities of electricity own consumption in the industrial sector, although it has hardly been developed so far, there is also a potential to be exploited. When designing the mechanisms, both increasing the penetration of renewables into subsectors that already consume them and diversifying the industrial subsectors will be assessed, given that there is currently a concentration of renewable energy consumption in four very specific subsectors (cement production, pulp and paper production, drinks and tobacco, and timber and timber products). The progress of energy efficiency and process management in the industrial field is specifically addressed in Measure 2.5.  b) Objectives addressed To promote the decentralised generation of renewable energies and own consumption in industry.  c) Mechanisms The following actions are planned for the development of renewable energies in industry:  Aid programmes to incorporate renewable energies into industrial processes Aid lines for industries or the heating networks that supply them, depending on the potential, cost and characteristics of the technology and the potential improvement in their carbon footprint.  Institutional capacity building The specific incorporation of the energy dimension into industrial policy tools will be promoted (at all levels of the administration).  Sectoral agreements Voluntary agreements will be made with specific industrial subsectors to encourage increased consumption of renewable energy.  Aid for conducting energy studies, reports and audits that will help the industry to move towards less carbon intensive processes These studies should identify the different technology options in line with the specific process heat requirements of each industrial subsector (on the basis of the documents on the best available techniques developed within the framework of Directive 2010/75 on industrial emissions), their physical, technical and economic potential, and the identification of challenges and proposals for measures.  d) Responsible bodies MITECO, IDAE, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism (MINCOTUR), autonomous regional administrations and sectoral associations.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 92 Measure 1.6. Framework for the development of thermal renewable energies a) Description Energy consumption for thermal uses in Spain in 2015 accounted for more than 33% of the total final energy consumption. In the same year, the contribution of renewable energies to consumption for heating and cooling was around 16.8%. To achieve the objectives of this Plan, it will be necessary to double this contribution by 2030. The revised Renewable Energy Directive provides that Member States must implement the necessary measures to increase renewable energy quotas for consumption for heating and cooling by 1.3% annually from the value achieved in 2020 (1.1% if residual heat is not included). The path of thermal renewables envisaged in this Plan would make it possible to exceed this indicative objective. Renewable energy communities can therefore play an important role in achieving this objective, primarily in relation to the development of heating and cooling networks. With regard to heating and cooling networks, according to the statistics reported in the framework of Article 24(6) of Directive 2012/27/EU, the final energy consumption in heating and cooling networks in Spain in 2017 was 1,777.29 TJ (approx. 42.5 ktoe). Since the final energy consumption in the heating and cooling sector was 28,904.7 ktoe, the share of heating and cooling networks out of the total consumption in the heating and cooling sector was 0.15% (i.e. well below the 2% set out in Article 24(10)(a) of Directive 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources). However, and given the potential for developing district heating and cooling identified, this Plan considers specific measures, both regulatory and on financial support, to enable district heating and cooling using renewable fuels to play a much more significant role by 2030.  b) Objectives addressed Promotion of the penetration of renewable energy sources for thermal uses, in particular in the building sector and as regards heating and cooling networks.  c) Mechanisms  Assessment of the potential of energy from renewable sources and of the use of waste heat and cold and other uses, in the framework of Article 14 of Directive 2012/27/EU and Article 15 of Directive 2018/2001/EU. This assessment will be available by 31 December 2020 at the latest and will be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/826 amending Annexes VIII and IX to Directive 2012/27/EU and with the recommendations on the subject to be published by the European Commission. This assessment will include, inter alia, an estimate of heating and cooling demand in terms of useful energy and final energy consumption by sector; an identification and/or estimation of the current heating and cooling supply by technology; the identification of any installations (from the capacity thresholds detailed in the Regulation) that generate waste heat or cooling and their potential for providing heating or cooling; a forecast of trends in demand for heating and cooling in order to have an outlook for the next 30 years; an analysis of the economic potential of the various technologies, including heat pumps; and an overview of the legislative and non-legislative measures that will make it possible to achieve this economic potential. The result of this evaluation will be taken into account to update the evolutionary paths of renewable energies in thermal uses in the relevant revisions of this Plan, as well as in the implementation of the mechanisms described below.  Mechanisms guaranteeing a minimum share for renewable energies in the thermal uses sector In accordance with Article 23 of Directive 2018/2001/EU, the subjects affected, the eligible projects and how the energy contributions will be accounted for will be determined. The economic compensation that would be contributed by each subject, where appropriate, will also be calculated. This will serve as a source of funds, to be implemented through the aid programmes.    3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 93  A certificate/guarantee of origin mechanism or similar will be set up to either certify compliance with these measures or voluntarily verify the renewable origin of the thermal energy for actors not subject to the measures.  Specific mechanisms related to the building sector, where the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda (MITMA) plays a fundamental role: o Integration of thermal renewable energies in building It is necessary to review and increase the energy efficiency and renewable energy requirements in the Technical Building Code (Código Técnico de la Edificación  CTE), as well as the minimum requirements to be met by thermal installations, by means of the Regulations on Thermal Installations in Buildings (Reglamento de las Instalaciones Térmicas en los Edificios  RITE), for all new buildings and refurbishments. o Aid programmes (loans and subsidies) Aid schemes for installations in buildings or heating networks, depending on the characteristics, potential and cost of each technology and the potential impact on improving the carbon footprint. In particular, specific schemes will be created for: - Upgrading existing solar thermal facilities - High-efficiency ambient energy equipment to replace obsolete systems - Upgrading biomass equipment with other high-performance equipment - Geothermal energy facilities with heat pumps and direct use - -energy  - Integrated, standardised and compact heating and cooling thermal installations. The specific processing of support for small-scale facilities will be assessed, designing simplified lines through the equipment installer or retailer. The Ministry of Finance will also analyse the desirability and viability of possible changes to the fiscal framework to send signals with a view to incentivising electrification and the use of renewables for thermal requirements, and avoiding indirect subsidies for fossil fuels.  Mechanisms related to the promotion of heating and cooling networks o To annually collect the information needed to fulfil the statistical obligations on heating and cooling networks, both existing and new, including at least the installed capacity, technology used, fuel used, energy produced and whether the installation meets the 50% renewable energy, 50% waste heat, 75% cogenerated heat or 50% of a combination of such energy and heat). o Moreover, mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that information is provided to final consumers about energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy in the heat networks to which they are connected. The possibility of implementing this measure by amending the legislation on existing thermal installations (RITE), as well as the legislation concerning the energy certification of buildings, will be evaluated. o Evaluation of the potential of these networks in new urban development projects. o Development of renewable energy communities linked to climate control networks, including technical training at the municipal level. o Ensuring that a cost-benefit analysis is conducted for each new urban development. o Legislative analysis and implementation of measures for potential users.  d) Responsible bodies General State Administration (MITECO, Ministry of Finance and MITMA); local and autonomous regional administrations.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 94 Measure 1.7. Advanced biofuels in transport  a) Description Transport contributes heavily to greenhouse gas emissions (27% of the total in 2016). Consequently, it is a key sector in the decarbonisation process. Road and rail transport represent almost one third of total energy consumption, representing 28,241 ktoe in 2016 (28,368 ktoe according to the methodology established in the Renewable Energy Directive). That year, the contribution of renewable energies in this sector reached 5.3% (calculated pursuant to the aforementioned methodology). The revision of the Renewable Energy Directive establishes an overall objective for renewables in transport of 14% by 2030. Furthermore, specific objectives for advanced biofuels have been set for 2022 (0.2%), 2025 (1%) and 2030 (3.5%). This overall objective for renewable energies and, consequently, the decarbonisation of transport will be achieved by reducing consumption (for example, by promoting a modal shift) and with the contribution of different technologies (primarily biofuels and renewable electricity). The measures relating to both the modal shift, particularly in the sphere of urban and metropolitan mobility, and the electrification of transport, understood in terms of the vehicle fleet and recharging infrastructure, are explained in more detail in the Energy Efficiency section of this Plan, and therefore this measure is focused on advanced biofuels. Biofuels are currently the most widely available and widely used renewable technology in transport. Furthermore, in some sectors, such as heavy vehicles (whose consumption is a significant share of the total for road transport) and aviation, they will continue to be the only way to reduce the use of fossil fuels over the coming years. In order to achieve the objectives for consumption of advanced biofuel, advanced biofuel production must be boosted, as it is still very low. This is due, in some cases, to the limited availability of some of the raw materials required and, in others, to the lack of technological maturity of some of the manufacturing processes involved in producing this type of biofuel. With the exception of biofuels produced from the raw materials listed in Annex IX to Directive 2018/2001, the rest are expected to be produced from conventional agricultural products or similar. b) Objectives addressed Penetration of advanced biofuels in the transport sector. c) Mechanisms The following mechanisms are planned in this regard:  general obligation to sell or consume biofuels;  adaptation of the certification system to specifically cover advanced biofuels and, in particular, biomethane injected into the network;  aid programme for advanced biofuel production facilities;  promotion of facilities for the production of renewable fuels of non-biological origin;  establishing a specific obligation to sell or consume advanced biofuels for the 2021-2030 period;  promotion of the consumption of labelled blends of biofuels, through measures that enable this option to be offered at service stations;  establishing specific consumption objectives for biofuels in aviation. d) Responsible bodies MITECO and MCI.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 95 Measure 1.8. Promotion of renewable gases a) Description Renewable gases are one of the few renewable energy vectors that can be used both to generate electricity and to cover energy demand in high-temperature industrial processes and in transport. There are different types of renewable gases and this measure refers mainly but not exclusively to: biogas, biomethane and hydrogen of 100% renewable origin (both the resource and the energy used in the process to obtain it). To date, the promotion of renewable gases has been limited mainly to biogas. In terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, biogas achieves not only the reduction derived from using a 100% renewable fuel37, but also an additional reduction in non-energy emissions (mainly, CH4), linked to better management of municipal waste, sewage sludge and waste from both agriculture and livestock as well as the agri-food industry. The measures implemented to remunerate electricity generation at biogas plants have not achieved the expected results, with the use in Spain far below the existing potential and far from that achieved in other European countries. Primary energy from biogas in the European Union exceeded 16,000 ktoe for the first time in 2016, with Spbiomethane has gained importance as, once certain quality requirements are met, the biomethane can be injected into natural gas networks38. This means an improvement in the possibilities of biogas energy use. The European Biogas Association estimates that there are more than 500 biomethane plants with grid injection in the European Union, one of which is in Spain. The second plant is scheduled to start up in the first quarter of 2020. Biogas is the renewable gas that takes precedence in the short and medium term, due to aspects of technological development, available potential and production costs. After it is upgraded to biomethane, it can have the same uses and users, and uses the same infrastructure as natural gas39. It is of particular interest for decarbonising the demand that is usually linked to thermal uses in industry, and is difficult to decarbonise with other renewables. Additionally, its production and use is linked to waste management and the circular economy. In the long term, the appearance of hydrogen of 100% renewable origin (both the resource and the energy used in the process to obtain it) could be important as a flexible energy vector, allowing the integration of surplus variable renewable electricity and the use of gas infrastructures. Hydrogen can only be considered as a renewable gas when it is obtained using 100% renewable electricity, through processes such as water electrolysis. The use of 100% renewable hydrogen contributes to a twofold objective: on the one hand, to reducing local polluting emissions and greenhouse gases during the entire production and use cycle; on the other hand, to taking advantage of surplus electricity from renewable sources at times of low demand. Its main qualities are the following:  it could be used in fuel cell electric vehicles without generating local emissions. It can be used in heavy road transport or on ships, etc.;  its immediate use in industry (without the need to store it) as a substitute for other fossil fuels;                                                               37 Biogas (CH4 + CO2 + other traces) is obtained from the anaerobic digestion of the biodegradable fraction of livestock waste, sewage sludge etc. 38 Biomethane produced via the anaerobic digestion of waste produced from the raw materials under Annex IX.A to the Renewable Energy Directive (Directive 2009/28, amended by Directive 2015/1513). Annex V to Directive 2009/28, on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, establishes that the typical reduction in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the use of biogas produced from waste is between 80% and 86%, depending on the type of waste concerned. 39 Given the high global warming potential of methane, it is critical to consider the fugitive emissions of this gas from the various upgrading processes, since processes that do not achieve very high methane recovery yields will have associated GHG emissions that are much higher than other renewable gases such as biogas. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 96   its energy density40 makes it a suitable energy vector for storing energy (particularly seasonal) and subsequently releasing it gradually;  it can be converted into synthetic natural gas through CO2 capture and, in this case, it has no restrictions on being introduced into the natural gas networks. Additionally, as a result of the reduction in the costs of electricity produced using renewables, and of hydrogen electrolysis and energy recovery technologies, there are also potential opportunities for other renewable gases in the medium and long term. Finally, depending on technological development, mechanisms will be proposed to promote power to gas or the production of renewable gases through electricity.  b) Objectives addressed Promotion of renewable gases for use in electricity generation and thermal uses. c) Mechanisms The push to use renewable gas focuses on overcoming the main technical and administrative barriers it faces. Such barriers include the following, inter alia:  high cost of production from renewable sources, much higher than the extraction and processing of fossil fuels or the production of decarbonised (or low carbon) gas from raw materials of fossil origin;  there is no recognised certificate of origin to guarantee its renewable origin and enhance its consumption;  the need to clearly establish the rights, obligations and responsibilities of the participants involved in the production, transport and marketing of renewable gas, providing them with the necessary legal certainty to undertake their activity;  the advisability of defining the conditions for the physical injection (connection) of biomethane and the provision of biomethane transport and distribution service (access);  a lack of awareness among end users, especially with regard to the safety of its handling and the validity of the equipment, making it necessary to carry out dissemination, information and awareness-raising actions;  shortage of supply facilities. For example, hydroelectric plants are subject to a complex set of procedures to obtain the required permits, and are regulated as a set of independent facilities. They involve high investments and long recovery periods. In view of the above barriers, the penetration of renewable gas, including biomethane, 100% renewable hydrogen and other fuels where their manufacture has used only raw materials and energy that are of renewable origin, will be encouraged through the approval of specific plans, including RDI actions both for biogas and hydrogen and for less mature technologies such as power to gas. To carry out these plans, the situation of renewable gases in Spain will be analysed, taking into account the different degrees of technological maturity of the different options, which will include the following:  Determining and projecting the theoretical production potential by 2030/2050. Justification of the associated demand, technically viable and economically profitable in comparison with other decarbonisation options, considering benefits based on system flexibility (electricity-gas binomial), as well as the potential to use and exploit the existing natural gas network.  Defining a strategy for determining the most efficient use and the most effective way to take advantage of this resource.  Designing aid mechanisms, based on penetration targets that make it possible to use the renewable gas efficiently, supported by a certification system that makes it possible to oversee and monitor targets, as well as flexibility mechanisms that encourage maximum efficiency in achieving the targets in competition with other decarbonisation options.                                                            40 The energy density of H2 is equivalent to about one-third the energy density of methane (CH4). 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 97  Developing regulations that permit the injection of these renewable gases into the natural gas network.   Determining a system of guarantees of origin for renewable gases that confirms their origin and traceability and the environmental impact associated with their production and use.  Identifying and removing regulatory barriers that hinder the development of renewable gases, especially power to gas.  d) Responsible bodies General State Administration (MITECO); local and autonomous regional administrations.  Measure 1.9. Plan for the technological upgrading of existing electricity generation projects with renewable energies  a) Description Over the 2021-2030 decade, approximately 22 GW of renewable electricity capacity will have come to the end of its statutory useful life. Without a specific plan for the technological upgrading of these projects, it is foreseeable that there will be a reduction in the installed capacity from renewables, which is basically made up of old wind farms and small-scale hydroelectric plants, although the earliest biomass, biogas and photovoltaic facilities would also be affected. With the aim of preventing the loss of their energy contribution, it is necessary to develop a specific plan for the technological upgrading of these facilities. Existing renewable electricity generation facilities represent a significant asset given their location in places with high energy resources, the existing infrastructure and network connection capacity, as well as the low environmental and territorial impact of developing new projects in locations already used for generating energy. Upgrading the generators at or repowering existing projects will enable better use of the renewable resource by replacing obsolete or old systems with new higher-powered or more efficient ones. On the other hand, both these mechanisms as well as hybridisation through the incorporation of different generation or storage technologies into existing projects will enable better use of the available network connection capacity. In grid, which will enable a more efficient use of the network and facilitate the connection of new renewable power at that node. On an environmental level, re-machining, repowering and hybridisation can have a lower impact by concentrating renewable generation in a specific environment, reducing the total number of machines, and thus   b) Objectives addressed Development of renewable energies. Renewal of old renewable facilities to maintain their capacity.  c) Mechanisms The following mechanisms are planned:  Administrative simplification Article 16(6) of Directive 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources stipulates that the repowering of renewable projects must be subject to a simplified and swift permit-granting scheme, lasting no longer than one year. Since existing projects have already undergone administrative processing prior to being authorised, it is necessary to assess, inter alia, the possibility of applying the following simplifications during this processing, while safeguarding the proper integration of the infrastructure into the territory: exemption from the public interest procedure and the procedure for declaring the property and rights affected; exemption from the requirement to submit a new archaeological study, if one was already submitted for the existing facility; reduction of the processing times for environmental impact assessments; reduction of the timescales for notifying other public administrations for administrative authorisation and sending out the technical conditions for the approval of the project; and simplification of the requirements for demonstrating the  3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 98  In the specific case of the environmental impact assessment, the existence of common cases between possible repowering projects makes it advisable to establish relatively homogeneous criteria and conditions for the processing of repowering projects.  Setting up coordination committees with the autonomous communities In order to coordinate the administrative simplification described above, the active involvement of the autonomous communities is required, given their powers in the areas of urban planning and the environment and their knowledge of the reality in each territory.  Calls for tenders for the allocation of a specific remuneration scheme for technological upgrading projects Specific tenders are proposed for the technological upgrading of renewable facilities that have reached the end of their statutory useful life. Thus, allocated projects that upgrade their equipment and facilities would receive a remuneration in addition to the one from the electricity market. The mechanism envisaged is a competitive tendering procedure, with a multi-annual schedule of tenders, to determine a cost-effective remuneration scheme for the application of public support, accompanied by the administrative measures required to take advantage of existing infrastructure. Both generator upgrade projects (with lower or equal capacity to that of the existing facility) and repowering projects (that involve an increase in capacity) will be accepted.  Regulation of the end of hydroelectric power station concessions With a view to ensuring the necessary investments and ensuring that power stations do not cease to operate, once existing concessions end, it will be necessary to define the procedures and timescales applicable to these facilities via regulations.  d) Responsible bodies General State Administration, local and autonomous regional administrations.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 99 Measure 1.10. Promotion of bilateral renewable electricity contracts  a) Description Globally, cities, communities, companies and individuals are demonstrating their interest in consumption of 100% renewable energy. The GO 100% RE initiative has mapped countries, cities, regions, companies and civil society actors, with a total of more than 62 million people that have made the change or are committed to making the change within the next decade to 100% renewable electricity supply. The private sector is supporting the energy transition through the demand for renewable energy, with initiatives such as RE100, an international initiative launched during Climate Week NYC 2014, formed by private companies committed to 100% renewable electricity consumption. To date, numerous multinationals have joined the commitment to consume 100% renewable electricity. These companies operate in a wide range of sectors: automotive, clothing, finance, food and drink, IT, pharmaceuticals, property, retail, etc. One possible mechanism for achieving a 100% renewable electricity supply is to enter into a bilateral contract with an electricity producer. Currently, in Spain, where bilateral contracts have started to take off, the main buyers within this scheme are power-marketing companies. Although bilateral contracts represent an opportunity to complement other remuneration mechanisms and attract financing, they are not without challenges, such as those related to designing an optimal contract that balances the needs of the producer and the consumer, or the lack of knowledge among potential buyers about the existence of this mechanism. The contracting of energy efficiency measures in the public sector is addressed separately in Measure 2.12.  b) Objectives addressed Development of renewable energies and participation of new actors, by promoting the contracting of 100% renewable electrical energy.  c) Mechanisms In addition to the mechanisms envisaged in the specific measures on public contracting of renewable energy and promoting the proactive role of consumers, mechanisms to encourage long-term bilateral contracting with renewable energy producers will be analysed, as instruments to reduce the risk of these operations or minimum contributions for certain large energy consumers.  d) Responsible bodies Sectoral associations, MITECO, local and autonomous regional administrations.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 100 Measure 1.11. Specific programmes for the use of biomass  a) Description The management and use of biomass has added value in addition to its simple energy capacity. In particular, it can revitalise rural areas, mitigate the risk of depopulation and encourage better adaptation to the effects of climate change in some territories. Biomass can also play an instrumental role in terms of achieving a just transition. For this reason, biomass is part of various strategies put forward by the different public administrations beyond the scope of this Plan. Furthermore, waste is a key factor in the circular economy. It is therefore necessary to take steps to enable the linking and achievement of both objectives: a just transition and a circular economy. For heat and electricity with biomass, it can be expected that the greatest development will occur with biomass of forest or agricultural origin (in industry, in general, it is already being used). An additional 1,600 ktoe/year is required for the increase in electricity generation and an additional 411 ktoe/year for thermal uses. In the Renewable Energies Plan (PER) 2011-2020, it was conservatively estimated that the additional potential in Spain is 17,286 ktoe/year, of which 10,433 ktoe/year is sustainable agricultural or forestry waste and the difference is new woody or grassy mass. Consequently, there are more than enough resources.  b) Objectives addressed Penetration of renewable energy sources and displacement of fossil fuels, participation of new actors and innovation.  c) Mechanisms Among the specific mechanisms to be implemented, the following stand out:  Promotion of energy from biomass with sustainability criteria o Legislative development throughout the biomass value chain. o Strategy for the energy use of pruning waste from the agricultural sector. o Adaptation to obligations associated with air quality at both new and existing biomass facilities. o Strengthening certification and the principle of proximity to the source for biomass use. o Dissemination and promotion of high-efficiency, low-emission local heating equipment. o Specific training for installers and other professionals in the biomass sector.  Economic aid measures linked to: o Biomass logistics plants. o Penalising the landfilling of waste. The establishment of agreed principles for the harmonised implementation (and creation, where applicable) of a tax on landfilling municipal and industrial waste, as already exists in various autonomous communities, will be encouraged. o Use of biomass in State-owned facilities.  d) Responsible bodies General State Administration and autonomous regional administrations.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 101 Measure 1.12. Unique projects and strategy for sustainable energy on the islands a) Description Before their generalised implementation, all technologies, including energy technologies, have to go  the integration of research, innovation and competitiveness (RIC) policies with market development, is often characterised by a substantial increase in the investment required, combined with a low level of technical reliability. Many technological developments fall at this hurdle because they do not have the (public and private) investment required to make the jump from the pilot phase of the project, something that must encourage public administrations and the private sector to join forces through the formation of partnerships. Examples of past efforts include Sotavento in the field of wind energy and Ecocarburantes Españoles in the field of biofuels. The innovative technologies that must be developed in order to achieve the objectives of the National Plan are covered in more detail under the fifth dimension of this National Plan. As regards this measure, it should be noted that the uniqueness in question refers not only to innovative projects but to the challenges faced as well. For example, these could relate to geographical (being on an island) or market conditions, as in the case of high-temperature geothermal for the large-scale generation of electricity, for which there is no market in Spain despite it being a mature technology, or in the case of offshore wind, which if developed around island territories would involve both types of uniqueness. In addition, a short-term opportunity has been identified that would have the use of these island territories as drivers and ffshore wind, associated with the incorporation of storage requirements and support for the electricity system, with a greater impact on reducing GHG emissions and even avoiding current costs for the electricity system associated with the General State Budget. It is vital for the public sector, in collaboration with the private sector, to spearhead pilot or demonstration projects that demonstrate the viability of, or need for, new models or systems that are still not fully market ready.  b) Objectives addressed Market development for new renewable energy technologies. c) Mechanisms Two main mechanisms are proposed:  Development plan for unique projects contribution or public-private collaboration will be particularly important. The support system best adapted to the development of the project can be used (corporate shareholding, financing, third-party financing (TPF), temporary joint venture, etc.).  Sustainable energy on the islands In May 2017, Spain, together with the European Commission and 13 other Member States, signed the architects of their own energy transition and the opportunity to take full advantage of these territories as a testing ground for energy transition technologies or policies that could then be exported to the continent. With this objective in mind, the General State Administration will propose sustainable energy strategies for the Balearic and Canary Islands, in collaboration with their respective autonomous and island governments, which will make it possible to reduce the energy cost overruns in these territories. In particular, these strategies will seek the appropriate territorial integration of renewables and the ability to supply firm power and other services, such as frequency stabilisation or black starts in the event of zero voltage, as well as emissions-free modes of transport and the integration of the change in the energy model into the water cycle. It will also be necessary to make progress with the interconnection between the extra-peninsular systems and to reduce the energy dependency of these territories, as stated in Measure 3.2 of this Plan.  d) Responsible bodies General State Administration (MITECO, IDAE), island autonomous communities. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 102  Measure 1.13. Local energy communities a) Description European legislation aims to boost the role of citizens as drivers of the energy transition, and to this end it defines two new legal entities:  renewable energy community (as defined in Directive 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources);  citizen energy community (as defined in Directive 2019/944 on common rules for the internal market for electricity).  Both legal entities, which must be transposed into Spanish law, have two common elements: they must be controlled by partners or members in the vicinity of the projects and their aim must be to provide environmental, economic and social benefits to their partners or members or to the local areas where they operate. Additionally, in the case of renewable energy communities, the partners must be natural persons, SMEs or local authorities (including municipalities). The main difference between the two entities is that, while the objective of the renewable energy community is to carry out projects of any nature (electric, thermal or transport) provided the energy source is renewable, the citizen energy community has been designed to cover any project related to the electricity sector, including distribution, supply, consumption, aggregation, energy storage, provision of energy efficiency services or the provision of electric vehicle charging services, or other energy services to its members. With regard to renewable energy communities, the existing barriers and their potential for development will be assessed, among other measures. It should also be ensured that they can produce, consume, store and sell renewable energy, in particular through renewable electricity purchase contracts, as well as have access to all appropriate energy markets, both directly and through aggregation. With regard to citizen energy communities, among other measures, they should be allowed to own, establish, acquire or lease distribution networks and manage them autonomously, as well as to access all organised markets.  b) Objectives addressed To facilitate the participation of citizens, SMEs and local authorities in the energy transition.  c) Mechanisms   The appropriate legislative framework will be developed to define these legal entities and to promote their development, in particular to comply with Article 22 of Directive 2018/2001 and Article 16 of Directive 2019/944. The development of the legislative framework must take into account the roles and cases of existing actors or groups that could set themselves up as local energy communities, such as cooperatives, industrial parks, technolassociations or port areas.  Elimination of barriers by establishing a one-stop shop that makes it possible to guide the applicant, acting as a facilitator of administrative procedures, as well as promoting the simplification of procedures in processes linked to local energy community projects.  Promotion of demonstration projects of local energy communities that cover the widest possible range of cases, identifying and enabling viable business models for the different types of projects, enabling them to be developed on a large scale.  3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 103   Measure 1.14. Promoting the proactive role of citizens in decarbonisation a) Description Citizens are at the centre of the energy transition, since they can: (1) encourage policy adoption and enhance the social and environmental accountability of companies; (2) benefit from the jobs created; and (3) consume, finance, invest in, sell, exchange, manage and produce renewable energy. The transition to a decarbonised energy system is a major technological and social challenge, but also an opportunity to give citizens a central role in the energy sector, in accordance with the Clean energy for all Europeans package. According to a recent study41, 30.9% of users in Spain would like to exercise their buying power and choose a new electricity supplier that guarantees that it produces and sells 100% renewable electricity, and is owned by citizens. Citizen financial participation in renewable energy production projects helps to direct household savings towards financing the energy transition. The cited study states that 12.1% of the people consulted would take on the role of an investor citizen who invests their savings by participating in renewable energy generation plants directly, without being a co-owner. 16% would be interested in co-owning a renewable facility financed by private individuals. These attitudes contribute to a better socio-economic anchoring of renewable energies in the territories, participating in local development, and making it possible to lead people to become aware of or even mobilise on energy issues. The challenge is to promote the proactive role of citizens in the energy transition and more specifically in the deployment of renewable energies.  b) Objectives addressed To empower citizens and promote their participation in the energy transition. To improve their ability to choose a 100% renewable supply and encourage companies to redirect their offer towards a more renewable service in order to offer this service to consumers with greater social commitment and more environmental responsibility. To promote the mobilisation of available funds by citizens to help finance the renewable energy transition or to manage their own energy. To promote citizen participation in the definition of local, regional and national energy policies.  c) Mechanisms The following mechanisms are planned:  Mechanisms to promote the diversity of actors and the existence of participatory citizen projects. Mechanisms will be established via regulations to promote the diversity of actors and the existence of participatory citizen projects, to promote both social and territorial cohesion and a just transition, and to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the new decarbonised generation model.                                                              41 Energía colaborativa. El poder de la ciudadanía de crear, compartir y gestionar renovables (Collaborative energy. The power of citizens to create, share and manage renewables); Greenpeace; 2017.  Training and capacity-building programmes for local energy communities to enable them to obtain the human and technical resources required to identify, process, execute and manage the projects, as well as to mobilise the necessary investments.  Analysis of the creation within the IDAE of an office to promote and support local energy communities that, among other mechanisms, will design and implement specific lines of guarantees and/or financing; provide technical assistance; promote the joint acquisition of equipment and services; and identify and disseminate best practice.  d) Responsible bodies MITECO and IDAE. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 104  A support mechanism will be established through which participatory projects can enter into a contract of sale for their electricity at a fixed price tied to the result of the tenders. An annual quota will be reserved for these projects, which will be granted to the first that request it and comply with the requirements until the energy quota is met. Furthermore, the question will be assessed of whether the projects that join the support mechanism could have public guarantees to facilitate financing and make it cheaper. In addition, options will be assessed to design tenders that favour projects that take into account the social component through, among other things, citizen participation in financing or the existence of a profit-sharing plan, where part of the revenue is allocated to activities agreed with local agents.  Instruments of support and collective financing adapted to the real environment of cities and the rural world, where competition criteria are considered and where local citizen participation is appropriate aggregation of projects will be assessed to facilitate, inter alia, access to European support mechanisms (i.e. ELENA42) for the development of renewable projects in general, as well as to green and innovative public procurement tenders.  Promotion of action mechanisms in the municipal sphere to promote associations or partnerships between municipalities and citizen groups, given the existing synergies and the mutual benefits to be achieved. The municipality can be a strategic advisor by co-investing as a partner in participative citizen projects, or even by becoming an infrastructure operator (existing and/or future) with a high effect/impact on the success of the so-called participative citizen projects.  Identification and removal of legal, administrative and economic barriers to the introduction of the direct purchase and sale of renewable electricity between producers and consumers regardless of their size, with the aim of facilitating a greater positive impact of citizen buying power on the energy transition. This guarantees consumers that they are actually paying for renewable energy. In addition, unlike guarantees of renewable origin, total hourly coverage with renewable energies is guaranteed for the consumer.  Citizen participation in demand management (individual or aggregate), through the necessary mechanisms to ensure that the structures of tariffs, tolls and electricity charges are designed to give a favourable signal both for active demand management and for consumption reduction. The promotion of demand management in general is driven by another specific measure in this Plan.  Full right of consumers to have real-time access to their energy data at no additional cost and to transfer these data to third parties without any impediment. With the aim of promoting and facilitating citizen participation in the design and implementation of local, regional and national energy policies, the IDAE will work with public administrations and social actors to generate good practices in these processes, as well as to monitor them over time. Energy literacy and transparency of information on the energy system must be improved in order to make citizen activation a reality. To that end, work will be done with local administrations and civil society to set up information and advisory systems for citizens about their energy, bills, consumption and environmental and social impacts.  d) Responsible bodies MITECO and IDAE.                                                                42 https://www.eib.org/en/products/advising/elena/index.htm 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 105 Measure 1.15. Just Transition Strategy a) Description The energy transition will generate many opportunities for economic development and employment, although in some cases there will be negative impacts, which will be particularly significant in those areas where fossil fuels are important to the local economy. Therefore, during the change process it is necessary to guide the economic sectors affected most, supporting the adaptation of companies and people to the new situation. The commitment to incorporate just transition policies into climate action measures aimed at transforming modes of production and consumption was agreed by the countries that are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at COP21. On the other hand, the ILO Guidelines for a just transition were adopted in 2015, providing a framework that countries can use, adopted through consensus, to guide the transition to low-carbon economies. In order for the just transition to be incorporated into energy transition and decarbonisation policies, the Just Transition Strategy was presented in February 2019 as a solidarity-based guidance strategy, within the Strategic Framework for Energy and Climate, also shaped by the Climate Change Bill and the INECP.  b) Objectives addressed  To facilitate the exploitation of employment opportunities and the improvement of the competitiveness and social cohesion generated by the energy transition.  To carry out sectoral plans in the main economic sectors, analysing challenges, opportunities, and threats and designing the necessary measures to carry out their transformation.  To minimise the negative impacts on vulnerable areas due to the energy transition through just transition agreements, as well as to provide technical and financial support for their implementation, as in the case of the Urgent Action Plan for coal-fired regions and plants undergoing closure. c) Mechanisms The Just Transition Strategy is the State-level instrument aimed at the ecological transition of the economy and the adoption of measures to ensure fair treatment for workers affected by the transition. In order to take advantage of the opportunities, green employment policies, vocational training policies, better guidance for companies and the promotion of transition guidance plans for industry and other sectors are all proposed. To minimise the negative impacts, the main mechanism is the Just Transition Agreements. The priority objective of these agreements will be maintaining and creating activity and employment in the affected regions, through guidance for sectors and groups at risk; maintaining population in the rural territories; and promoting diversification and specialisation consistent with the socio-economic context of each area. The agreements will give priority to those sectors with the best results in terms of environmental, economic and social sustainability. For short-term challenges such as the closure of mines and coal-fired power stations that have not made any investments, as well as nuclear power stations without previous conversion plans, the Strategy incorporates a 2019-2021 Urgent Action Plan with the following objectives:  ensuring that workers who lose their jobs in mining companies that close down receive adequate compensation, such as early retirement or severance pay;  maintaining, in the short term, employment for the mining regions through the Mine Restoration Plan and the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Plan and other plans to be developed with mining municipalities;  offering the regions subject to the closure of mines, coal-fired power stations or nuclear power plants the implementation of transitional agreements with the aim of ensuring that the closures do not affect employment and the population at the end of the process. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 106  With these objectives, the Just Transition Agreements will include tools such as:  guaranteeing the affected territories priority access to part or all of the electricity transmission capacity, as well as priority access to the use of the water covered by concessions;  promoting energy policy tools such as the possibility of specific renewables tenders for these territories;  promoting priority access to aid and funds, such as the Support Programme for Productive Industrial Investment (REINDUS), or to State investments for the conservation and enrichment of the historical and architectural heritage. Finally, among other instruments, the actions of the City Foundation for Energy will be oriented towards promoting measures in the area of Just Transition (see Measure 5.10).  d) Responsible bodies MITECO, in collaboration with the Ministry of Labour and Social Economy; Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA); MITMA and MINCOTUR, in cooperation with regional and local governments and business organisations, trade unions and other social organisations.    3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 107 3.1.2 Cross-cutting measures to promote renewable energy  Measure 1.16. Public procurement of renewable energy  a) Description At present, Framework Agreement 23/2017, formalised on 31 July 2018, on the supply of electricity to the General State Administration, its autonomous bodies, management bodies and common services of Social Security and other public State bodies, and other attached entities, establishes that the supply of electricity will have a 50% guarantee of origin, unless the body concerned has established a higher percentage in the additional requirements. Furthermore, in December 2018, the Council of Ministers approved the Ecological Public Procurement Plan of the General State Administration, which sets the target of procuring electricity from 100% renewable sources by 2025, for all electricity consumption in the buildings and services of the General State Administration. Bearing in mind that, in their current design, guarantees of origin do not guarantee new investments in renewable energies, the possibility will be analysed, with a view to the next Framework Agreement, of replacing the requirement of guarantees of origin with the implementation of mechanisms for purchasing electricity from renewable sources through long-term purchase agreements. Such agreements will encourage new installations, as well as innovative formulas that allow, inter alia, the installation of own consumption generation systems in public buildings. To make further progress on the decarbonisation path, similar objectives need to be promoted in the rest of the public administrations, both regional and local, through the dissemination of information, model specifications and tenders and good practice manuals.  b) Objectives addressed  Decarbonisation of the electricity supply of the General State Administration and the rest of the public administrations.  Promotion of new renewable energy generation and pumping installations.  c) Mechanisms  Design and implementation of new framework agreements for the purchase of 100% renewable energy, as well as the introduction of renewable own consumption systems in public buildings.  Analysis of the design and implementation of centralised tenders for the purchase of long-term renewable electricity, from new facilities.  Analysis of the potential of innovative public procurement (see Measure 5.5 of this Plan) for the implementation of renewables in the public sphere.  d) Responsible bodies Ministry of Finance and MITECO.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 108 Measure 1.17 Training professionals in the renewable energy sector a) Description growth of employment between 253,000 and 348,000. In 2012, the International Renewable Agency (IRENA) was already reporting that meeting commitments in the field of renewable energies would require qualified professionals throughout the value chain, and it identified the need to increase and improve the training of professionals in renewable energies as one of the main challenges for the sector. The effects of the shortage and poor training of professionals result in a slowdown in the pace of development, economic losses on projects and a worsening of reputation for the technologies concerned. Both the new and existing professionals in the sector, along with professionals from other sectors affected by the just transition, need high-quality continuous training that will allow them to face the new challenges of the future labour markets. The autonomous communities are responsible for education and training. Furthermore, a significant proportion of training is currently done within the companies themselves. The Plan initially proposes that the different levels of government work together with associations from the sector and the trade unions to identify the profiles needed to meet the objectives in the Plan, and subsequently promote the adoption of best practices to increase the training of deficient profiles in cooperation with the bodies concerned.  b) Objectives addressed In anticipation of the implementation of new decarbonisation technologies, it is necessary to anticipate market demands and promote continuous training at the five levels of approved professional qualification, bearing in mind that the Single European Market demands training in professional skills that will facilitate mobility within the EU. The actions below seek to achieve this.  Improve training. Technology is advancing rapidly and it is necessary to adapt and continuously improve the existing training offer, allowing professional skills to be updated on an ongoing basis to stay competitive in the labour market.  Increase the offer in training. The Plan envisages new professional profiles related to technologies that are forecast to take off markedly, but where there is hardly any market today, such as new energy storage systems. It is necessary to develop and implement new qualifications and specialities.  Attract talent. The energy sector needs new talent. Access to new training opportunities must be provided. To that end, on the one hand, labour market opportunities must be disseminated and, on the other, mechanisms must be put in place (scholarships, credits, etc.) so that those who wish to do so may have access to them under equal conditions. It is necessary to spread the possibilities of having a professional career within the new decarbonised economy. A recent study confirms that the renewable energy sector represents an opportunity to attract female talent in particular43. c) Mechanisms  Determination of the professional profiles required throughout the value chain for the technologies associated with the development of the Plan.  Adaptation of qualification levels to the needs of the labour market resulting from the application of the INECP.  Awareness-attention to the job opportunities offered by the energy transition.                                                              43 Education and training gaps in the renewable energy sector; Lucas et al.; Solar Energy 173 (2018) 449455. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 109 d) Responsible bodies General State Administration (MITECO, IDAE, the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training, the National Qualifications Institute (INCUAL), the State Public Employment Service (SEPES), the Ministry of Science and Innovation (MCI), autonomous communities, local authorities, energy agencies, renewable sector associations, industrial and services sector associations, training companies, trade unions and professional associations.    Measure 1.18. Revision and simplification of administrative procedures  a) Description Delays in project implementation make it more expensive to move forward with a project. There is a risk that administrative procedures, in terms of timescales or processes, could prolong or generate uncertainty around whether permits will be granted, without necessarily offering improvements or guarantees as regards environmental or social issues, or adaptation to the local area. Furthermore, current administrative procedures are not, in general, adapted or designed to handle the deployment of hybrid facilities where different renewable energy generation technologies share the same space, unlocking the opportunities for territorial integration that new technologies or ways of organising installations offer. In conclusion, it is necessary to revise the administrative procedures involved with a view to streamlining projects and avoiding unnecessary charges for operators. The following must be reviewed:  how to process new renewable facility projects, including alternative hybrid projects involving different renewable technologies, both for feeding the energy generated into the grid and for partial own consumption;  the legislative barriers or gaps that hinder the participation of local energy communities in the system.  b) Objectives addressed  Deployment of onshore and offshore renewable energies, including hybrid projects.  Deployment of decentralised generation (own consumption and energy communities).  Streamlining and clarifying administrative procedures for renewable projects.  Minimising the impact on the territory.  c) Mechanisms  Setting up round tables with the autonomous communities. Identification of best practices in administrative processes at local, regional and state level that are clear, objective, effective and efficient and that deliver value in terms of guaranteeing environmental protection, public interest and the adaptation of the projects to the local reality. This process should be the joint responsibility of all actors to guarantee the equitable development of renewable energy capacity throughout the country.  Updating administrative procedures. The aim will be to adapt the administrative procedures to include procedures for hybrid projects involving different renewable technologies. The administrative procedure for facilities in the marine environment that generate electricity from wind and ocean energy will also be adapted, with particular attention to reducing processing times for test platforms and RDI projects.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 110  Territorial integration of renewables. The fulfilment of the renewable development objectives established in this Plan must be compatible with compliance with the legislation on natural heritage and biodiversity. In any case, additional measures will be promoted, such as the creation of spaces for the conservation and promotion of native biodiversity, with special consideration for species in vulnerable situations. To that end, before the Plan commences, the IDAE will draw up a good practice manual to mitigate or reduce the environmental and landscape impacts of renewable electricity generation facilities that involve the occupation of large areas of land, with precise recommendations on location, construction and integration, in order to significantly preserve biodiversity, ecosystem services and the landscape.  Procedure guide. To facilitate the application of existing procedures for both developers and the various public bodies involved in these procedures, the IDAE will publish a guide that brings together in a single document the various regulations applicable to the processing of renewable energy projects, as well as recommendations and best practice. The document will make it possible to avoid processing errors that require costly and time-consuming corrections, as well as to identify potential improvements for reviewing the procedures themselves.  Simplification of procedures. The administrative procedures for granting the necessary permits for the construction and commissioning of production facilities using renewable energy sources, as well as for facilitating the repowering of existing facilities, will be streamlined, ensuring a simplified and rapid permit-granting procedure. In that regard, the meaning of non-substantial modification will be defined, for the purpose exemption from the obligation to obtain prior administrative authorisation and a construction permit, pursuant to Article 53(2) of Law 24/2013 of 26 December 2013. This will further simplify the authorisation procedures for production facilities.  Specific authorisation for experimental projects. Mechanisms will be developed for the administrative authorisation of projects of an experimental nature or intended for test benches, such as those described in Measure 5.7 of this Plan, so that an enclosure or boundary conditions can be authorised that must be met by the project or the different elements tested as part of it, and so that a completely new procedure is not required when specific elements of the project are modified within the conditions set.  d) Responsible bodies General State Administration, regional and local administrations.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 111 Measure 1.19. Generating knowledge, outreach, awareness and training a) Description One of the challenges facing the Plan is the rapid evolution of technology in the energy sector and in efforts to mechanisms, it is essential to establish a mechanism to generate the knowledge required. The transition to a decarbonised energy system is a technological and social challenge. This measure seeks to anchor the need to decarbonise in the public consciousness and that of the public and private sectors, and to disseminate tools, technologies and practices to reduce fossil fuel consumption, increase the contribution of renewable energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and take advantage of the potential of carbon sinks. b) Objectives addressed Proactive participation of all actors in the energy transition. c) Mechanisms  Knowledge generation Objective and approved qualitative and quantitative data and information are of the utmost importance for decision-making and maintaining the trust both of the sector and of the public in general. MITECO, through the IDAE or other institutional bodies, will work in the area of energy transition with actors in the sector to identify and close information gaps. Studies and analyses will be conducted both on the evolution and potential of energy technologies and on drafting a Spanish strategy for developing offshore wind.  Public awareness campaigns Studies carried out both by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) show that one of the barriers to the social acceptance of renewables is the persistence of misinformation about them, due, among other factors, to the lack of a united voice and the lack of good communication practices. The mechanisms considered include: o public awareness campaigns at the Energy and Environment International Trade Fair (Genera) held annually in Madrid; o MITECO, through the IDAE, in close collaboration with MITMA and other institutional bodies, will identify messages and work with communication professionals (journalists and companies in the sector) to identify a common language for renewable energies, dismantle the possible prejudices against them and increase their social acceptance among the public.  Sectoral information and training campaigns on energy and climate Despite their enormous potential, renewable energies are still poorly understood in some sectors. It is necessary to improve the information available about them, particularly in order that the industrial and services sectors understand the benefits of using them. Information and training campaigns can be coordinated in collaboration with the target sectors, by signing agreements between administrations, energy agencies, renewable sector associations, industrial associations, technology institutes, professional associations or associations of developers in the services sector. Furthermore, communication and information, as well as training of professionals in the energy efficiency sector, are specifically addressed in Measures 2.15 and 2.16, respectively. In the past, information campaigns linked to the promotion of programmes for the development of renewable technologies in buildings and industries have had a significant impact in terms of improved user perception of the advantages of using these technologies. These programmes had their own identifying image linked to quality control of the participating companies, in an attempt to ensure the success of the activities.  Access to information on consumption 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 112 As set out in Measure 4.6, Data access, giving the public and the productive sectors easy and instant access to their energy consumption data, as well as the opportunity to share this information with third parties, is necessary in order to harness the potential of energy management, the drive for own consumption and the development of new services to facilitate decarbonisation.  Strengthening the inclusion of ecological criteria in public procurement Public authorities should seek to procure goods, services and works with a reduced environmental impact throughout their life cycle when compared with goods, services and works with the same procurement is underpinned by the changes concerning environmental considerations introduced by Law 9/2017 of 8 November 2017 on Public Sector Contracts. The creation of an Interministerial Commission for the incorporation of ecological criteria into public procurement (Royal Decree 6/2018 of 12 January 2018), together with the Ecological Public Procurement Plan (2018-2025), will serve as the driving force. Public procurement in the fields of renewable energy and energy efficiency is specifically addressed in Measures 1.16 and 2.12, respectively.  Promoting the calculation of carbon footprints and their reduction This will be approached via various means. One of the main ones is to promote the participation of Spanish organisations in calculating carbon footprint, compensation and voluntary carbon dioxide absorption projects created in 2014 by means of Royal Decree 163/2014 of 14 March 2014. This will be promoted through training and the development and dissemination of guides and tools. Other areas of work will involve including the carbon footprint in public procurement, calculating the carbon footprints of ministerial departments and promoting carbon footprint calculation and reduction efforts among Spanish municipalities. Finally, the possibility will be assessed of promoting the calculation and registration of the carbon footprint of specific entities.  d) Responsible bodies General State Administration (MITECO, IDAE, MCI), autonomous communities, local authorities, energy agencies, renewable sector associations, industrial and services sector associations, training companies, trade unions and professional associations.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 113 3.1.3 Emissions Trading Systems (ETS) sectors  The policies and measures in these sectors fall within the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC; Directive (EU) 2018/410 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2018 amending Directive 2003/87/EC to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments, and Decision (EU) 2015/1814.  In Spain, the European emissions trading system is governed by Law 1/2005 of 9 March 2005, as well as various Royal Decrees implementing this law. This system affects around 900 industrial and electricity generation installations in Spain, as well as more than 30 active aircraft operators.  Furthermore, through the fourth Additional Provision of Law 1/2005, Spain has implemented Article 27 of Directive 2003/87/EC, which permits Member States to exclude small emitters and hospitals from emissions trading. In 2011, Spain adopted Royal Decree 301/2011 of 4 March 2011, on mitigation measures equivalent to participation in the emissions trading system for the purpose of excluding small-scale installations, which permitted the exclusion of 174 installations over the 2013-2020 period.  Member States also have the option to implement another ETS mechanism relating to compensation for indirect costs. In Spain, the Sixth Additional Provision of Law 1/2005 establishes that the government may create a mechanism for the compensation of indirect costs. This mechanism was created via Royal Decree 1055/2014 of 12 December 2014. Aid is awarded pursuant to this Royal Decree based on the Commission guidelines on State aid in this context (2012/C 158/04).  To date there have been two calls for aid applications: in 2015, EUR 4 million was allocated to compensate for indirect costs incurred in 2015; and in 2017, EUR 6 million was allocated to compensate for indirect costs incurred in 2016 (note the change to a year-end approach). In both cases, the funds available were under 10% of the eligible costs in accordance with the Commission guidelines; however, the 2018 State Budget provides for additional compensation for the recipients of aid from the second call. At the time of drawing up this Plan, the third call is being developed, for costs incurred in 2017, with a budget of EUR 6 million.  Finally, in Spain, the use of income from auctioning emissions allowances is set out in a legally binding regulation. Thus, the Fifth Additional Provision of Law 17/2012 of 27 December 2012, on the State Budget for 2013 provides that this income must be used to finance electricity system costs related to the development of renewable energies (for 90% and up to EUR 450 million) and other measures for combating climate change (for 10% and up to EUR 50 million). 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 114 To the 23% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, the ETS sectors contribute with a reduction of approximately 60% compared to 2005.  The measures to be implemented in these sectors are set out in section 3.1.2. above, under the energy efficiency dimension, and in the following measure:  Measure 1.20. EU Emissions Trading System  a) Description Greenhouse gas emissions in the electricity generation and basic industries sector will continue to be governed by the European emissions trading system. The latest reforms introduced by Directive (EU) 2018/410 of the European Parliament and of the Council strengthen this system, positioning it as a key measure for the achievement of EU climate change objectives. In Spain, the European emissions trading system is governed by Law 1/2005 of 9 March 2005, as well as various Royal Decrees implementing this law. This system affects around 900 industrial and electricity generation installations in Spain, as well as more than 30 active aircraft operators. Greenhouse gas emissions subject to this system make up around 40% of the national total. Looking to the implementation starting from 2021, the national legislative framework will have to be adapted to the latest reforms.  b) Mechanisms Law 1/2005 of 9 March 2005 and Royal Decrees implementing this law.  c) Responsible bodies MITECO.   3.1.4 Non-ETS sectors  As indicated in the section on objectives, this Plan deals with the policies and measures required to contribute to the European objective with a reduction in greenhouse gases of at least 23% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. These reduction efforts must be shared between sectors subject to the emissions trading system (ETS) (electricity generation, refineries and major industries) and non-ETS sectors that can, in turn, be subdivided into:   Non-ETS energy; residential, commercial and institutional; transport, and non-ETS industry. Non-energy non-ETS; agriculture and livestock farming, waste management and fluorinated gases.Furthermore, the total gross emissions calculation must take into account the greenhouse gas emissions and removals resulting from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF).  Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013, establishes binding objectives for each Member State for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in non-ETS sectors from 2021 to 2030. Accordingly, Spain must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in non-ETS sectors by 26% by 2030 compared to 2005.  3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 115 However, the overall reduction of 23% by 2030 compared to 1990 means that in 2030, the non-ETS sectors as a whole will have to contribute a reduction of approximately 39% compared to 2005 levels through the measures proposed.  Within this group, the waste management, farming and fluorinated gas sectors (non-energy non-ETS) will contribute with reductions of approximately 28%, 18% and 33% respectively, compared to 2005 levels.  Figure 3.1. Historic and projected emissions  300,000  250,000  200,000  150,000  100,000  50,000  0   Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019  The abovementioned Regulation also defines the methodology for calculating and defining the linear reduction path that should be applied to establish the annual emissions allowances (AEAs) that each member state can issue annually. The emissions reporting cycle for inventories means that until 2020 it will be not possible to apply the methodology to data on non-ETS not be set until then.  Furthermore, this Regulation establishes that if a Member State exceeds its annual emissions allowance it will be able to use an additional quantity up to the sum of total net removals and total net emissions of greenhouse gases from the combined accounting categories of afforested land, deforested land, managed cropland and managed grassland (LULUCF). The Regulation also establishes a set of requirements that must be met to be able to make use of this flexibility. For Spain, the total amount that can be used throughout the 2021-2030 period is 29.1 MtCO2-eq.  The specific and measurable policies in the energy sectors (both non-ETS and ETS) are described in the corresponding sections on the decarbonisation/renewables and energy efficiency dimensions.   Non-ETS Emissions (MtCO2) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 116 It should be noted in this regard, as indicated above, that transport/mobility will make a decisive contribution to the decarbonisation of the economy envisaged in this Plan. This sector, after the electricity sector, will mitigate greenhouse gas emissions to the greatest extent, reducing emissions by 27 MtCO2-eq between the start of the Plan in 2021 and the end of it in 2030. Measure 2.1. under the Energy Efficiency Dimension (3.2) explains that as a  access to which will be restricted for the most polluting vehicles  it is intended to achieve a modal shift affecting 35% of the passenger-kilometres currently travelled in conventional vehicles.  As regards the identification and implementation of the measures outlined below for the non-energy non-ETS sectors, these measures were analysed using the M3E model described in Annex B. Models.  Measure 1.21. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the agricultural and livestock sectors  a) Description The actions identified for the agricultural and livestock sectors are described below, together forming an additional measure for the WAM (With Additional Measures) scenario or Target Scenario of the 2021-2030 INECP.  a.1. Promoting arable crop rotation on unirrigated land This measure involves promoting arable crop rotation on unirrigated land, including legumes and oilseed, which could replace cereal monocultures. Arable crops often form part of crop rotation systems and have traditionally been used to conserve and maintain the fertility of the soil, moisture level. The introduction of leguminous plants into crop rotation systems delivers improved nitrogen levels in the soil, improving its structure and fertility. This means that subsequent crops require less nitrogenous fertilisers. Therefore, growing legumes has a positive effect on climate change mitigation, as it reduces the emissions associated with the use and production of this type of fertiliser. Furthermore, from the perspective of adapting to climate change, it increases the resilience of the soil and crops, and therefore is an appropriate adaptive measure, particularly in unirrigated systems. In any case, boundary strips and margins will be maintained in the rotations, along with the natural parcels of the agricultural matrix, which, in addition to reinforcing the objective of CO2 absorption, will improve and increase the preservation of biodiversity (greater plant diversity, greater shelter and food resources), and the rural landscape.  a.2. Adjusting the application of nitrogen to the needs of the crop The measure proposed involves drawing up a fertilisation plan that takes into account the needs of the crop, so that organic and inorganic fertilisers are used at the correct dosage and at the right time. The fertilisation plan will include splitting applications, using products that help to control the release of the nutrients and reduce emissions, promoting organic irrigation and, wherever possible, encouraging localised irrigation techniques and optimising machinery use. Furthermore, the judicious use of manure and slurry will be promoted. This will form part of the Circular Economy Strategy, as these materials will be reused in the production chain.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 117 Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions resulting from the improper use of fertilisers will be reduced.  a.3. Frequent emptying of slurry from pig housing This measure involves frequently emptying the pits under the pens at pig facilities. Frequent emptying means emptying them at least once a month. The technique referred to involves clearing the pits at the end of the period or when they are full. Frequently emptying the pits reduces NH3, CH4  and N2O emissions.  These improvements in the management of manure and slurry at housing for different categories of pigs and cattle will reduce the emissions produced inside the housing.  a.4. Covering slurry ponds This measure involves covering slurry ponds at new pig and cattle facilities. The quantity of methane generated by a specific manure management system is affected by the degree to which anaerobic conditions are present, the temperature of the system and the time that the organic matter is kept in the system. Completely covering slurry ponds reduces NH3 emissions and odours by more than 90%.  a.5. Solid-liquid separation of slurry The measure proposed involves the solid-liquid separation of slurry, with the solids being stored and the liquid fraction being emptied into uncovered anaerobic ponds in areas with a high concentration of livestock (pig and cattle). This liquid part will be used for irrigation, making use of its value as a fertiliser. Solid-liquid separation, in addition to enabling better management of manure, will facilitate subsequent processing and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Storing the solid fraction has a lower methane conversion factor (MCF) than storing the liquid slurry, and the liquid fraction obtained has a lower volatile solids content compared with the original material which means that methane emissions are reduced.  a.6. Production of compost from the slurry solid fraction The measure proposed involves producing organic fertiliser (compost) using pig and cattle manure in areas with a high concentration of livestock. During composting, aerobic bacteria oxidise ammoniacal nitrogen, reducing NH3 emissions. Moreover, this process enables the waste to be stabilised by means of aerobic fermentation, which produces CO2 (not taken into account in the final balance as it comes from biomass) and small quantities of CH4 and N2O in comparison with other techniques that produce more greenhouse gas. The compost produced is an organic soil improver that boosts the fertility and condition of the soil, given that it helps to fix carbon in the soil. Measures aimed at reducing stubble burning will also be adopted with the aim of reducing the harmful health effects of particulate emissions.  b) Mechanisms Regulatory measures from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA) and/or interventions under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Strategic Plan.  c) Responsible bodies MAPA, jointly with the autonomous communities in accordance with the distribution of the relevant powers in Spain.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 118 Measure 1.22. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in waste management a) Description The actions identified for the waste sector are described below, together forming an additional measure for the WAM scenario or Target Scenario of the 2021-2030 INECP.  a.1. Domestic or community composting This essentially concerns recycling bio-waste or the organic fraction of urban waste in situ, by means of in rural, semi-urban and urban areas. The implementation of the measure will involve distributing composters among the target population, as well as an awareness-raising/training campaign in the households and communities involved to ensure -waste to landfill, to reduce the collection frequency for the remaining fraction and to obtain high-quality compost.  a.2. Separate collection of bio-waste for composting The target population of this measure is mainly semi-urban areas and certain urban areas. The universe for this measure is the total amount of organic material and vegetable waste produced by the population, both domestic and major producers that is taken to landfill. Implementing it will require a new strategy for the collection model, the upgrading of the fleet where applicable and the construction or redevelopment of composting plants depending on the population concerned. The reductions will be the result of redirecting bio-waste destined for landfill and reducing collection frequency.  a.3. Separate collection of bio-waste for biomethanation This measure concerns the implementation of a separate bio-waste collection system, but in this case it will be taken to a biomethanation plant, for use as a biofuel. The target population is primarily urban, since plants with a capacity over 40,000 tonnes are being considered. In this case, the mitigation effect has two aspects, one in line with the previous points made in relation to the collection frequency and avoiding landfilling bio-waste, and another that concerns the saving achieved by using a renewable energy.  a.4. Reduction of food waste areas of action that will help to reduce food waste at every link along the food production chain, achieving real changes in attitudes, procedures and management systems. These include, among other activities, information/awareness-raising campaigns to publicise guidelines on buying, storing and preparing food responsibly, voluntary agreements, reviewing legislation, developing guidelines and promoting RIC. This measure is part of efforts to reduce the amount of waste generated. At international level, it is included in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 12.3 seeks to halve food waste at the consumer level and reduce food losses and waste during primary production, processing and distribution. The EU has developed a platform to drive the achievement of this goal, and it is also covered in the EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy. At the national level, MAPA, through the household food waste panel, calculated that 1,229,509 tonnes of food was thrown away in 2017.  a.5. Increase in the separate collection of paper at municipal level This measure involves increasing paper collection and recycling at the municipal level (households, small businesses, HORECA, buildings, banks and offices).   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 119 Although in general terms paper can be considered an organic fraction of solid waste, it should be considered separately for several reasons: it has its own collection channel, greater potential for selective collection and recycling and the potential to emit more methane than bio-waste. Reductions will be achieved by avoiding sending the paper collected to landfill. Furthermore, the reductions derived from using recycled pulp instead of virgin pulp have been taken into account. This measure involves the selective collection of paper at the municipal level with a particular focus on schools, universities and the administrations, by installing special containers and improving the amounts collected, with the aim of recycling the paper.  a.6. Increase in the separate collection of household used cooking oil This measure focuses on the separate collection of oil from households, as there is already an adequate level of implementation in hotel and restaurant services. Local authorities would be responsible for implementing a collection model adapted to their municipality. Used cooking oil is a valuable secondary material for the manufacture of biodiesel. Consequently, this measure not only contributes to the reduction of emissions resulting from poor waste management, but it also offers other benefits such as contributing to the objectives relating to renewable energy and advanced biofuels, and to reducing the risk of water and aquifer contamination.  a.7. Increase in the separate collection of textiles Although some of this waste stream is collected separately for reuse and recycling, concerns around textile waste have led the EU to define an objective on the separate collection of this material. Textiles represent 6% of the waste fraction taken to landfill in Spain and half of this amount comprises natural fibres. This measure involves the separate collection of clothes and used textiles, via roadside containers or other facilities, for their reuse and recycling, thus avoiding their being taken to landfill where the natural fibres emit methane as they decompose. Often the implementation of such measures is also associated with other social benefits. The universe has been estimated on the basis of the description of the waste fraction in the 2016-2022 National Framework Plan for Waste Management (PEMAR).  a.8. Management of biogas leaks from enclosed landfill For a significant part of its history, waste management in Spain has consisted of landfilling. Consequently, there is a significant inventory of landfill sites that have been enclosed in accordance with legislation, but at which there are still a considerable number of biogas leaks. In these cases, the plan is to cover the surface of the landfill sites with an oxidising layer that contains methanotrophic bacteria able to oxidise the methane that passes through the layer. There are currently several methods that can be adapted to the characteristics of the target landfill sites. The measure involves applying oxidising layers to the surface of the target landfill sites, with the oxidation ratio by area estimated, conservatively, on the basis of studies and projects on the subject.  a.9. Use of woody pruning waste as biomass This measure involves the use of pruning waste as biomass by cogeneration companies (electricity uses) or in the production of pellets (thermal uses), which will substitute the use of fossil fuels. CH4 and N2O emissions caused by burning woody pruning waste will be reduced. Olive groves and vineyards are being given prime consideration given the large size of their growing areas and the size and volume of pruning waste that they produce. The extension to other crops will also be examined, taking into account their different uses, whether for food, for improving soil organic carbon or for use as biomass. This measure will also lead to a significant reduction in particulates and thus contribute to the National Air Pollution Control Programme.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 120 b) Mechanisms Amendment of Law 22/2011 of 28 July 2011 on waste and contaminated soils to accelerate the transposition of the amended Waste Framework Directive and bring forward the obligatory separate collection of bio-waste to before 31 December 2020 for municipalities with more than five thousand inhabitants and before 31 December 2023 for other municipalities.

POLICIES AND MEASURES 121 Measure 1.23. Reduction of fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions  a) Description a.1. Replacement of facilities that use fluorinated gases that have a high Global Warming Potential (GWP) with other facilities that use gases that have a low or no GWP This involves the replacement of equipment that uses hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) that have a high GWP (primarily refrigeration/air-conditioning equipment) with alternative equipment that uses refrigerant gases that have a low or no GWP (CO2, NH3, hydrocarbons or fluorinated gases with a low GWP such as R-32 or Hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs)). This measure affects the total existing HFC bank. a.2. Reduction of HFC emissions through measures at existing HFC facilities This involves reducing the emissions from existing facilities through measures that reduce HFC emissions linked to leaks from this equipment. The measures involve implementing periodic checks, automatic leak detection systems, retrofitting, redeveloping existing high GWP fluorinated gas facilities into compatible low GWP fluorinated gas facilities, and enclosing refrigerator units in commercial refrigeration establishments to reduce the quantity of fluorinated gases used. a.3. Recovery and management of fluorinated gases at the end of the useful life of the equipment This involves recovering and managing fluorinated gases at the end of the useful life of equipment that uses them, prioritising their regeneration and recycling over other management options. Recovering the refrigerant gas and managing it properly will prevent the full quantity from being emitted into the atmosphere. a.4. Promoting the use of mildly flammable refrigerants with a low GWP This involves reviewing the safety standards on refrigeration and climate control to make it possible to use A2L mildly flammable refrigerants with a low GWP (such as R-32 and HFOs) more extensively, particularly in the domestic air-conditioning sector. The universe covered by the measure is the sales of domestic air-conditioning units in Spain.  b) Mechanisms  Tax on fluorinated greenhouse gases (Law 16/2013 of 29 October 2013, establishing certain measures in the field of environmental taxation and adopting other tax and financial measures).  Gradual reduction under a quota system pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases and repealing Regulation (EC) No 842/2006.  Royal Decree 115/2017 of 17 February 2017, governing the placing on the market and use of fluorinated gases and equipment based on them, as well as the certification of the professionals that use them, which establishes the technical requirements for facilities conducting fluorinated gas emitting operations.  Voluntary agreement for the more environmentally-friendly integrated management of the use of SF6  in the electricity industry.  Amendment of Royal Decree 138/2011 of 4 February 2011, approving the Safety Regulation on refrigeration installations and their additional technical guidelines.  c) Responsible bodies MITECO and MINCOTUR. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 122 3.1.5 LULUCF (Regulation 2018/841)  In the LULUCF sector, the forecasts in the baseline scenario point to a saturation in the capacity of CO2 removal by natural sinks. This can be attributed to a set of diverse causes, including, in particular, the impacts of climate change on the Spanish forestry sector (increase in temperature and reduced water availability, especially), the scarcity of surface area with specific management instruments to increase CO2 storage capacity, a low rate of current reforestation or the generalised increase in the risk of desertification throughout the territory.  The measures proposed in forest and agricultural sinks seek to reverse this trend  although, due to the quality itself of the natural sinks, these measures require time to improve the removals generated  at the same time as ensuring the maintenance of the social, ecological and economic functions of the terrestrial ecosystems, as shown in Figure 3.2. It is, therefore, important to consider the effect of these measures in the long term, beyond the year 2030.  Figure 3.2. Evolution of emissions/removals of CO2-eq in the LULUCF sector Historical and projection for 2030 and 2050 (kt)    0.00 -5,000.00 -10.000.00 -15,000.00 -20,000.00 -25,000.00 -30,000.00 -35,000.00 -40,000.00 -45,000.00  Historical 2021-2030 Baseline 2031-2050 Baseline 2021-2030 Target 2031-2050 Objective Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019  The proposed measures in forest and agricultural sinks would generate additional removals of 0.96 MtCO2-eq in 2030 compared to the baseline scenario (0.78 MtCO2-eq in forest sinks and 0.18 MtCO2-eq in agricultural sinks), although, as noted, the effect of these measures is more effective the longer the time frame considered. Their benefit should also be highlighted in other key aspects such as the maintenance and improvement of ecosystem functions or the creation of rural employment.  Considering the accounting rules set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/841 for emissions and removals in the categories of afforested land, deforested land, managed forest land, managed agricultural land and managed grassland (including managed wetlands from 2026, for which it is planned to include long-term measures in line with the Long-Term Strategy for 2050), Spain - ensures that emissions do not exceed removals, calculated as the sum of total emissions and total removals in its territory in the abovementioned accounting categories.  1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 2032 2034 2036 2038 2040 2042 2044 2046 2048 2050 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 123 Likewise, with these same accounting rules, Spain expects to exceed the 29.1 MtCO2 over the 2021-2030 period established in Regulation (EU) 2018/842 as flexibility to achieve the binding annual reductions in GHG emissions.  However, there are no plans to use this flexibility to achieve the commitments made by Spain for 2030 in this plan.  Table 3.2.

POLICIES AND MEASURES 124 Measure 1.24. Forest sinks  a) Description The actions identified for forest sinks are described below, together forming an additional measure for the WAM scenario or Target Scenario of the 2021-2030 INECP.  a.1. Regeneration of silvo-pastoral systems Currently the main problem affecting the conservation of dehesas (shade tree and pasture systems) is the lack of regeneration of the dominant tree species. This is due to several causes such as overgrazing, the lack of planning in silvo-pastoral management, the excessive use of firewood, the excessive burden of game animals, forest fires, and the incidence over recent years of root rot and other factors that cause decay, colloquially grouped under the name dry rot. These factors have led the Spanish dehesas and other silvo-pastoral landscapes to be in a far from ideal state of conservation, with inadequate tree densities. This measure aims to regenerate the dehesas and other open highlands so they can be considered silvo-pastoral systems and the full sink effect can be taken into account, with the dual purpose of maintaining standpoint, and of avoiding CO2-related costs and losses, both in tree biomass and in the soil. a.2. Promoting poplars as replacements for agricultural crops in flood-prone areas This measure aims to promote, at times, the cultivation of black poplars, considering their importance for the national economy and their environmental contribution in terms of CO2 removal, together with their potential to help stabilise riverbanks and their ability to withstand regular flooding and waterlogged soil. The latter aspect makes them a suitable crop for flood zones. Furthermore, when they are located between agricultural land and riverbanks, they act as a natural water filter for surface runoff and surplus irrigation water containing fertilisers and plant protection products. At the same time, this measure is intended to boost the forest sink effect by preferentially developing native and structurally complex formations and species, avoiding as far as possible the orientation towards monocultures. Moreover, in any actions to recover riverside vegetation and stabilise riverbeds to create forest sinks, the Water Framework Directive objective will be respected in relation to maintaining and achieving the good status of water bodies, hydromorphological and riverside vegetation indicators. In other words, whenever possible, the aim will be to recover the native riparian ecosystems. This measure will involve planting structurally complex native species (and sometimes new poplar groves), in flood-prone areas with a return period of 10 years, based on the risk of floods originating in rivers to economic activity mapped by the National Flood-Prone Area Mapping System (SNCZI). a.3. Creation of forest areas Forests play a central role in the global carbon cycle given that they capture carbon from the atmosphere as they grow and store it in their tissues. Given their enormous biomass, forests are one of the biggest carbon sinks. They also produce goods and products that are of great importance to society (biodiversity, protecting the water cycle, jobs, products, etc.). This measure involves promoting afforestation (the conversion, by direct human activity, of unforested land into forested land over a period of at least 50 years via planting, sowing or human-induced natural regeneration) and reforestation (the conversion, by direct human activity, of unforested land that was once woodland but is currently deforested into forested land via planting, sowing or human-induced natural regeneration).    3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 125  a.4. Forestry activities to prevent forest fires We currently have a forest environment that is very prone to fires and the means of extinguishing these fires are reaching the limits of their effectiveness. It is therefore vital that more attention be paid to preventive activities that help to reduce the risk of outbreaks and facilitate efforts to extinguish the fires. This measure covers the work required to reduce and control the amount of wood fuel, making the forests more resistant to the outbreak and spread of fires and facilitating efforts to extinguish fires when they do occur. The amount of fuel is controlled by breaking the spatial continuity of vegetation, by means of scrub clearing, pruning, thinning, etc., particularly in areas where it is difficult to work with machinery. Forest fires pose a variety of dangers in addition to the release of the carbon fixed in the biomass and the production of additional emissions (CH4, N2O, NOx and CO) due to incomplete combustion, such as the release of organic carbon from the soil and the consequent erosion, or the public expenditure involved in putting out forest fires. The working method is based on the application of techniques by specialised personnel who propose and apply specific and balanced measures that serve to control and improve the vegetation, while recognising the interests of the different groups present in the area. a.5. Controlled grazing in strategic areas to prevent forest fires This measure is also focused on the prevention of forest fires, but it proposes the integration of planned grazing into fire prevention efforts, as another complementary tool. Controlled grazing in pastoral firebreaks is a sustainable farming practice in that the livestock helps to reduce the risk of fire and play an important ecological function in Mediterranean forests. Furthermore, its inclusion in the range of forest management tools encourages the local population to be more vigilant and to take more of an interest in forest conservation, promoting collaboration between experts and farmers, which strengthens the social prevention of fires. Grazing in firebreak areas is, therefore, a useful fire prevention tool that offers very positive environmental and social externalities, making it, ultimately, a valuable land management system. a.6. Promoting sustainable coniferous forest management, application of thinning schemes to increase carbon removals Besides increasing forest areas through planting and land use changes, it is possible to increase the biomass storage capacity of already established forest systems by applying particular management techniques. Thinning, understood as the reduction of the density of individuals of the same species, is an intermediate forestry intervention that is essential in the management of forest systems. Its objectives include reducing competition, improving the individual vigour of the trees, regulating the specific composition of the forest, bringing forward and maximising production at the end of the cycle, and increasing the value and size of the products. From the point of view of CO2 fixation there is ample scientific evidence that, even though thinning reduces the number of trees in the forest, the application of specific schemes can increase the total amount of CO2 removed by the forest throughout its productive cycle. This measure promotes the development of management plans that include an adequate thinning plan, quantifying the improvement involved in terms of CO2 removals, without quantifying other associated benefits (improvements in forest health, reduction in forest fires, etc.). a.7. Hydrological-forest restoration in areas at high risk of erosion Hydrological-forest restoration incorporates the range of actions required to conserve, defend and recover the stability and fertility of the soils, regulate runoff, reinforce channels and slopes, contain sediment and in general defend the soil against erosion, actions that seek to retain organic carbon in the soils and that have other synergistic effects such as defending against desertification, drought and flooding, conserving and recovering biodiversity and enriching the landscape.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 126 This measure involves the construction of structures intended to correct and stabilise watercourses in areas at high risk of erosion (according to the map of desertification risk in the National Action Plan to Combat Desertification), but not the reforestation of this land as these activities are covered in a separate measure.  b) Mechanisms  Interventions that may be developed as part of the upcoming CAP Strategic Plan in Spain.  The inclusion, where applicable, of interventions in the third-generation River Basin Management Plans and the flood risk management plans.  Harmonisation of the fees for the use of public water resources to incentivise poplar planting in designated areas.  Promotion of public-private financing instruments aimed at boosting the creation of territorial contracts that could implement forest fire prevention measures.  Analysis and study of the tax regime linked to forests to promote the active management of forest areas and consequently reduce the risk of forest fires.  Promotion of public-private financing instruments aimed at stimulating the creation of territorial contracts that could implement measures to facilitate grazing in forest landscapes.  Promoting intermediate forestry measures to better secure forest products with greater added value and enable the energy recovery of forest waste.  Development and implementation of the Plan of Priority Actions for Hydrological-Forest Restoration.  Development and implementation of the National Soil Inventory.  c) Responsible bodies MAPA and MITECO, jointly with the autonomous communities, in accordance with the distribution of the relevant powers in Spain.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 127 Measure 1.25. Agricultural sinks  a) Description The actions identified for agricultural sinks are described below, together forming an additional measure for the WAM scenario or Target Scenario of the 2021-2030 INECP. They are also important for the synergies they show for a better adaptation of the agricultural sector to the impacts of climate change and are therefore aligned with the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change. a.1. Promoting conservation agriculture (direct sowing) This measure involves applying conservation agriculture techniques that increase the amount of CO2 removed by agricultural soils and reduce emissions from diesel-powered agricultural machinery. The measure is appropriate both in terms of mitigating and adapting to climate change, as it encourages the soil to act as a carbon sink and also improves its resilience. Farmers will need to be trained for it to be implemented. a.2. Maintenance of plant cover and the incorporation of pruning waste into the soil for woody crops This measure involves maintaining live plant cover between the crop rows and incorporating woody pruning waste into the soil. These two agricultural practices are compatible and synergistic. Greenhouse gas reductions are achieved, on the one hand, by not tilling the soil, as is traditionally done, and on the other, by avoiding the uncontrolled burning of pruning waste. Besides reducing emissions, agricultural benefits are obtained (by improving soil structure and productivity), as well as environmental benefits (by increasing the amount of organic carbon in the soil and the associated biodiversity and by protecting the soil from erosion) and economic benefits (by reducing the amount of fertiliser required).  b) Mechanisms Other regulatory measures from MAPA and/or interventions under the CAP Strategic Plan. c) Responsible bodies MAPA, jointly with the autonomous communities, in accordance with the distribution of the relevant powers in Spain.    3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 128 3.1.6 Taxation  Measure 1.26. Taxation  a) Description In line with the Change Agenda approved by the Spanish Council of Ministers held on 8 February 2019, at st green approach to taxation  lead an in-depth study and, where applicable, take the corresponding steps to update those elements of the tax system that could systematically incentivise a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy, through the progressive and generalised internalisation of the environmental externalities that occur in the generation and use of energy, as well as in the execution of the main economic activities that emit greenhouse gases and increase the vulnerability of the Spanish economy to the foreseeable impacts of climate change.
