 -122-  3.3  86  i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.387 3.3.1.1 Energy sector The main policies and measures to ensure the security of energy supplies in the electricity sector are:  Development of the transmission system (distribution systems) in order to ensure system and production adequacy and security of electricity supply ensuring long-term fulfilment of the N-1 criterion;  measures to ensure the adequacy of production capacities;  development of an integrated electricity market;  measures following from European legislation;  diversification of the electricity mix;  emergency system management and emergency prevention. Transmission system development The development of the electricity system is crucial to ensuring the security of electricity supply. In the Czech Republic, the transmission system operator has the primary responsibility for the development of the transmission system. The development of the transmission system is also significantly coordinated at EU level. Detailed information on the current state and the expected development of the electricity infrastructure is given in Chapter 4.5.2. Measures to ensure the adequacy of production capacities In relation to ensuring the adequacy of generation capacities, the generation adequacy outlook, including the draft measures to resolve potential problems with ensuring the adequacy of generation capacities, is prepared annually as needed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and the Council.88 Currently, work is underway on the preparation of a detailed analysis and methodology for determining the reliability standard with the use of commonly used reliability indicators, which should subsequently form the basis of legislative (non-legislative) provision of the security standard in the area of generation adequacy. A summary of the generation adequacy outlook is given in Chapter 4.4.1.5. The need to ensure sufficient production capacities, inter alia, in view of the gradual decline in conventional fossil fuel sources, will most likely require some form of strategic reserve, probably for the period 20252035, when the Czech energy market may experience the first major shortage of electric energy or power. The setting of this reserve will be based on the legislative requirements laid down in particular by Regulation (EU) 2019/943. Any strategic reserve will be established or defined by law, which will be preceded by an impact assessment of this measure. Strategic reserve settings and parameters are already being discussed at the level of a specific working group.                                                            86 Policies and measures reflect the first energy efficiency principle. 87 Consistency with preventive action plans and emergency plans under Regulation [proposed through COM(2016) 52] concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and repealing Regulation (EU) No 994/2010, and risk-preparedness plans under Regulation [proposed through COM(2016) 862] on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector and repealing Directive 2005/89/EC. 88  The latest Assessment of the Czech Electricity System Production Adequacy is from 2018 and is available at: https://www.mpo.cz/cz/energetika/elektroenergetika/hodnoceni-vyrobni-primerenosti-es-cr-do-roku-2030--233193/   -123-  Development of an integrated electricity market One of the important elements for enhancing energy security is the further development of the internal electricity market / its continued integration. The internal energy market is a separate dimension of the Energy Union and is described in more detail in the other parts of this document, specifically in Chapters 2.4, 3.4 and 4.5. Measures following from European legislation The security of electricity supply is already very well regulated by specific European legislation. In this respect, we may specifically mention Regulation (EU) 2019/941 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector and repealing Directive  became effective on 4 July 2019.  Diversification of the electricity mix The Czech Republic will strive for the highest possible diversification of the energy/electricity mix and the minimisation of sources using large quantities of input fuel which must be imported from abroad. The strategically optimal electricity mix for 2040 is specified in the approved State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic and is referred to in Chapter 1.2.1.1. In this respect, it is important to emphasise the role of nuclear power, which should gradually replace coal in the electricity mix. An increase in the share of nuclear energy and renewable sources at the expense of fossil fuels is also a key prerequisite for achieving long-term commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as set out in Chapter 3.1.1.6. The Czech Republic no longer has its own sources of uranium ore (more precisely, it has resources, but mining has been discontinued), so fuel for nuclear power plants is imported from abroad. However, in comparison especially with natural gas, the quantity of nuclear fuel that can be stored allows consumption for several years ahead. Therefore, although it is not a domestic source, in terms of energy security or import dependence this energy source is a better alternative than, for example, natural gas. For more details on nuclear fuel diversification, see 4.4.1.6. Emergency system management and emergency prevention The issue of managing crisis situations is mainly regulated in Act No 240/2000, on crisis management (the Crisis Act), as amended, which establishes the scope of competence and powers of State bodies and bodies of territorial self-governing units and the rights and obligations of legal and natural persons in the preparation for crisis situations not related to the defence of the Czech Republic against external attack and in their resolution and protection of critical infrastructure, and the responsibility for violation of these obligations. On the other hand, emergency situations are regulated by Act No 458/2000, on the conditions for business and on the performance of State administration in the energy sectors and amending certain acts (the Energy Act), as amended, which transposes the relevant European Union regulations and, in relation to the directly applicable European Union regulations, regulates the conditions for business and the performance of State administration in the energy, electricity, gas and heating sectors as well as the rights and obligations of natural and legal persons associated with them. Emergency in the energy sector According to the Energy Act, emergency means a state in the electricity, gas or heat supply system as a result of natural events, measures of State authorities under a state of emergency, threats to the State or the state of war, accidents or accumulation of failures on facilities for the production, transmission and distribution of electricity, accidents on facilities for the production, transmission, distribution and  -124-  storage of gas, accidents on heat supply system facilities, smog alerts pursuant to special regulations, terrorist acts, unequal balance of the electricity system or its part, unequal balance of the gas system or its part, unequal balance in the heat supply system, transmission of a fault from a foreign electricity system, threat to physical security or protection of persons causing a significant and sudden shortage of electricity, gas or heat or threat to the integrity of the electricity system, gas system or heat supply system, its security and operational reliability, in the case of the electricity system or gas system on the entire the territory of the State, on a defined territory or its part. t of measures and activities carried out in a situation where there is a real risk of an emergency. In the case of the gas system, it consists of two phases: early warning, where there is information of a possible emergency, and alert, where there is an actual deterioration in the supply to customers, but it is not yet necessary to introduce a general reduction in consumption. The transmission system operator announces the exact time of start or termination of an emergency for the entire territory of the State in mass media and by means of dispatching management and immediately notifies the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Energy Regulatory Office, the Ministry of the Interior, the market operator, the regional authorities and the Prague City Hall. Similarly, the transmission system operator notifies emergency prevention without delay to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Energy Regulatory Office, the Ministry of the Interior, the market operator, the regional authorities and the Prague City Hall within one hour after the commencement of the respective activities. For the defined area or its part, these obligations lie with the distribution system operators. In the heating sector, emergency and its termination are declared through the media or by another appropriate manner by the Ministry of Industry and Trade for the entire territory of the State and by a regional authority or the Prague City Hall for its part. The body which has declared the emergency is obliged to immediately inform the Ministry of the Interior and the competent regional fire rescue service of the expected duration of the heat supply restrictions. Pursuant to the enabling provisions of Act No 458/2000, on the conditions for business and the performance of State administration in the energy sector and amending certain acts (the Energy Act), the Ministry of Industry and Trade shall issue an Implementing Decree laying down the measures and procedures to be applied to preventing emergencies, during emergencies and the removal of the consequences of emergencies, the methods to declare emergencies and notify the prevention of emergencies and the procedures in restricting the generation of electricity, the consumption of electricity, gas and heat including the balancing, cut-off and frequency plans, the method to ensure gas security standards, the requirements for the content of emergency plans, the method to ensure gas security standards, requirements for the content of documents for the preparation of preventive action plans in accordance with a directly applicable EU regulation and the deadlines for their submission to the Ministry. In the electricity sector, such enabling provisions are laid down in Implementing Decree No 80/2010, on the state of emergency in the electricity sector and on the content of the emergency plan; in the gas sector, such enabling provisions are laid down in Implementing Decree No 344/2012, as amended by Implementing Decree No 215/2015; and in the heating sector, such enabling provisions are laid down in Implementing Decree No 225/2001, establishing the procedure for the occurrence and elimination of a state of emergency in the heating sector. Critical infrastructure protection In accordance with Act No 240/2000, on crisis management and amending certain acts (the Crisis Act), critical infrastructure means a critical infrastructure element or a system of critical infrastructure elements, the disruption of whose function would have a serious impact on the security of the State,  -125-  securing of the basic living needs of the population, human health or the economy of the State. A critical infrastructure element means, in particular, a structure, equipment, resource or public infrastructure, determined according to the cross-cutting and sectoral criteria set out in Government Decree No 432/2010, on the criteria for the identification of critical infrastructure elements. These elements are determined by assessing their criticality, the impact of the loss of their function and their irreplaceability or, where relevant, the possibility to provide an alternative to their function. According to law, critical infrastructure protection means a measure aimed at reducing the risk of the e critical infrastructure element operator; a European critical infrastructure element operator is considered to be a European critical infrastructure entity. Type crisis management plans Type plans set out recommended type procedures and principles for a particular type of crisis situation and measures to address such a situation. According to Government Decree No 462/2000, type plans addressing crisis situations concerning a large-scale electricity supply disruption; (ii) the type plan for addressing crisis situations of a large-scale gas supply disruption. Emergency plans Emergency preparedness is a prerequisite for the successful resolution of extraordinary events (from calamities, floods, system failures to declaration of emergency in accordance with Act No 458/2000). Emergency preparedness consists in the ability to respond, correctly and in due time, to the occurrence of an emergency or crisis situation and to eliminate the risk to life, health, property or the environment to the maximum extent possible. In accordance with Act No 458/2000, the Energy Act, it is necessary to prepare emergency plans, which represent a set of planned measures for the prevention of emergencies and for the effective and rapid elimination of these situations. The procedure for restoring electricity supply within the distribution network The procedure for the reduction of electricity consumption and the restoration of electricity supply within the distribution system is laid down primarily in Implementing Decree No 80/2010, on emergency in the electricity sector and on the requirements for the content of emergency plans. In accordance with Section 1 of this Implementing Decree, the reduction of electricity consumption in areas where there is a risk of emergency or where an emergency has been declared is determined by the application of the appropriate level of the control plan, cut-off plan, operative shutdown of a part of facility or automatic operation of frequency relays in accordance with the frequency plan, to the extent necessary to equalise the power balance of the relevant part of the electricity system. In accordance with Section 3(2), regional distribution system operators submit to the transmission system operator by 30 September of each year the updated capacity values for the individual control levels and the cut-off plan and frequency plan levels. The use and the requirements for the content of the control plan, the cut-off plan, the frequency plan and the emergency plan are set out in the relevant annexes to the Implementing Decree.  -126-  3.3.1.2 Gas sector The main policies and measures to ensure the security of energy supplies in the gas sector are:  diversification of gas sources and gas transit routes (closely linked to the development of the transmission system);  measures following from European legislation;  development of the transmission system (distribution systems) in order to ensure system adequacy and security of gas supply ensuring long-term fulfilment of the N-1 criterion;  development of an integrated gas market;  a rigorous monitoring of compliance by the gas traders with the security standard of supply for protected customers;  measures to ensure sufficient storage capacity and the efficient use of gas storage facilities;  emergency gas system management and emergency prevention. Diversification of sources and gas transit routes The Czech Republic is almost exclusively dependent on the import of natural gas. Domestic gas production covers only a negligible share of domestic consumption (approximately 23 %). For this reason, it is very important to ensure diversification of natural gas sources and routes. As regards the diversification of natural gas transport routes, the Czech transmission system operator is currently planning two infrastructure projects. The first is the Bidirectional Austria-Czech Interconnection (BACI), which would create the first direct interconnection between the Czech Republic and Austria. The second project is the Czech-Polish interconnection (the STORK II project), which would also contribute to the diversification of gas sources. Both projects are part of -south Swinoujscie, Norwegian gas transported by the Baltic Pipe to Poland, sources from the LNG terminal Krk in Croatia or sources from the Caspian region (especially the Southern Gas Corridor). Both infrastructure projects are part of the Update of the State Energy Policy and are regularly part of the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of the Transmission System in the Czech Republic. Among other things, the Czech Republic uses a very good connection to the gas infrastructure of neighbouring countries, especially Germany and Slovakia, thanks to transit pipelines which lead east-west, west-east and partly north-south. In this respect, it is possible to mention the possibility of reverse flows following the limitation of gas supply in 2009 and the commissioning of the new Gazela transit pipeline in 2013, which resulted in a relatively significant increase in the capacity of inputs into the Czech system. In connection with the implementation of the Capacity4Gas project, new opportunities for the domestic market arise not only from the interconnection of this pipeline to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, but also to the new LNG terminals in Germany. For more information, see Chapter 4.5.2.2. The development of new types of gas (biomethane, synthetic gas, hydrogen) from domestic sources will bring greater security in the future, thus reducing the import dependence of the Czech Republic in this area.  The security of supply with respect to the diversification of natural gas sources and transmission routes and the robustness of the transmission system is expressed within the N-1 criterion, in accordance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938. N-1 is quantified by the transmission system operator within the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of the Transmission System. The recommended value of this criterion according to Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 is 100 %. Table 54 quantifies the security of gas supply for the Czech Republic in 20192028 according to the N-1 criterion, based on the Ten-Year Plan  -127-  for the Development of the Transmission System in the Czech Republic 2019202889. Chart 18 then shows a comparison of the minimum value required by the Regulation and the expected evolution of the N-1 criterion for 20192028.

Business diversification is also important in this respect. The Czech Republic has taken the first major step towards securing                                                            89  At the time of preparation of the National Plan, a ten-year development plan for the period 20202029 was already available but was not yet formally approved.  -128-  greater business diversification already in 1997, with the validity of a 20-year gas supply contract concluded with Norway, which expired in 2017. Currently more than one third of natural gas is sourced at European gas exchanges. This, of course, is closely linked to the development of the internal market in natural gas, which is described in separate chapters of this document. Measures following from European legislation The security of natural gas supply is already very well regulated by specific European legislation. In accordance with Regulation No 994/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 October 2010 concerning measures to safeguard security of gas supply and repealing Council Directive 2004/67/EC, preparation is underway of the Preventive Action Plan to ensure gas supply in the Czech Republic and of the Emergency Plan, which could affect the security of gas supply in the Czech Republic.90 In October 2017, Regulation (EC) No 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and repealing Regulation 994/2010 came into force. As part of the coordination of emergency planning at national, regional and EU level, the obligation to prepare preventive action plans and emergency plans is maintained. At the same time, other specific measures are introduced, such as the principle of solidarity. The Regulation also lays down an obligation to comply with the infrastructure standard at N-1 level or an obligation to establish and maintain a security standard of gas supply. These obligations are subsequently specified by national legislation, in particular Act No 458/2000 and Decree No 344/2012, as amended. Development of the transmission system to ensure system adequacy and gas supply security The transmission system development aims to ensure system adequacy and gas supply security in order interconnection of the transmission systems of the individual EU Member States; (iii) remove bottlenecks at national level. The expected development of the transmission system is described in the ten-year network development plan, which is prepared by the transmission system operator. Under this plan, measures are taken to ensure system adequacy and gas supply security. The ten-year network development plan: (i) indicates which parts of the transmission system are to be built or extended over the next ten years; (ii) identifies all the investments in the transmission system that the transmission system operator has decided on and the new investments to be made in the next three years. When making the Development Plan, the transmission system operator shall base its current and foreseeable future gas supply and demand on it. To that end, the transmission system operator shall analyse the development of gas production, supply, import and export, taking into account the planned development of the distribution systems connected to the transmission system, the planned development of gas storage facilities and the EU-wide transmission system development plan prepared pursuant to Regulation (EC) 715/2009.  The purpose of the ten-year network development plan is to provide an overview of anticipated investments increasing the capacity of the Czech transmission system and to assess the compliance of the transmission system with the requirements: (i) of the State Energy Policy (or other relevant strategic                                                            90  The Preventive Action Plan and the Emergency Plan (or their update) are available at: https://www.mpo.cz/cz/energetika/energeticka-legislativa/plany-dle-narizeni-ep-a-rady-c--994-2010--119187/  -129-  documents); (ii) for ensuring the supply security standard and ensuring compliance with the N-1 criterion. Development of an integrated gas market One of the important elements for enhancing energy security is the further development of the internal natural gas market / its continued integration. The internal energy market is a separate dimension of the Energy Union and is described in more detail in the other parts of this document, specifically in Chapters 2.4, 3.4 and 4.5. Security supply standard The key policy for ensuring the security of natural gas supply is The obligation to ensure the security supply standard is laid down by Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2017 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and repealing Regulation (EU) No 994/2010. The security supply standard is further regulated by Act No 458/2000, as amended. The manner to ensure the security standard, its determination and other related requirements are regulated by Implementing Decree No 344/2012, on the state of emergency in the gas sector and on the manner to ensure the security gas supply standard, as amended (as amended by Implementing Decree No 215/2015). Within its competences, the Market Operator is entrusted with monitoring and evaluating the compliance with the security supply standard. In addition, as part of the monitoring of gas sector statistics, the Energy Regulatory Office publishes regularly during the heating season a monthly report on the assessment of the security standard of gas supply in the Czech Republic. This report contains aggregated information on compliance with the security standard, in particular with regard to the obligation to store at least 30 % in gas storage facilities, the structure and the manner of demonstration  Measures to ensure sufficient storage capacity and the efficient use of gas storage facilities On the basis of the measure laid down in the State Energy Policy (2015), the overall capacity of gas storage facilities should be maintained at 35 to 40 % of annual gas consumption. In 2016, where natural gas consumption stood at 88.2 TWh, the value of this criterion was 37 %. Taking into account the expected consumption of natural gas and the development of storage capacity, this criterion should be met by 2030 (202891). However, it should be emphasised that this is not an enforceable obligation (this obligation is not laid down in legislation). In the Czech Republic, natural gas storage facilities are operated on a commercial basis and investments in further storage capacities may be affected, inter alia, by the following factors: (i) the difference between summer and winter gas prices; (ii) greater market integration and gas systems coupling (i.e. greater market flexibility) leading to greater competition in the services offered by gas storage facility operators; (iii) the decision to build storage facilities is often made conditional on binding interest of a particular trader; (iv) the security supply standard has no direct effect on the extension of storage capacities connected to the Czech system; this is because it is possible to use foreign gas storage facilities provided there is sufficient agreed transmission capacity to the Czech Republic, which the storage facility operator can ensure and offer to the market within the standard product; (v) the setting of the gas market, including the level of transmission tariffs to and from the gas storage facility creates the essential conditions for storage and should be set up to ensure the efficient use of gas storage facilities and maintain optimal storage capacity as required by the State Energy Policy (2015).                                                            91  Based on the Ten-Year Network Development Plan of the Czech Republic 20192028  -130-  Also, the deliverability from the storage facilities should be guaranteed for 2 months at 70 % of the peak daily consumption in winter. The highest daily consumption was reached on 23 January 2006, namely 68 million m3; the corresponding required deliverability is 47.6 million m3. The maximum deliverability of all the tanks connected to the Czech system is 69.7 million m3  however, this value is usually reached if the storage facilities are at maximum capacity and, therefore, it can be reasonably assumed that at the end of the winter season the required deliverability may no longer be guaranteed. However, it should be emphasised that this criterion is only aggregate and, as such, it does not completely reflect the relevant features of Czech storage facilities, especially their geographical distribution, which cannot be described as optimal, because almost all of them are located in Moravia (in Bohemia, there is only the Háje storage facility), which is due to the suitable conditions for their location. For more detailed information on the existing capacity and location of gas storage facilities, as well as the anticipated development of capacity and deliverability, see Chapter 4.5.2.2 or 4.5.2.4. Emergency gas system management and emergency prevention Emergency system management The operation of the system is supervised by the gas dispatching of the transmission operator, which is informed of the network state by means of measuring devices and dispatching centres of other operators (distributors and storage facilities) , while the expected operational values for the given state can be obtained by simulating the operation. A significant difference between expected and actual values may indicate an accident on a facility. For reliable and safe operation, the dispatching centres of the transmission operator, storage facility operators and distributors are capable of cooperating, even in the event of an accident on the system. The NET4GAS Transmission System Emergency Plan is the key document dealing with emergency situations. In case of emergency prevention and emergency situations, the Gas System Emergency Plan of the Czech Republic is also prepared. The Emergency Plan is revised and refined every year. Furthermore, Implementing Decree 344/2012 lays down the procedure to declare an emergency. Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2017 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and repealing Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 introduces a solidarity process in which a Member State is obliged to offer the requesting Member State natural gas for its solidarity-protected customers. In accordance with the upcoming amendment to national legislation, the Czech Government or the Ministry of Industry and Trade, as the competent authority, is responsible for providing solidarity and applying for solidarity  based on the recommendations of the transmission system operator or the Central Crisis Management Staff established by it.  The priority of the established procedures is to make maximum use of the application of solidarity to the market principle and to the non-market principle of reducing gas offtake to end customers who are not protected by solidarity. Preventing emergency When preventing emergency in the early warning phase (stage 1), use is made of the storage capacity of the transmission and distribution systems, storage facility operators examine the possibility of maximum off-take from the storage facilities, and the extraction operators examine the possibility of extraction and traders examine the possibility of increased gas imports to the Czech Republic. All of them immediately inform the transmission operator of the supply possibilities. Emergency in the early warning phase is reported by the transmission operator or distribution company without delay to the storage facility operators, gas producers, traders and customers in the area concerned and, within one hour after the declaration, to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Energy Regulatory Office, the Ministry of the Interior and regional authorities. Emergency committees and crisis teams are activated. The  -131-  market operator shall notify all market participants that imbalances will be settled in the emergency prevention regime. The transmission operator may also declare the state of emergency prevention (stage 2) for the entire territory of the Czech Republic. This involves reduction in the agreed transmission, distribution and gas -take points (customers with gas consumption above 630 MWh per year) to the extent that they can switch to substitute fuel. If the measure is not effective, the gas supply to the defined customer off-take points can be interrupted. The operator shall notify these points to the transmission operator or to the distribution companies and traders to which these off-take points belong. In addition to the entities above, the declaration of emergency in the warning phase will also involve the Czech Radio. Also, in the case of settlement, no compensation for lost profits may be claimed. 3.3.1.3 Oil and petroleum products The main policies and measures to ensure the security of energy supplies in the oil and petroleum products sector are:  diversification of sources and transport routes for oil transport;  providing for emergency oil reserves. Security in the oil and petroleum products sector is, of course, wider than the above. A detailed analysis within this document is not effective and is dealt with in more detail in other documents. Some more detailed information on the current situation is available, for example, in the Report on the Development of the Energy Sector in the Oil and Petroleum Products Sector92. Ensuring emergency oil reserves can be considered as one of the main measures to provide for energy security. The Czech law lays down the obligation to create and maintain emergency reserves of oil and petroleum products in Act No 189/1999, on emergency oil reserves, on dealing with oil emergency situations and amending certain related acts (Emergency Oil Reserves Act) of 29 July 1999, as amended. Section 2 of this Act provides for the creation and maintenance of emergency reserves, and Section 2(2) ned by the Administration of State Material Reserves from oil and selected petroleum products in an amount equivalent to at least 90 days Implementing Decree No 165/2013 on the types of oil and the composition of petroleum products for storage in emergency oil reserves, on the calculation of the level of emergency oil reserves, on storage facilities and on the reporting of emergency oil reserves. 3.3.1.4 Heat sector Energy security can be viewed from several perspectives. The primary objective of the heating sector users (customers) is primarily to have stable heat supply. In terms of heat source and heat supply system operators, the primary objective is ensuring such entry conditions that their business in the sector is predictable and, ultimately, profitable. In line with the strategic national documents, the following areas were identified as the primary objectives (trends) in the heating sector:  diversification of energy sources and decentralisation of inefficient systems;                                                            92  This document is available in electronic form at: https://www.mpo.cz/cz/energetika/statni-energeticka-politika/zprava-o-vyvoji-energetickeho-sektoru-v-oblasti-ropy-a-ropnych-produktu-za-rok-2016--235988/  -132-   flexibility of the supply of electricity and other products and services. Diversification and decentralisation of sources On the basis of the national strategic documents, a higher degree of diversification of heat sources is expected in the future due to the gradual replacement of coal (as one of the primary fuels in the heating sector used by larger sources) by alternative fuels. Namely, the increase concerns the share of:  waste for energy purposes;  biomass;  natural gas. In individual strategic documents (such as the Action Plan for Biomass in the Czech Republic 20122020), the heating sector is mentioned as one of the sectors with a high potential to use biomass, which should at least partially help to replace coal. Primarily, local biomass sources should be used, especially:  residual biomass types;  biomass grown for the particular purpose;  biodegradable municipal waste. The potential of biomass can be seen in individual heat production / its use in the case of central heat sources in relation to high-efficiency CHP. In the case of inefficient systems, their disintegration into smaller units can be expected, especially by utilising cogeneration units. At the same time, the strategic documents mention the effort of most heating plants to switch to high-efficiency cogeneration where this is technically feasible and economically advantageous. Flexibility of the supply of electricity and other products and services In connection with the ongoing decentralisation of electricity sources, it will be necessary to ensure the overall flexibility of the energy system. From this perspective, heating sources should be more involved in the provision of support services at the distribution and transmission system level. At the same time, thanks to the possibility of using cogeneration, production sources contribute to flexible electricity supplies; on the other hand, technology such as electric boilers and heat pumps have the potential to increase the ability to control electricity generation/consumption. Finally, it is necessary to mention the development of not only the market with heat and electricity, but also with cold. 3.3.1.5 Securing long-term supplies of nuclear materials and fuel The State Energy Policy, in the section on instruments in the area of state administration performance fuel stocks in accordance with the applicable legislation in proportion to the expected security of supply  In accordance with the requirements of the valid State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic and related strategies and priorities (including the National Action Plan for the Development of Nuclear Energy in stocks or to create such conditions (technical, commercial, licencing) for nuclear fuel supply as to guarantee the nominal operation of all increasing the share of nuclear energy to the target level of 50  -133-  the current state and expected development of nuclear fuel reserves for individual power plants and it was partially discussed by the technical-investment working group of the Standing Committee on Nuclear Energy or the Standing Committee on New Nuclear Build in the Czech Republic93. Upon request, this material will be discussed by the Standing Committee for Nuclear Energy or the Standing Committee on New Nuclear Build in the Czech Republic. For more information on the current status and outlook for long-term nuclear fuel supply security, see 4.4.1.6. 3.3.1.6 Cyber security in the energy sector The energy sector is an intermediary for the basic functions of the state. From a security point of view, this is a high-crucial. In this respect, both the energy sector and individual sub-sectors were regulated by Act No 181/2014, on cyber security, from the very beginning of its effectiveness. The director and coordinator of this Act and its implementation is the National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NCISA). There, the main measures in the area of cyber security can be described as the fulfilment of Act No 181/2014, on cyber security, or Decree No 82/2018, on cyber security, which lay down the specific obligations that relevant entities must fulfil. Cyber security of individual organisations is thus ensured by the concerned entities through the fulfilment of obligations imposed on them by the Act on Cyber Security, or by Decree No 82/2018, on cyber security, depending on the nature of the entity. There are criteria set out in the implementing legislation for assessing whether a system is critical and if its administrator must be included among the persons obliged under the above Act. These criteria are mostly based on certain limits of the impact of information security breaches in these systems that need to be taken into account.  Act No 181/2014, on cyber security, came into effect in 2015 and its main objective is to increase cyber security of the Czech Republic, especially in the crucial areas. In the energy sector, these are mainly major pipelines or power-is to cover the information and communication systems that are connected to these physical elements (critical infrastructure). The breach of information security of these information or communication systems could have significant negative impacts on the operation of critical infrastructure elements. Criteria according to which critical infrastructure is determined are contained in Government Decree No 432/2010, on the criteria for determining the critical infrastructure element, as amended. The existing procedure under the Crisis Act (Act No 240/2000, on crisis management and amending certain acts, as amended) was thus extended to include the procedure for identifying critical information infrastructure. In this decree, the energy sector consists of the following subsectors: electricity, natural gas, oil and petroleum products and central heat supply. The identification of critical information infrastructure is carried out by NCISA through measures of a general nature. If a critical infrastructure operator is an organisational unit of the State, the Government decides on the determination of the critical infrastructure element by its resolution. In 2016, the European Commission issued Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information system                                                           93  On 18 February, by the Government Resolution No 132, the Statute was changed, including a change of its name.  -134-  Directive into national law of the Czech Republic, the basic service operator becomes another obliged into the Czech legal environment has led to the expansion of the circle of obliged entities in the energy sector. Impact values required for the given information system administration to be included under the regulation of Act No 181/2014 are lower in relation to this institute than in the case of critical information infrastructure.  The NIS Directive obliges Member States to regulate three subsectors in the energy sector, namely the electricity, oil and gas subsectors. In addition to the mandatory subsectors, the Czech Republic has included the heating sector. The criteria for designating the basic service operator and the basic service information system are then laid down in Implementing Decree No 437/2017, on the criteria for designating the basic service operator, as amended. In contrast to critical information infrastructure, another formal process of NCISA identification of these systems was also adopted. It does so, unlike in the case of critical information infrastructure, by issuing a decision in administrative proceedings, which the NCISA initiates itself, ex officio. ii. Regional cooperation in this area Regional cooperation in the gas sector takes place, inter alia, on the platform to prepare the Gas Regional Investment Plan for Central and Eastern Europe (CEE GRIP). It is also possible to mention the Gas Coordination Group meetings. Regional cooperation also stems from the Security of Gas Supply Regulation, which lays down the solidarity principle and the elaboration of regional chapters on risk analysis, preventive action plans and emergency plans. In the electricity sector, the issue is addressed within a number of already existing structures, for example within ENTSO-E cooperation. Regional energy security cooperation is likely to be further strengthened on the basis of the Security of Electricity framework of regional cooperation in the gas sector, other forms of cooperation can be mentioned, such as the Gas Regional Initiative SSE and various pan-European working groups at ACER, CEER or ENTSO-G. iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds Financial measures related to energy security at national level, including EU support and the use of EU funds, mainly concern the development of electricity and gas infrastructure.
