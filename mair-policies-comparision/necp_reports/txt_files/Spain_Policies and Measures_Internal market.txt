3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 174 3.4 INTERNAL ENERGY MARKET DIMENSION Regional cooperation Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action sets out the obligation for Member States to cooperate with neighbouring Member States in the development of the INECP, in Article 12. In compliance with this article, and as a continuation of the meeting held on 1 March in France on the French INECP, a working session on regional cooperation was held in Madrid on 9 March 2019, organised by the Spanish MITECO. Representatives from Portugal, France and the European Commission, as well as Spain, participated. The French, Portuguese and Spanish Plans were presented during the session. The transmission system operators of the three countries as well as the European Commission and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) took part. A session was also held on electricity, gas and possibilities of developing joint renewable energy projects. The following figure shows the meeting agenda:  Figure 3.8.

CLOSING SESSION 17:30-18:00 | Wrap-up  Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 175 The main conclusions reached at the abovementioned meeting were the following:   All three Member States share a long-term vision for carbon neutrality by 2050, including broad penetration of renewable energy, reduction of energy consumption, end-use electrification and significant retrofitting of buildings.  The European Commission noted the importance of the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plans as a key reference for investors and stakeholders. It also stressed that regional cooperation is one of the pillars for effective implementation of INECPs.  The involvement of electricity system operators is considered very relevant for the proper implementation of INECPs.  In relation to risk preparation, the three Member States present acknowledge the work of ENTSO-E and will share risk plans in the future.  For the development of the interconnections, the active involvement of the transmission system operators was considered important by the attendees, as well as the social acceptance of the projects.  Storage and interconnections are considered to be complementary to achieving climate objectives.  Good practice in the decarbonisation and energy efficiency dimensions will be exchanged to increase cooperation between the Member States present.  Finally, the possible joint development of cross-border projects will be analysed. However, for the time being, neither Portugal nor France are considering opening national support schemes for electricity generation from renewable sources. In short, the meeting held on 9 July 2019 was the regional cooperation mechanism implemented in this Plan, and it is expected to be the first in a series of collaborations in different energy and climate areas, which will help the implementation of the INECPs in each of the States. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 176 Measures concerning the Internal Energy Market Dimension  With regard to the interconnectivity of the electricity system, we will continue to work on what was agreed in the Madrid Declaration - Summit for Energy Interconnections, held by Spain, France, Portugal, the European Commission and the European Investment Bank in Madrid on 4 March 2015, and ratified in June 2018 in the Lisbon Declaration.  In the Madrid Declaration, a common strategy was adopted for the development of electricity transmission activities and a new high-level Regional Group for South-West Europe was created for the promotion and supervision of interconnection projects. This strategy was ratified in the Lisbon Declaration.  In the area of the internal market dimension, the main measures are described below.  Measure 4.1. Increased electricity interconnection with France  a) Description Building the following essential interconnections:  Bay of Biscay Project: Interconnection between Aquitaine (FR) and the Basque Country (ES). This will allow the interconnection capacity between Spain and France to reach 5,000 MW.  Interconnection between Aragon (ES) and Atlantic Pyrenees (FR) and interconnection between Navarre (ES) and Landes (FR). This will increase the interconnection capacity between Spain and France up to 8,000 MW. Interconnections are the main infrastructure element that enables progress in the internal energy market, since they make it possible to exchange electricity with neighbouring countries at competitive and homogeneous prices and they reduce the volatility of national markets. They are important for energy security and improve the efficiency of electricity systems by contributing to a more efficient allocation of generation, reducing the need for duplicate installations across borders. Finally, they play an essential role in achieving energy and climate objectives by allowing greater integration of non-dispatchable renewable technologies into the grid.  b) Impact of the measure The most important of these projects, the Bay of Biscay project, was considered in the 2017 Projects of Common Interest (PCIs)52 as an interconnection between Aquitaine (FR) and the Basque Country (ES). This is an interconnection that is 370 km in length (110 km in Spain and 260 km in France), of which 90 km are terrestrial and 280 km are undersea, with an estimated cost of EUR 1.75 billion. This project will allow the capacity of the interconnection between Spain and France to reach 5,000 MW (5% of installed capacity). The others, also included in the list of 2017 PCIs, are outlined below:  Interconnection between Aragon (ES) and Pyrenees Atlantic (FR). There are 150 km planned on the Spanish side, and the estimated cost is EUR 1.2 billion.  Interconnection between Navarre (ES) and Landes (FR). There are 80 km planned on the Spanish side, and the estimated cost is EUR 1.2 billion.                                                               52 COMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2018/540 of 23 November 2017 amending Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the Union list of projects of common interest. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 177 c) Responsible bodies The public authority responsible for approving and monitoring the measure is MITECO, in collaboration with the French government. The execution is carried out by REE together with the electricity transporter in France, RTE.  d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at the electricity sector.  e) Mechanisms The current transmission network planning, with a 2015-2020 horizon, includes the abovementioned interconnections in a post-2020 horizon. These projects will be examined and taken into consideration for the new planning of the transmission network with the 2021-2026 horizon. The inclusion of these installations in Annex 2 of the abovementioned planning currently in force enables the relevant administrative procedures to be initiated.  f) Financial requirements and public support  1316/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013, plays an important role in the financing of electricity interconnections (Measures 4.1 and 4.2), as well as of other PCI infrastructures. It is designed to promote infrastructures of special European interest by means of financial aid from the EU through competitive calls for proposals or applications for funding submitted by the bodies responsible for building these infrastructures, always with the approval of each Member State. In relation to the Bay of Biscay project, the project promoters (REE and RTE) applied for EUR 800 million CEF funds in the 2017 call. A decision was made on the call in early 2018 with the award of EUR 578 million. According to the abovementioned cost allocation, EUR 350 million went to France and the remaining EUR 228 million to Spain.   Measure 4.2. Increased electricity interconnection with Portugal  a) Description creation of the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL) involved close cooperation between the governments of both countries. As a result, from the start in July 2007, MIBEL has been one of the most liquid markets in Europe, providing multiple benefits for the consumers of both countries, in a framework of participation open to all interested parties under conditions of equality, transparency and objectivity. Even so, given that in 2017, 6.7% of the hours were not matched in the daily market due to congestion in the interconnection with Portugal, it is considered appropriate to increase the exchange capacity between Spain and Portugal up to 3,000 MW. The project comprises the following facilities on the Spanish side, located in the provinces of Ourense and Pontevedra:  400 kV DC power line, with input and output at Beariz on the Cartelle-Mesón do Vento line;  Beariz 400 kV transmission substation;  400 kV DC power line, Beariz-Fontefria;  Fontefria 400 kV transmission substation;  400 kV DC power line, Fontefria-Portuguese border.  b) Impact of the measure  3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 178 Interconnections are the element that enables progress in the internal energy market, since they make it possible to exchange electricity with neighbouring countries at competitive and homogeneous prices and they reduce the volatility of national markets. They are equally important for the energy security dimension and improve the efficiency of electricity systems by contributing to a more efficient allocation of generation installations by reducing the need for duplicate installations across borders. Finally, they play an essential role in achieving energy and climate objectives by allowing greater integration of non-dispatchable renewable technologies into the grid. c) Responsible bodies The public authority responsible for approving and monitoring the measure is MITECO, in collaboration with the Portuguese government. REE is responsible for the implementation. d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at the electricity sector. e) Mechanisms The current transmission network planning, with a 2015-2020 horizon, includes this international interconnection. Projects that have not been put into service will be re-examined and taken into consideration for the new planning of the transmission network with the horizon of 2021-2026. f) Financial requirements and public support This new interconnection with Portugal, also included in the 2017 list of PCIs, is intended to increase the capacity for interchange between the two countries to 3,000 MW, at an estimated cost of EUR 128 million.   a) Description As previously stated, the Energy Planning document, 2015-2020 Development Plan for the Electricity Transmission Network, submitted to the Congress of Deputies on 29 September 2015 and approved on 16 October 2015 by agreement of the Council of Ministers, is currently in force. In March 2019, the process to develop the new planning, with a 2021-2026 horizon, was initiated. In this area, the following are proposed as projects to be developed in addition to the PCIs:  400 kV Abanto/Güeñes-Ichaso axis.  Actions in the metropolitan area of Barcelona.  Pyrenean region. Moralets.  Mequinenza axis interconnection.  220 kV JM Oriol-Los Arenales-Cáceres-Trujillo network mesh axis.  220 kV Valencia capital network mesh.  Strengthening of the 220 kV axis between La Plana and Morvedre.  Strengthening of the 400 kV network between Castellón and Valencia.  Connection between Mallorca and Menorca, currently a service force, planned for 2021. The development of any actions that may affect neighbouring electricity systems will be carried out in cooperation with the relevant TSOs to minimise the potential effects and impacts on both electricity systems. In line with the provisions of Measure 1.3 of this Plan, the guiding principles for the 2021-2026 planning of the electricity transmission grid are, in addition to the general principles established in Article 9 of Royal Decree 1955/2000 of 1 December 2000 regulating the activities of transmission, distribution, marketing, supply and authorisation procedures for electricity installations, the following:  3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 179 1. The implementation of the energy and climate commitments set out in this Plan. 2. The maximisation of renewable penetration in the electricity system, minimising the risk of discharges, and in a way that is compatible with the safety of the electricity system. 3. The transfer of renewable energies in areas where there are high levels of renewable resources and where it is environmentally possible to exploit and transport the energy generated. 4. The contribution, as far as the electricity transmission network is concerned, to ensuring the security of supply of the electricity system. 5. The compatibility of the development of the electricity transmission network with the environmental restrictions required by the Strategic Environmental Assessment of the INECP. 6. The removal of existing technical restrictions on the electricity transmission network. 7. Compliance with the principles of economic efficiency and the principle of economic and financial sustainability of the electricity system. 8. The maximisation of the use of the existing network, renewing, expanding capacity, using new technologies and reusing existing facilities. 9. The reduction of losses for the transport of electrical energy to consumption centres.  b) Impact of the measure Traditionally, the planning of the electricity transmission network consists of a binding part, the network infrastructures to be built, and an indicative part with demand and generation projections. On this occasion, the indicative part is this INECP. The binding planning of the electricity transmission network will therefore be adapted to the fulfilment of the objectives of this Plan and its forecasts for demand and generation fleet. The energy transition process requires adequate planning of the electricity transmission network to allow the mass integration of new renewable generation at the pace necessary to achieve the objectives in the medium and long term, ensuring the safe operation of the electricity system at minimum cost to consumers. In this sense, the adequate design and planning of the same plays an essential role in the integration of a greater amount of intermittent electricity generation, enabling the connection of more generation. It is also expected that distributed generation from renewable sources and own consumption will become increasingly important over the coming years. In addition, the transformation of the energy model will lead to a change in the generation mix as a result of the replacement of emitting and contaminating generation technologies and the incorporation of new clean and renewable technologies, which in turn will lead to a change in the energy flows through the transmission network and in the management of these flows. On the other hand, in order to minimise the environmental impact, to optimise the investments already made and to maximise the use of the existing electricity corridors, priority should be given to the improvement and updating of the existing network as opposed to new routes and infrastructure. These actions can be carried out by increasing the capacity of the network through repowering, setting up multiple circuits and using new technologies. This will be done by putting the necessary security of supply and reliability of the electricity transmission network first at all times. It should also be noted that the network planning aims include the elimination of structural technical restrictions that cause economic inefficiencies in the system and an extra cost in the price of energy paid by consumers, as well as the minimisation of losses caused by the existence of long-distance energy flows to supply large consumption centres. Finally, it should be borne in mind that energy is an important factor in the siting of economic activity, so the planning must provide an adequate response to any new demand needs identified, including those derived from the development of high-speed rail infrastructure, thus contributing to the generation of wealth, employment and structure for the territory.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 180 c) Responsible bodies The public authority responsible for approving and monitoring the measures is MITECO. The TSO REE is responsible for the implementation.  d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at the electricity sector.  e) Mechanisms The projects included in the transmission network planning currently in force, with the 2015-2020 horizon, which have not been put into service will be re-examined and taken into consideration for a new planning of the transmission network with the horizon 2021-2026. In March 2019, the process of drawing up the new plan, with a 2021-2026 horizon, was initiated by Order TEC/212/2019 of 25 February 2019 initiating the procedure for making proposals for the development of the electricity transmission grid with a 2026 horizon.  f) Financial requirements and public support The proposed development of the transmission network must comply with the principles set out in the abovementioned Law 24/2013 of 26 December 2013, including the economic and financial sustainability of the electricity system as provided for in Article 13 of the abovementioned Law, respecting in all cases the annual investment limits established by Royal Decree 1047/2013 of 27 December 2013, which establishes the methodology for calculating the remuneration of electricity transmission activity.   Measure 4.4. Integration of the electricity market a) Description Progress in the integration of the electricity market consists of various initiatives, which are outlined below. 1. Increasing the contribution of renewable energies to adjustment and balancing services. The necessary measures will be provided for storage development and demand management, also contributing to the energy security dimension. 2. Adopting the necessary measures to promote the decarbonisation of the economy with the aim of coal-fired power plants minimising their (unlikely) energy contribution to the electricity system by 2030. 3. Implementing the necessary measures to improve the capacity to manage hydroelectric power, in order to maximise the integration of renewable energies (this measure is supplemented by the increase in energy storage, within the energy security dimension). 4. Promoting the participation of consumers in the electricity market. The new European internal market directive and regulation provide incentives to respond to demand and, under this legislation, the market will evolve towards a design that provides effective price signals through which the active participation of demand and the possibility of its aggregation are guaranteed. 5. Analysing the development of capacity mechanisms compatible with the new European directives and regulations that will contribute to meeting the objectives of this Plan, open to the participation of all resources that are in a position to provide the necessary capacity, including energy storage and demand management. 6. Promoting own consumption and distributed generation (Measure 1.4). In this regard, Royal Decree 244/2019 of 5 April 2019 was recently approved, regulating the administrative, technical and economic conditions for the own consumption of electrical energy. This Royal Decree aims to achieve a strong boost for own consumption. In addition, it should be noted that this law has partly transposed the provisions of the Renewable Energy Directive. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 181 7.  Developing, in accordance with the new European internal market directive and regulation, energy storage as a means to guarantee electricity supply; it will be considered that this can offer multiple services with different characteristics and advantages. Thus, generation, demand and storage will be able to contribute their firmness and flexibility, with the appropriate mechanisms, ensuring supply at all times (see Measure 1.2).  b) Impact of the measure Based on the great effort made by Spain in the deployment of smart meters launched in 2008 and completed at the end of 2018, consumers have a basic tool for understanding their hourly consumption, becoming active consumers, and adjusting to prices in the electricity market. Therefore, consumers can adjust their demand to times when the market prices are lower, contributing in this way to shifting the demand curve and thus facilitating a reduction in electricity prices. In that regard, it is essential to continue making progress within an enabling framework that supports the promotion of own consumption and renewable energy communities. In this respect, the provisions of Royal Decree-Law 15/2018 of 5 October 2018 on urgent measures for the energy transition and consumer protection will be developed, by means of Royal Decree 244/2019 of 5 April 2019 regulating the administrative, technical and economic conditions for the own consumption of electricity , based on the search for the greatest simplicity possible in the technical and administrative requirements, so that they do not create a barrier to the development of own consumption. Royal Decree-Law 15/2018 of 5 October 2018 has abolished the figure of charge manager and charging activity has been liberalised, so that any consumer can provide charging services. In addition, the managers of ports, airports and rail infrastructure, in their role as consumers, can provide electricity supply services to vessels, aircraft and railways, and services inherent to the provision of that service, enabling vessels and aircraft to stop consuming fuel while they are located in these facilities. This will contribute to the objective of achieving low-emission transport. On the other hand, the abovementioned Royal Decree-Law 15/2018 of 5 October 2018 amended the regulation of own consumption in Spain so that consumers-producers, and society as a whole, can benefit from the advantages that this activity entails, in terms of lower network needs, greater energy independence and lower greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, it is necessary to move forward with a favourable framework for adequate access to consumption data by consumers, such as the promotion of own consumption and local energy communities as set out in the following measures: 1.4. The development of own consumption using renewables and distributed generation, 1.13. Local energy communities and 1.14. Promoting the proactive role of citizens in decarbonisation, included in this Plan. c) Responsible bodies The public authorities responsible for implementing and monitoring the measure will be MITECO and the autonomous communities. d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at the electricity sector. e) Mechanisms Further regulatory development, including the transposition of European regulations, as well as the planning exercise foreseen in Action 3.6.    For the specific aspect of electricity consumer protection and improving competitiveness in the retail sector, the following measure is proposed:   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 182 Measure 4.5. Protecting electricity consumers and increasing competition a) Description The Energy Union has placed electricity consumers at the centre of its policies. Energy is a critical commodity, essential for full participation in modern society. The transition to clean energy must therefore also be fair to those vulnerable sectors, regions or segments of society that may be affected by the energy transition. In the future, all EU consumers will have the right to generate electricity either for their own consumption, to store it, share it or sell it to the market. These changes will make it easier for households to get involved in the energy system, better control their consumption and respond to price signals. The new market rules will ensure a high level of protection and good data management. In addition, new services, such as demand response, will help many individuals and families significantly reduce their energy bills. b) Mechanisms This measure is considered in the specific aspect of electricity consumer protection and improving competitiveness in the retail sector. It consists of the following initiatives: 1. Establishing a dynamic framework of standards which can be adapted to the constant development of the sector and which protects the most vulnerable consumers by promoting competitive and transparent prices. To do this, the necessary reforms in the design and operation of the electricity market will be analysed. In addition, new smart tariff designs will be studied that will promote demand management and the rational use of infrastructure, and will contribute to the decarbonisation objectives. 2. enabling them to make better decisions about electricity consumption, to achieve more efficient behaviour and a less harmful impact on the environment. 3. Furthering the promotion of free competition between electricity providers. c) Responsible bodies The public authorities responsible for implementing and monitoring the measure will be MITECO, together with the autonomous communities and the CNMC. d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at the electricity sector.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 183 Measure 4.6. Data access a) Description Detailed, accessible and comprehensible information on their energy consumption is crucial to enable citizens and businesses to take decisions on their energy consumption and on choosing more efficient tariffs and investments, and to enable existing or new entrants, such as aggregators, to offer them various energy services and to perform the functions for which they are empowered by Directive 2019/944/EU on common rules for the internal market for electricity. In addition, the availability of information on aggregate consumption by public administrations is necessary to enable them to evaluate the effectiveness of energy policies and measures. Following the deployment of smart electricity metering systems (which in Spain in 2018 were already 93% implemented), different data management models currently exist or are being developed in the Member States. For example, in Estonia and Denmark, a central data platform has already been established, managed by an independent body, with another option being that the platform operator are the distribution system operators themselves. Regardless of the management model, it is important that transparent rules are in place by virtue of which these data can be accessed under non-discriminatory conditions and ensure the highest level of accessibility, usability, cybersecurity and protection, as well as the impartiality of the entities that process them. As existing technologies already allow this and as stated in Article 20 of Directive 2019/944/EU, consumers should have access to their data in near real time (compared to the hourly data collected today in Spain, in countries such as France data is collected every 30 minutes, in Belgium and Slovakia every 15 minutes, and in Italy, Greece and Poland in near real time). Moreover, to ensure a transition that covers all energy uses, it is necessary for the consumer and the administration to have data on thermal energy consumption. b) Objectives addressed To enhance the awareness and the leading role of citizens in the energy transition, the development of innovative energy services such as, inter alia, aggregation, and the analysis of the effectiveness of policies and support measures by the public administration, through adequate access to electricity consumption data. c) Mechanisms Creation of the data access platform that makes use of, at least, the data from existing meters, and that guarantees the following:  ease of use for citizens both for checking their consumption data as well as for authorising third-party access;  compliance with data protection regulations;  access to the data in near real time and to historical consumption data;  access by the administration to aggregated data by geographical area and consumer type;  relevant information for consumers such as that relating to tariff periods or power requirements. Development of thermal energy information systems that allow users to easily and comprehensibly access their own data, as well as access by the administration to aggregate data. d) Responsible bodies General State Administration (MITECO/IDAE, MINECO and Ministry of Consumer Affairs), CNMC, REE and distribution companies. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 184 With regard to the Spanish gas market, its reinforcement and development is considered essential in the next decade. This requires the following initiatives:  Measure 4.7. Integration of the gas market a) Description In line with Measure 4.4, but focused on the gas sector, the following initiatives are proposed to improve market integration: 1. Establishment of the logistics model of regasification plants through the approval of the CNMC Circular establishing the mechanisms for access and allocation of capacity to be applied in the natural gas system and its subsequent development. In this way, it is hoped to maximise the flexibility of the system by allowing progress towards a model that allows the purchase and sale of LNG without distinction as to the plant in which it is physically located. 2. Expansion of the measures for promoting liquidity (mandatory negotiation in the organised market of natural gas for certain purposes, market creators). 3. Taking advantage of the storage capacity for LNG in Spanish plants, as well as their capacity for regasification, to convert them into a physical hub at EU level, both for natural gas and renewable gas or hydrogen.  b) Impact of the measure This measure will be implemented by the national regulatory authority, the CNMC, within the scope of its powers and within the framework of Law 8/2015 of 21 May 2015. This law created the organised market for gas (MIBGAS) and appointed the market operators, with the objective of filling the gap for an organised secondary wholesale market, which will provide a transparent price signal and boost competition in the sector. As for the electricity market, the entrance of new providers is also proposed for gas, as well as a reduction in the administrative burden for providers of natural gas in their relations with the administration.  c) Responsible body The public authority responsible for implementing and monitoring the measure is MITECO.  d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at the gas sector.  Measure 4.8. Protection of gas consumers  a) Description In the area of consumer protection, responding to the overall objective of providing consumers with the necessary information so that they can make their natural gas consumption decisions independently, the following initiatives are proposed: 1. Simplifying connection: introducing the possibility of execution by the applicants themselves, through amendment of Article 25 of Royal Decree 1434/2002. 2. Simplifying the process of changing provider: introducing a process that prevents delays and extending the powers of review of the regulator, through the amendment of Articles 41 and 42 of Royal Decree 1434/2002. 3. Reducing fraud: strengthening the role of distributors in the detection of fraud and communication procedures with providers, through the amendment of Articles 61 and 62 of Royal Decree 1434/2002. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 185 4. Implementing smart meters: technical and financial analysis of the potential implementation of smart meters for consumers, supplied at a pressure equal to or lower than 4 bar, based on the report to be prepared by the CNMC in compliance with additional provision four of Order ETU/1283/2017 of 22 December 2017. 5. Prevent the suspension of supply in extreme weather situations, as established in the 2019-2023 National Strategy against Energy Poverty.  b) Impact of the measure This measure will provide consumers with the ability to know at all times the volumes of gas consumed and their environmental footprint (emissions, proportion of renewable gas consumed, real-time consumption, online invoice availability, etc.).  c) Responsible body The public authority responsible for implementing and monitoring the measure is MITECO.  d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at the gas sector.    Measure 4.9. Improving the competitiveness of the retail gas sector  a) Description The following initiatives are proposed: 1. Imposing new obligations on the dominant operators in the natural gas sector, based on their retail market share. 2. Creating a single central point of statistical reporting to the General State Administration for providers, based in the State Secretariat for Energy, which in turn will provide the information required by other bodies (CNMC, CORES). 3. Simplifying the electronic procedure for setting up new providers. In this regard, it is worth noting the effect of measures such as those contained in Royal Decree Law 15/2018, consisting of the introduction of an exemption from the Excise Duty on Hydrocarbons for energy products used in the production of electricity in electric power stations or the co-generation of electricity and heat in combined power stations.  b) Impact of the measure of gas consumed and their environmental footprint (emissions, proportion of renewable gas consumed, real-time consumption, online invoice availability, etc.).  c) Responsible bodies The public authority responsible for implementing and monitoring the measure is MITECO.  d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at the gas sector.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 186 Measure 4.10. Development plan for gas demand management  a) Description Geographical areas will be selected where preventing the potential interruption of supply to unprotected clients could be essential in order to safeguard energy security. In addition, this demand management plan must pre-select unprotected clients with a sufficient volume of consumption and economic activity to support these mechanisms.  b) Impact of the measure As a consequence of the plan, national regulations will be developed by the CNMC and MITECO, within the scope of their respective competences, in order to have these mechanisms approved within the established time frame. In particular, the main tools include the following:  Interruptible tariff: possibility of interruption of supply to clients subject to this type of transmission and distribution tariff, for a lower amount than the fixed tariff, with the option of reducing the demand to be satisfied by the system in the event of lack of supply or saturation of gas pipelines in extreme conditions.  Demand management systems: the development of demand management systems is planned, allowing unprotected consumers to relinquish volumes of contracted gas, putting them on the market at a fixed price through competitive procedures, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1938.  c) Responsible body The public authority responsible for implementing and monitoring the measure is MITECO.  d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at the gas sector.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 187 Measure 4.11. Combating energy poverty a) Description targeted social policies and energy efficiency measures such as insulation of social housing. It also puts forward that energy poverty is a major challenge across the EU and is caused by low income and energy inefficient housing. It sets out a new approach to protecting vulnerable consumers, which includes helping Member States to reduce energy costs for consumers by supporting energy efficiency investments. As part of the energy union governance process, Member States should assess the number of households in fuel poverty in their integrated national energy and climate plans, taking into account the household energy services needed to ensure basic living standards in the national context, existing social policy and including geographical dispersion, based on a common approach to fuel poverty. If a Member State finds that a significant number of households are in such a situation, it should include in its plan an indicative national target for reducing that number. The integrated national energy and climate progress report should include: 1. information on progress towards the national indicative target of reducing the number of households living in fuel poverty; 2. quantitative information on the number of households living in fuel poverty and, where available, information on policies and measures to address the problem. The Commission will share the data communicated by the Member States with the EU Energy Poverty Observatory (EPOV). In this context, the measures adopted by the Commission on energy efficiency urge Member States to take energy poverty into account by requiring that a share of energy efficiency measures be implemented as a priority in households affected by energy poverty and in social housing. Their long-term building renovation strategies should also contribute to alleviating this poverty. The European Commission wants to strengthen the positive effect of the social aspects of energy efficiency. Any particularly important for low-income families who cannot heat their homes adequately, let alone afford renovation or upgrading to make more efficient use of energy. The Directive concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity approved in June 2019 highlights the importance of the Member States adopting the measures necessary to protect vulnerable consumers and those in a situation of energy poverty, in the context of the internal market in electricity. Such measures may differ according to the specific circumstances in each Member State, and may include social or energy policy measures related to the payment of electricity bills, to investment in the energy performance of residential buildings, or to consumer protection, such as safeguards against disconnection. In the national context, energy poverty in Spain is a complex phenomenon where the approach calls for multidisciplinary analysis and coordinated actions of the different policies by the public authorities. The approved in April 2019 provides a framework for action and a framework for the actions to be carried out in this area. To this end, an approach has been adopted that combines measures of a more performance-oriented and palliative nature, to be implemented in the short term, with other more structural and developmental measures to improve energy efficiency, aimed at the medium and long term. The Strategy has been drawn up within a framework of collaboration, advice and participation from representatives of the different administrative bodies (State, autonomous community and local), as well as experts and entities from the third sector, who will also be present during its subsequent implementation.    3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 188 In line with the European guidelines, the ENPE includes a definition of fuel poverty and vulnerable Fuel poverty is the situation in which a household cannot meet its basic needs for energy supplies, as a result of insufficient income, and which, where appropriate, may be aggravated by having an energy-inefficient dwelling; a vulnerable consumer is a consumer of electrical or thermal energy who is in a situation of fuel poverty and who may benefit from support measures established by the administrations In order to parameterise the situations, the ENPE selects the four official indicators of the EU Energy Poverty Observatory (EPOV): 1. High share of energy expenditure in income (2M): proportion of households whose share of energy expenditure in income is more than twice the national median share. 2. Low absolute energy expenditure (M/2): share of households whose absolute energy expenditure is below half the national median. 3.  Inability to keep home adequately warm: share of (sub)population not able to keep their home adequately warm. 4. Arrears on utility bills: share of (sub)population having arrears on utility bills. Additionally, the analyses of these indicators are complemented by other secondary indicators and are crossed with certain variables to characterise the population. The ENPE also sets a target for each of the EPOV indicators: to fall by at least 25% by 2025, seeking to go further and reach 50% of their current values. The lines of actions outlined in the ENPE operational pan, specified in 19 measures, are profiled through four fundamental focuses. The focuses around which the ENPE is articulated are the following: I. Improve knowledge. Periodic monitoring of the indicators by the annual updating of the four indicators by the National Statistics Institute (INE), which will provide specific information on their values disaggregated by climate zone. Moreover, the IDAE will be the body responsible for publishing the results, as well as carrying out the comparative analysis with the other European Union Member States and with the targets set at national level. II. Improve the response to the current situation. The planned performance measures are key mechanisms for the short-term protection of vulnerable consumers, enabling them to meet payments for their energy supplies. The creation of a new social energy bond is thus planned, granted on the basis of disposable income criteria. The income thresholds to be set may be relaxed for certain categories of particularly vulnerable consumers, with particular attention being paid to households with children. The direct granting of aid may be considered for those groups receiving benefits whose granting is linked in advance to low income levels. The mechanism will be based on three principles: 1. Universality of supply sources: the new aid will be integral to all energy supplies, both electrical and thermal. 2. Automation: granting will be simplified by direct verification of the requirements by a public administration that collects information from all the bodies involved, avoiding the need for the consumer to process the application. 3. Coordinated management with other public administrations: all the administrations will be involved in the implementation of the aid in a coordinated manner and respecting the established distribution of competences. Social services will be required to apply the precautionary principle associated with Minimum Essential Supply, so that the supply of the most vulnerable households is not disrupted for a period of time.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 189 One of the measures envisaged will be to prohibit the interruption of energy supply to vulnerable consumers in extreme weather situations. III. Create a structural change for the reduction of energy poverty. This focus includes structural and energy efficiency measures, centred on achieving an improvement in the equipment and conditions of the buildings and homes of vulnerable consumers. They are a key element in tackling fuel poverty because they seek permanent change in households to reduce their dependence on other loan measures. Measures such as improving energy efficiency and residential equipment are included (Measures 2.6 and 2.7 of this Plan), as well as own consumption installations aimed at vulnerable consumers (Measure 1.4). IV. Consumer protection and social awareness measures. These are actions that seek to empower consumers, professionals and other actors linked to energy poverty through a better knowledge of rights, obligations, possibilities and alternatives in the field of energy consumption. The first element is generally raising awareness of the need to eradicate energy poverty in modern societies.  It also includes developing a protocol so that primary care professionals can detect situations of energy poverty.  b) Objectives addressed The reduction of energy poverty in Spain, as well as the reduction of the impact that this situation has on part of the population.

A definition of energy poverty and vulnerable consumers has been put together in line with the regulation established by the Electricity Directive and the Governance Regulation. The corresponding statistical instruments have been used, together with the consultation and participation of public bodies and private actors to obtain a representation of the situation in Spain.  Official measurement indicators have been designed. This previous analysis has made it possible to establish the needs and places of action that the ENPE must cover. The development of these indicators will be subject to continuous analysis and will serve as a basis for comparison with the other European Union Member States.  Objectives have been established to reduce energy poverty in the medium and long term.  Measures have been designed to achieve the objectives. d) Responsible bodies The General State Administration (MITECO/IDAE, MINECO, National Institute of Social Security) autonomous regional and local administrations, sectoral associations, National Statistical Institute.
