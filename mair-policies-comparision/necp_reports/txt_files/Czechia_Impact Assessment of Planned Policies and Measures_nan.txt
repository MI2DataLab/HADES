 -306-  5 IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF PLANNED POLICIES AND MEASURES178 5.1 Impacts of planned policies and measures described in section 3 on energy system and GHG emissions and removals, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures (as described in section 4). (i) Estimates of the development of the energy system and of greenhouse gas emissions and removals, and where appropriate emissions of air pollutants in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/2284, drawn up in accordance with planned policies and measures for at least 10 years after the period covered by the plan (including the last year of the period covered by the plan), including relevant Union policies and measures. Estimates of energy system development Estimates of the energy system development are given in Chapter 4. Despite this, a clear summary is given below, in particular for the period of validity of the National Plan, i.e. 20212030, but also, as required by Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, with a view to the next ten years, 2040. Chart 116  shows expected primary production development. Chart 117 then shows the expected evolution of the energy mix at the primary energy source level. Chart 118 then shows expected development of gross electricity production and electricity consumption. Chart 119 then shows the expected development of gross heat production. Developments after 2030 must be taken as largely indicative; the expected development in 20312040 will be further specified in the next National Plan for 20312040. Developments with impact on this period will, of course, be reported in interim progreor the outputs based on the evaluation or update of the State Energy Policy.                                                            178 Planned policies and measures are options under discussion that have a realistic chance of being adopted and implemented after the submission of the national plan. The resulting estimates under section 5.1. will therefore include not only the implemented and adopted policies and measures (estimates with existing policies and measures), but also planned policies and measures.  -307-  Chart 116: Expected primary production development  Source: Ministry of Industry and Trade Chart 117: Expected evolution of the energy mix at the primary energy source level  Source: Ministry of Industry and Trade 02004006008001.0001.2001.4001.6002010201120122013201420152016201720182019202020212022202320242025202620272028202920302031203220332034203520362037203820392040PJCoalTechnological gasesOil and petroleum productsNatural gasRenewable sourcesIndustrial wasteMunicipal wasteNuclear power plantsHeatElectricity-50005001.0001.5002.0002.5002010201120122013201420152016201720182019202020212022202320242025202620272028202920302031203220332034203520362037203820392040PJCoalTechnological gasesOil and petroleum productsNatural gasRenewable sourcesIndustrial wasteMunicipal wasteNuclear power plantsHeatElectricity -308-  Chart 118: Expected development of gross electricity production and electricity consumption  Source: Ministry of Industry and Trade Chart 119: Expected development of gross heat production  Source: Ministry of Industry and Trade Estimates of greenhouse gas development and emissions 020.00040.00060.00080.000100.0002010201120122013201420152016201720182019202020212022202320242025202620272028202920302031203220332034203520362037203820392040GWhCoalTechnological gasesOil and petroleum productsNatural gasRenewable sourcesIndustrial wasteMunicipal wasteExisting nuclear power plantsNew nuclear power plantsHeatElectricityGross electricity consumption0204060801001201401602010201120122013201420152016201720182019202020212022202320242025202620272028202920302031203220332034203520362037203820392040PJCoalTechnological gasesOil and petroleum productsNatural gasBiogasRenewable sources (excl. biogas)Industrial wasteMunicipal waste -309-  Estimates of greenhouse gas development and emissions on the basis of emission projections, up to 2040, are provided in Chapter 4.2.1, specifically in part (ii).

Also, policy interactions may not be predictable or quantifiable in advance. The policy interactions have already been largely reflected in individual sections of this document. The Czech Republic considers the interaction of policies in the field of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency to be very important; there is also an important interaction of targets in these areas. This link, including some quantification, is described in Chapter 2.1.2. Another important issue is the interaction of RES and energy efficiency targets and policies and impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, where unfortunately there is a trend where the targets are set at the same level as meeting the main greenhouse gas emission reduction target. However, these interactions have to be assessed at EU level, which proposes the setting of milestones. In this respect, the impact of RES and energy efficiency targets and measures on the EU ETS is also important, where setting targets can lead to surplus of emission allowances and to counterproductive impacts in terms of greenhouse gas emission reductions. Chapter 2.1.2 also contains information on the interaction between energy, climate and agricultural policies, as well as on interaction with biodiversity and ecosystem measures and objectives. Chapter 4.2.1 contains information on the interaction between energy, climate and air protection policies.  (iii) Assessment of the interaction between existing and planned policies and measures, and between  The vast majority of policies and measures are based on EU legislation or rules set at EU level, such as the EEAG support rules. The aid schemes must then be notified to the EU. Therefore, the Czech Republic perceives that the assessment of the interaction between measures and policies at EU level and national policies that are based on EU legislation or are directly linked to the transposition of EU legislation should primarily be evaluated at EU level. To a certain extent this is done in the form of impact analyses of EU legislation. At this point, it should be stressed that the whole requirement of impact assessment at Member State level is largely questionable, since the objectives framework is clearly defined by EU legislation, so impact studies no longer have an impact on the overall setting of objectives and overall direction of EU policy; their role is thus questionable and all the more emphasis must be placed on impact studies at EU level. It should be noted here that impact studies for the agreed RES and energy efficiency targets have not been carried out at EU level due to the increased ambition in the negotiations of the relevant legislation.    -311-  5.2 Macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmental, employment and education, skills and social impacts, including just transition aspects (in terms of costs and benefits as well as cost-effectiveness) of the planned policies and measures described in section 3 at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures 5.2.1.1 Macroeconomic impacts Methodology macroeconomic model, which is described in section 4.1.1.2 of this document. This outlook is based on a general equilibrium model that achieves the equilibrium of the economy as a whole, taking into account the underlying macroeconomic parameters and the degree of regional convergence of economies. The above macroeconomic outlook was used as an input parameter (therefore, there is the issue of certain cyclicality of the macroeconomic impact assessment if the macroeconomic outlook is --to verify overall trends and in particular to obtain a detailed overview of the energy intensity of individual sectors. In this respect, the most significant energy-intensive products have been identified, which account for a significant part of energy consumption, for which the historical development of energy consumption and naturally expressed production is statistically monitored and it is thus possible to obtain an overview of energy intensity of production. Subsequently, the expected development of production of these products was determined in cooperation with industry associations and assumptions were made on the possible development of energy intensity taking into account the potential for switching to best available techniques. The economic development and energy consumption of these energy-intensive products have been projected into individual sectors within the overall macroeconomic model, for the remaining sectors (and the remaining production within the sector beyond energy-intensive products), energy intensity has been aggregated.  The impacts of the objectives and policies set out in this document were then reflected in individual sub-simplification, since translating specific measures into economic development is not a trivial matter. Therefore, this approach combines a top-down and bottom-up approach, with an emphasis on interconnection with energy consumption. A partial output is represented by the trajectory of energy intensity development according to individual sectors, which are supported by the expected production of basic energy-intensive products. This modelling is an important justification for the objectives outlined in section 2.2. The summary energy intensity provided in section 2.2 is only an aggregate expression and it is necessary to assess the energy intensity in individual sectors. A reduction in energy consumption beyond that target is thus possible through a reduction in economic growth or production in a given sector (or for a given energy-intensive product), or by substantiating a decrease in energy intensity per unit of production beyond the projected reduction. This corresponds to taking into account national circumstances, which, according to Article 6(2) of the Energy Union Governance Regulation, have to be taken into account when evaluating the target under Article 3 of the Energy Efficiency Directive.  -312-  Macroeconomic impacts until 2030 Chart 121 shows the development of monetary production by industry. This is an aggregation for display purposes; this development has been analysed at the level of approximately one hundred sectors of the economy (two-digit NACE). There is a partial change in the composition of the different sectors, which is in line with developments in the energy sector described in other sections of the document and the proposed policies and measures (but some simplification had to be adopted here to quantify these policies and measures). Chart 122 demonstrates the emphasis on maximising interconnection with the ajectories are an aggregation of approximately one hundred sub-sectors.

Therefore, the Czech Republic uses the possibility provided by Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 not to elaborate on these impacts in detail, if this is not feasible. Environmental impacts are described in Chapter 4.2.1. In the case of lignite mining, economic, social and environmental impacts were analysed in 2015 in a relatively detailed manner. These analyses are available in a total of four public studies179. (see below). The comprehensive impacts will be gradually quantified and refined so that they can be presented in a coherent form in the relevant progress report or in the National Plan Update. Relevant in this respect is the impact assessment of the State Energy Policy (approved in 2015) in accordance with Act No 100/2001, on environmental impact assessment and amending certain related acts (Environmental Impact Assessment Act), as amended. Information on the impact of energy development under the State Energy Policy is part of the process of monitoring the State Energy Policy. Evaluation of the State Energy Policy is carried out in accordance with Act No 406/2000, not later than five years after approval. The SEP evaluation will be carried out in 2020 and will also include the output of environmental monitoring.

The programme was established on the basis of Government Resolution No 826 of 19 October 2015, in which the Government decided on the need to support the economic restructuring of the ÃšstÃ­, Moravian-Silesian and Karlovy Vary regions. Based on this resolution, the Ministry for Regional Development commissioned an input analysis which assessed in detail the current situation, the most serious problems and the development potential of the regions concerned. The subject of the analysis was not only an extensive macroeconomic analysis, but also a collection of impulses and experiences that took place directly in individual regions. A strategic framework was created based on the input analysis. This document does not yet contain a proposal for concrete measures, but identifies their basic principles -term strategy to support, facilitate and accelerate the restructuring of the economy in structurally affected regions. Specific measures are then part of individual action plans. Government-approved action plans combine measures from the pillars of business and innovation, direct investment, R&D, human resources, social stabilisation, environment, infrastructure and public administration. On 17 June 2019, the 3rd comprehensive action plan for the restructuring strategy for the ÃšstÃ­, Moravian-Silesian and Karlovy Vary Regions 20192020 was published. Figure 18 sets out the basic goals and pillars of the RESTART Programme. Table 121 then shows the overall financial requirements for measures under each action plan.  -315-  Figure 18: Basic goals and pillars of the RESTART Programme  Source: RESTART Programme Table 121: Overall financial requirements for measures under each action plan of the RESTART Programme  1st Action plan 2nd Action plan 3rd Action plan Total allocations in CZK million 40 445 15 838 11 090 Implementation period 20172030 20182030 20192030 Source: RESTART Programme Platform for Coal Regions in Transition In 2017, the European Commission initiated the establishment of the Platform for Coal Regions in Transition. There are a total of 41 regions in 12 Member States. In 2019, 18 coal regions were actively involved in the platform, including three regions from the Czech Republic, namely the Moravian-Silesian, ÃšstÃ­ and Karlovy Vary Regions. The Czech Republic considers the platform to be very important and will strive for maximum involvement. Coal Commission of the Czech Republic The Czech Government Resolution No 565 of 30 July 2019 established the Coal Commission. This commission is chaired by the Minister of Industry and Trade together with the Minister of the Environment. The Commission has a total of 19 members. Key ministries and offices, trade unions and industrial / economic associations, non-profit organisations, regions, the Chamber of Deputies and the academic sphere are represented. The scope of the Coal Commission is defined by the following outputs: (i) assessing the future needs of lignite, focusing on the assessment of individual large combustion  -316-  sources in the form of a comprehensive analysis; (ii) an analysis of the possibilities of future diversion limited in time. However, the partial outputs of the Commission must be prepared by 30 September 2020 at the latest according to the approved statute. The Coal Commission has appointed the following three working groups: (i) group to set a timetable for reclimate protection; (ii) group for setting parameters for possible downsizing and legislative issues; and (iii) group for identifying social and economic impacts. 5.3 Overview of investment needs According to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, the following information should be provided in this section: (i) the existing investment flow and future investment prospects in terms of planned policies and measures; (ii) sectoral or market risk factors or obstacles at national or regional level; (iii) an analysis of the additional public financial support or means to remedy the shortcomings identified under point (ii). In this respect, a different structure has been chosen, but the information required by Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 should be available within that structure nonetheless. 5.3.1 Existing investment flow Figure 19 presents the estimated flow the buildings sector, the renewable energy sector and infrastructure investment flows. The aim is to prepare a similar flow of investment also for 2030, taking into account existing and planned policies, preferably across all sectors with possible identification of investment gaps. However, this investment flow is not currently available and will be supplemented, as appropriate, in the relevant progress report and/or National Plan Update.  -317-  Figure 19: Energy and climate investment flow in 2017 (buildings, renewables and infrastructure)180  Source: Climate and Energy Investment Map  Czechia (CUT) 5.3.2 Investment needs 5.3.2.1 Renewable energy sources and other supported energy sources Under operating aid, the envisaged development of RES and other supported energy sources (see the objective in Chapter 2.1.2) for the period 20212030 corresponds to a total of CZK 511.2 billion, of which CZK 411.4 billion is represented by the existing operating aid for current sources, CZK 53.5 billion is represented by the related operating aid for current sources to keep them in operation and CZK 46.4 billion is represented by support for new sources (of which CZK 35.1 billion is for RES and the rest for other supported energy sources  high-efficiency cogeneration and secondary sources).  However, the support for resources in the period 20212030 is associated with costs after this period due to its legally guaranteed duration which, depending on the type of supported resource, last from 15 to 30 years after the commissioning of the power-generating facility. For this reason, for sources to be put into operation in the period 20212030, support will still be paid during the period 20312059. Overall, up to CZK 335.7 billion is expected to be paid in the period 20312059, of which up to CZK 49.4 billion will be represented by existing operating aid for current supported sources and another CZK 146.59 billion will be represented by the related operating aid for current sources to keep them in operation. Support for new supported sources put into operation in the period from 2021 to 2030, which will be paid out in the period from 20312059, is expected to amount up to CZK 139.7 billion (of which                                                            180  The source is the Climate and Energy Investment Map  Czechia (CTU) reports, prepared on the basis of the Climate Investment Capacity (CIC) project: climate finance dynamics & structure for financing the 2030 targets.

Table 122 shows operating aid costs by period and by production breakdown. These are values that are calculated according to the current price of electricity or allowance prices and do not take into account any future development of the price of the emission allowance, where in case of its increase and subsequent impact on the price of electricity, the amount of aid paid would also decrease accordingly. Options taking into account the possible development of the price of electricity or emission allowance are (these options are described in more detail in Chapter 4.1.1.9) are provided in the background 181. Table 123 shows total investment support for RES. It is a quantification of the necessary investment support in order to achieve the 22 % share of RES by 2030. It should also be noted that until 2018, operating aid for current resources had already been paid in the amount of CZK 354.7 billion and by the end of 2020 it will probably be paid in a total amount of CZK 448.7 billion.

Table 125  shows the public aid and total investment related to the implementation of Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, as amended. This table shows that the achievement of the Article 7 target is linked to a total investment of CZK 634.5 billion and an allocation of CZK 157.8 billion of public expenditure. Table 50 lists the related energy savings. Table 34 then provides detailed information on the expected financial costs associated with the renovation of buildings, which, however, are already included in the costs of compliance with Article 7.  Additional investments / public funds will have to be further spent to comply with Article 3 of Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, as amended. However, these investments could not be quantified in similar detail. Their total amount then largely depends on the contribution of Article 7 measures to the reduction of total final energy consumption based on Article 3.                                                             182  So far, this is a preliminary calculation, as data for reference years are not yet available.  -320-  Table 125: Public aid and total investment linked to the implementation of Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU, as amended Measures/sources of funding Measure type Total investment (CZK million) Of which public aid (CZK million) Policy measures 20212030  Operational Programme Competitiveness 20212027 Financial mechanism 19 000 8 000 Operational Programme Environment 20212027 Financial mechanism 35 000 14 000 Integrated Regional Operational Programme 20212027 Financial mechanism 20 000 8 000 New Green Savings Programme / Succession NGS Programme Financial mechanism 118 000 40 000 EFEKT Programme Financial mechanism 5 000 4 650 PANEL 2013+ Programme Financial mechanism 15 000 15 000 Modernisation Fund183 Financial mechanism  50 000184 Taxation of household fuels Tax measure 1 300 - Taxation of fuel Tax measure 180 000 - Prohibition of boilers for 1st and 2nd emission class solid fuels Regulatory measures 44 000 11 000 Ecodriving Support Behavioural measures 120 100 Policy measures from 20142020 generating new individual measures Operational Programme Enterprise and Innovation for Competitiveness Financial mechanism 11 500 4 000 Operational Programme Environment 20142020 Financial mechanism 800 400 Integrated Regional Operational Programme 20142020 Financial mechanism 300 100 New Green Savings Programme Financial mechanism 4 050 1 350 Voluntary scheme for improving energy efficiency Voluntary agreement 135 000 -         Financing overlap   - 65 000 - 11 000 Total   524 070 156 600                                                             183  A more detailed breakdown of allocations to individual areas aimed at increasing energy efficiency, as well as the overall set-up of the modernisation fund, will be specified during 2020. 184  The above amount ed to in Article 10c(4) of Directive 2003/87/EC, as amended, to support the projects of the electricity generating plant operators to modernise, diversify and decarbonise the energy sector in accordance with the Act on Emission Trading.  -321-  5.3.2.3 Infrastructure Table 126 shows the cumulative investments in the electricity system in the period 20212030. Chart 123 then shows the expected investments in the transmission system according to the ten-year development plan. Investments in the gas system are not publicly available, but investments in the transmission system are expected to amount to several tens of CZK billion. It is also an investment in smart grids. Accurate supporting documentation for cost estimates should be derived from work on projects included in the National Action Plan for Smart Grids (NAP SG). Based on the NAP SG approved in 2015, an additional cost of CZK 155 billion (up to CZK 120 billion for the integration of decentralised sources, beyond standard development and routine renewal) was envisaged for the development of smart grids by 2040. The NAP SG Update (NAP SG 20192030) quantifies the costs of the integration of decentralised sources as of 2040 in the amount of CZK 45 billion. This reduction is mainly due to the connection of voltage regulation at the high voltage level and other technical measures in smart grids. For more information about NAP SG, see Chapter 3.4.3, specifically part (ii).

The main sources of public finance are as follows: (i) the state budget; (ii) 2027; (iii) proceeds from the sale of emission allowances; and (iv) the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). Below you will find more detailed information on individual sources of financing. Table 129: Overview of sources of financing for implementation of the National Plan of the Czech Republic Financing source Description State budget Within the state budget, mainly operating aid for renewable energy sources is envisaged, as well as programmes related to support the increase of energy efficiency (e.g. national programmes EFEKT, PANEL).

Further utilisation of funds is envisaged within the Successor Programme New Green Savings (MoE) and also for the fulfilment of energy-climate goals under the responsibility of MoE and MIT. The Czech Republic will also try to prepare projects for the purpose of using funds from the Innovation Fund. Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) is an important financing mechanism for financing key information infrastructure in the electricity and gas industry. Source: Ministry of Industry and Trade 5.3.3.2 European Union funds (EU funds) For the period 20142020, this is an important source of funding to ensure the development of the energy sector and the achievement of European and national targets in this area. As for the period 20212027, on 2 May 2018 the EC published the draft Multiannual Financial Framework 20212027. The budget is designed to address the main priorities and policies that deliver the highest European added value. Overall, the Commission proposes a long-term budget of EUR 1 279 billion in commitment appropriations (in current prices) for 20212027, which corresponds to 1.11 % of the EU-27 gross national income (GNI). Taking into account inflation, the budget has slightly increased compared to the current 20142020 budget (including the European Development Fund). The Commission has proposed a similar cohesion policy budget to the one in the current period (without the UK, however, there is a slight increase of 3 %). In its first draft, the Commission allocated EUR 226 billion for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), approximately EUR 47 billion for the Cohesion Fund (CF) and about EUR 100 billion for the European Social Fund (ESF). In addition, the Commission has also published information on where the funds will go and how they will be linked to those directly managed  -325-  by the European Commission. The allocation for the Czech Republic amounted to EUR 18 billion in constant prices, representing a decline of about 24 % compared to the current period (EUR 20.1 billion in current prices).

The Ministry of the Environment is responsible for the Act on the Conditions for Trading in Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowances, which must also ensure the collection of data and calculation of the free allocation. In accordance with the requirements of the relevant directive, these funds are assigned in particular to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting innovation in industry and to measures to increase energy efficiency, including the construction and renovation of heat supply systems, increase in the energy performance of buildings and increase in the efficiency of energy use in industry and the energy sector.

Since 2015, the part that belongs to the Ministry of Industry and Trade has been wholly used to cover part of the support for electricity and heat from supported sources. The explanatory memorandum to the government decree on the determination of State budget funds in accordance with Section 28(3) of the Supported Energy Sources Act for 2019 shows the following State grant requirement between 2015 and 2018 (see Table 134).

The Ministry of the Environment is responsible for the Act on the Conditions for Trading in Emission Allowances. The legislative process for the adoption of the amendment to Act No 383/2012, on the conditions for trading in greenhouse gas emission allowances, was launched in late 2018 (the consultation process on this amendment took place in December 2018). It is this amendment that should clarify the key points for predicting the use and the amount of funds available for energy efficiency policy and the supported energy sources policy after 2020. Table 135 Table 44 shows the prediction of revenues from the auctioned emission allowances for the period 20212030. The following factors are important within the distribution of revenues from the n of indirect costs189. The precise setting of these parameters was being discussed when this document was prepared; the table contains an estimate updated according to the draft amendment to Act 383/2012 and the development of the emission allowance market. However, it is necessary to maximise the targeted use of these funds to meet the RES and energy efficiency targets. This use should be at 6070 % of total revenues.

Or more precisely, policies and measures that may have a potential impact on other Member States are already undergoing specific impact assessments, such as cross-border infrastructure projects or other major projects that are subject to an environmental impact assessment. Key strategic documents are also subject to environmental impact assessment, including regional consultation. The State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic underwent this process in 2014 and 2015.  (ii) Impact on energy prices, utilities and energy market integration The Czech Republic is not a large enough market to significantly affect the price of electricity in the region. With regard to natural gas, the Czech Republic is a negligible producer in terms of volume. Continued integration in electricity and gas contributes to the gradual convergence of prices (see Chart 124 and Chart 125 or ACER / CEER source publication).
