97 Dimension internal energy market i. Current situation of electricity and gas markets, including energy prices (47) Despite hopes to the contrary, market liberalisation, which profoundly changed the energy landscape, did not directly reduce overall bills. In the specific case of electricity and natural gas, it actually coincided with a marked rise in fossil fuel prices (oil and natural gas) that fed through to consumer prices. During the first few years following liberalisation, the regional and national markets continued to be dominated by the historical operator. Since then, however, the Walloon Energy Commission (Commission Wallonne pour l'Energie  CWaPE) has observed an increase in competition at regional level in terms of both the supply and the generation of electricity, which has been a factor in the recent changes in electricity and natural gas prices. Residential Competition and any competition-related impacts on price levels can only affect the unregulated component of the price, i.e. the energy component. This amounts to around 50% of the bill for a residential customer in the case of natural gas and 30% in the case of electricity. In June 2017, the most expensive component of electricity bills was distribution (37.6%), followed by energy (32.5%). - Electricity Table 15 - Trends in residential electricity prices  Evolution du prix final du kWh en électricité (exprimé  Trends in final electricity prices in kWh (expressed in EUR/kWh) Belgique - données Eurostat - client type DC (2 500 kWh<Consommation<5 000 kWh) Belgium  Eurostat data  consumption band DC (2,500 kWh<consumption<5,000 kWh) Allemagne - données Eurostat - client type DC (2 500 kWh<Consommation<5 000 kWh) Germany  Eurostat data  consumption band DC (2,500 kWh<consumption<5,000 kWh) France - données Eurostat - client type DC (2 500 kWh<Consommation<5 000 kWh) France  Eurostat data  consumption band DC (2,500 kWh<consumption<5,000 kWh) Pays-Bas - données Eurostat - client type DC (2 500 kWh<Consommation<5 000 kWh) Netherlands  Eurostat data  consumption band DC (2,500 kWh<consumption<5,000 kWh) Royaume-Uni - données Eurostat - client type DC (2 500 kWh<Consommation<5 000 kWh) United Kingdom  Eurostat data  consumption band DC (2,500 kWh<consumption<5,000 kWh) Pour la moyenne pondérée des fournisseurs designés - client type DC (3 500 kWh/an dont 1 600 kWh en heures pleines et 1 900 kWh en heures creuses) à partir de 2011 (avant 2011: client type DC1: 3 500 kWh/an) - données simulateur For the weighted average of the designated suppliers  consumption band DC (3,500 kWh/year, including 1,600 kWh at peak rate and 1,900 kWh at off-peak rate) from 2011 (before 2011: consumption band DC1: 3,500 kWh/year)  simulated data Pour la moyenne pondérée des produits meilleurs marchés - client type DC (3 500 kWh/an dont 1 600 kWh en heures pleines et 1 900 kWh en heures For the weighted average of the cheapest products  consumption band DC (3,500 kWh/year, including 1,600 kWh at peak rate and 1,900 kWh at off-peak                                                            47 the period from January 2007 to June 2017. 98 creuses) à partir de 2011 (avant 2011: client type DC1: 3 500 kWh/an) - données simulateur rate) from 2011 (before 2011: consumption band DC1: 3,500 kWh/year)  simulated data  In the first half of 2016, prices started to drop from their December 2015 level, but then rose again during the second half of the year (this increase continued in early 2017). However, prices then dropped to a degree in the second quarter of 2017. These changes in the energy component can be partly explained by changing prices on the wholesale markets, in particular the Belpex indicator. - Gas Table 16 - Trends in residential gas prices  Evolution du prix final du kWh en gaz (exprimé en  Trends in final gas prices in kWh (expressed in EUR/kWh) Belgique - données Eurostat - client type D2 (5,555 kWh<Consommation<55,555 kWh) Belgium  Eurostat data  consumption band D2 (5,555 kWh<consumption<55,555 kWh) Allemagne - données Eurostat - client type D2 (5,555 kWh<Consommation<55,555 kWh) Germany  Eurostat data  consumption band D2 (5,555 kWh<consumption<55,555 kWh) France - données Eurostat - client type DC (5,555 kWh<Consommation<55,555 kWh) France  Eurostat data  consumption band DC (5,555 kWh<consumption<55,555 kWh) Pays-Bas - données Eurostat - client type D2 (5,555 kWh<Consommation<55,555 kWh) Netherlands  Eurostat data  consumption band D2 (5,555 kWh<consumption<55,555 kWh) Royaume-Uni - données Eurostat - client type D2 (5,555 kWh<Consommation<55,555 kWh) United Kingdom  Eurostat data  consumption band D2 (5,555 kWh<consumption<55,555 kWh) Pour la moyenne pondérée des fournisseurs designés - client type D3 (23 260 kWh/an) - données simulateur For the weighted average of the designated suppliers  consumption band D3 (23,260 kWh/year)  simulated data Pour la moyenne pondérée des produits meilleurs marchés - client type D3 (23 260 kWh/an) - données simulateur For the weighted average of the cheapest products  consumption band D3 (23,260 kWh/year)  simulated data  During 2016 and early 2017, gas bills issued by the designated suppliers were sometimes lower in price and sometimes higher, depending on variations in the energy component. The downward trend in prices during 2016 continued despite a temporary increase in the third quarter. This reduction was partly due to the downward trend in prices on wholesale markets. Professional The production, import and supply of electricity and natural gas are subject to competition. 99 - Electricity Figure 18: International comparison of electricity prices  The dominant components of the electricity price are the energy component and the distribution component. For consumption band E1 (annual electricity consumption below 40 MWh), the energy component accounts for 31% of the electricity price and the distribution component for around 37%. Although the energy component of bills has fallen sharply, the other components have increased. The renewable energy support mechanism has not only increased final bills directly through the renewable energy contribution, but also indirectly through the transmission component surcharge introduced in 2012 to allow Elia to meet its obligations to buy back surplus green certificates on the Walloon market. It should be noted, however, that the Decree of 11 December 2013 partly exempts certain businesses from the Elia green certificate surcharge, mainly those businesses in consumption bands E4 to E6. In 2009/2010 electricity prices in Wallonia (all-inclusive price excluding VAT) moved closer to the prices charged by our direct neighbours; since then, the trend has reversed and the gap is growing. The highest prices for consumption bands IA (<20 MWh/year) to ID (from 2 to 20 GWh/year) are charged in the United Kingdom and Germany. Consumers in Germany are paying the price for their strong energy policy and energy transition, including the phase-out of nuclear power. A study carried out recently by PWC in relation to larger consumers (i.e. with a different scope to this report) highlighted the fact, however, that some industrial electricity-intensive customers in Germany can benefit from substantial reductions giving them a competitive advantage over their Belgian and European neighbours. At the other end of the scale to consumers in Germany and the United Kingdom, customers in France and the Netherlands benefit from the lowest tariffs. The prices charged in Wallonia fall somewhere between these two extremes. 100 - Gas Over the last 12 months, prices have fallen (by 0.3% for G5 up to 11% for G4), which can be attributed to a price drop on the wholesale market. The energy component (including transmission) and, to a lesser extent, the distribution component form the bulk of the natural gas price. For consumption band G1 (annual gas consumption below 120 MWh), the energy component accounts for 55% of the gas price and the distribution component for 41%.  Figure 19: International comparison of gas prices  It appears that the prices charged in Wallonia are competitive and often at the lower end of the price scale. As the study carried out by PWC in relation to larger consumers recently confirmed, gas commodity prices are similar from one country to another. Although the costs associated with transmission, distribution and taxes make up only a small share of final bills, they are key elements in international comparisons. The study also highlighted the fact that the vast majority of prices charged in Wallonia are lower than those in neighbouring countries
