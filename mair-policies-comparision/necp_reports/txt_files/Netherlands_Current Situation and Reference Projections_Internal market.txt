The Netherlands currently has connections with Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Norway, with a total import/export capacity of 7 gigawatts (see Table 4.6). Table 4.6 The Netherlands' interconnection capacity in megawatts (Source: PBL, 2019a)  The electricity markets of Belgium, France and the Netherlands have been integrated since 2008. More recently, the markets of Germany (since 2010) and the United Kingdom (2014) have also been coupled to the Dutch market. Connections with this regional market have also been made with the Scandinavian and Central European markets (TenneT, 2018). This has manifested in a highly integrated (Northwestern) European electricity market in which the Netherlands plays a pivotal role. This integration contributes to competition on the energy market, boosts the security of supply and facilitates the integration of renewable electricity. A high degree of connectivity allows national electricity surpluses or deficits to be absorbed more easily. Figure 4.14 shows the transmission network.

Extensions mean that these connections will increase from seven to nine gigawatts in 2021. There are no concrete expansion plans for the connections with Norway and the United Kingdom. The Cobra cable is currently being laid between the Netherlands and Denmark, which is a connection of 700 megawatts expected to be fully operational in 2020. The 1,500 megawatt Doetinchem-Wesel connection between the Netherlands and Germany was commissioned at the end of September 2018. Capacity between Belgium and the Netherlands will increase from 2 to 3.4 gigawatts before 2025 through the completion of the Rilland transformer station, the installation of an additional phase shifter in Maaseik in Belgium and internal reinforcements in the Belgian grid in view of the closure of the Doel nuclear power plant. Following the decision of the European Council of 23 October 2014 to increase European interconnection to 10% in 2020 and to 15% by 2030, the European Commission created an expert group that published a report on 15 November 2017 on the expected European interconnection capacity required for 2030. This report cites two new ways to measure interconnection, with the Netherlands comfortably exceeding its targets with both alternative measuring methods (EC, 2017a). Table 4.7 shows the percentages of interconnection based on the definition used by the European Commission (EC, 2017b). The Netherlands also exceeds its targets with ease based on this definition. Table 4.7 Interconnections, capacity of electricity generation and interconnectivity (Sources for capacity of electricity generation: PBL, 2019a (Adopted policies forecast))  Interconnection developments in the gas network There are currently no plans to radically expand the gas network. However, in time, sections of the low-calorific gas network could be made suitable for transporting high-calorific gas, as a result of the low-calorific gas phase-out and the possible increase in the consumption of high-calorific natural gas. Furthermore, the intended transition from low-calorific gas to high-calorific gas by industrial large-scale consumers may necessitate the creation of new connections to the high-calorific gas network. The current Network Development Plan of the operator of the national gas transport grid GTS, the Network Development Plan (NOP) 2017, provides for maintenance and limited expansion of the gas network during the period up to 2025 (GTS, 2017a). This expansion relates to connections to other countries as a result of the projected increase in imports. Incremental Capacity Tests (ICT) are a new element of the NOP 2017. These allow market parties to inform GTS once every two years if they require an expansion of the interconnection points capacity of the European gas network. The first ICT ran from 6 April to 1 June 2017, but did not result in any expansion (GTS, 2017b). Plans to expand connections to the gas network in the long term are currently being discussed, since natural gas extraction from the Groningen field is being completely phased out. There are a number of options available to absorb demand for natural gas, which have various consequences for the gas network and connections to the network. The main options are: importing high-calorific natural gas from Norway and Russia, gas extraction from other (small) Dutch fields and switching to other types of gas, such as biogas and hydrogen, and/or electrification.                                                 123 With reference to national network development plans and regional investment plans of TSOs. 2019 2020 2025 2030 7,050 8,050 10,800 10,800 34,887 37,602 52,646 59,018 20.2% 21.4% 20.5% 18.3%  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   Groningen 4.5.2 Energy transmission infrastructure Characteristics of existing transmission infrastructure124 Size and voltage of the electricity network The high-voltage grid connects the ultra-high-voltage grid with the distribution networks. Power plants, energy-intensive industry, larger wind farms (35 to 500 megavolt-ampere), etc. are all connected to the high-voltage grid. The high-voltage network mainly consists of networks with a voltage of 50 kilovolts, 110 kilovolts or 150 kilovolts; networks of the latter two voltages have been managed by TenneT since 1 January 2018. The high-voltage network consists of approximately 5,020 kilometres of overhead lines and approximately 3,850 kilometres of underground cables. The ultra-high-voltage grid transports power over greater distances within the Netherlands. The large electric power plants from 500 megavolt-ampere are connected to it. This network also has connections with Belgium, Germany, and also via direct current connections with Great Britain and Norway. TenneT is this grid's network operator; it has a voltage of 220 kilovolts or 380 kilovolts. The ultra-high-voltage grid consists of circa 2,840 kilometres of overhead lines and approximately 40 kilometres of underground cables. Natural gas transmission network The transport networks operated by Gasunie Transport Services (GTS) consist of pipes and stations. The transmission networks are divided into a high-pressure grid (HTL) and an intermediate-pressure grid (RTL) based on pressure class. The HTL is subdivided into a Groningen gas (G-gas) transport network and a high-calorific gas transport network based on the type of gas flowing through the network (see Figure 4.15). Figure 4.15 Transmission network for high-calorific gas (yellow) and Groningen gas (black) (Source: ECN, 2016). Supply station(s) [entry points] Compressor and mixing station Compressor station Mixing station Export station Underground storage facility Liquid natural gas facility Nitrogen injection LNG terminal Pipeline - Groningen gas Pipeline - high calorific gas Pipeline - low calorific gas Pipeline - desulphurised gas Pipeline - nitrogen High calorific gas Air separation facility Nitrogen buffer                                                   124 With reference to overviews of existing transmission infrastructure by TSOs. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   The two HTL networks are connected via blending stations where different combinations of high-calorific gas and nitrogen are added to the G-gas network. The HTL networks contain a large number of compressor stations as well as pipelines. These stations can be used to increase the pressure of the gas to facilitate further transport. Gas is fed into the network at entry points. These can be supply points for gas originating from domestic production, border points where gas enters from other networks (or via an LNG terminal) or points connected to gas storage facilities. Gas can be supplied via the connections with Germany and Belgium and in the form of LNG on the Maasvlakte (the GATE LNG terminal). The possibility of enabling limited supply from the United Kingdom via the Bacton Balgzand Line (BBL) is currently being explored. After transport, gas is removed from the HTL at exit points or at metering and pressure-regulating facilities. Exit points are the transfer points for domestic customers (the gas distribution stations), border points where gas is transferred to other networks and points that are connected to gas storage facilities. The RTL begins at a metering and pressure-regulating facility from which HTL gas is distributed and in turn, the networks of the regional grid operators are largely supplied by exits on the RTL. The RTL is basically only used to transport G-gas. Expected expansion of transmission infrastructure125 Developments in the electricity transmission network The Netherlands has one of the most reliable national electricity grids in the world, with 99.99% reliability (Netbeheer Nederland, 2017). The capacity of the high-voltage grid will be expanded in the next few years in order to provide the electricity market with an effective and reliable supply of energy. Expansions involving the 380 kV network, which are ongoing or planned, include the Randstad 380 kV Noordring connection, the Noord-West connection, the Zuid-West connection and the Doetinchem-Wesel connection (completed at the end of 2018). Developments in the natural gas transmission network GTS regularly compiles a Network Development Plan (NOP), the most recent is the NOP 2017 (see above). This NOP uses three scenarios to demonstrate that the gas transmission system in the Netherlands is robust enough to respond to the expected changes in the supply and demand of gas over the next ten years and that any necessary investments are limited. However, there will be a greater need to convert high-calorific gas into gas that is suitable for the low-calorific consumer market, due to the decision to reduce gas extraction from the Groningen field as quickly as possible and to eventually halt it. This is why at the end of March 2018, the government decided to proceed with the construction of an additional nitrogen plant to allow the decrease in production from the Groningen field to be compensated by the conversion of high-calorific gas to low-calorific gas. The plan is for the plant to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2022 (Gasunie, 2018). 4.5.3 Electricity and gas markets and prices Trends of energy markets and prices Energy prices for end consumers The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for energy reflects price developments for natural gas and electricity consumption by households (see Figure 4.16). Since 2000, household energy bills have increased by an average of 4.5% per year, while inflation has been at an average of 1.8% per annum. The relatively large increase in energy prices for households is partly due to the steady increase in fuel prices on the global market. The CPI for energy fell sharply during the crisis as of the end of 2008, but returned to maximum levels early 2013. Since then it has fallen dramatically once more. The consumer price has since risen slightly due to the increase of the energy raw material in 2016 and this trend continued in 2017 (Statistics Netherlands, 2018a).                                                   125 With reference to national network development plans and regional investment plans of TSOs. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030 119   Figure 4.16 Consumer price index (CPI) for energy, electricity and gas (Source: CBS et al., 2019b)    Price of electricity for end consumers The price of electricity depends, for example, on fuel prices of oil, coal and natural gas (see Figure 4.17). Another key component involves the costs of the transmission networks.              Figure 4.17 Price of electricity for end consumers (Source: CBS et al., 2019b) Price of electricity for end consumers (euros per kWh, excl. VAT and taxes) Consumption class 2,5 2.5 up to 5 MWh (households)  500 to 2,000 MWh (businesses)  150,000 MWh and over (large businesses) 0 | ------- | ------ | -------- | ----- | ------- | ----- | -------- | ------ | -------- | ----- | 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 Price of natural gas for end consumers Figure 4.18 shows the development of the price of natural gas for end consumers as of 2007. In general, the price of natural gas follows the price of crude oil (see Section 4.1.3). Significant world events also have an effect on the price of natural gas. The strong fluctuations of the price for households that take place within a year are the result of the high demand for natural gas during the winter period.  Figure 4.18 Price of natural gas for end consumers (Source: CBS et al., 2019b)  2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 Situation Estimate adopted and proposed policies Cut-off between situation and estimate Bandwidth Key: verbruiksklasse = consumption class  huishoudens = households  zakelijk = business  grootzakelijk = large business  Forecast for electricity market developments The Dutch electricity market is highly integrated with the Northwestern European market. This means developments in our neighbouring countries are crucial to production in the Netherlands, to imports and exports and, to the price of electricity. These developments could involve the development of generation capacity, including the share of renewable energy, and that of the electricity demand in neighbouring countries. Figure 4.19 shows the expected wholesale price in the Netherlands. Major factors that influence the development of wholesale prices up to now include lower fuel prices, overcapacity of supply and the increase in renewable energy generation in the Netherlands and Germany. The increase in the forecast can be explained by the influence of rising fuel prices and the decrease in overcapacity. Figure 4.19 Development of the average wholesale price of electricity (Source: PBL, 2019a) euro2018 per megawatt hour    Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   The wholesale price in the Netherlands is significantly affected by developments in other countries in the Northwestern European market. The network companies of most countries expect a slight increase of the demand for electricity in the long term, due to electrification of the heat demand and transport. The effect is expected to be greater than the reduction in the demand for electricity from energy savings. Every two years, the European network of high-voltage grid operators, ENTSO-E, compiles a pan-European network development plan, referred to as the Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP). For the short term (until 2025) there is one scenario, "Best Estimate". For the longer term, 2030 and 2040, there are several scenarios, all of which are in line with the EU's climate targets for 2030. The development of demand, generation capacity and network connections between countries is based on the Sustainable Transition scenario from the TYNP2018 (ENTSO-E, 2018). In this scenario, the necessary CO2 reduction in the European electricity sector is achieved by replacing lignite and coal-fired generation with natural gas. Both wind energy and solar power capacity in Europe is increasing significantly, from about 106 gigawatts of wind power in 2019 to more than 173 gigawatts by 2030. Solar power capacity will increase from 71 gigawatts in 2019 to 131 gigawatts by 2030. The capacity of lignite and coal-fired power plants in Europe will decrease from 64 gigawatts in 2019 to below 19 gigawatts by 2030. The capacity of gas-fired power plants is expected to increase by 25 gigawatts from 2019 to 100 gigawatts in 2030 (see Figure 4.20).

An important reason for this is the increase in interconnections and market integration. Moreover, the two countries increasingly resemble one another in terms of the composition of their generation capability, given that the share of renewable energy is growing in the Netherlands and nuclear power and coal-fired capacity are being phased out in Germany. By 2030, prices in the Netherlands will be slightly lower than in Germany, though the difference will be negligible. In the next few years, the price of electricity in the United Kingdom will be relatively high because the old coal-fired power plants have been decommissioned. Afterwards the price difference will decrease due to the increase in the capacity of gas-fired power plants and renewable energy sources. The capacity of the network connections between the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe will also be expanded significantly as of 2020. However, any future expectations involving the United Kingdom will be subject to change, given that they depend on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. 4.5.4 Electricity and gas market operations Based on quantitative data, this section provides a better understanding of the functioning of energy markets in the Netherlands. The annual reports produced by the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER/CEER) have been used to achieve the results of the monitoring of the internal electricity and gas market. ACER/ CEER, in cooperation with national regulators, compiles reports on wholesale markets, retail markets and consumer protection in Europe126. These reports focus, among other things, on developments in supply and demand, prices and the liquidity of energy markets. For the sake of brevity, an explanation is provided of the liquidity of wholesale gas and electricity markets and some indicators of "market health" for wholesale gas. For detailed information on the availability of cross-border capacity and the efficient use thereof, refer to the actual reports. The liquidity of the wholesale electricity market Liquidity can be measured in different ways. The churn factor is the volume traded through stock exchanges and mediators in relation to physical consumption. The higher this factor, the greater the liquidity. In the Netherlands, the churn factor increased by 10% between 2016 and 2017 (see Figure 4.22). High liquidity contributes to a competitive market.                                                  126 See https://www.ceer.eu/web/portal/national-reporting-2018 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   Figure 4.22 Churn factors in key European forward markets 2014-2017 (source: ACER/CEER, 2018a)   2014 2015 2016 2017                         The liquidity of the wholesale natural gas market Being an established hub, the Dutch gas market is one of the highest category hubs, with broad liquidity, large forward markets, which contribute to the possibilities of covering supply risks and serving as a reference price for other hubs in the European Union and for the indexation of long-term contracts (see Figure 4.23)  Figure 4.23 Ranking of hubs in the EU based on monitoring data from 2017 (Source: ACER/CEER, 2018b)   Established hubs Broad liquidity Sizeable forward markets which contribute to supply hedging Price reference for other EU hubs and for long-term contracts indexation  Advanced hubs High liquidity More reliant comparatively on spot products Progress on supply hedging role but relatively lower liquidity levels of longer-term products  Emerging hubs Improving liquidity from a lower base taking advantage of enhanced interconnectivity and regulatory interventions High reliance on long-term contracts and bilateral deals  Liquid-incipient hubs Embryonic liquidity at a low level and mainly focused on spot Core reliance on long-term contracts and bilateral deals Diverse group with some jurisdictions having - organised markets in early stage - to develop entry-exit systems   Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    The Dutch market for Title Transfer Facilities (TTF) for "day-ahead (DA) gas" is the largest in the EU. During the 2016-2017 period, the number of transactions decreased by 15% and average price volatility decreased from about 40% to over 30%. Via TTF, gas already located in the Dutch network can be transferred without leaving the network, thereby promoting market liquidity. See figures 4.24 and 4.25.   Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   Figure 4.24 The average price volatility of the day-ahead gas market in selected EU hubs in 2016 and 2017 as a % (Source: ACER/CEER, 2018b)     DA products   Figure 4.25 Number of implemented "trades" daily average of day-ahead products in 2017 and percentage change compared with 2016 (Source: ACER/CEER, 2018b)           The previously cited report on the wholesale market for gas also includes indicators for "market health". For the purpose of illustration we specify how the Netherlands scores for these indicators (Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index (HHI) and residual supply (RSI). The higher the HHI, the greater the market share of the largest suppliers. The RSI indicates the percentage of the supply within one country for which there are alternatives to the largest provider. The higher the RSI, the "more competitive" the market. The Netherlands scores in the green healthy zone (see Figure 4.26).     Figure 4.26   [Figure not reproduced: see original document]   Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   Consumer satisfaction with energy suppliers The Energy Monitor of the Consumer and Market Authority (ACM) focuses on consumer satisfaction with their energy supplier. Satisfaction in 2019 is comparable to previous years. Satisfaction with the process of switching to another supplier is high, with 87% satisfied to very satisfied (see Figure 4.27).   4.5.5 Energy poverty Internationally, there is no clear-cut definition of the concept of energy poverty. Moreover, the Netherlands does not have a specific policy on energy poverty (see Chapter 2), which means no specific data is collected for this topic. The European Energy Poverty Observatory (EPOV) collects and bundles knowledge related to energy poverty across the EU. Data originate, among others, from Eurostat's annual EU SILC survey. The EPOV uses four primary indicators of energy poverty: 1. The percentage of households that indicate they cannot afford to adequately heat their home, based on the question: "Can your household afford to keep its home adequately warm?" 2. The percentage of households that indicate payment arrears of their energy bill, based on the question: "In the last twelve months, has the household been in arrears, i.e. has been unable to pay on time due to financial difficulties for utility bills (heating, electricity, gas, water, etc.) for the main dwelling?" 3. The indicator for Hidden Energy Poverty, based on the percentage of households with absolute energy expenditure lower than half the national median. 4. The "double median energy ratio", which is equal to the percentage of households that spends a greater share of income on energy than twice the national median share. Based on the EPOV indicators, we can see that energy poverty in the Netherlands is less common than in the rest of the European Union. The first indicator reveals how citizens judge the extent to which they are financially able to adequately heat their home. Figure 4.28 shows that households in the Netherlands are far less likely to experience financial problems in this area than people elsewhere in Europe. We observe the highest scores in specific countries in Central, Eastern and Southern Europe. Only 2.6 percent of Dutch respondents said in 2016 that they had difficulty paying to heat their home. The Netherlands also scores exceptionally low with regard to the second indicator, the percentage of households with payment arrears of their energy bill (2%). The percentage of households with payment arrears in the Netherlands in 2016 was even the lowest of all EU countries (Figure 4.29). Central, Eastern and Southern European countries also demonstrated the highest percentages for this indicator too. The Netherlands' score for the indicator for Hidden Energy Poverty (energy expenditure lower than half the national median) (circa 3.5%) is also the lowest of all countries in the EU (Figure 4.30). Finally, with 6.5 percent, the Netherlands also has the lowest score for the share of households with an energy ratio above the double median, the fourth indicator.

It opted for a broader interpretation of the concept of energy poverty. Among other things, extremely energy-efficient behaviour for financial reasons, as well as disconnection due to lack of payment falls under energy poverty (PBL, 2018b). The report looked at the share of disposable income a household spends on energy (the energy ratio) and the extent to which a household has money left over for basic living expenses after housing and energy costs (the payment risk). PBL is introducing a methodology for determining the average energy bill per income group, in which the Netherlands is divided into five income groups. If disposable income minus the actual net cost of energy and housing is less than the minimum standard amount for (other) basic costs, the household will not be left with enough at the end of the month to cover basic living costs. This can lead to payment arrears and debts for energy, rent or mortgage, but also for care or other domains. One problem with the energy ratio as an indicator is that there is no clear limit as to when the energy burden is too high. At the household level, the energy ratio merely provides an indication of energy costs as part of a household's total budget. The payment risk indicator does give an idea of whether a household has a financial problem. The disadvantage of the payment risk indicator is that it is not clear whether an affordability issue stems from the level of the energy bill. Households with a high energy ratio do not always present a payment risk, and conversely, a payment risk does not automatically mean a high energy ratio. As shown in Figure 4.31, in the Netherlands there was a total of 528,000 households with a payment risk in 2014-2015. About half of these households (269,000) also have a high energy ratio. The remaining (259,000) households do not have a high energy ratio, but often relatively high living costs (low incomes). This may indicate a form of hidden energy poverty, but can also be due to an outdoor lifestyle or an energy-efficient newly-built house, which means that energy consumption is relatively low.  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   Figure 4.31 Households according to energy ratio and payment risk in 2014 (source: PBL, 2018b)  High energy ratio  269,000 Households (4.0%) with a high energy ratio and payment risk   385,000 Households (5.7%) with only a high energy ratio     Payment risk No payment risk   259,000 Households (3.8%) with only payment risk  5.8 million 5.8 million Households (86.5%) with a low energy ratio and no payment risk       3.8 million Tenants Owner-occupiers  Low energy ratio    The remaining 6.2 million households posed no payment risk in 2014-2015, but some had relatively high energy costs given their 00 per month of disposable income available, on top of the minimum required budget. The 528,000 households with a payment risk have an affordability issue related to living and energy costs. Some of them, 259,000 households, do not have a high energy ratio. These households have insufficient budget for the minimum cost of living due to low income and/or high housing costs. It often concerns younger, small households who have recently moved or live in a highly urban environment. Tenants are also over-represented in this group. In general, it concerns households in newly-built homes with higher living costs and lower energy costs as well as households in smaller homes with relatively high living costs and poor energy labels. The remaining 269,000 households with a payment risk are very similar in composition to other households with a payment risk, but are more likely to live in an older home with a poor energy label. Moreover, they have little to no financial scope to cope with changes in spending.
