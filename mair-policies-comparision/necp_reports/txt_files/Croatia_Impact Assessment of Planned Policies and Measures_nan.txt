222  5. IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF PLANNED POLICIES AND MEASURES 5.1 Impacts of planned policies and measures described in section 3 on energy system and GHG emissions and removals, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures (as described in section 4) i. Projections of the development of the energy system and GHG emissions and removals as well as, where relevant of emissions of air pollutants in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/2284 under the planned policies and measures at least until ten years after the period covered by the plan (including for the last year of the period covered by the plan), including relevant Union policies and measures Projections of the most important energy and climate indicators, taking into account the expected sectoral changes by 2030, are presented below: o Immediate energy consumption is expected to amount to 286.9 PJ in 2030, representing a change of 8.1% and -15% in comparison to 2005 consumption o The expected reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from energy sources amounts to 31.2% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels  o The renovation rate in the period 2021 to 2030 is growing from the current 0.7% per annum for the period 2014-2019 in steps of 1.1% to 3.0%, reaching a 10-year average of 1.6%. The rate of abandonment of the existing building stock is significantly increased, as evidenced by the increase in temporarily unoccupied units in the period between two consecutive censuses. o The penetration of electric, hybrid and hydrogen-powered vehicles is expected to reach 3.5% of total road passenger activity in 2030 o Increase in the share of renewable energy sources in gross final energy consumption to 36.4% by 2030  o Decarbonisation of electricity production by increasing the share of renewable energy sources to 63.8% by 2030  Increasing energy efficiency is strongly present in all sectors of consumption, with the strongest effects expected in the building sector and transport.  In the building sector, a continuation of good practices and strengthening of energy efficient of all buildings (residential and non-residential) is expected, targeting renovation according to the nZEB standard, which also implies a greater utilization of RES (photovoltaic systems, solar thermal collectors, biomass boilers, heat pumps). 223  The projections of greenhouse gas emissions from mobile and fixed energy sources in the Republic of Croatia is shown in Figure 5-1. The scenario with existing measures and the scenario with additional measures are presented.   Figure 5-1. Greenhouse emissions projections for the scenario with existing measures and scenario with additional measures - energy sources The potential of additional measures to reduce emissions by energy sector is illustrated in Table 5-1, and it represents the difference between emissions from scenarios with existing and additional measures.

For the scenario with existing measures, the reference scenario (NUR) is selected and for the scenario with additional measures the gradual transition scenario (NU1) is selected.  Figure 5-2. GHG projections for the scenario with existing measures and scenario with additional measures - non-energy sources The potential of additional emission reduction measures for non-energy sectors is shown in Table 5-2, and represents the difference between the greenhouse gas emissions of the NUR and NU1 scenarios. Table 5-2.: Greenhouse gas reduction potential for additional measures, non-energy sources CO2e emission reductions (kt) 2025 2030 2035 2040 Industrial processes  163 155 239 323 Agriculture 118 162 200 237 Waste* 0 0 0 0 Emission reduction potential - non energy sources 281 316 439 560 225  * - The NU1 scenarios are equal to the NUR scenario for the Waste sector, as no additional measures have been identified. Both scenarios involve the implementation of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from solid waste disposal. The total GHG emissions in the Republic of Croatia are shown in Figure 5-3. The trend of historical emissions and expected emission reductions for the scenario with existing measures and the scenario with additional measures are shown. Greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 would be 28.9-33.5% below 1990 levels. During 2019, projections of emissions from energy and non-energy sources will be approximated, and adjustments in emissions projections may happen.  Figure 5-3. Projection of total greenhouse gas emissions, for the scenario with existing measures and the scenario with additional measures In these scenarios, the Republic of Croatia fulfils its obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the sectors outside of ETS by 2030. (-7 %). Emission reductions from the sectors outside ETS would be 12.7-18.5% by 2030, compared to 2005 emissions (Figure 5-4.). 226   Figure 5-4. Projection of greenhouse gas emissions from sectors outside of ETS, for the scenario with existing measures and the scenario with additional measures Emission reductions in the ETS sector would be 30.1-34.3% in 2030. The projection of greenhouse gas emissions for the ETS sector is shown in Figure 5-5.   Figure 5-5. Projection of greenhouse gas emissions from the ETS sector, for the scenario with existing measures and the scenario with additional measures For the scenario with existing measures (WEM) and scenario with additional measures (WAM), greenhouse gas emissions for international air transport have also been calculated, based on the energy balance data for the projection period 2020-2040. The GHG projections are equal for both scenarios analysed (Table 5-3). 227  Table 5-3.: Greenhouse gas emissions from international air transport CO2e (kt) emission 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 International Air Transport (WEM = WAM) 380.7 390.0 399.4 400.9 402.4 ii. Assessment of policy interactions (between existing policies and measures and planned policies and measures within a policy dimension and between existing policies and measures and planned policies and measures of different dimensions) at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, in particular to establish a robust understanding of the impact of energy efficiency / energy savings policies on the sizing of the energy system and to reduce the risk of stranded investment in energy supply The description of each measure indicates the dimensions to which the measure in question has an effect. iii. Assessment of the interactions between existing policies and measures and planned policies and measures, as well as between those policies and measures and the Union climate and energy policy measures The description of each measure indicates the dimensions to which the measure in question has an effect. 5.2 Macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmental, employment and education, skills and social impacts, including just transition aspects (in terms of costs and benefits as well as cost-effectiveness) of the planned policies and measures described in section 3 at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures Within the framework of the analysis of the consequences pertaining to the transition to low carbon scenarios, the impact of the transition on the so-called classic pollutants, especially SO2, NOX and fine particles (PM2,5) was analysed. The calculations show that by switching to low-carbon scenarios in 2030, the emissions of these pollutants into the air will be reduced from 9% to 32%. Reducing pollutant emissions will have a positive effect on health, especially in cities. Macroeconomic effects are analysed on the basis of an estimate of total investments in the period 2021 to 2050, as analysed in the "Green Book". Scenario S2 was used to assess the effect, projecting total investment of HRK 378.90 billion, of which HRK 141.47 billion in the period 2021 to 2030, and HRK 237.43 billion in the period 2031 to 2050. The assumption of the analysis is that investments are linearly distributed by year, i.e. that on average, HRK 14.148 billion is invested annually in the first period, or HRK 11.872 billion in the second period.  228  Macroeconomic effects are calculated by input-output analysis based on the input-output table for the Republic of Croatia for 2015, published in 2019 on Eurostat. The analysis takes into account the direct and indirect, multiplicative, effects of investments that are disaggregated by different estimates into individual activities (out of a total of 65 activities), which are in the symmetric input-output table, given the specificity of each investment. Direct effects include additional employment, i.e. income, in the sectors producing goods and services to meet the additional final demand. Indirect effects include indirect employment, i.e. income, of other sectors that increase production levels to deliver the intermediate inputs required for production in the sector that directly supplies output for final demand. The input-output model covers the existing technological links between 65 different activities i.e. sectors of the Croatian economy. The ratio of imported and domestic components is based on the input-output table for 2015. The results of the analysis are divided into two periods: 2021 to 2030 and 2031 to 2050. The results of the first period analysis indicate that the total investment projected by the energy plan will have an effect on the increase of GDP (and gross value added) of between 2 and 2.5 percent given 2018 GDP levels. In the growth structure, construction, sector F, has 32%, non-construction industry including agriculture and mining and quarrying 34% along with tertiary services in the amount of 34%. Employment will increase by about 2.4 percent in the first year compared to the total number of employed persons in 2017, i.e. approximately 40 thousand newly employed persons, 44 percent of which in the activity of construction (50 percent of new jobs are the result of investments in the building sector), approximately 33 percent in industry, and the remaining approximately 23 percent in tertiary activities. It is expected that employment growth will not be of equal dynamics in the coming years due to the increase in worker productivity, the deployment of new technologies, the relocation of workers from completed works to new jobs, etc. Considering the historical data on employment trends by sectors with investments made, especially in the building sector, it is expected that the number of employees will increase in the amount between 40 and 80 thousand new employed persons, as a result of investments projected by the Energy and Climate Plan (compared to 2017). The analyses carried out and the results obtained indicate the significant macroeconomic effects of the integrated national energy and climate plan on the Croatian economy, shown through its impact on GDP and employment, both overall and by sectors. The conducted analysis is to a certain extent limited by the availability and quality of the required input data, which primarily refers to the disaggregation of total investments by sectors of the Croatian economy and the ratios of imported and domestic components by sectors of the input-output table for 2015. Input-output analysis is a static analysis and does not take into account future changes in technological links between different industries. Also, this analysis does not cover the induced effects, which include induced employment, i.e. the income generated by producers of goods and services intended for household consumption.  229  5.3 Overview of investments needs i. Existing investment flows and forward investment assumptions with regard to the planned policies and measures Table 5-4 show an estimate of total investment for the period 2021-2030 as well as for the period 2031-2050. Table 5-4.: Estimation of total investments for the years 2021 - 2030 and 2031 - 2050. HRK billions 2021  2030 2031 2050 Electricity generation 16.32 36.86 Transmission of electricity 7.90 9.90 Electricity distribution 10.0 20.0 Heating 0.60 1.20 Solar thermal systems 3.04 6.08 Natural gas transportation and distribution 10.7 2.80 Oil sector 13.0 9.9 Hydrocarbon prospecting 24.3 14.3 Building sector- energy renovation of buildings 13.06 27.91 Building sector- nZEB new construction 38.26 104.42 Infrastructure of alternative energy forms in transport 0.57 3.34 Production of advanced biofuels 3.73 0.72 Total 141.47 237.43 The largest investments are expected in installations for electricity production (the major part of which will be investments in installations using renewable energy sources) and in the building sector, namely the construction of buildings and houses with nearly zero-energy consumption. In terms of the necessary incentives, the greatest need will be in the energy renovation of the existing building stock. ii. Sector or market risk factors or barriers in the national or regional context The most important risks are related to delays in the implementation of regulatory measures and insufficient funds to implement financial measures. These risks will be minimized by continuous monitoring of the implementation of measures and, if necessary, corrective action.  230  iii. Analysis of additional public finance support or resources to fill identified gaps identified under point ii It is expected that the most significant part of the required funds will be provided from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), the Modernization Fund, the Innovation Fund, funds from emission allowances auctioning, European research and development and competitiveness programmes and from national sources. Funding from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is expected. 5.4 Impacts of planned policies and measures described in section 3 on other Member States and regional cooperation at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including comparison to projections with existing policies and measures i. Impacts on the energy system in neighbouring and other Member States in the region to the extent possible Cross-border and regional integration of energy markets is expected to lead to lower energy and energy generating product prices. At the same time, greater integration of variable renewable energy sources into national electricity systems will cause increased variability in cross-border electricity flows, which will require the construction of more robust transmission grids and possibly the construction of new interconnectors, which may reduce the quality of electricity delivered to customers and potentially compromise the stability of the system's operation for an expected lower inertia and higher speeds of frequency change. Quality problems and reduced system inertia are expected to be addressed on a European level. ii. Impacts on energy prices, utilities and energy market integration The changes that are expected in the energy sector are economically viable and will not ultimately entail higher costs. In doing so, the nature of costs will change - investment costs will increase and operating and energy costs will be reduced. Ultimately, energy markets will be fully integrated, both geographically - at the level of the European Union and neighbouring countries, as well as across sectors - there will be an interconnection of the electricity, heat, gas and transport sectors. iii. If relevant, impacts on regional cooperation It will be necessary to further strengthen cross-border and regional cooperation in all dimensions of the Energy Union.
