The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         4.2.   4.2.1. GHG emissions and removals  i. Trends in current GHG emissions and removals in the EU ETS, effort sharing and LULUCF sectors and different energy sectors The trend in the greenhouse gas emissions in Romania (excluding LULUCF) is falling, the most significant reduction being recorded in 1991, i.e. 19 % compared to 1990. In principle, this is due to the 27 % decrease in the industrial activity in the same year. GHG emissions of 92 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent were recorded in 2017, which equates to a 60 % decrease (including LULUCF) compared to emissions recorded in 1990 (229 Mt of CO2 equivalent) and to a 54 % decrease excluding LULUCF. Romania is currently contributing with approximately 2.5 % of the total share of GHG emissions at EU level, excluding LULUCF, which is falling compared to 1990, when contribution was over 4 %58.

Even if, also for this sector, a significant reduction was recorded, it was below the reduction in total GHG emissions in the period 1990-2017 so, today, this sector (also including the transport sector) accounts for 82 % of the total GHG emissions, including LULUCF, and for 66 % of the total emissions, excluding LULUCF. Moreover, a reduction in the GHG emissions was also caused by an increase in the reduction of emissions due to LULUCF.                                                  58 According to the EU emissions data from Eurostat, indicator env_ac_io10 The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Chart 17 - Trend in the structure of GHG emissions by sector between 1990 and 2017, including LULUCF  Source: Ministry of the Environment, Waters and Forests, National Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, 2018 RO EN Energie Energy  Industrial production LULUCF LULUCF  Agriculture  Waste  As regards emissions in 2017, excluding LULUCF, the energy sector accounted for 66 % of the total emissions in 2017, the energy industry representing the main source (33 % of the total emissions from the entire energy sector, i.e. a quarter of the total GHG emissions recorded in 2017), followed by agriculture (17 %) and industrial production (12 %).

It is thus noticeable that most of the GHG emissions (65.9 %) are CO2 emissions, followed by CH4 emissions with 25.2 % of the total emissions, whereas SF6 and PFCs emissions account for less than 1 % of the total emissions.

Projections of sectoral developments with existing national and Union policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) Considering the existing measures, the trend in GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) is projected in the following chart. In this context, the historical trend in the reduction of emissions is likely to be maintained in the future as well, reaching an emissions reduction rate of 49 % in 2030 compared to 1990, such decrease being expected to continue also after this reference year.

As for the non-ETS sector, an increase of approximately 3 % is expected by 2030 compared to the emissions recorded in 2005. Total GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) is likely to reach 126 Mt of CO2 equivalent, which would mean an emissions reduction by 15 % compared to 2005 and by approximately 49 % compared to 1990.

Renewable energy i. Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in each of these sectors According to the latest public information available, Romania recorded a 24 % share of renewable energy in the gross final consumption, this indicator recording an increase from 17 % in 2005. This trend was also recorded in the presented sectors, the highest trend being recorded for the share of renewable energy in the consumption of electricity.

This share had been fully triggered by the production of hydro-power until 2009. In this respect, the increase in the RES-E share in the period 2010-2017 was triggered by the development of the wind and solar technologies, a significant increase being recorded in the production of onshore wind energy. On the other hand, gross final consumption of electricity followed a slightly upward trend.

As for sources of consumption/production of renewable energy, no significant changes have been recorded. Final renewable energy consumption is totally accounted for by consumption of biomass (firewood, agricultural waste). At the same time, no gross final consumption of energy from the use of heat pumps has been recorded in Romania to this date.

However, these indicators are relevant for assessing the trend in the main factors underlying the composition of the share. In the period 2005-2017, final energy consumption in this sector recorded a general increase, the only exceptions being recorded in 2010 and 2013. Renewable energy consumption largely followed the same trend. As for the trend in the structure of the final renewable energy consumption in transport, the main changes were marked by:  a significant increase in consumption of compliant biofuels for its consideration in the calculation of the renewable energy share; the reduced value of this indicator in 2011 was triggered by the fact that a considerable amount was considered to be non-compliant; The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          an upward trend in the consumption of electricity from renewable sources in the road transport;  a slight increase in the consumption of electricity from renewable sources in the rail transport;  a decrease in the consumption of renewable energy in types of transport other than road and rail transport.

Indicative projections of development with existing policies for the year 2030 (with an outlook to the year 2040) In the context of current policies, an increase in the RES share is expected for all indicators. The highest increase is likely to be recorded for the share of renewable energy in transport, which is likely to reach 11.2 % in 2030. This trend, although favourable, would not be enough The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         to achieve the EU target of 14 % (set afterwards by amending the RED)59), so additional measures will be required to increase this indicator. Moreover, the projection of the RES-T share does not take into account the new calculation methodology for this indicator, which entails different multipliers for biofuels and consumption of electricity from renewable sources. Furthermore, the improvement in the heating and cooling sector are not considerable, so this sector should also be considered when developing policies designed to foster consumption of renewable energy, in a linear increase, in accordance with the Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable energy sources, as amended in 2018 (Interinstitutional File 2016/0382).  Chart 27 - Projections regarding the trend in the RES shares in the context of current policies  Source: The 2016 PRIMES Scenario prepared by the Ministry of the Economy, Energy and the Business Environment  RO EN SRE RES SRE-Î&R RES-H&C SRE-E RES-E SRE-T RES-T  Projected trend in final renewable energy consumption in the context of current policies - electricity (RES-E) In the forthcoming period, all sources of production of renewable energy are expected to record an increase (solar energy in particular) against the background of a cost reduction trend for the wind and solar energy following technological developments. Hydro-power is expected to record a slight increase until 2020 and then to slightly fall and to relatively level out until 2035. However, this increase in renewable energy consumption will not translate into                                                 59 Renewable Energy Directive The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         significant increases in the RES share because of an almost equivalent increase in the total gross final consumption of electricity.

Final consumption of renewable energy will constantly increase by 2035, with the exception of 2030, when a drop will be recorded. As for the structure of the final renewable energy consumption, the main change compared to the historical trend will be reflected in the energy consumed through heat pumps and by an increase in the production of renewable energy derived from heat, in particular in 2035.
