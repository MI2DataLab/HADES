3.4. Dimension 4: Internal energy market   3.4.1. Electricity infrastructure  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 178 of 268    i. Policies and measures to achieve interconnectivity of the electricity grid taking into account EU interconnectivity targets  In 2017, the electricity interconnection level in Austria was 15.3%, and was therefore already been set for 2030 in Austria. However, it is to be expected that, in view of the national target of increase. Austria will therefore also continue to drive forward the socially and environmentally compatible development of the network infrastructure (also see point 3.4 in this regard).  ii. Regional cooperation in this area  During the process of drawing up the draft National Energy and Climate Plan, regional Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and Italy, as well as with Poland, Croatia and Belgium. As part of this, the majority of Member States, including Austria, have chosen to invite each other to cooperation meetings. Each of these meetings saw several Member States come together to inform one another of the contents of their respective draft NECPs and to identify possible connecting factors enabling closer cooperation.  In the scope of the internal energy market dimension, there was above all discussion of the following subjects for closer cooperation:   Cooperation in the scope of implementing the EU electricity market design package  Exchange on integration projects and cross-border infrastructure    For further details, also see point 1.4, Regional cooperation     iii. (National and EU) financing measures, where applicable  To implement the planned measures under the National Energy and Climate Plan, there will be considerable need for investment, which must equally comprise contributions from public authorities (Federal Government, provinces, EU) and the private sector within the meaning of the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement (in particular Article 2.1.c PA). The auction of certificates in the EU Emission Trading Scheme generates income for Member States, which may constitute a significant source for financing climate protection measures. The overall investment volume ultimately expected for achieving the targets is decisively determined by the assumed mix of regulatory, support and tax measures. The cost-effectiveness of the climate- and energy-Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 179 of 268  relevant support landscape has an equally determining effect on investment as the expected effect of regulatory plans and/or the degree of effectiveness of new instruments in the area of tory measures do not necessarily or directly have to trigger investment-relevant financing flows, but can also constitute directly relevant contributions to adhering to the Energy Union objectives.     3.4.2. Energy transmission infrastructure   i. Measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.2, including Projects of Common Interest (PCIs)   Accelerating, reducing bureaucracy and simplifying licensing procedures Innovation and investment require a suitable framework. In order to resolve underinvestment, it is crucial to provide planning and legal certainty and to reduce bureaucracy. This applies in particular to infrastructure projects which are essential for energy transition.  At present, the procedures in place are too complicated and lengthy. This is slowing the transformation of the energy system and, in the medium term, is a risk to supply security. The aim is therefore to accelerate, reduce bureaucracy and simplify licensing procedures in line with civil rights and relevant EU legislation. In this way, obstacles will be removed and investment in the energy system increased.   Integrated grid infrastructure plan (see also point 3.1.2, sub-point i) At present, European law requires that long-term plans be put in place to expand gas and electricity grids within the overall transmission network. Not only are those plans currently being drawn up separately, meaning that fundamental issues in terms of a strategically positive balance between the two energy sources are being overlooked, no consideration is being given to challenges at the level of the distribution network and potential consistency.  In order to exploit existing potential for optimisation by way of closer mutual consideration of the electricity and gas system, an integrated grid infrastructure plan will act in future as a cornerstone of the supply strategy, demonstrating the interfaces and potential to be found. It will do so, for example, by identifying optimal locations for large storage and conversion facilities such as power-to-gas and similar options.  For this to be done, legal amendments to the Electricity Industry and Organisation Act 2010 and Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 180 of 268  the Gas Act 2011 will also be required. These amendments will include definitions of the roles of the Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism, the involvement of the provinces and municipalities (for example with regard to the consideration of spatial-planning concerns), the transmission system operators and the regulatory authority. Moreover, they will lay down the planning period for provisions and establish how this plan is evaluated.  Simplification of power line regulations (see also point 3.1.2, sub-point i) Power line regulations are due to be simplified by way of an exemption from approval under electricity law for medium-voltage power lines of up to 45 kV, whereby the current threshold of 1 kV will be increased to 45 kV. This is hugely important as there will be increased demand in the coming years to expand the medium-voltage sector due to the need for charging points in the field of e-mobility, a greater number of installations for generating renewable energy and grid infrastructure which is adapted to greater decentralised production and increased flow rates. Exempting transmission installations of up to 45 kV from approval would result in fewer approval procedures under power line regulations, thereby relieving the processing burden on operators of such installations (in particular distribution system operators) and the approval authorities (in particular provincial governments responsible under provincial legislation on power lines).  Legislation establishing district heating transmission rights District heating is disadvantaged by the fact that transmission rights may not be established by issuing a decision where approval is denied by the owner of the land. This creates unnecessary additional costs, resulting in a cost barrier for connections.  Planned measures in relation to PCIs With regard to PCIs, it is necessary to refer to the procedure for approving PCIs at national level established under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013. That procedure includes a rapid approval process, streamlined administrative structures and stakeholder participation. Austria has yet to approve any projects under this procedure as no corresponding applications for approval have been received.     ii. Regional cooperation in this area  During the process of drawing up the draft National Energy and Climate Plan, regional Hungary, Slovenia and Italy, as well as with Poland, Croatia and Belgium. As part of this, the majority of Member States, including Austria, have chosen to invite each other to cooperation meetings. Each of these meetings saw several Member States come together to inform one another of the contents of their respective draft NECPs and to identify possible connecting factors enabling closer cooperation. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 181 of 268      In the scope of the internal energy market dimension, there was above all discussion of the following subjects for closer cooperation:   Cooperation in the scope of implementing the EU electricity market design package  Exchange on integration projects and cross-border infrastructure    For further details, also see point 1.4, Regional cooperation     iii. (National and EU) financing measures, where applicable  At EU level, financial aid for PCIs can be applied for through the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA) is the settlement centre for CEF support. However, this is due to be replaced by a new Regulation (see proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Connecting Europe Facility and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1316/2013 and (EU) No 283/2014, 2018/0228 (COD)). In addition to CEF energy, other EU support funds such as EFSI (in future investEU) and cohesion policy funding (in particular ERDF) are also available for PCIs.  Nevertheless, financial aid is possible to obtain from the EIB or EBRD under different criteria.     3.4.3. Market integration   i. Measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.3   Regulations concerning the internal electricity market (Internal Electricity Market Directive) - Transposition into new Austrian Electricity Market Act [Strommarktgesetz] The current legal framework concerning the electricity industry requires fundamental renewal on the basis of the new Directive containing common rules for the internal market for electricity (2019/944) and in view of crucial changes to the electricity industry situation (AT/DE price zone separation, price developments). Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 182 of 268  Essential elements of a new Electricity Market Act are:   Strengthening customer rights: dynamic electricity tariffs, special rights of active customers, definition and measures for combating energy poverty.  Definition of new actors: storage facilities, PtX installations, aggregators, community models, active customers; plus associated amendment of the unbundling rules.  Reconfiguration of the network charges: connection charges, work-power adjustment, G component (transposition of the EU Balancing Guideline), charges for new actors, flexible charges.  Demand Response concept: developing flexibility markets, facilitating market access for consumption systems (in particular control reserve, bottleneck management).    Timetable:  The Internal Electricity Market Directive will be transposed by 31 December 2020 (1st half of 2020: Drafting/2nd half of 2020: Legislation)  Further measures in the field of market integration   Sending correct price signals to market operators This implies, above all, allowing price spikes (scarcity pricing) and limiting interference with pricing mechanisms. Negative wholesale prices should be avoided in line with European practice.  Making entry into the energy balancing and reserve market more attractive Important measures include amending regulatory requirements, helping to reduce intervals and encouraging the entry of new participants. This will also prevent counterproductive incentives in relation to climate and energy targets.  Introducing annual flexibility reporting In order to better understand the energy balancing and reserve market, each year it is essential to examine the potential for flexibility, the number of flexibility providers on the energy reserve markets and the number of industrial customers providing flexibility.  Promoting stable conditions and reduction of bureaucracy for aggregators Aggregators will be supported by stable conditions and a reduction in bureaucracy involved in Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 183 of 268  participating in the market. To do so requires a clear legal framework for aggregators and third parties.  Dividing infrastructure costs fairly The cost of maintaining and expanding the grid infrastructure needed to transform the energy system must be distributed fairly between all network users, even in cases of increasing private generation. Non-balancing of meter points will be ensured in this regard.  ii. Measures to increase the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy such as smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, real-time price signals, including the roll-out of intraday market coupling and cross-border balancing markets   Making energy systems more flexible To maximise the use of renewable energy when making efficient use of existing and new infrastructure, flexibility in the energy system must be encouraged, including:   Flexibility in the area of energy provision (sector coupling, targeted temporal use of non-volatile sources such as biomass, etc.)  Flexibility in consumption (e.g. buffering of thermal energy for heating and cooling building stock, adapting industrial and commercial processes)  Flexibility through storage (e.g. electricity, heating and gas storage facilities)  Flexibility through smart grid management (e.g. smart electricity grids, flexible heating grids)   Sector coupling Sector coupling is a vital part of developing a decarbonised energy system. This means linking together previously separate systems (electricity, heating, mobility, industry). Through renewable energy sources which supply electricity in particular, sector coupling will help decarbonise all sectors of the economy. Furthermore, through the use of energy-efficient technology, e.g. heating powered by heat pumps, electric vehicles, etc., energy consumption will be reduced significantly. Sector coupling makes it possible for large, cost-effective energy storage facilities to be used outside of the electricity sector and for the flexibility of electricity demand to be increased significantly. In this way, fluctuations in variable renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar energy, can be offset without having to rely too much on more expensive electricity storage. The following coupling is currently in use or being tested: power-to-Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 184 of 268  gas, power-to-heat, power-to-chemicals and cogeneration.  Storage capacity See point 3.3, sub-point i  Extending alternative financing instruments and citizen participation for renewable energy and efficiency projects is being considered. Österreichische Kontrollbank (OeKB) has also successfully issued its first sustainability bond. This bond has a term of 7 years, -up in respect of the Austrian federal bond was 10 basis points.     iii. Where applicable, measures to ensure non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response, etc.  See point 3.4.3, sub-points ii and v.     iv. Where applicable, measures to protect consumers, especially against energy poverty  In addition to generally applicable consumer law, numerous energy-specific measures have already been put in place to protect consumers, and in particular low-income households in energy poverty (see 3.4.4. in this regard):  Basic supply for household customers is mandatory (see Section 77 of the Electricity Industry and Organisation Act 2010 (= contracting obligation));  A tariff calculator has been set up by the regulatory authority so that price-related data and conditions are published in a way which is transparent and non-discriminatory in order to also make it easy to switch supplier (see Section 65 of the Electricity Industry and Organisation Act 2010);  A rigorous electricity labelling system is in place aimed at providing end electricity consumers with a breakdown of the share of each energy source (primary energy sources) found in the energy mix used by suppliers the previous year. In this way, end customers are also able to assess the electricity supplied on the basis of qualitative characteristics (see in particular Section 79a of the Electricity Industry and Organisation Act);  Dynamic pricing: Smart meter rollout + accompanying measures such as a right to Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 185 of 268  monthly billing in accordance with Section 81(6) of the Electricity Industry and Organisation Act 2010  In the case of green finance instruments for consumers, ensuring that the information provided by the companies to the consumers is easily comprehensible.    As an integral part of end customer services, E-Control has set up an arbitration body - notified by the Federal Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs, Health and Consumer Protection (BMASGK) to the European Commission - through which electricity and gas customers may seek help in the event of difficulties with grid operators or suppliers.  Furthermore, in order to streguidelines, for example, have been developed for consumers, electricity traders and suppliers by the regulatory authority in order to explain more clearly the complex legal bases and correlations in the form of an overview and as regards the processes carried out.  Measures for combating energy poverty See point 3.4.4.     Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 186 of 268  v. Description of measures to enable and develop demand response, including those addressing tariffs to support dynamic pricing26   Balanced tariff structure Flexible grid tariffs which work in the interests of the system can have a balancing effect on the energy system and thus reduce overall system costs. Grid tariff structures will be simplified and made more transparent for consumers so that they can also take future dynamic pricing into account.  Adapting the grid tariff structure: Promoting smart meters and prosumer grid tariffs for households and businesses To exploit grid stabilisation and load balancing potential, households and businesses applying innovative business models using interruptible installations, such as heat pumps, photovoltaic systems, electricity storage facilities and electric vehicles, should be able to benefit from low-cost be extended on a voluntary basis. All prosumers will be entitled to a smart meter and will therefore have the right to join up to such innovative models.  Smart meter roll-out 2019 The introduction of smart meters can be traced back to the EU Electricity Directive from 2009 (Directive 2009/72/EC). In Austria, the legal basis is formed by the Electricity Industry and Organisation Act 2010 and the Smart Metering Regulation (IME-VO). By the end of 2020, 80% of meter points are to be converted to new digital meters and at least 95 per cent of households should be equipped with smart meters by the end of 2022 where technically feasible.  The IME-VO 2017 amendment brought about a significant strengthening of the rights of end consumers. They were granted the right to determine the configuration of the meters themselves, and can also make use of the opt-out right. However, there is no legal right to keep the mechanical meter (Ferraris meter). The meters are the property of the grid operators. These are also obliged to comply with the provisions of the Calibration Act [Eichgesetz]. The grid operators are obliged to immediately remove non-calibrated equipment from the system, regardless of whether a Ferraris meter or digital meter is involved. In such cases, conversion to a smart meter is then naturally carried out. The users are also to be guaranteed appropriate recording of the consumption values of the meters assigned.  There is also a right to receive a smart meter ahead of schedule. End consumers can be equipped with a smart meter upon request at any early stage (within six months), regardless of the grid -out plans.                                                                     26 In accordance with Article 15(8) of Directive 2012/27/EU. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 187 of 268   The roll-out of smart meters will be used in order for a large proportion of the population to participate in the new energy market. Smart meters play a major role in the conversion to new energy technologies (PV or energy communities). The conversion to a decarbonised energy world will be clearly explained to households.     3.4.4. Energy poverty   i. Where applicable, policies and measures to achieve the objectives set out in point 2.4.4.  In Austria, the Federal Government and provinces have support instruments suited to directly or indirectly combating energy poverty. These include, in particular, minimum income instruments, housing subsidies (subject support) and building support granted for housing construction and renovation works. The latter is object-specific support, which in many cases may be supplemented by subject-specific characteristics (in particular, income ceilings, families, etc.).  In line with the analysis under section 2.4, long-term effective investment in the building stock is needed to overcome energy poverty in Austria, targeting both building envelopes and heating and hot water systems. Such measures usually involve high investment costs which those households living in or near poverty would especially struggle to manage using their own resources. Measures involving relatively modest investments can often also have a significant impact. Such measures should offer households sufficient information which is easy to put into practice and financial support. In addition to adapting support, accompanying measures of an informal and organisation-legal nature are needed to improve access to independent and public information and advice, and to reduce organisational barriers (e.g. liabilities for renovation loans) for households in energy poverty
