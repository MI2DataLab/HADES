144  3.4. Dimension internal energy market 3.4.1. Electricity infrastructure i. Policies and measures to achieve the targeted level of interconnectivity as set out in point (d) of Article 4 The National Competent Authority (NCA) of Cyprus for PCIs has accepted the application file of EuroAsia Interconnector submitted by the Project Promoter and the statutory permit granting procedure started in November 2019.  Taking into account the achievement of the interconnection target, Member States participating at EuroAsia Interconnector, Cyprus and Greece, will implement the following measures:   Exchange of best practices and national electricity market standards or network codes for the cross-border exchange of electricity of renewable electricity between Cyprus and Crete.   Coordination of the Transmission System Operators (TSOs) of Greece, Cyprus and Israel.  Coordination of the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) of Greece, Cyprus and Israel.  Implementation of ACER and ENTSO-E Guidelines from both Member States. ii. Regional cooperation in this area To promote regional cooperation for the EuroAsia Interconnector, the NCA of Cyprus and Greece are aligning their efforts for the interoperability of this cross-border interconnection. Also, according to the provisions of the Regulation 347/2013 the two NCAs may collaborate or exchange know-how for the permit-granting of this PCI. iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds The electricity interconnection, requires a substantial amount of investments; based on preliminary information, it is estimated (Chapter 5) that the national contribution of Cyprus up to 2030 may amount to 118 million Euros. This is a low amount, but one has to keep in mind that: a) three countries will be involved in financing the interconnector and b) the total investment cost for the interconnector will be much higher, but will extend to a much longer period in the future. In relation to the EU support the Project of Common Interest EuroAsia moter of EuroAsia Interconnector is preparing to apply for CEF grants for works in CEF Energy call in 2020. 3.4.2. Energy transmission infrastructure i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.2, including, where applicable, specific measures to enable the delivery of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and other key infrastructure projects 145  The current PCI in Cyprus for electricity is EuroAsia interconnector which is categorised according to EU Regulation 347/2013/EC in NSI East electricity corridor. The PCIs for gas, EastMed Pipeline and CyprusGas2EU, are both categorised in SGC gas corridor. The quantified objectives of these projects are market integration, increase the flexibility of the national energy system, ending the energy isolation of the island and contribution to the security of energy supply (related to energy security dimension) and reduce greenhouse emissions due to lower emissions of natural gas than those from conventional fuels (related to decarbonisation dimension mostly for gas projects). Gas supply transmitted by PCIs will be used for power generation in the island. In the coming years, IGI Poseidon will focus its efforts on the development of the EastMed Pipeline project completing the engineering and survey activities, obtaining needed construction permits, defining the financial and regulatory framework and starting negotiations and cooperation with the key partners (at local and regional level) aiming the timely implementation of the Project. In this framework, on November 4th 2019, IGI Poseidon signed with the Israel Natural gas Lines Company LTD (INGL), the TSO of Israel, a Memorandum of Understanding that outlines the cooperation on the joint development of the EastMed Pipeline Project in coordination with existing, planned or under development gas infrastructure in the Region. Furthermore, regarding the cooperation on the EastMed Pipeline, the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between Cyprus, Greece and Israel for the EastMed gas pipeline was signed on 2nd of January 2020. Specific measures adopted to enable the delivery of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) A Ministerial decision appointed MECI as the National Competent Authority (NCA) for Projects of Common Interest (PCIs). Therefore the NCA proceeds to the actions below:  Following the notification submitted by the PCI EastMed Pipeline, the NCA will complete assessment of the maturity of the project in collaboration with other involved Authorities in Cyprus in the Q1 2020. After the acceptance of the notification by Cyprus and Greece the pre-application procedure will begin.  It has accepted the application file submitted by the PCI EuroAsia Interconnector for the starting of the statutory permit granting procedure in November 2019. After the completion of the statutory procedure by end of 2020 the construction phase will begin (total duration as submitted by Project Promoter is two years).  Preparation of the Manual of Procedures for PCI permitting in Cyprus (version 2) that will accelerate and simplify permitting procedure, prioritize PCIs in public sector and lift bureaucracy. Development of the One-Stop Shop PCIs interactive website. This website will increase efficiency, promote transparency and help enhance cooperation among MS.  Specific measures for other key electricity infrastructure projects  Cyprus TSO Ten Year Network Development Plan 2019-2028, according to Article 67 of the Law for the Regulation of the Electricity Market.  146  The main objective of this measure is the development and the secure operation of the Transmission Network in the years 2019-2028. The criterion employed is n-2 for the backbone network and n-1 for the rest of the network circuits and the transmission transformers. The Transmission TYNDP analyses the investments to be carried out during the ten-year period 2019 to 2028 for the development and the secure operation of the transmission electricity system.  The T-TYNDP takes into consideration the total yearly demand forecast for the period 2016-2025 as well as the maximum forecasted demand for each transmission substation. The average long-term expected capacity growth of new PV systems was also taken into consideration. The TYNDP is implemented by the Transmission System Owner, which is part of the Electricity Authority of Cyprus, but is functionally unbundled from Generation and Supply Activities. Details regarding this Policy and Measure are included in the Impact Assessment Study. Key infrastructure modernisation projects are detailed in Section 2.4.366.  Specific measures that enable the delivery of PCIs (EuroAsia Interconnector) include the upgrade of Kofinou Transmission substation so as to ensure the security and reliability of the -2022.  Specific measures for other key gas infrastructure projects  DEFA has carried out studies for the development of the internal gas network for the transition of gas from Vasilikos area to the other EAC power stations and the other IPPS. MECI is updating the Master Plan of Vasilikos in order to ensure the inclusion of the required area for the Compressor Station and onshore landfall facilities of the EastMed Pipeline, as jointly identified by the IGI Poseidon specialists and the NCA officers in October 2019.  ii. Regional cooperation in this area Cyprus's goal is to lead and promote regional dialogue on the creation of the necessary energy infrastructure that will lift its energy isolation. Partnerships in the EastMed region aspire to create a climate of stability, trust and cooperation in the EastMed region that can foster investment in sustainable development.  There is regional cooperation between Cyprus and Greece for the implementation of studies related to a regional market between the two MS for the use of LNG and promotion of LNG bunkering through two European programmes (CYnergy and PoseidonMed II). Furthermore, a MoU was signed between the countries of Cyprus, Greece, Israel and Italy on the 5th of December 2017 at Nicosia for the EastMed Pipeline project, aiming at the development of this Gas PCI. EastMed Pipeline in combination with the Poseidon Pipeline, may transport gas from EastMed region to Greece and Italy.                                                             66 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/EnergySe.nsf/All/4CFADF62B303D228C22584D6004AAB42/$file/SRSS-C2018-070_Deliverable_3.pdf 147  Additionally, Cyprus actively participates in the Eastern Mediterranean Gas Forum (EMGF) through which a regional platform for the discussion of energy issues among Mediterranean countries is provided. iii.
