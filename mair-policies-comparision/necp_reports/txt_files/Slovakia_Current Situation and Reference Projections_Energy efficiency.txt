4.3 Dimension: energy efficiency  i. Current primary and final energy consumption in the economy and per sector (including industry, residential, service and transport) Figure 31 Energy consumption in the SR 20012016   Konecna energeticka spotreba (TJ) Final energy consumption (TJ) Primarna energeticka spotreba (TJ) Primary energy consumption (TJ) Ciel PES 2020 (TJ) Target PES 2020 (TJ) Ciel TES 2020 (TJ) SUSR Target FES 2020 (TJ) SO SR Source: Eurostat 2018 Primary energy consumption reached 676 PJ in 2017, 36 PJ (5.68%) more than in 2016. Final energy consumption in 2017 amounted to 410 PJ, an increase of 27 PJ (7.17%) compared to 2016. Figure 32 Final energy consumption 2007-2017  Key: Priemysel Industry Doprava Transport Domacnosti Households Podohospodarstvo Agriculture Obchod a sluzby Commerce and services Source: SO SR (2019) Energy consumption trends by sector  Industry The industry sector is the largest energy consumer in the Slovak Republic. Energy consumption in industry declined until 2009, after which energy consumption in industry levelled out, with a moderate increase in 2015 and 2017. Final energy consumption in industry was 144 PJ in 2017, or   38% of final energy consumption in Slovakia. Year-on-year energy consumption in industry rose by 0.8% because of the economic recovery and production growth. Transport Consumption in the transport sector expressed as final energy consumption was 113 PJ in 2017. The largest year-on-year rise in energy consumption was in 2017, increasing by 13.8%. Between 2007 and 2017 it rose by up to 33%, making it the largest consumption increase in the monitored ten-year period.  In terms of the individual modes of transport, road transport in particular contributed to the high increase. Other modes of transport show a steady trend in energy consumption. The chief factors fuelling long-term energy consumption growth in transport include: the ever-growing numbers of registered motor vehicles and the accompanying rise in the numbers of people travelling by car, along with an expansion in road haulage as the carriage of goods switches from less-energy-intensive modes of transport to road transport. The comparable financial cost of road freight transport is an important factor, even if an enormous number of road vehicles are used. Households Households consumed 88 PJ of energy in 2017 with consumption increasing year-on-year by 3.7%. This shows that there is still considerable potential for the renovation of buildings, in particular for government and public buildings, but also for private sector buildings. There are approximately 1 million apartment buildings and family houses (with 1.9 million dwellings) and over 15 000 public buildings such as schools, hospitals and offices. Based on expert estimates, buildings are responsible for 26% of CO2 emissions. Agriculture Energy consumption in the agriculture sector does not show such significant fluctuations as in other sectors. In 2017, energy consumption in the agriculture sector amounted to 6 PJ and the sector recorded a year-on-year decline in consumption of 4.2%. Commerce and services The commerce and services sector consumed 60 PJ of energy in 2017, a rise of 9% compared to the previous year. This variation can be explained by the break-up and merger of enterprises, changes in their sectoral classification and the resulting changes in terms of where their consumption is classified in the energy balance, and by the calculation method used for this item by the SO SR. ii. Current potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling52 In 2017, the total installed capacity for high-efficiency cogeneration was 1 241.85 MW, while the electricity generated was 2 545.28 MWh, representing 9% of total electricity generation in Slovakia. In terms of cogeneration technologies, the generation of electricity and heat in steam vapour condensing or backpressure turbines is currently predominant. The share of these installations in total installed power is 58.0%, and 83.0% of the total heat produced by high efficiency cogeneration.                                                  52 In accordance with Article 14(1) of Directive 2012/27/EU.  Figure 33: Share of individual fuels in combined heat and power plants  Key:  Biomasa Biomass Bioplyn Biogas Iné palivá Other fuels Hnedé uhlie Brown coal/lignite  Black coal/anthracite Ropa a ropné výrobky Oil and petroleum products Zemný plyn Natural gas  In recent years, plants using combined heat and power technology have been rebuilding boilers to burn biomass with coal and building new boilers to burn biomass, and this trend will continue, although to a lesser extent than hitherto. Systematic measures to reduce subsidies and the consumption of fossil fuels through increasing energy efficiency and the use of RES that meet sustainability criteria need to be put in place. For large sources with steam and gas turbines, only a slight increase in installed capacity is anticipated, which is achieved by the essential reconstructions of existing technology with combined heat and power technology. In this segment of electricity output through cogeneration, especially in the heat plants with condensing steam turbines, recently, in addition to the reconstruction and modernisation of these facilities, these technologies are being replaced by gas piston engines for natural gas with an electric motor power of up to 10 MW. The greatest potential for additional high-efficiency cogeneration is assumed for existing district heating systems, which supply heat to end users.

Steam backpressure turbine Steam condensing extraction turbine Gas turbine with heat recovery Combustion engine Other technologies Figure 3: Co-generators and the amount of electricity and heat produced by district  Heat supply from district heating systems is provided to approximately 16 000 apartment buildings, with a total of 650 620 apartments (more than 1.8 million inhabitants). Over the last 15 years, heat consumption in apartment buildings connected to the district heating systems has decreased by 26% to 1 800 GWh. This reduction followed the introduction of energy-efficiency measures (hydraulic regulation of heating systems and hot water distribution, insulation of circulating pipelines for hot water distribution, installation of thermoregulating valves, thermal insulation of building façades and replacement of windows) and depending on the number of degree-days, reflecting the climate conditions in different years. Slovakia will continue to support the continuation of the above measures.  The Slovak Innovation and Energy Agency, which operates the energy efficiency monitoring system, has created and operates a Thermal Map of the Slovak Republic. The Thermal Map serves in particular to identify those areas where heat can be efficiently and efficiently delivered through high-efficiency combined heat and power, through renewable sources, and through the use of heat from industrial processes for heating and cooling . The Thermal Map should help to provide potential investors with information on locations where it is advisable to think in the future about the introduction of district heating systems and hence the potential for the use of cogeneration. More detailed information on the Thermal Map is available at www.siea.sk/tepelna-mapa/.

Estimates and forecasts for 2020 provide for a decrease in heat consumption of 8.5%, that is, 450 GWh. The forecast for heat consumption for the next few years was determined by analysing the potential for the energy efficiency of thermal plants, from which to a large extent the supply of heat from district heating systems and is covered and the anticipated development of heat consumption for heating, especially in apartment buildings supplied by heat from these systems.

Consideration was also given to the assumed heat consumption in development areas (industry, housing construction). The potential increase in heat consumption will largely be covered by the anticipated reduction in the supply to existing heat consumers. According to the above, the anticipated heat consumption was modelled up to 2025.

That was aimed at transitioning to a low-carbon economy by using renewable energy sources and improving energy efficiency (increasing heat and power from renewable energy sources, systematically reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and developing efficient district heating systems). The Green for Households national project was also established under this axis.  This project focuses on the use of the so-called small renewable sources in family houses and apartment buildings to increase the share of renewable energy use in households. By the end of  2018, 18 501 vouchers, worth more than EUR 41.19 million, were reimbursed as part of the Operational Programme Quality of the Environment, providing an installed capacity of 141.63 MW.   The plan for the new project, with a total budget of EUR 48 million, has already been approved. As part of the project, an additional 25 000 installations could be supported by 2023 in households outside the Bratislava autonomous region. It is planned to extend the original SIEA voucher system plans with an applications stack to allow households to demand vouchers on an ongoing basis. The project envisages an increase in the number of small renewable energy installations by 21 000 units and an increase in the capacity of renewable energy generation by 140 MW.  State environmental protection aid scheme for the reduction of GHG and pollutants in the energy sector The scheme is intended to provide State aid to increase environmental standards by going beyond the applicable Union standards, in the form of a subsidy from the state budget, to support projects in the field of achievable and measurable greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions savings, reducing the use of primary energy sources, replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, constructing, renovating and modernising heat distribution from district heating, construction or upgrading energy infrastructure, and introducing best available techniques to reduce greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions. The scheme may be financed by funds raised from the sale of emission allowances at auction, no call had been made as of November 2019.  Action Plan for the transformation of Upper Nitra - a new central heat source As regards the transformation of the Upper Nitra region and maintaining the continuity of heat supply in this region, use of the existing heat and electricity generation infrastructure in accordance with the Upper Nitra Transformation Action Plan with minimal environmental impact will be appropriate, ensuring price competitiveness and promoting the long-term sustainable growth of the region.  iv. Cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements resulting from national calculations, in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU  Cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements for buildings have been established according to the EC comparative methodology given by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 244/2012 of 16 January 2012 supplementing Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the energy performance of buildings, by establishing a framework for a comparative methodology for the calculation of cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements for buildings and building elements and guidelines accompanying Commission Regulation (EU) No 244/2012. By calculations and comparisons, it was to be demonstrated whether the current minimum energy performance requirements for buildings and building elements in Member States are not significantly lower than cost-optimal requirements. Comparison of the calculated cost-optimal levels with current minimum energy performance requirements for buildings The results of the comparison for the SR have revealed the justification for the tightening of requirements after 2015.  By selecting according to specified features (building category, construction period, size, availability of project data) using the database of residential and non-residential buildings based on statistical  analysis methods, 11 reference buildings were proposed. In addition to the set obligation to propose 2 reference buildings from the existing pool and 1 reference new building to represent the categories of apartment buildings, family houses and administrative buildings, 1 reference building representing school buildings and 1 reference building representing a sports building were proposed.  As part of the packages of measures, measures were applied complying with the applicable requirements set for low-energy construction, for ultra-low energy construction and for buildings with nearly zero energy requirement according to STN 73 0540-2+Z1+Z2 of 2019. All packages, including the package with the optimal building design properties being considered, were used to determine primary energy, life cycle costs, including net present value.   For each reference building, between 5 and 12 packages/variants of measures were used. One special package is the reference case characterised by the original state for existing buildings and a package characterised by current requirements for new buildings. Variant solutions have been proposed for individual thermal protection levels of buildings (e.g. 12 variants for thermal protection of the outer cladding with various thicknesses of thermal insulation varying from 40 mm to 240 mm in additional thermal protection in an additive thermal insulating contact system). The value of the heat transfer coefficient took into account the original quality of the cladding, the roof covering and the internal dividing structures between the heated and unheated spaces. For the variations in the change in the thermal properties of the opening structures, a selection was made of products characterised by the heat transfer coefficient of the frame and the glazing (Uf, Ug, Uw in W/(m2.K)), solar energy transmittance g (-) and a linear loss coefficient for the glazing spacing frame. Variants were also considered for heat generation (7 variants, e.g. natural gas district heating, wood chips, combined heat and power generation, condensing gas boiler, wood pellet boiler, air - water heat pump, ground - air heat pump) , as well as variants for hot water production and cold production. For lighting, an analysis was independently conducted of the cost optimality of the measures when compared with the energy requirement. The option chosen was applied in all packages of proposed measures when determining the net value.  The results of the calculations show that global costs are different for the macroeconomic and financial aspects, but this does not change the optimum position. The national reference value that was considered for the SR to compare the calculated cost-optimal levels with the current minimum energy performance requirements is the financial (microeconomic) level, i.e. including VAT and without considering CO2 costs.  Under Art. 4(1) of Directive No 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings (recast), minimum energy performance requirements shall be reviewed at regular intervals which shall not be longer than five years.  The results of the calculation of the cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements for buildings in 2013 were compared with the established requirements (as recommended) from 1 January 2016 for the ultra-low energy level of construction. By an amendment to standard STN 73 0540-2+Z1+Z2 of 2019 standardised requirements were introduced for ultra-low energy construction, valid from 1 July 2019, which correspond to the results of the calculation of cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements for buildings.   When calculating cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements in 2018, the procedures used and results of the cost-optimal minimum level of 2013 calculations, introduced in the applicable legislation, have been respected. This means that the basic level of assessment are the current requirements for the ultra-low energy level of construction.  The calculation of the minimum requirements for the energy performance of buildings and at the same time the subject of the second phase of the assessment was the calculation of the cost-optimal level of minimum energy performance requirements for buildings with nearly zero energy needs. For the second phase of assessing the cost optimalities of the minimum building energy efficiency requirements, reference was made to the reference building categories: apartment buildings, family houses and administrative buildings.  Due to the introduced clarifications and adjustments to the entry conditions of calculations (e.g. taking into account the influence of thermal bridges, poor heat use, change of primary energy factors) and taking into account the supply of new construction products and changes in the parameters of construction products, a new assessment of reference buildings in the ultra-low energy level of construction had to be carried out.
