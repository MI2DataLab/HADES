3.1 Dimension decarbonisation  3.1.1 GHG emissions and removals  3.1.1.1 Policies and measures to achieve the target set under Regulation (EU) 2018/842 as referred in point 2.1.1 and policies and measures to comply with Regulation (EU) 2018/841, covering all key emitting sectors and sectors for the enhancement of removals, with an outlook to the long-term vision and goal to become a low emission economy and achieving a balance between emissions and removals in accordance with the Paris Agreement. The above climate goals are affected by many European Union policy areas and measures, such as the EU ETS, the Fuel Quality Directive, emission requirements for new vehicles, the Fluorinated Greenhouse Gases Regulations, the Landfill Directive and the Common Agricultural Policy. These will not be discussed here.  They are also affected by many policy areas and measures for renewable energy and energy efficiency (see Section 3.1.2 and 3.2) and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in Sweden. Table 7 summarises the key policies for achieving climate goals.  Table 7. Summary of key policies and measures for achieving the 2030 climate goals (EU policies are in bold type).                                                       70 https://www.regeringen.se/regeringens-politik/naringspolitik/. 71 Government bill 2016/17:146 Report 2016/17:MJU24, Riksdag communication 2016/17:320. 41 (199) Cross-sectoral Energy supply Housing and services Industry Transport Waste Agriculture Forestry  Energy and Carbon Tax  EU ETS  Klimatkliv (Climate Stride) funding initiative Environmental Code Planning and Building Act  Fossil-Free Sweden Communication Energy and Climate Advisory Service  Regional energy and climate plans  The European Regional Development Fund  Research and demonstration  Procurement rules  Energy and Carbon Tax  Waste Incineration Tax  EU ETS  Electricity certificates system  Wind power initiative  Support for solar energy  Energy and Carbon Tax  Ecodesign Directive  Energy Labelling Regulation  Building regulations  Energy and Climate Advisory Service  Energy declarations  Education programme for low-energy buildings   Client groups and networks  Energy and Carbon Tax  EU ETS  Industrikliv (Industrial Stride) funding initiative Energisteg (Energy Step) funding programme Requirements and support for energy mapping  Energy and climate coaches  Energy-efficiency network  Environmental Code  F-Gas Regulation and BREF  Energy and Carbon Tax  Emission requirements for new vehicles  Reduction obligation  Bonus-malus system  CO2-based vehicle tax  Lower taxable value for vehicles with environmental technology  Pump Act  Environmental information about fuels Climate incentive payment  Urban Environment Agreement  Infrastructure planning  Eco-bonus system for shipping  Procurement rules  Tax on air travel  EU ETS (flights)  Ban on dumping flammable and organic waste  Collection of measurement data from dumps  Waste tax  Producer responsibility  Municipal waste planning  EU waste package  CAP  Rural Development Programme  The Rural Development Network  Advice  Support for biogas from manure  Biogas support  The Forestry Act  Land drainage rules under the Environmental Code  Forest and land protection under the Environmental Code and nature conservation agreements  National Forest Programme  Advice and education  CAP  Cross-sectoral policies and measures  Energy Tax and Carbon Tax The Swedish energy taxation system combines a carbon tax with a fuel tax and an electricity tax. The main taxes affecting greenhouse gas emissions in Sweden are the carbon tax and the fuel tax. These are described in general terms below; a more detailed description is given for each sector.  A carbon tax, based on the fossil content of fuel, was introduced in Sweden in 1991 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The tax has been increased in stages since it was first introduced. Overall, it has increased from SEK 0.25/kg CO2 (1991) to SEK 1.18/kg CO2 (2019). Besides specific tax increases introduced by the Riksdag in response to proposals in Government bills, the tax rates are indexed annually on the basis of earlier legislation. Carbon tax is not deducted on biofuels, which are not covered by the reduction obligation for petrol and diesel.  Some sectors are taxed at a reduced rate, or are exempt from tax, because of the risk of carbon leakage, in other words a business or its emissions moving  42 (199)  Energy has been taxed for many years in Sweden72. Energy taxes on petrol and diesel were introduced in 1924 and 1937 respectively. An energy tax was first imposed on heating fuel and electricity in the 1950s. The purpose of energy taxes was initially purely fiscal, but for a long time they have also been used to bring energy consumption into line with Sweden's energy efficiency and renewable energy goals73. The energy tax on motor fuels is also designed to absorb external traffic-related costs, such as wear to road surfaces and noise. The energy tax on fuel varies depending on whether it applies to motor fuel or heating fuel. The level of taxation on heating fuels also varies between the domestic, industrial and energy supply sectors (see Section 3.2 for current levels of taxation).  Both energy and carbon tax are charged on petrol and diesel for road vehicles, machinery, private vehicles and aircraft. To take account of inflation and economic developments, energy and carbon taxes on fuel are also adjusted to reflect changes in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP)74.  In some cases, Sweden applies a tax reduction for sustainable biofuels. All high-blend sustainable biofuels are exempt from both energy tax and carbon tax. Sweden has state aid approval for current tax relief on high-blend liquid biofuels and biogas until the end of 202075. Biofuels blended into gasoline or diesel are covered by the reduction obligation (see the section on the transport sector below) and therefore subject to the same tax per litre as the fossil fuels they are blended with. The carbon tax on the finished fuel has been determined on the basis of the average fossil carbon content, taking account of the target for the average content of blended biofuel (see Section 3.2 for the current levels of taxation).  There is no energy or carbon tax on fossil fuel for national and international commercial shipping and aviation.  Both energy and carbon tax is applied to fuel used for heating. Biofuel is exempt from both taxes. Other fuels used to generate heat in combined heat and power (CHP) and other heat generation plants within the EU ETS are subject to 91% carbon tax and the full rate of energy tax. The rate for CHP plants has increased significantly since 1 August 2019, when the fuel was subject to an 11% carbon tax and 30% energy tax. CHP plants outside the                                                       72 Energy tax is a collective term for excise duties on fuel and electricity and is governed by the Energy Tax Act, see (1994:1776). 73 The energy efficiency goal and the renewable energy goal for 2020 are set out in Government bill 2008/09: 162 and 163. 74 The annual adjustment of tax rates for petrol and diesel takes account of changes in GDP by applying a flat-rate of 2% in addition to the CPI adjustment. This additional adjustment is applied both to energy and carbon tax but is expressed as an increase in energy tax. This additional indexation was neutralised in the petrol and diesel tax adjustment in 2020. 2019/20:1 expenditure area 22). 75 C(2015) 9344 final, C(2015) 9345 final. 43 (199) EU ETS pay the full rate of energy and carbon tax on the fuel used to generate heat. This is also an increase, as only 30% energy tax was paid on this fuel until 1 August 2019 (see Section 3.2 for current levels of taxation).  The fuel used to generate electricity is exempt from both energy and carbon tax, but electricity consumption is generally subject to the energy tax on electricity (see Section 3.2 for current levels of taxation).  Some energy and carbon tax exemptions and reduction are applied to industry, mainly because most of the manufacturing sector is already covered by the EU ETS. These parts of the manufacturing sector pay 30% of the general energy tax on heating fuel and are completely exempt from carbon tax. The parts of the manufacturing sector outside the EU ETS also pay 30% of the energy tax on the heating fuel used in the manufacturing process. These sectors previously paid significantly less carbon tax, but this has gradually increased in recent years. The tax reduction was removed entirely in 2018 and carbon tax is now applied in full.  Until 31 July 2019, energy and carbon tax on diesel for on-track machines 60% of the general levels of taxation respectively. This energy and carbon tax reduction was abolished on 1 August 2019 (see Section 3.2 for current levels of taxation).  The agriculture, forestry and aquaculture sectors pay 30% of the general energy tax on heating fuel. Carbon tax reductions were also applied to these sectors, but they have been reduced gradually and the full carbon tax has applied since 2018.  A special reduction of the carbon tax on diesel for machinery in the agriculture, forestry and aquaculture sectors has been reduced gradually from SEK 2.10 a litre (2011) to SEK 1.43 a litre (up to 30 June 2019). From 1 July 2019 to 31 December 2019 the tax reduction was increased again to SEK 2.24 a litre. Energy tax on this fuel was reduced to SEK 0.19 a litre in the same period.  The Klimatkliv Since 2015, all types of organisation, except for those belonging to the EU ETS, have been able to apply for local climate investment.76 The candidates compete for this investment on the basis of the estimated reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per krona. Examples of eligible investments are                                                       76 Investments in sectors within the EU ETS may still be eligible if they increase the utilisation of waste heat. 44 (199) charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, biogas plants, switching from fossil oil to biofuel or district heating, the expansion of smaller district heating networks, destruction of nitrous oxide in the healthcare sector, cycle paths and cycling infrastructure. In 2019, the Government budgeted SEK 1.5 billion for the Klimakliv initiative.  The Environmental Code and the Planning and Building Act The horizontal environmental legislation is collected in the Environmental Code, which has the overall purpose of promoting sustainable development. The code is applied with reference to Sweden's environmental quality goals, including Limited Impact on the Climate (see Section 2.1.1 for this goal). The Environmental Code includes general rules to be followed by all operations and measures. It also contains a requirement to use the best available technology. Large environmentally hazardous operations require a permit. The process for granting a permit includes an assessment of direct and indirect environmental impact and energy management and, for installations that are not part of the EU ETS, an assessment of greenhouse gas emissions. However, requirements for greenhouse gas emissions may not be imposed on operations that are part of the EU ETS.  Land-use planning is governed mainly by the Planning and Building Act (2010:900), which requires environmental and climate aspects to be taken into account in planning. Some infrastructure projects are assessed under the Environmental Code instead, either directly or by reference from other legislation.  Communication about climate matters The Swedish authorities have many years of experience with using communication as a policy for the public sector, business and the general population. Examples include the following:   www.naturvardsverket.se is a hub for facts and statistics about emissions and is widely used by politicians, the media, companies, organisations and researchers; the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMIH) develops and distributes information about weather, water and climate change; the Swedish National Knowledge Centre for Climate Change Adaptation, part of the SMHI, has launched a Swedish climate change portal, providing information and guidance on adaptation to a warmer climate; the Swedish Energy Agency is responsible for giving energy efficiency information and advice to companies and the general population and for providing a reliable and 45 (199) sustainable energy supply; it also runs an informative website and assists with local energy advice (for more information, see Energy and climate advisory services below); the Swedish Forest Agency and the Swedish Board of Agriculture focus on e-services and digital information for land and forest owners, forestry workers and farmers about reducing the impact of climate on forestry and agriculture; and The Swedish Transport Administration is tasked by the Government with providing information and raising awareness to help meet the domestic transport milestone and creating the conditions for Sweden to meet its net zero emissions target by 2045. Fossil-Free Sweden -Free Sweden initiative was launched in 2016 to improve dialogue between the Government and business, municipalities, other public operators and civil society77.  The Government has appointed a national coordinator for Fossil-Free Sweden who acts as a link between the operators and the Government to remove obstacles and accelerate the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The initiative is an important platform for dialogue and cooperation between major operators for a competitive climate transition.  It currently involves around 400 operators and is open to anyone who supports the declaration. The operators involved in the initiative share the belief that the world must be fossil-free and that Sweden must take a lead on this. The declaration also commits operators to take certain specific actions to reduce emissions.  The initiative includes sectoral roadmaps which highlight the commercial possibilities for companies and sectors to become fossil free. Fourteen of these roadmaps were presented to different sectors in 20182019. They are a good basis for constructive cooperation between the Government and business on the path to the joint climate goals.  The work includes giving advice and publicising the vision for a fossil-free society, highlighting the opportunities presented by the transition.  Energy and climate advisory services                                                       77 http://fossilfritt-sverige.se/. 46 (199) The Swedish Energy Agency provides municipalities with Government funds so that they can give local climate and energy advice to private individuals and small businesses. Almost every Swedish municipality has a local climate and energy advisor, who provides objective information tailored to the locality and advises on energy efficiency measures, energy consumption and climate-related issues in buildings and households.  The Swedish Energy Agency also gives financial assistance to the 15 regional energy offices which coordinate the energy and climate advisors. The energy offices initiate and participate in many energy efficiency and renewable energy projects funded by the EU, the county councils, regional associations and other organisations. The offices work regionally with companies, county councils, municipalities and others bodies, for example on producing plans and strategies.  Regional climate and energy strategies The county councils coordinate regional climate and energy initiatives and support regional operators, for example by gathering and disseminating information. The county councils have worked with other regional and local operators on regional climate and energy strategies based on the long-term energy and climate policy targets adopted by the Riksdag, with the aim of producing effective measures and synergies. The county councils also contribute to environmental assessments and environmental monitoring, local and regional town and country planning, regional development and growth policy and infrastructure planning.  Public procurement There is great potential for using public procurement to reduce emissions and promote innovative and climate-smart solutions. In its national procurement strategy, the Government stated that Sweden must lead the way and continue to set the standard for green public procurement, and that the life-cycle should be considered in every phase of procurement. The new procurement legislation, including the Public Procurement Act (2016:1145), explains how environmental and climate aspects can be taken into account.  The transport sector  Reduction obligation  switching fuels An obligation to reduce petrol and diesel consumption was introduced on 1 July 2018 to promote the use of biofuels78. All fuel suppliers must therefore reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of petrol and diesel over their entire                                                       78 Act (2017:1201) on Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Adding Biofuels to Petrol and Diesel. 47 (199) life-cycle by a certain percentage every year by gradually increasing the amount of added biofuel (see Table 8). The reduction obligation makes an important contribution to phasing out fossil fuels in transport.  Table 8. 20182020 reduction levels under the Reduction Obligation Act79. Year 2018 2019 2020 Diesel 19.3% 20% 21% Petrol  2.6%  2.6%  4.2%  The Government has asked the Swedish Energy Agency to suggest reduction levels for 20212030. It has also examined whether the same reduction should apply to petrol and diesel and whether or not high-blend biofuels should be included in the reduction obligation. The report on this task was submitted in June 201980 and it was completed on 25 October 2019. The process for successively increasing the reductions after 2020 is continuing.  Bonus-malus system for new light-duty vehicles A bonus-malus system has been in force in Sweden since 1 July 2018. The system means that purchases of low carbon vehicles qualify for a bonus, while high carbon vehicles are subject to a higher rate of vehicle tax for the first three years. A carbon-based vehicle tax is applied from year four onwards (see below). The system covers purchases of new cars, light-duty buses and light-duty trucks. From 1 January 2020, vehicle tax and the bonus for new vehicles will be based on the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), a new, more accurate method for measuring a es higher emission measurements, the changeover will lead to tougher environmental governance.  Carbon-based vehicle tax To give buyers an incentive to choose cars, light-duty trucks, light-duty buses and mobile homes with low greenhouse gas emissions, Sweden applies different annual tax rates based on the vehicle's carbon emissions per kilometre, which means that vehicles with low carbon emissions are taxed at a lower rate than those with high emissions. This tax applies to vehicles purchased before the bonus-malus system was implemented in July 2018 and -malus system three years after purchase.  Lower taxable value for vehicles with environmental technology Company cars account for 50% of new vehicle registrations in Sweden and employees can use a large proportion of them privately. The benefit of using                                                       79 Act (2017:1201) on Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Adding Biofuels to Petrol and Diesel. 80 The Swedish Energy Agency  Kontrollstation 2019 för reduktionsplikten (ER 2019:27). 48 (199) calculated on the basis of a separate rate. Under a rule introduced to support the introduction of environmentally friendly cars to the market, the value of environmentally friendly company cars is reduced to the price of the closest comparable new car without that technology. The taxable value of electric cars, plug-in hybrids and cars that run on gas (excluding gasoil) can be reduced even further.  Requirements for biofuels at filling stations  The Pump Act To improve the availability of renewable fuels, Sweden has passed a law81 requiring filling stations with sales of over 1 500 m3 of petrol or diesel to offer at least one type of renewable fuel.  Environmental information about fuels The Government has amended the Fuels Ordinance (2011:346) to enable consumers to obtain information about the origin and environmental impact of fuels at the pump. The Ordinance obliges fuel suppliers to provide consumers with information based on their annual reports to the Swedish Energy Agency under the Fuels Act (2011:319).  The environmental information must be available at the pump and must p-cycle, its raw materials and their country of origin. More details can be found requirement to provide information to avoid the excessive administrative costs they would incur. The information requirement will therefore be voluntary for companies supplying less than 1 500 m3 of liquid or 1 000 000 m3 of gaseous fuels a year.  The Swedish Energy Agency is currently developing detailed requirements for the environmental information. The information requirement will come into force in May 2020.  Electric bus incentive payment becomes a climate incentive payment The regional public transport authorities (municipalities and companies which the regional public transport authorities have authorised to enter into public transport contracts) and private operators of public transport services can apply for an electric bus incentive payment. This payment applies to electric buses, plug-in hybrid buses, trams and fuel cell buses for public transport.82 The amount of the payment depends on the number of passengers and whether the buses are electric only or hybrid. It is designed to support the introduction of electric buses to the market. The budget for                                                       81 Act (2005:1248) on the obligation to provide renewable fuels. 82 Ordinance (2016:836) on Electric Bus Incentive Payments. 49 (199) the electric bus incentive payment in 2019 is SEK 80 million.  From 2020, the electric bus incentive payment will become a climate incentive payment. This will make it possible to apply for support for electric trucks and other environmentally friendly trucks and electric machinery as well as electric buses; in combination with the continuing support for electric buses this will promote the introduction of these vehicles to the market. The budget for this will be increased to SEK 120 million in 2020.  Urban Environment Agreement In 2015, the Government introduced a special grant for sustainable urban environments, the Urban Environment Agreement. The grant is intended for municipalities and county councils and amounts to SEK 1 billion a year for 20182029, or SEK 12 billion in total. The Urban Environment agreement is financed via the economic framework of the 2018 2029 National Transport Infrastructure Plan. The measures are intended to produce energy-efficient solutions with low greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to achieving the environmental quality goal High Quality Built Environment. The grant provides municipalities and county councils with up to 50% Government funding for infrastructure for public transport and, since 2017, for cycling. In April 2019, the Government decided to amend the Ordinance (2015:579) on Support for Sustainable Urban Environments to include goods transport measures in the Urban Environment Agreement. The amendments came into force on 22 May 2019. Municipalities and county councils which have been given grants must use them to increase the proportion of sustainable transport or build more houses.  Sustainable cities with a focus on climate-smart mobility The Government has appointed the Swedish Energy Agency as main project Nordic Cities project, focusing on climate-smart mobility. The project will consist of five sub-projects:  1. the launch and the concluding conference on sustainable cities, focusing on climate-smart travel and transport; 2. the presentation of good examples and recommendations for ways of increasing the number of zero-emission vehicles in cities; 3. discussions, exchanges of experience and recommendations for promoting attractive and climate-smart transport in cities; 4. exchanges of experience and attempts to find solutions for charging electric vehicles in cities; and 5. development of a database of electric vehicle charging 50 (199) stations.  The Government has commissioned the Swedish Transport Administration to lead the sub-project on attractive and climate-smart transport in cities. It must submit a report on its work to the Infrastructure Department by 15 March 2021.  Long-term infrastructure planning In May 2018 the Government decided to introduce a new national transport infrastructure plan for all modes of transport for 20182029. The Swedish Transport Administration is responsible for long-term planning for all modes of transport and for implementing the plan. The plan will be prepared in consultation with municipal and regional authorities and other stakeholders.  Eco-bonus system for shipping Since 2018 the Government has allocated funding to an eco-bonus system to encourage the transfer of goods transport from roads to shipping. The aim is to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from the transport of goods. In its draft budget for 2020, the Government proposed extending the system until 2022 with an allocation of SEK 50 million a year.  National goods transport strategy In June 2018 the Government decided to introduce a national goods transport strategy83. The strategy highlights three priorities for further work. There are action areas for each priority, subdivided into six action areas for Competitive and Sustainable Goods Transport, five for Transition to Fossil-Free Transport and three for Innovation Competence and Knowledge. The Government has issued a number of assignments under the goods transport strategy. It has also set up a national goods transport council.  Electrification commission The Government will commit SEK 5 million a year until 2022 for an electrification commission to accelerate work on the electrification of the transport sector84. The electrification commission will help to accelerate investments in electric roads, charging infrastructure for electric trucks and other effective applications. The commission will also shed light on matters related to funding, how quickly roads can be electrified, and the effects of converting goods transport on the electricity supply. It will work with the business community and relevant stakeholders, as a matter of urgency, to produce an action plan for electrification of Sweden's busiest roads and will investigate other electrification options.                                                       83 https://www.regeringen.se/regeringens-politik/nationell-godstransportstrategi/. 84 https://www.regeringen.se/artiklar/2019/09/sarskilda-satsningar-i-hostbudgeten-inom- infrastrukturdepartementets-politikomraden/. 51 (199)  Electric roads Electric roads are infrastructure for dynamic charging, in other words charging en route. Depending on the technology chosen, they can be used by trucks, buses and cars. A demonstration project is being carried out on the E16 outside Sandviken (heavy goods vehicles) and at Arlanda airport (heavy goods vehicles and cars). In April 2019, the Swedish Transport Administration decided to launch two more demonstration projects, which are currently being carried out in Lund (public transport) and on Gotland (heavy goods vehicles and public transport). The demonstration project on Gotland uses induction, so there is no need for a fixed connection with the vehicle, while the other projects use conduction, so the vehicle has to be physically connected to the electricity supply. The Swedish Transport Administration is currently preparing to build the first permanent electric road. The Government believes that electric roads will increase the efficiency of goods transport and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It therefore intends to develop a long-term plan to construct and expand electric roads. Major goods routes and links to ports should be prioritised. The need for complementary technologies to allow vehicles to run on electricity outside the electric road network, for example rapid charging points for heavy goods traffic, should be addressed in future work.  Public procurement of transport Since 2009 the cars purchased or leased by public authorities have had to be environmentally friendly85. Many municipalities and companies voluntarily apply the same requirements when purchasing or leasing vehicles. The Vehicle and Public Transport Service Procurement (Environmental Requirements) Act (2011:846) sets out the criteria to be met for the public procurement of cars and public transport services. These criteria aim to reduce environmental impact by setting requirements for aspects such as energy consumption and emissions. According to FRIDA, the Swedish Environment and Vehicle Database for Public Transport86 around 85%87 of public transport ran on renewable fuels in 2018. Statistics from the Swedish Confederation of Transport Enterprises88 show that 63% of busses ran on fuels other than conventional diesel in 2017.  Procurement authorities apply criteria for public procurement of passenger transport, goods transport, fuel, tyres, public transport and vehicles89 which help those procuring transport to set requirements.                                                       85 The Ordinance (2009:1) on Environmental and Road Safety Requirements for Cars and Car Journeys by Public Authorities. 86 https://www.svenskkollektivtrafik.se/verktyg-och-system/frida-miljo-och-fordonsdatabas/. 87 Percentage of vehicle kilometres with renewable fuels. 88 Statistics for the bus sector, Swedish Confederation of Transport Enterprises. 89 https://www.upphandlingsmyndigheten.se/hallbarhet/stall-hallbarhetskrav/fordon-och-transport/. 52 (199)  Coordination of charging infrastructure and renewable fuels which require specific infrastructure The Swedish Energy Agency is tasked with coordinating support for the vehicle charging and renewable fuels infrastructure and providing information about the location of charging stations and filling stations for biodiesel, E85 and ED95, vehicle gas and hydrogen. This includes support for the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency under the Klimakliv initiative along with expertise and advice on setting priorities, information about the geographical distribution and assessment of support granted. As part of its coordination work, the Swedish Energy Agency has held discussions with the county councils about developing regional plans for the renewable fuels infrastructure.  It has focused its work on the charging infrastructure on increasing the capacity of society operators, by involving relevant operators in the development of a suitable charging infrastructure. In its work on the renewable fuels infrastructure it has focused on collecting knowledge and experience of renewable fuels which require specific infrastructure by increasing access to relevant and reliable information about the infrastructure for various operators.  Rapid charging along major roads Riksdag has introduced support for rapid charging infrastructure along major roads to cover the large areas which do not have this infrastructure yet90. The Government proposes spending SEK 50 million over three years on this expansion.  vehicles and renewable fuels In its 2018 spending authorisation, the Government tasked county councils with preparing regional plans for infrastructure for electric vehicles and -term leadership and coordination of regional work in all areas relevant to the energy transition and reduced climate impact. A report on the regional plans must be submitted by 31 January 2020.  Measures to improve information and raise awareness of the transition to a fossil-free transport system In April 2019, the Government tasked the Swedish Transport Administration with taking measures to improve information and raise awareness of the transition to a fossil-free transport system. These measures                                                       90 Government bill 2019/2020:1 expenditure area 21, Report 2019/20:NU3, Riksdag communication 2019/20:110. 53 (199) reducing the 2010 levels of greenhouse gas emissions from domestic transport, excluding aviation, by at least 70% by 2030, and to enable Sweden to achieve net zero emissions by 2045.  This project will continue until 31 December 2022, but the Swedish Transport Administration must submit a report by 30 June 2021 outlining the measures that should be taken to improve information and raise awareness of the transition to a fossil-free transport system during the rest of the planning period (20232029). The Swedish Transport Ad   to hold an annual conference to discuss progress towards meeting the Riksdag's climate target for transport;  to prepare an annual summary of ongoing work, concentrating on measures which may produce significant climate benefits, which are to be used by the relevant authorities and operators when planning and implementing their work on the climate target for transport; and  to create an arena for access to fossil-free fuels and efficient transport in cities, provide more information about owning and driving electric vehicles to encourage electrification of the transport system, and take measures to improve information and raise awareness to help the municipalities and county councils to develop their climate requirements for procurement of transport infrastructure.  Tax on air travel On 1 April 2018 a tax on air travel was introduced in Sweden to reduce its impact on the climate91. The tax is levied on commercial air travel and must be paid for passengers travelling from an airport in Sweden by the air carrier with which they are travelling. The amount of the tax depends on the passenger's final destination (in 2020: SEK 62, 260 or 416).  Night trains abroad The Government wants to give people a better choice of public transport with a low climate impact. On 11 July 2019 it tasked the Swedish Transport Administration with investigating the possibility of providing daily night train services to several European cities. It must submit proposals for the transport to be procured, prepare a timetable for implementation and assess the cost to the state. It must also investigate other options for providing night train services abroad and for the state to contribute to replacing the                                                       91 Air Travel (Tax) Act (2017:1200). 54 (199) transport procured with a commercially operated service as soon as possible. The Swedish Transport Administration must submit an interim report of its findings by 15 January 2020 and a final report by 20 April 2020.  The waste sector  Ban on dumping combustible and organic material and methane collection The dumping of combustible and organic waste is banned under the Ordinance (2001:512) on the Dumping of Waste. The Ordinance also governs the collection and disposal of methane from landfill sites.  Waste Tax Act A tax on waste disposed of in landfill sites was introduced in 200092. The tax has increased gradually and has been indexed at 2% above CPI a year since 2019. In 2019 the tax is SEK 520 per tonne of waste taken to a landfill site.  Producer responsibility The producer responsibility legislation contains national recycling targets; eight product groups are covered by a number of ordinances93. Producer responsibility promotes the sorting, collection and recycling of waste streams. It also aims to reduce the amount of waste and to give producers an incentive to develop more resource-efficient products, which are easier to recycle and do not contain substances that are harmful to the environment.  Municipal waste plans Under the Environmental Code, municipalities must have a waste plan which covers all types of waste and sets out the measures required to manage waste in an appropriate way to protect the environment and conserve resources. The waste plan must also include measures to reduce the amount and hazardousness of waste94.  The forestry sector  The 20142020 Rural Development Programme The Rural Development Programme for 20142020, which is part of the entrepreneurs, capacity building, cooperation and innovation, and support for organic farming, environmental and climate measures, and animal welfare. Measures specifically intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are those designed to increase energy efficiency, the product and use of                                                       92 Waste Tax Act (1999:673). 93 The Ordinance (2018:1462) on Producer Responsibility for Packaging, the Ordinance (2018:1463) on Producer Responsibility for Recovered Paper, the Ordinance (2007:185) on Producer Responsibility for Cars, the Ordinance (1994:1236) on Producer Responsibility for Tyres, the Ordinance (2014:1075) on Producer Responsibility for Electrical Equipment, the Ordinance (2008:834) on Producer Responsibility for Batteries, the Ordinance (2009:1031) on Producer Responsibility for Medicinal Products and the Ordinance (2007:193) on Producer Responsibility for Certain Radioactive Products and Orphan Sources. 94 The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency's Regulations (2006:6) for Municipal Waste Prevention and Management Plans. 55 (199) renewable energy (including the production of biogas and the planting of perennial energy crops), conversion from fossil to renewable energy sources, improved manure management, more efficient nitrogen use, climate and energy advice, measures to prevent nitrogen leaks, restoration and establishment of wetlands, promotion of forage and catch crops on agricultural land, the conservation of natural pastures and other separate climate and energy projects. The budget for the whole duration of the programme is SEK 36 billion, 59% of which is funded by Sweden and the remaining 41% by the EU.  The Rural Development Network The Rural Development Network completes Sweden's Rural Development Programme. The Network brings together local, regional and central operators to exchange information and experience, with the aim of improving the implementation of its EU-related programme. The Government has given the Swedish Board of Agriculture the task of ensuring that the Rural Development Network operates effectively.  Advice on plant nutrients   county councils. The service is funded by the Regional Development Programme and has been giving advice on increasing the efficiency of nutrients to reduce leaching since the beginning of 2001. It also gives advice specifically on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which is one of its main objectives, and on energy efficiency.  Support for biogas from manure Since 2015 there has been a support system for production of biogas from anaerobic digestion of manure95. The support aims to increase the production of biogas from manure, obtaining twice the environmental and climate benefits by reducing methane emissions from manure and replacing fossil energy. Many environmental benefits can be obtained by digesting more manure. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions and eutrophication of fresh and marine water and produces biogas which can be used as energy. The biogas obtained can be used to generate electricity or heat and as a fuel for vehicles. The maximum support is SEK 0.40 per kWh of biogas produced. The Rural Development Programme can also provide support for investment in new biogas plants.  Biogas support In 2018, temporary support was introduced for production of biogas upgraded to vehicle gas (biofuel) which was not produced from sewage                                                       95 The Ordinance (2014:1528) on State Support for the Production of Biogas. 56 (199) sludge or landfill gas96. To improve competition in the sector, and in response to the Government's proposal in the revised budget in autumn 2019, the Riksdag decided that a total of SEK 100 million in support should also be paid out for this type of biogas production in 201997.  Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF)  The Forestry Act The Forestry Act (1979:429) has two overall objectives of equal importance: to support production and to protect the environment The production objective is to use forests and woodlands efficiently and responsibly so that they provide a sustainable yield. Forestry production must focus on flexible use of forestry products. The environmental objective is to preserve the natural productive capacity of woodlands. The bio- and genetic diversity of forests must be secured. Forests must be managed in a way that allows viable populations of naturally occurring plant and animal species to survive under natural conditions. Endangered species and habitats and heritage forests and their aesthetic and societal value must be protected.  Rules for land drainage The Environmental Code contains rules for land drainage which can also be used to reduce emissions from this land. Land drainage is carried out to remove water from the land or to protect it from water. For measures to be classified as land draining as defined in the Environmental Code, they must be intended to make the land more suitable for a particular long-term purpose, such as cultivation, development, peat cutting, road construction, landscaping or golf courses.  Since 1986, a permit has been required for land drainage under the Environmental Code. Land drainage is forbidden in large areas of Southern Sweden, where it is particularly important to preserve wetlands. This means that conservation measures are stricter and there is a two-stage process for land drainage permits. Applicants must first obtain an exemption from the land drainage ban and then permission for drainage. Land drainage is prohibited in the rest of the country and on sites protected under the Ramsar convention98.  Provisions for nature reserves and protection of natural habitats in the Environmental Code and conservation agreements In Sweden forests and land are set aside for the conservation of biodiversity, the care and conservation of valuable natural habitats, the protection,                                                       96 See the Ordinance (2018:1501) on State Support for the Production of Biogas for Use as Biofuel. 97 Government bill 2019/20:2, Report 2019/20:FiU11, Riksdag communication 2019/20:60. 98 The Ramsar convention is a global convention for the conservation of wetlands and aquatic environments and uses them sustainable: https://www.naturvardsverket.se/Miljoarbete -i-samhallet/EU-och- internationellt/Internationellt-miljoarbete/miljokonventioner/Vatmarkskonventionen/. 57 (199) restoration or creation of valuable natural habitats and for open-air recreation. These measures in the form of nature reserves, conservation agreements and voluntary setting aside of land also benefit carbon storage in forest biomass and land carbon, by maintaining or increasing it.  In Sweden and many other countries, nature reserves99 are one of the most common ways of protecting valuable natural environments in the long term. At the moment there are nearly 5 000 nature reserves in Sweden. Chapter 7 of the Environmental Code contains provisions for the establishment of nature reserves. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency is in charge of this work.  Conservation agreements  Conservation agreements100 are civil-law agreements under which the state or a municipality agrees to pay property owners a certain amount of money not to use land for forestry, for example. The Swedish Forest Agency and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency provide joint guidance on setting up these agreements. It should not make any difference which authority a landowner makes an agreement with.   The Government adopted the strategy for Sweden's National Forest Programme101 on 17 May 2018. The strategy is governed by the  green gold  must provide jobs and sustainable growth for the whole country and contribute to the development developed102 for the strategy. The availability of sustainable biomass from Swedish forests has an important part to play in the transition to a fossil-free society. The action plan contributes to Sweden's climate work by establishing targets and measures to increase the national supply of bio-based alternatives.  Advice, education and training on forest management The Swedish Forest Agency provides forest owners with information about how climate change will affect their forests. It also issues guidance on how owners can best use and manage their forests to achieve their specific aims.  The energy supply sector                                                       99 http://www.naturvardsverket.se/Var-natur/Skyddad-natur/Naturreservat/. 100 http://www.naturvardsverket.se/Stod-i-miljoarbetet/Vagledningar/Skyddad-natur/Naturvardsavtal/. 101 https://www.regeringen.se/49bad6/contentassets/34817820f e074cb9aeff084815bd3a9f/20180524_hela.pdf. 102 https://www.regeringen.se/4a095b/contentassets/7cbc4c534fb3457385ff1d7f32e3e512/handlingsplan-for-sveriges-nationella-skogsprogram-2018.pdf. 58 (199) Policies and measures for this sector are described in Section 3.1.2.  The housing and services sector Policies and measures for this sector are described under the dimension Energy Efficiency in Section 3.2.  The industry sector Industriklivdevelopment of technologies and processes for reducing process-related greenhouse gas emissions. It is described under Research, innovation and competitiveness in Section 4.6.  Other policies and measures for the sector are described in the dimension for energy efficiency in Section 3.2.  3.1.1.2 Where relevant, regional cooperation in this area. On 1 January 2019, the prime ministers of the Nordic states adopted a declaration undertaking to make their countries carbon neutral. The declaration highlights many areas for increased Nordic cooperation and work has started on identifying potential new areas. In August 2019, the prime ministers adopted a new vision for Nordic cooperation which aims to by 2030. Action on the climate is also at the heart of this vision. Nordic companies and sustainability solutions have great potential to play a key role in the green conversion of the global economy.  Nordic experience and know-how can help to promote higher ambitions under the Paris Agreement and encourage dialogue with other countries in international negotiations. The objective of the Nordic Environmental and Climate Cooperation Programme for 20192024, which was negotiated contribute to the ambitious implementation of the Paris Agreement and continue to take a leading role in the necessary climate transition.  During its presidency of the Nordic Council of Ministers in 2018, Sweden took the initiative to promote closer cooperation on sustainable Nordic cities. The presidency project to promote the transition to climate-smart mobility in cities and sustainable solutions for the Nordic region with a focus on building in wood and sustainable architecture and design runs from 20182020 and will increase the exchange of information and joint actions.  The Nordic Environment Finance Corporation (NEFCO) plays an important part in the green transition. NEFCO's focus on climate, green 59 (199) growth, the Baltic Sea and the Arctic and Barents Sea are entirely in line with the Government's priorities. It is also the only Nordic institution with Green Climate Fund (GCF) accreditation, which enables Nordic operators to carry out climate measures in cooperation with the fund.  Nordic cooperation as a priority for the Government, which is working to intensify it.  3.1.1.3 Without prejudice to the applicability of State aid rules, financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds, in this area at national level, where applicable  3.1.2 Renewable energy  3.1.2.1 Policies and measures to achieve the national contribution to the binding 2030 Union target for renewable energy and trajectories as referred to in point (a)(2) Article 4, and, where applicable or available, the elements referred to in point 2.1.2 of this Annex, including sector- and technology-specific measures.  The electricity certificates system The aim of the electricity certificates system103 is to stimulate the growth of renewable electricity. The system was introduced in Sweden in 2003 and has been operated jointly with the other Nordic countries since 2012. The countries have a common goal to use the system to increase renewable electricity generation to 28.4 TWh by the end of 2020. Sweden has undertaken to fund 15.6 TWh and Norway 13.2 TWh, but it is up to the market to determine when and where the new electricity will be generated.  In June 2017 the Swedish Government decided to extend the electricity certificate system until 2045 and to increase it by 18 TWh by 2030. Norway's target for 2020 is the same and no new target will be introduced in Norway after 2020.  Sweden is funding the higher target of 18 TWh, which will be achieved by applying a linear increase of 2 TWh a year from 2022 until 2030.  The electricity generators that fulfil the requirements of the Electricity Certificates Act (2011:1200) receive an electricity certificate for each megawatt hour (MWh) of electricity they generate, which they can then sell on the open market. There is a demand for electricity certificates because all electricity suppliers and some consumers are obliged to buy them for a                                                       103 http://www.energimyndigheten.se/fornybart/elcertifikatsystemet/. 60 (199) certain amount (quota) of the electricity they sell or consume. The number of electricity certificates a supplier can buy increases every year in line with the quota, which increases the demand.  Tax on waste incineration The Riksdag has decided to introduce a new excise duty on incinerated waste in response to the Government's proposal104. Biofuels, hazardous waste, animal by-products and the production of some materials which contain waste or waste residues will be exempted from the duty. The tax will be charged at SEK 125 per tonne of waste, although the rate will be SEK 75 per tonne of waste in 2020 and SEK 100 per tonne in 2021. The rate will be increased annually in line with general price increases from 2023 onwards. A deduction for tax purposes can be applied to waste from an incineration plant. The new tax comes into force on 1 April 2020.  Tax reduction for microgeneration of renewable electricity To make it easier for private individuals and companies to invest in generating renewable electricity for their own use, microgenerators have been compensated for the surplus they feed into the grid since 2015105.  The tax reduction is SEK 0.60 per kWh for the surplus fed in to a connection point with fuse of up to 100 amps in a calendar year. The ceiling for reductions is SEK 18 000 a year.  Reduced energy tax for microgenerators of renewable energy Electrical power generated in a plant with an installed generation capacity of less than 50 kW by a generator with a combined installed generation capacity of less than 50 kW, which not been transferred to a network and which is covered by the grid concession and notified under Chapter 2 of the Electricity Act (1997:857) is tax-exempt.  50 kW of installed generation capacity is equivalent to 125 kW of installed generation capacity for electrical power generated by wind or waves, 255 kW installed peak power for solar power and 50 KW installed capacity for other energy sources without a generator. The installed capacities of electrical power generated from different sources must be combined.  If the generator's total generation capacity exceeds 50 kW or the equivalent, but not the capacity of a single plant, the energy tax can be reduced to SEK 0.5 per kWh for electricity not transferred to a licensed network.                                                        104 Government bill 2019/20:32, Report 2019/20:SkU12, Riksdag communication 2019/20:91. 105 Chapter 67, Section 2733, Income Tax Act (1999:1229). 61 (199) Changes to investment support for photovoltaic cells connected to the grid Since 2009 state support has been given for the installation of photovoltaic cells. It is directed at all kinds of operator  companies, public organisations and private individuals. There is a lot of interest in the support and county councils received around 52 000 applications up to April 2019, 29 000 of which were granted.  Since 8 May 2019, the maximum support has been 20%. The amount of support is calculated on the basis of the eligible installation costs. The maximum support for each photovoltaic cell system is SEK 1.2 million and the maximum eligible costs are SEK 37 000 plus VAT per installed kilowatt of rated electrical capacity. The support covers installation of all types of photovoltaic cell systems and hybrid solar electricity/heat systems. The county councils deal with applications in the order received. The support is limited and can only be given while the money set aside lasts. Systems eligible for energy certificates can also obtain photovoltaic cell support.  The budget for photovoltaic cell support was SEK 585.6 million in 2017 and SEK 1 085 million in 2018. The budget for the support in 2019 was SEK 736 million. The scheme expires on 31 December 2020 and the budget for 2020 has been set at SEK 835 million106.  Renovation, conversion and extension deduction for photovoltaic cells or solar heat The tax deduction for renovation, conversion and extension applies to the labour costs for house repairs, maintenance, conversions and extensions107. It was introduced in 2008 to increase the supply of labour and reduce undeclared work108. Private individuals can obtain a deduction of around 9% of the investment costs for installing photovoltaic cells or solar heating systems109 .  Support for storage for self-generated electrical energy Storing energy can increase the efficiency of the energy system. A grant for storage of self-generated electrical energy was introduced in November 2016 to enable customers to store more of their self-generated energy. It provides financial support for private individuals installing storage systems110. The grant has an annual budget of SEK 60 million and will end in 2020. Up to 60% of the cost of a storage system can be covered by the grant, however the maximum payment is SEK 50 000.                                                        106 Government bill 2019/20:1, Report 2019/20:NU3, Riksdag communication 2019/20:110. 107 The renovation, conversion and extension deduction is also described in Section 3.2. 108 Government bill 2006/07:94, Report 2006/07:SkU15, Riksdag communication 2006/07:181 and Government bill 2008/09:97, Report 2008/09:FiU18, Riksdag communication 2008/09:183. 109 http://www.energimyndigheten.se/fornybart/solelportalen/vilka-stod-och-intakter-kan-jag-fa/stod-vid-investering/. 110 The Ordinance (2016:899) on Grants for the Storage of Self-Generated Electrical Energy. 62 (199) By April 2019, the Swedish Energy Agency had paid around SEK 36 million to the county councils, which administer the support.  Refunding of energy tax on electricity after battery storage Under Chapter 11, Section 13 of the Energy Tax Act (1994:1776), consumers have been able to apply for an energy tax refund on electricity drawn from a licensed grid, stored and then fed back into the same licensed grid, since 1 January 2019. This is to avoid unintentional double taxation.  Exemptions from network charges Electricity consumers who have their own small111 generation plants and who consume self-generated electricity in addition to electricity purchased from the grid, are exempt from electricity feed-in charges. However the exemption applies only to consumers who have withdrawn more electricity from the grid in a calendar year than they have fed into it. Examples of consumers covered by this support include farms with small wind power plants and buildings with photovoltaic installations on the roof.  Smart and renewable energy systems on Gotland The Government has commissioned the Swedish Energy Authority to conduct a pilot project for the transition to a sustainable energy system on Gotland; the project will be based on the three basic pillars of energy policy: security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability. The first stage was to produce a roadmap for the project, which was submitted to the Government on 20 March 2019.112 The next stage is to implement the roadmap. The measures in the roadmap cover the whole of the energy system and, in principle, all sectors. They affect many major operators (public, private, not-for-profit organisations and individual members of the public) not least because they are responsible for implementing them. The project is expected to take several years to complete.  3.1.2.2 Where relevant, specific measures for regional cooperation, as well as, as an option, the estimated excess production of energy from renewable sources which could be transferred to other Member States in order to achieve the national contribution and trajectories referred to in point 2.1.2.  Since 2011, Sweden and Norway have had a joint electricity certificates market governed by a bilateral agreement. The aim of this joint electricity certificates market is to increase renewable electricity generation by 28.4 TWh between 2012 and 2020. Sweden will finance 15.2 TWh and Norway 13.2 TWh; it is up to the market to determine when and where the new electricity will be generated. Sweden also aims to increase renewable energy                                                       111 Exemption from network charges applies to electricity consumers with a contract for a power rating of up to 63 amps who generate electricity or are able to supply electricity at an output of up to 43.5 kilowatts. 112 The Swedish Energy Agency  Gotland Energy Pilot Project. Färdplan för att möjliggöra att Gotland blir pilot för ett hållbart energisystem (ER2019:09). 63 (199) generation by a further 18 TWh by 2030. This increase will be financed by Sweden alone.  Reporting under the agreement between Sweden and Norway will be based on a 50-50 distribution of electricity generation between the two countries until each has reached 13.2 TWh and then on 100% generation by Sweden (Article 14(2)).  3.1.2.3 Specific measures on financial support, where applicable, including Union support and the use of Union funds, for the promotion of the production and use of energy from renewable sources in electricity, heating and cooling, and transport. Information about specific financial support, including Union support, is given in Section 3.1. The Regional Funds Programme is described in Section 3.2. The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) aims to bridge gaps in the European transport, energy and telecommunications networks, focusing particularly on the cross-border parts of those networks. The facility aims to improve competitiveness within the EU and to foster economic, social and territorial cohesion, and has provided funding for Swedish projects over the years.  3.1.2.4 Where applicable, the assessment of the support for electricity from renewable sources that Member States are to carry out pursuant to Article 6(4) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Sweden has not prepared specific assessments of the effectiveness of support schemes for the generation of renewable electricity and their major distributive effects on different consumer groups, and on investments. Under Article 6.4 of the revised Renewable Energy Directive113 Member States must, at least every five years, assess the effectiveness of their support schemes for electricity from renewable sources and their major distributive effects on different consumer groups, and on investments. The Member States must include the assessment in the relevant updates of their integrated national energy and climate plans and progress reports in accordance with the Energy Governance Regulation114.  3.1.2.5 Specific measures to introduce one or more contact points, streamline administrative procedures, provide information and training, and facilitate the uptake of power purchase agreements. Summary of the policies and measures under the enabling framework Member States have to put in place pursuant to Article 21(6) and Article 22(5) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 to promote and facilitate the development of self-consumption and renewable energy communities.                                                       113 Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. 114 Regulation 2018/1999 (EU) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council. 64 (199)  The introduction of one or more contact points In May 2019, the Government commissioned the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency to analyse the measures required to implement Article 16 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (the revised Renewable Energy Directive). This includes investigating which agency or agencies should be designated as contact points. It must submit a report to the Swedish Government Offices (Infrastructure Department) by 31 January 2020.  Strategy for sustainable expansion of wind power The Swedish Energy Agency and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency are working together to develop a strategy for sustainable expansion of wind power. The strategy is based on the target of 100% renewable electricity generation in 2040 under the Energy Agreement. A substantial, sustainable expansion of wind power will be required to achieve this transition. The Directors General of the two agencies have therefore begun to develop a joint strategy for sustainable expansion of wind power which takes account of factors such as resource-efficiency, human health and the environmental impact. This is an Environmental Objectives Council initiative115.  The council coordinates the approach of state operators to wind power and produces guidelines for balancing various interests; it is also drafting a wind power plan, which breaks down the national wind power requirement to regional and municipal level. It began the work in 2018 and is due to report on it in spring 2020.  Maritime spatial plans On 17 June 2015, the Government decided to introduce a maritime spatial planning regulation (2015:400) to govern maritime spatial planning in Sweden. Under this regulation, the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management must produce proposals for maritime spatial planning for the Gulf of Bothnia, the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. The maritime spatial plans must ensure sustainable use of marine resources and development of industry, while improving the marine environment. The Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management must work with the Swedish Energy Agency to develop ways of harnessing offshore wind power and wave energy. The Agency prepared the first draft of its maritime spatial plans in autumn 2016. The plans were sent out for consultation in spring 2017. This was followed by further consultation in 2018 and a review in 2019. The Agency submitted draft maritime spatial plans to the Government in December 2019116.                                                       115 The Government set up the Environmental Objectives Council as a platform to promote action and intensify work on achieving Sweden's environmental targets at all levels of society. The Council presents the measures it intends to t 116 Maritime Spatial Plans for the Gulf of Bothnia, the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, reference number 3628-2019. 65 (199)  Simplified administration of support for photovoltaic cells At the Government's request, the Swedish Energy Agency reviewed the management of investment support for photovoltaic cells and made some suggestions for simplifying it. It suggested that this should be done initially within the current administrative system. The administration has been streamlined in a number of respects, the application forms have been simplified, information about support has been made more accessible, applications can now be submitted electronically, the monitoring requirement has been removed and dialogue between the authorities managing the support has been improved.  The solar electricity portal - guidance on photovoltaic cells In September 2018, the Swedish Energy Authority launched the Solelportalen.se web portal. The portal provides owners of small domestic properties and commercial premises with independent, factual information about photovoltaic systems from pre-installation planning to decommissioning. It is intended to help people considering investing in photovoltaic cells to make wise decisions.  The solar electricity portal was developed by the Swedish Energy Agency at the Government's request, It carried out the work in conjunction with several authorities with relevant information in the field.  Removal of the requirement for planning consent for solar energy installations The requirement for planning consent for many types of installation and solar collector has been removed from the planning and building legislation to facilitate the installation of photovoltaic systems.  Since 1 August 2018, planning consent has not usually been required to install a photovoltaic or solar collector installation on a building in an area covered by the urban management plan, if it follows the contours of the building. However, the municipalities can set other requirements in the urban management plan. The exemption from planning consent does not apply to buildings in built areas which are of special historic, cultural, environmental or artistic value or are located in, or adjacent to, areas of interest for national defence.  Since the planning and building legislation did not previously contain any specific rules for photovoltaic and solar heat installations, or any guiding case-law, the conditions for solar energy installations varied between municipalities.  Areas of national interest to optimise land use 66 (199) The Swedish Energy Agency is responsible for declaring national interest for energy generation and energy distribution which must be of particular national relevance.  For energy generation, this includes areas for large-scale installations which can generate large amounts of energy or power, but also installations which can provide balancing or regulating capacity or which are needed in the area when energy consumption is high. There are currently eight areas earmarked for energy generation.  For energy distribution, national interest provisions should be applied to areas for installations which are part of larger interconnected energy distribution systems of national interest.  Areas have been designated of national interest for wind use since 2004 and, since the last update in 2013, this has been very important for evaluating wind power in comparison with other interests for town and country planning117. There are now 313 areas of national interest for wind use, 284 of which are onshore and 29 offshore. They cover a total area of 7 900 km2 excluding developed land, which is 1.5% of the area of Sweden, including Swedish waters.  The Swedish Energy Agency is also developing a national interest scheme for hydro-electric power and has begun a preliminary study on this.  Future hydro-electric power generation must be adapted to modern environmental conditions and must also facilitate the transition to an electricity system based on 100% renewable energy. A draft national plan for reviewing hydroelectric power is currently being prepared. Eight hydroelectric power companies have also formed the Vattenkraftens Miljöfond Sverige AB, which is responsible for funding the environmental measures required for the transition of hydroelectric power operations in Sweden. The environmental initiatives must be beneficial both to fisheries and tourism and to local development and must be designed to achieve international environmental targets in water-related industries.  Renewable electricity purchase agreements There are no specific policies or other measures to facilitate more widespread use of renewable energy purchase agreements. According to market operators, these agreements are widely used in Sweden and have played an important role in the expansion of wind power.                                                       117 http://www.energimyndigheten.se/fornybart/riksintressen-for-energiandamal/. 67 (199)  Self-consumption of renewable energy and renewable energy communities In May 2019, the Government commissioned the Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate to investigate how to implement the revised Renewable Energy Directive118. This involved investigating the measures required to implement Article 21 on renewable energy self-consumers and Article 22 on renewable energy communities. It must submit a report to the Swedish Government Offices (Infrastructure Department) by 28 February 2020.  3.1.2.6 Assessment of the necessity to build new infrastructure for district heating and cooling produced from renewable sources. The Swedish district heating system is already well developed and district heating competes with other forms of heating. The owners assess whether new infrastructure for district heating and district cooling is necessary and will be profitable.  3.1.2.7 Where applicable, specific measures on the promotion of the use of energy from biomass, especially for new biomass mobilisation taking into account:  biomass availability, including sustainable biomass: both domestic potential and imports from third countries  other biomass uses by other sectors (agriculture and forest-based sectors); as well as measures for the sustainability of biomass production and use. The Klimatkliv119 is an investment support initiative for local and regional measures to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases which have an impact on the climate; it is administered by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. The funds must be invested with the primary aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions120. A plant for production of biochar from forestry residues is one example of a measure that has received support under the Klimatkliv initiative121.  The Swedish Energy Agency is continuously producing statistics on biofuels (prices, quantities) to increase transparency on its markets122. The Swedish Forest Agency records the removal of branches and tops left over from felling in its felling residue reports123.  The 20142020 Rural Development Programme includes investment support for buying and planting the perennial energy crops willow, poplar and hybrid aspen124. The programme also includes investment support for                                                       118 Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. 119 The Klimatkliv is also described in Section 3.1.1. 120 https://www.naturvardsverket.se/Stod-i-miljoarbetet/Bidrag/Klimatklivet/Om-Klimatklivet/. 121 https://www.landskogsbruk.se/skog/satsning-pa-biokol-far-225-miljoner/. 122 http://www.energimyndigheten.se/statistik/. 123 https://www.skogsstyrelsen.se/bruka-skog/skogsbransle/. 124 https://www.jordbruksverket.se/amnesomraden/stod/stodilandsbygdsprogrammet/investeringar/jordbruktradgardochrennaring.4.6ae223614dda2c3dbc44ef5.html. 68 (199) fencing for bio-energy crops and the construction of bio-energy installations.  The Government has set up a circular economy delegation125. The delegation is a Government advisory body within the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth. Its tasks include developing a strategy for the transition to a circular and bio-based economy, both nationally and regionally. It has chosen to focus initially on three areas: plastics, public procurement and the design of the circular economy. It has conducted a comprehensive debate on the circular economy and its importance for the sustainable development of society. Industry, for example, needs a business case and a demand for products not manufactured from virgin material, and business opportunities for by-products and manufacturing residues.  In 2016, the Environmental Objectives Council launched a project to increase knowledge of bioenergy in Sweden and the EU. The Swedish Forest Agency, the Swedish Energy Agency, the Swedish Board of Agriculture, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and the county councils were jointly commissioned to produce a report on the position of bioenergy and its potential.126 This was a response to the need for sustainable measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement; it also took account of the fact that many different agencies are responsible for dealing   There are many bioenergy research initiatives which are described in Section 4.6.  3.1.3 Other elements of the dimension  3.1.3.1 Where applicable, national policies and measures affecting the EU ETS sector and assessment of the complementarity and impacts on the EU ETS. The following policies affect emissions in the EU ETS:  carbon tax and energy tax on cogeneration and heat generation  see the description in Section 3.1.1;  the electricity certificates system  see the description in Section 3.1.2;  energy tax on industry  see the description in Section 3.1.1;  the Industrikliv initiative  see the description in Section 4.6;  the Energisteg initiative  see the description in Section 3.2;  requirements and support for energy mapping  see the description in Section 3.2  energy and climate coaches  see the description in Section 3.2;  energy efficiency networks  see the description in Section 3.2;                                                       125 https://tillvaxtverket.se/amnesomraden/affarsutveckling/delegation-cirkular-ekonomi.html 126 The Swedish Forest Agency, the Swedish Energy Agency, the Swedish Board of Agriculture and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency  Bioenergi på rätt sätt  Om hållbar bioenergi i Sverige och andra länder (Report 2017/10). 69 (199)  the Environmental Code  see the description in Section 3.1.1; and  tax on waste incineration  see the description in section 3.1.2.  These policies are designed to promote technical advances and reduce emissions from Swedish installations within the system. They complement the EU ETS and may increase the number of allowances in the Market Stability Reserve. Hence they may potentially also increase the number of allowances cancelled.  3.1.3.2 Policies and measures to achieve other national targets, where applicable  Air quality  127 To honour its commitments, Sweden will have to take measures to reduce national emissions of ammonia and nitrogen oxides. The National Air Pollution Control Programme128 adopted by the Government on 28 March 2018 sets out the measures that need to be taken. To achieve the reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions measures will have to be taken both in domestic transport and industry. An integrated air and climate policy will help to reduce emissions of both greenhouse gases and air pollutants.  Measures to reduce ammonia emissions include management of manure in farming, since this is the single largest source of these emissions in Sweden.  Climate change adaptation  Creating the conditions for climate change adaptation  cooperative structures, stakeholder involvement and action plans The Ministry of the Environment is responsible for coordinating work on climate change policy in the Swedish Government Offices. Climate change adaptation is monitored and evaluated with the assistance of the National Expert Council for Climate Change Adaptation and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). The National Expert Council for Climate Change Adaptation was set up in 2018 and is tasked with preparing a five-yearly report for the Government. The report must put forward proposals for national work on climate change adaptation, prioritise adaptation measures on the basis of an assessment of the risks, costs and benefits, briefly analyse the effects of climate change on society and assess national work on climate change adaptation.                                                       127 Directive (EU) 2016/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2016 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants, amending Directive 2003/35/EC and repealing Directive 2001/81/EC. 128 M2019/00243/Kl. 70 (199)  In June 2018, as a result of the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, the Government commissioned the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning to coordinate work on climate change adaptation in the built environment  In 2012, the Government commissioned the SMHI to set up the National Knowledge Centre for Climate Change Adaptation to assist municipalities, regions, authorities and other stakeholders with their climate adaptation work. In 2019, the centre had a budget of around SEK 20 million for this work.  Many Swedish authorities play an important part in climate change adaptation through their respective sector responsibilities. They work preventively by increasing knowledge and improving resilience. The implementation of the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy began in June 2018 with the Ordinance (2018:1428) on the Climate Change Adaptation Work of National Authorities in which the Government gives 32 national authorities and the 21 county councils the task of initiating, supporting and monitoring climate change adaptation in their respective areas of responsibility, for example by preparing action plans.  Many national authorities had already prepared action plans for their sector. Some were prepared with national funding, for example action plans for forestry, human health, cultural heritage, sustainable development and Sami industry and culture.  The county councils are responsible for coordinating the regional climate change adaptation work and for supporting local operators. They adopted regional action plans in 2014. The work on climate change adaptation measures identified in these plans is reported to the Government every year. The plans cover the whole of Sweden with nearly 800 proposed measures. Most of the measures are related to flood protection, protection of drinking water, protection of coastlines, infrastructure (roads and railways), adaptation of agriculture and forestry, resilience during heatwaves and health care.  The Governmental Agency Network for Climate Change Adaptation comprises the 21 county councils and 19 national agencies. The network coordinates climate adaptation work and provides a forum for the exchange of information; the secretariat is managed by the SMHI. There are also thematic national cooperation networks.  71 (199) Some local agencies have also developed action plans for their municipalities. Significant progress has been made and awareness of the importance of climate change adaptation has increased throughout society in recent years. The Planning and Building Act (2010:900) was amended in 2018 to stimulate further progress. As a result of these amendments the municipalities are able to take greater account of climate adaptation aspects in the communal planning process.  Knowledge transfer and risk assessment regional climate scenarios up to 2100. The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency operates the Floods Portal, which contains information from flood maps and geographical data in accordance with the Ordinance (2009:956) on Flood Risks, and a database of natural disasters. The Swedish Geotechnical Institute has worked with seven other agencies to produce geotechnical risk maps and tools to assess climate risks.  The Climate Change Adaptation Portal provides information about the impact of climate change on society along with tools for climate change adaptation, examples of climate change adaptation measures already implemented and information about current activities.  Many of the sectoral and regional adaptation plans include risk and vulnerability analyses.  Implementation The Government funds measures to improve knowledge of the impact of climate change and to address its impact, for example with measures to prevent subsidence, landslides and floods. The budget for this in 2019 is SEK 316 million. This includes funding for measures to prevent subsidence and landslides in the Göta älv valley, which is a particularly vulnerable area of Sweden.  The Government is also making decisions on the delegation of various measures to sectoral agencies. However, climate change adaptation is multi-sectoral, which means that the work is usually carried out by several operators and sectors working together nationally, regionally and locally.  Sweden has a well-established and effective framework for work on reducing the risk of disasters, which includes emergency preparedness groups. The work is coordinated by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency.  72 (199) Cooperation is encouraged at all levels and between sectors and operators working on land use planning, risk management, natural disasters and climate change adaptation, to reduce risks and improve preparedness.  There are currently several cooperation forums in Sweden, where sectoral agencies and other stakeholders can share experience and plan important measures. These include the Agency Network for Coastal Erosion, the Committee for Dam Design Flows from a Climate Change Perspective, The Delegation for Subsidence and Landslides, and the National Drinking Water Network.  ability analyses as part of their work to prepare for extraordinary events and emergencies. These analyses include events affected by climate change.  In the built environment, where the risk of natural disasters in particularly high, municipalities can apply for state funding for preventive measures. Around SEK 75 million a year is available for 20172020. The funding, which is administered by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, can be given to cover up to 60% of the costs, or a maximum of 60% of the value of the object at risk. The natural disasters concerned here are mainly subsidence, landslides and floods.  Evaluation and audits The National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy has a five-year review cycle. The cycle includes the implementation of the strategy and the production of an updated climate and vulnerability analysis, followed by review and evaluation of the work carried out. The SMHI's National Expert Council for Climate Change Adaptation is responsible for evaluating the strategy. An updated strategy will then be developed in 2023.  Gender mainstreaming Under the Paris Agreement, the transition to a fossil-free economy must take account of human rights and promote equality. Human rights are universal and establish that all people are of equal value and have equal rights irrespective of their culture, nationality or background. Equality in turn is a human right and establishes that society must give women, men, girls and boys the same rights, resources, protection and opportunities.  Accor-represented in positions of authority and sometimes lack the conditions or opportunities to influence climate-related policy, planning and implementation Women all 73 (199) over the world are also affected more severely by climate change than men, as they are more vulnerable to it in many countries. Climate projects and policy often achieve better results when women are involved in making the decisions locally and nationally, because they often have local knowledge and experience of managing resources sustainably.  Sweden is working on gender equality issues both at EU and national level. Sweden's feminist policies include international work, and Sweden's gender equality policy objectives are also objectives for the Government's international cooperation. Sweden's domestic policy and foreign policy on gender equality are therefore closely linked, as with the EU cooperation. Sweden promotes gender equality work within the EU, the UN, the Council of Europe and other international organisations. It also works nationally to meet its international gender equality commitments and obligations, Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).  Sweden has a feminist foreign policy which means that it always adopts a gender equality approach to its international relations with the aim of promoting rights, representation and resources for all women and girls. The feminist foreign policy is set out in an action plan, which includes specific targets for gender equality. Sweden has campaigned for many years for gender equality to be integrated into all relevant EU processes.  have the same power and opportunities to shape society and their own lives. This aim must also embedded in climate policy and the Government intends to Environmental Protection Agency has submitted a proposal for further integration of gender equality in the implementation of the Paris Agreement.  3.1.3.3 Policies and measures to achieve low emission mobility (including electrification of transport). Policies and measures for the transport sector are described in Section 3.1.1.  3.1.3.4 Where applicable, national policies, timelines and measures planned to phase out energy subsidies, in particular for fossil fuels; Environmentally damaging subsidies must be phased out both in Sweden and worldwide. However, Sweden has not set deadlines for phasing out energy subsidies. In response to the proposals in the revised spring budget for 2019, the reduction of energy and carbon taxes for mining operations was abolished (see Section 3.1.1). The compatibility of policy with climate objectives is also evaluated continuously through the Climate Policy
