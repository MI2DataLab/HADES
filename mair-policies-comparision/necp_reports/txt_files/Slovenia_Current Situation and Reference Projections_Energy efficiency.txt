150 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   4.3  Energy Efficiency Dimension This chapter presents the results of the scenarios for the transport, industry and general consumption sectors. The general consumption sector includes households, agriculture and forestry and other uses, which also includes the services sector. The scenarios used when drafting the NEPN are in line with the findings of the LIFE Climate Path 2050 project and will also be harmonised as appropriate with the long-term climate strategy. i. Current primary and final energy use in the economy and individual sectors (including industrial, residential, service and transport sectors) In 2017, the energy supply amounted to 6 838 ktoe, or 6 788 ktoe excluding non-energy use. The largest share, i.e. 71%, was final energy use, amounting to 4 859 ktoe. Transformation losses due to conversion to electricity and heat amounted to 1 718 ktoe or 25%, transmission and distribution losses accounted for 2% and energy sector use and own use in transformation accounted for 1%. With regard to final energy use, the greatest amount of energy is consumed in transport (38% of final energy use) and manufacturing and construction (27%). Households consume 23% of final energy with other uses accounting for 12%. ii. Current possibilities for using high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling Projection results for the district heating sector and potential for high-efficiency cogeneration District heating is an efficient system for the distribution of heat produced in a centralised location. It is at a low level in comparison with more developed European countries (e.g. Iceland, Denmark, Sweden) as only 7.6% of energy use is from district heating systems, mainly due to dispersed settlement patterns in Slovenia. In the EU, district heating systems are recognised as one of the key technologies in achieving reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and in energy consumption. One of the priority targets is also energy efficiency in all sectors, which means reduced energy consumption in buildings. Slovenia has district heating mainly in cities. Various fossil fuels, whose reserves are limited, are used as the energy source for the most part. In densely populated areas, district heating systems have been shown to play a key role in decarbonisation of the heating and cooling sector. An important role will be played by fourth-generation systems characterised by low operating temperatures, flexibility of operation, the possibility of cogeneration of heat and electricity, heat storage, integration with electricity generation sectors, transport, and the integration of RES and surplus heat . Energy consumption in district systems is expected to decline steadily in both the existing measures scenario and the NEPN scenario. In 2020, energy consumption will be higher due to planned new systems. In 2030, in accordance with the EM scenario, energy consumption is reduced by 24% compared to 2017 and amounts to 261 ktoe; it is reduced by a further six percentage points by 2040 and amounts to 240 ktoe. The projected reduction in energy consumption is the result of established existing instruments that promote energy renovation of buildings and connections to district systems. In the existing measures scenario, the main impact is from efficient energy use in buildings, given the large number of energy renovation projects  and reduced energy as a result  but relatively few new connections to systems. In the NEPN scenario, by 2030 energy consumption is reduced to 247 ktoe  by 28% in relation to the 2017 baseline. By 2040 it is reduced by a further seven percentage points to 224 ktoe. The chief 151 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   difference for the significant reduction in energy consumption under the NEPN scenario compared to the EM scenario is not only more extensive implementation of energy renovation of buildings but also more intensive encouragement to connect buildings to district systems, focusing on multi-dwelling and service sector buildings. The structure of technologies and fuels in district heating systems complies with the guidance for decarbonisation of the sector. Fossil fuel use is being reduced and the use of renewables and the share of more efficient technologies - CHP and heat pumps - are being increased. Compared to the baseline year 2017, under the existing measures scenario, energy consumption will be reduced most significantly in solid-fuel CHP systems, namely from 200 ktoe to 77 ktoe in 2030 and to 43 ktoe in 2040. This share is reduced to a greater extent under the NEPN scenario, with consumption down to 40 ktoe in 2030 and 34 ktoe in 2040. The projections take into consideration an increase in boilers using wood biomass  a 14% increase in 2030 and a 20% increase in relation the baseline year 2017 under the EM scenario. The NEPN scenario also envisages the wider use of these systems than in the baseline year but, given the general orientations, energy consumption will not increase as much as under the existing measures scenario. Thus, the NEPN scenario anticipates a 17% increase in the energy consumption of these boilers in 2030 and, in 2040, a further 4% increase in relation to the baseline year 2017, specifically achieved through the promotion of other systems. The projections envisage the widespread expansion of renewable CHP systems. Figure 44: Energy projection for the district heating sector for the existing measures scenario and the NEPN scenario  Key to Figure 446:  Energy consumption [ktoe]  EM  NEPN In the EM scenario, energy consumption is expected to fall by 14% from 35 ktoe in the baseline year 2017 to 30 ktoe in 2030. Then, in 2040 consumption is expected to increase by 71% compared to 60 ktoe in the baseline year. The NEPN scenario indicates increased consumption in relation to the baseline year 2017 of 91% (67 ktoe) by 2030 and 130% (81 ktoe) by 2040. Heat generation in district systems totalled 213 ktoe in the baseline year 2017. In both scenarios energy consumption is reduced. In the existing measures scenario, the reduction is 9% (193 ktoe) by 2030 and 15% (180 ktoe) in 2040 relative to the baseline year 2017. There is a further reduction in energy consumption in the NEPN scenario  by 16% (178 ktoe) by 2030 and by a further 22% (to 168 ktoe) by 2040. 152 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Table 53: Heat production in district heating systems according to technology for the existing measures scenario and the NEPN scenario  EM Unit 2017 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 CHP ktoe 171.0 163.8 143.4 130.5 127.7 126.6 Boilers ktoe 40.9 41.9 50.9 59.8 53.7 47.8 Heat pumps ktoe 0.9 0.9 2.1 3.1 4.4 5.6 Solar collectors ktoe 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.3 0.4 0.4 NEPN Unit 2017 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 CHP ktoe 171.0 163.7 148.2 143.6 145.2 142.9 Boilers ktoe 40.9 42.0 39.6 27.6 17.4 13.4 Heat pumps ktoe 0.9 1.1 4.1 6.3 8.7 11.1 Solar collectors ktoe 0.0 0.0 0.2 0.5 0.6 0.7 Figure 45: Projection of energy consumption and structure of technologies and fuels for the sector district heating for the existing measures scenario and the NEPN scenario  Key to Figure 45: Energy consumption [ktoe] EM (Existing measures)  NEPN  Solar collectors  Heat pump   Boiler LB (wood biomass)  Boiler UNP (LPG)  Boiler ZP (natural gas)  Boiler ELKO   CHP ZP (natural gas)  CHP RES  CHP solid fuel  CHP UNP (LPG) 153 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 46: Projection of installed power and electricity generation in CHP systems for the existing measures scenario and the NEPN scenario  Key to Figure 46 Installed power [MW] Electricity production [GWh]  Industry  DH  Services and households  iii. Projections in terms of existing energy efficiency policies, measures and programmes for the use of primary and final energy for each sector until at least 2040 (including for 2030) This chapter describes the situation concerning energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 and presents the results of model projections for the existing measures scenario (EM scenario) and the scenario with additional ambitious measures, i.e. the NEPN scenario. Transport Transport is a sector that has a great impact on energy consumption and hence on the attainment of energy and environment policy targets in Slovenia, especially in terms of achieving the targeted share of renewables in gross final energy use. We face considerable challenges in transport: from e-mobility, improving public transport, transport sharing opportunities, increasing freight transport, developing rail transport, changing habits to new transport-related social and business models. Several scenarios for the development of transport activity and the development of energy consumption in transport were analysed in the preparation of the NEPN. Below we present the results or model scenarios, namely the existing measures scenario and the NEPN scenario. Status In 2017, transport in Slovenia accounted for 1 870 ktoe or 38% of the final energy in the country. The key energy products in this sector are petroleum products; they represented 97% of the total energy in transport in 2017. Other energy sources include renewables and waste (biofuels) at 2%, electricity at 0.9% and natural gas at 0.1%. 154 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 47: Breakdown of fuel consumption in transport in 2017 [ktoe]  Key to Figure 47:  Solid fuels  Petroleum products  Natural gas  Renewables and waste  Electricity  Heat Results of projections in the transport sector In accordance with the scenario, energy use in passenger transport has varied greatly since 2020. In the existing measures scenario, energy consumption increases up to 2030, when, excluding aviation, it represents 60.4 PJ and is 6% higher than in 2017 or 43% higher than in 2005. Up to 2040, compared to 2030, energy consumption will drop by 8% to 55.5 PJ. In 2030, the main fuel used is diesel at 61%, with petrol at 29%, biofuels at 6% and electricity at 2%, with trains and road transport each contributing half and LPG and natural gas each 1%. Energy consumption per passenger kilometre unit is reduced from 2017 to 2030 by 10% and up to 2040 by 25%. Aviation fuel represents 1.1 PJ in 2017, 1.9 PJ in 2030 and 2.3 PJ in 2040. The air traffic projection is the same in all scenarios. In the ambitious scenario with additional measures (NEPN), energy consumption drops as from 2020, in particular thanks to the accelerated introduction of alternative means of propulsion in private motor vehicles. In 2030, energy consumption excluding aviation at 50.8 PJ is 11% less than in 2017. Up to 2040 the reduction in energy consumption continues at a fast pace, reaching 26.2 PJ or 54% less than in 2017. In this scenario, energy consumption per passenger kilometre is 0.92 MJ/pkm in 2030, and only 0.46 MJ/pkm in 2030. In both scenarios, energy consumption in freight transport rises up to 2030. In the existing measures (EM) scenario, it continues to increase after 2030. In the scenario with ambitious additional measures  the NEPN, however, it decreases after 2030. The EM scenario indicates energy consumption of 33.2 PJ in 2030, i.e. 36% more than in 2017 and 73% more than in 2005. By 2040, energy consumption increases by a further 9% compared to 2030. In the NEPN scenario, consumption in 2030 at 28.6 PJ is 17% higher than in 2017, while in 2040 at 24.6 PJ it is 14% less than in 2030. In 2030, there is no substantial difference in the fuel structures in the various scenarios, and diesel has the greatest share across the board: especially in the existing measures scenario (at 86%), while in the NEPN scenario it is at 75%. Second place in the existing measures scenario is held by biofuels with 7% and natural gas with 4%. Petrol has a 1% share. In the NEPN scenario, biofuels have a 10% share and natural gas an 8% share. Electricity represents 3% in the existing measures scenario and 4% in the NEPN scenario. In the NEPN scenario, petrol accounts for only 0.5% of fuel consumption. By 2040, in the NEPN scenario, the share of natural gas is increased to 33%, meanwhile the share of diesel is reduced to 26%. In the EM scenario, diesel has a share very similar proportion to the 2030 value, at 85%, because the conversion of heavy goods vehicles to natural gas is not planned. The 155 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   share of electricity is 4% in the EM scenario and 12% in the NEPN scenario, while the share of biofuels is 6% in the EM scenario and 8% in the NEPN scenario. Figure 48: Total energy consumption in transport for the existing measures scenario and the NEPN scenario up to 2040  Key to Figure 48: Energy consumption [ktoe]  Actual development   With existing measures (EM)   With additional measures (NEPN)  Energy consumption per tonne-kilometre unit is 0.43 MJ/tkm in 2017. In 2030, it falls to 0.39 MJ/tkm in the EM scenario and to 0.35 MJ/tkm in the NEPN scenario. Significantly smaller reductions in specific energy consumption per transport work carried out are achieved in freight transport than in passenger transport, anticipating no replacement of propulsion technologies but only incremental improvement of internal combustion engines, other drive assemblies and aerodynamics. Total energy consumption in the EM scenario rises until 2035. In 2030 it reaches 95.4 PJ, which is 16% more than in 2017 and 53% more than in 2005. In 2040, total energy consumption is 94.0 PJ. In the NEPN scenario, energy consumption rises until 2025, after which the trend reverses and energy consumption starts to fall, decreasing more intensively after 2030. Total energy consumption in 2030 is 81.3 PJ, which is 1% less than in 2017, and in 2040 it is 53.1 PJ, which is 36% less than in 2017. The share of RES in transport, determined in accordance with the calculation method laid down in the RES Directive of 2018, reaches 13% in 2030 in the EM scenario. Biofuels make the largest contribution to this share. In the NEPN scenario, the share of RES in transport comes to 21% in 2030, with biofuels contributing most. 156 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 49: Projection of end-use of energy and fuel structure for the transport sector for the existing measures scenario and the NEPN scenario up to 2040  Key to Figure 49: Energy consumption [ktoe]  Aviation fuel   Biofuels   Electricity   Hydrogen  CNG  ZP   UNP  Synthetic liquid fuels  Diesel Fuel   Petrol Industry The projection of energy consumption and emissions in industry is a particular challenge as we are today on the threshold a new industrial era, the era of new industrial paradigms, Industry 4.0, based on information and communication technologies (ICT) and universal device connectivity (the ). Decarbonisation of the industrial sector represents a particular challenge, given the high share of natural gas consumption in manufacturing, especially in energy-intensive activities (manufacture of paper, cement, steel, aluminium and chemicals). The integration and implementation of substantial efficiency measures that are crucial for the transition to a circular economy represent an extremely important and topical developmental trend in industry.  Status In 2017 manufacturing and construction in Slovenia consumed 1 293 ktoe of energy, which is 26% of final energy in Slovenia. The key energy products in this sector are electricity and natural gas, which in 2017 together accounted for as much as 77% of total energy in manufacturing and construction (see figure below), with electricity representing 43% and natural gas 34%, while renewable energy sources made up 9% (wood biomass, biogas, environmental energy, solar energy), petroleum products 7%, district heat 4% and solid fuels 3%. 157 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 50: Breakdown of fuel consumption in manufacturing and construction in 2017 [ktoe]  Key to Figure 50:   Solid fuels  Petroleum products  Natural gas  Renewables and waste  Electricity  Heat Results of projections for the industry sector In the EM scenario, with existing measures, energy consumption in manufacturing increases. In 2030, it amounts to 1 403 ktoe, a 9% increase compared to 2017, and in 2040 it amounts to 1 481 ktoe, an increase of a further 15% in relation to the baseline year. In the NEPN scenario, however, energy consumption in manufacturing and construction is reduced, thanks chiefly to energy efficiency measures (utilisation of surplus heat, etc.). In 2030, energy consumption in manufacturing is 1% less than the baseline 2017 value and, in 2040, 2% less. In 2030, consumption amounts to 1 283 ktoe. In 2030, utilisation of 33 ktoe of surplus heat is expected and, in 2040, 61 ktoe. While, in the EM scenario, with existing measures, the share of renewables81 is 10% in 2030 and 8% in 2040, the NEPN scenario assumes a 30% share of renewables by 2030 and a 37% share by 2040. It should be emphasised at this point that the NEPN scenario anticipates the use of synthetic gas as early as 2030, a 10% share in 2030 and a 25% share in 2040. Electricity consumption, amounting to 554 ktoe in 2017, is on the increase and increases further in the existing measures scenario to 602 ktoe, or 9%, by 2030 and to 643 ktoe or 16% by 2040. In the NEPN scenario, electricity consumption increases by 5% to 584 ktoe by 2030 and by 14% to 634 ktoe by 2040. The energy end-use trends and fuel structure for both scenarios up to 2040 are shown in the figure below.                                                            81  The share is determined as the ratio of the sum of renewable fuels (wood biomass, other renewables and surplus heat ) to the sum of heating fuels (excluding district heat).  158 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 51: Projection of energy end-use for the manufacturing and construction sectors for the existing measures scenario and the NEPN scenario  Key to Figure 51:  Final energy consumption  Actual development   With existing measures (EM)   With additional measures (NEPN)  Figure 52: Projection of energy end-use and fuel structure for the manufacturing and construction sectors for the existing measures scenario and the NEPN scenario  Key to Figure 52:  Final energy consumption;  Electricity  Heat  Waste heat  Hydrogen  Waste  Other RES  Wood biomass  Synthetic gas  Natural gas  Synthetic liquid fuels  Liquid fuels 159 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Cogeneration of heat and electricity in industry We also envisaged the use of cogeneration technologies (CHP) in industry. In 2017, 126 ktoe of fuel was used for heat production purposes: 26 ktoe of brown coal, 37 ktoe of biomass, 62 ktoe of natural gas, 1 ktoe of biogas and 0.1 ktoe of fuel oil. In the baseline year 2017, 85 ktoe of heat and 201 GWh of electricity were produced in the units. The existing measures scenario expects the existing situation to be maintained in 2030 and does not anticipate any new CHP installations in 2040. The NEPN scenario is more ambitious in this area, expecting capacity to be increased to 85 MW (431 GWh electricity generation) by 2030 and 97 MW (629 GWh electricity generation) by 2040. The figure below shows the consumption of heat generation fuels by CHP plants in industry by scenario and threshold electricity generation. The columns show the final consumption of fuels used for heat generation in CHP units. In the existing measures scenario, the existing installations operate until 2030 and no new installations are foreseen after 2030 due to non-stimulating incentives. The ambitious NEPN scenario envisages more intensive penetration of CHP technologies on wood biomass (a 52% share of fuel consumption in 2030 and a 53% share in 2040). Natural gas accounts for 47% of fuel consumption in 2030 and 40% of fuel consumption in 2040. The share of hydrogen is increasing, at 12 ktoe accounting for about 7% of fuel use in 2040. In accordance with the data reporting and collection methodology, the use of fuels for electricity generation in cogeneration units is attributed to the transformation sector.

Table 54: Capacity and generation of electricity in CHP technologies in industry according to scenarios Capacity [MW] 2017 2020 2030 2040 EM scenario 51 52 42 1 NEPN scenario 51 58 85 97 Threshold electricity production [GWh]  EM scenario 201 206 110 6 NEPN scenario 201 238 431 629 General consumption (households, agriculture and forestry and other consumption) By 2050, in order to fulfil the greenhouse gas emissions targets imposed, net-zero emissions will have to be achieved in the consumer sector (households, agriculture and forestry and other consumption, of which the service sector is also part). The objective is extremely ambitious and, in order to achieve it, it will be necessary to continue with the energy renovation of buildings and promote technologies using RES and centralised systems. By 2030 and beyond, it will be necessary to maintain a rate of integrated energy renovations of over 2% per year. This will be a major challenge, especially for the public sector, as it more demanding cases of reconstruction for economic, technical and other reasons will follow. The construction design and renovation process will be supported by mandatory building information modelling, which will increase design efficiency, reduce investment and shorten construction time. Regulations on the construction of new buildings will be further tightened up. Tightening of energy efficiency regulations in buildings and sustainable evaluation of buildings is expected, which is likely to affect the number of renovations and energy efficiency of buildings. Starting in 2018, new buildings in the public sector must be nearly zero energy, which means that they must be extremely energy efficient and must use renewable energy sources. From 2021 this applies to all buildings. Most of the buildings in Slovenia were built in the 1960-1990 period, and the reduction of GHG emissions up to 2030 and 2050 will also need to take into account other aspects of renovation, such as, for instance, seismic, flood and fire protection, etc. This will be done in the context of a long-term strategy to promote investment in the energy renovation of buildings, which will identify additional instruments for the renovation of buildings and a phased approach to the comprehensive phased renovation of buildings. Status Energy consumption in the consumer sector (households, agriculture and forestry and other consumption) amounted to 1 697 ktoe in 2017, which represents 34% of final energy in Slovenia. The key energy sources in the sector concerned are electricity (35%), renewables (30%) and petroleum products (17%), with natural gas accounting for 10% of energy consumption in the sector. 161 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 54: Breakdown of fuel consumption in the buildings sector in 2017 [ktoe]  Key to Figure 54:  Solid fuels  Petroleum products  Natural gas  Renewables and waste  Electricity  Heat The focus is, within buildings, to dramatically reduce the use of fossil fuels and to maximise the use of district heating systems that enable greater flexibility and connectivity to other sectors  electricity generation through heat storage, and elsewhere renewable energy sources. A detailed spatial analysis was also undertaken addressing the possibility of expanding existing district heating systems and identifying new areas where micro and large district heating systems would be economically viable today and in 2030 and 2040 when heat demand will be reduced because buildings will be more energy efficient. Thus, in accordance with the various scenarios, the actual possibility of connection to district heating systems for single and multi-dwelling buildings, public buildings and other service sectors was identified. Result of projections for the general consumption sector In accordance with the existing measures (EM) scenario, energy consumption in the general consumption sector is decreasing, as shown in the figure below. Compared to the baseline year 2017, consumption is down 15% to 1 448 ktoe in 2030, dropping by a further 4 percentage points to 1 381 ktoe by 2040. Compared to the existing measures scenario, the NEPN scenario provides for even more energy renovations, greater emphasis on renewable technologies for heating and hot water preparation, and more connections to district heating systems as well as a significant increase in their number in economically justified areas. In the NEPN scenario, final energy use is reduced by 21% to 1 339 ktoe in 2030, while in 2040 it is reduced by 26% compared to 2017 to 1 249 ktoe. 162 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 55: Total energy use in the general consumption sector under the existing measures scenario and under the NEPN scenario by 2040  Key to Figure 55:  Final energy consumption  Actual development   Existing measures (EM)   Additional measures (NEPN) Targets for net-zero emissions in buildings by 2050 lead to significant changes in fuel structures. Technologies using fossil fuels will be replaced by either technology using renewables, or by heat stations and connections to district heating systems. In the existing measures scenario, the final energy consumption of liquid fuels is projected to be 123 ktoe in 2030, a reduction of 57% compared to 2017. It is further reduced by 24% to 83 ktoe by 2040. In the NEPN scenario, the projected reduction of final energy consumption is 65% (99 ktoe) in 2030 and 85% (42 ktoe) in 2040 compared to the baseline year 2017. The projections take into account an increase in final electricity consumption due to (1) an increase in the share of heat pumps as heating technologies in buildings in new constructions and replacements of old, inefficient systems, (2) an increase in the electricity consumption of other technical systems in buildings (lighting, cooling) and (3) an increase in the electricity consumption of interior fittings, where the major consumer is the services sector. In the existing measures scenario, an increase of 11% to 656 ktoe is expected in 2030, while final energy consumption increases by a further 11% to 723 ktoe by 2040. The NEPN scenario also envisages more replacements and greater use of heat pumps, as well as more efficient lighting, more economical use of interior fittings, etc. Final energy consumption is therefore 601 ktoe in 2030, an increase of only 2% compared to 2017, while increasing to 654 ktoe in 2040, a 10% increase in relation to the baseline year. 163 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA   Figure 56: Projection of energy end-use and fuel structure for the general consumption sector for the existing measures scenario and the NEPN scenario up to 2040  Key to Figure 56: Final energy consumption   Electricity  Heat  Waste heat  Hydrogen  Waste   Other RES  Wood biomass  Synthetic gas  Natural gas  Synthetic liquid fuels EM  (existing measures)  NEPN Energy end-use projections and balance  The table below shows the results of projections for all energy end-use sectors by energy group.

Cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance resulting from national calculations in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU The minimum energy performance requirements for buildings are governed by the Rules on efficient use of energy in buildings. This act is expected to be updated in 2020 in line with the requirements stemming from Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU and the establishment of minimum requirements for nearly zero-energy buildings. Accordingly, after 2020, all buildings will be constructed and renovated as nearly zero-energy buildings in line with the rules on efficient energy use in buildings. The requirements will be established at three levels, namely (1) heat required to heat the building, (2) non-renewable primary energy and (3) the share of renewables in the total energy balance of the building. Different types of buildings will be subject to different minimum requirements, and a more detailed energy treatment will be required for some types of buildings. Cost-effective approaches and optimal levels will also be specified in more detail in a long-term strategy to encourage investment in the energy renovation of buildings.
