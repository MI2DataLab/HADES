2.1. Dimension decarbonisation The goal of the national energy and climate plan is to achieve a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of 24% by 2030 compared to 2005. This will be achieved through a phase approach as presented in section 3.1. 2.1.1. GHG emissions and removals For non-ETS sectors, a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 24% compared to the respective emission levels for 2005 is set. The sectors covered by the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) are subject to the overall European GHG reduction target of 43% compared to the corresponding 2005 emission levels. The NECP also adopts the quantitative targets set in the context of the implementation of Directive 2016/2284/EC on the reduction of national emissions of certain air pollutants for the period 2020-2029 and for the year 2030 compared to 2005 (as shown in Table 2.1), which also requires the development, establishment and implementation of National Air 49  Pollution Control Programmes, as well as the monitoring and reporting of the emission levels for relevant pollutants [sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds other than methane (NMVOC), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5)] and other pollutants (CO, heavy metals, POPs, BC). These emissions are not simulated or further analysed within the framework of the NECP, as their evolution is an obligation of other national emission inventories and of the National Programme for the Control of Air Pollution, further analysing the impact of the NECP on the achievement of the targets set for Cyprus under Directive 2016/2284/EC. Table 2.1: Quantitative targets for the reduction of national emissions of certain air pollutants for the period 2020-2029 and for the year 2030 compared to 2005 Air pollutant Percentage of emission reductions compared to 2005 Period 2020-2029 2030 Sulphur dioxide (SO2) 83% 93% Nitrogen oxides (NOx) 44% 55% Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) 45% 50% Ammonia (NH3) 10% 20% Fine particulate matter (PM2.5 46% 70% LULUCF Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down accounting rules on greenhouse gas emissions and removals relating to land use, land-use not be covered by this Regulation. However, while the environmental outcome under this Regulation in terms of the levels of greenhouse gas emission reductions that are made is affected by taking into account a quantity up to the sum of total net removals and total net emissions from afforested land, deforested land, managed cropland, managed grassland and, under certain conditions, managed forest land as well as, where made mandatory under Regulation (EU) 2018/841, managed wetland, as defined in that Regulation, a LULUCF flexibility for a maximum quantity of 280 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent of those removals divided among Member States should be included in this Regulation as an additional possibility for Member States to meet their commitments when needed. That total amount and its division among Member States should acknowledge the lower mitigation potential of the agriculture and land use sector and an appropriate contribution of that sector to greenhouse gas mitigation and sequestration. In addition, voluntary deletions of annual emission allocations under this Regulation should allow for such amounts to be taken into (EU) 2018/841. On 30 November 2016, the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Governance of the Energy Union energy and climate plans in the context of strategic energy and climate policy planning for all five key dimensions of the Energy Union. According to the governance proposal, the national 50  planning of their compliance with this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2018/841. To that end, Member States are to set out the policies and measures to meet the obligations under this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2018/841, with an outlook to the long-term goal to achieve a balance between greenhouse gas emissions and removals in accordance with the Paris Agreement. Those plans are also to set out an assessment of the impacts of the planned policies and measures to meet the objectives. According to the governance proposal, the Commission should be able to indicate in its recommendations on the draft national plans the appropriateness of the level of ambition and of the subsequent implementation of policies and measures. The possible use of the LULUCF flexibility to comply with this Regulation should be taken into account when compiling those plans. For Cyprus, total net removals from afforested land, deforested land, managed cropland and managed grassland may be taken into account for compliance for the period 2021 to 2030 pursuant to point (a) of article 7(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 is 600 kt CO2 eq. Climate Change Adaptation With regard to climate change adaptation, the Department of Environment of the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and the Environment coordinated the efforts to develop and implement the National Adaptation Strategy to Climate Change. For the implementation of the Strategy, a relevant Action Plan has been prepared, the implementation of which implies the implementation of measures which the competent Ministries / Authorities will promote within their budgets. The National Adaptation Strategy (NAP) and Action Plan (NAP) to Climate Change were adopted by the Council of Ministers on 18/5/2017. This Decision: - Calls on all stakeholders involved in the relevant Action Plan to promote the implementation of the envisaged actions, incorporating, where appropriate, relevant provisions in their Budgets. Where necessary, implementing bodies should assess the relevant economic impacts as well as the cost - benefits of implementing the actions, in order to confirm their need of their implementation. - Designates the Department of the Environment to oversee the implementation of the adaptation measures of the National Adaptation Strategy and the relevant Action Plan, which will submit, through the Minister of Agriculture, Rural Development and the Environment, an annual report to the Council of Ministers. This Report shall, inter alia, indicate the extent to which the actions have been implemented, the reasons for any divergence, and suggestions for corrective action. The National Adaptation Strategy provides a holistic framework which intends to help the decision-makers, stakeholders and citizens to respond successfully to climate change risks and assess the potential cross-sectional impacts and the vulnerability to climate change and how it might be reduced by various cost-effective adaptation options. The strategy besides the detailed analysis of observed and potential impacts and their vulnerabilities includes adaptation measures that should be taken immediately, as well as policies for future actions, for different sectors of economy. The selected sectors of importance in which climate change is significant for Cyprus are the following: Water resources, Agriculture, Coastal 51  zones, Tourism, Biodiversity, Energy, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Soils, Forests, Public Health and Infrastructure. Reviews of NAS and NAP coordinated by the Department of Environment  The 1st Annual Report on the Implementation of the adaptation measures of the National Adaptation Strategy to Climate Change and Action Plan was submitted and approved by the Council of Ministers on 5 December 2018, while the 2nd Annual Report was submitted and approved 15 January 2020. It is noted that some of the effects of regional climate change cannot be effectively addressed by the existing measures of the National Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan and therefore require specific study to determine, as far as possible, how to effectively address them. To this end, and in support of the National Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan, the Climate Change Actions in the Eastern Mediterranean & Middle East will be utilized. The purpose of this Initiative is to develop a Regional Action Plan to support countries in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East to meet their obligations under the Paris Agreement and to address and / or adapt to the effects of climate change. This Regional Action Plan will be a dynamic high-level strategic planning document and outline regional climate policy (climate change mitigation and adaptation), taking into account the specificities and challenges of the region. Waste Under the EU circular economy package and the new waste directives amending the EU legal framework on waste, including the Waste, the Packaging and Packaging Waste and the Landfill Directives came in force in 2018, new ambitious long-term objectives and obligations have been introduced for the reduction of waste, increases in separate collection, reuse and recycling, and a significant reduction in the amount of waste that is landfilled. Specifically, by 2025 organic waste must be separately collected, while the separate collection of recyclable waste must be significantly increased since the preparation for reuse and recycling must rise to 55% by 2025, 60% by 2030 and 65% by 2035. The objective is to reduce landfill to a maximum of 10% of the total amount of municipal waste generated by 2035.  Table 2.2: Waste Management Targets Directive 2018/851/EU amending the Waste Directive 2025 2030 2035 Preparing for reuse and recycling of municipal waste 55% 60% 65% Bio-Waste By 31/12/2013 bio-waste is either separated and recycled at source or is collected separately and is not mixed with other types of waste. Directive 2018/850/EU amending the Landfill Directive By 2035 the amount of municipal waste landfilled is reduced to 10 % or less of the total amount of municipal waste generated (by weight) Directive 2018/852/EU amending the Packaging 2025 2030 52  Directive Recycling of packaging waste 65% 70%   Plastic  50% 55%  Wood 25% 30%  Ferrous metals  70% 80%  Aluminium  50% 60%  Glass 70% 75%  Paper and cardboard 75% 85% As a response to the increased obligations arising from the circular economy package, the National Strategy for the Management of Municipal Waste will be revised in 2020 to determine the future planning needs and measures and actions to be implemented to meet the new requirements and quantitative targets of the circular economy package, including to further promote separate collection, to support local authorities in their new obligations, and to promote the necessary infrastructure for the recycling and treatment of waste on the basis of the principles of the circular economy. Long-term planning In the light of the latest available science and of the need to step up global climate action, the Cyprus endorses the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.  The transition to climate neutrality will bring significant opportunities, such as potential for economic growth, for new business models and markets, for new jobs and technological development. Forward-looking research, development and innovation policies will have a key role. Achieving climate neutrality will however require overcoming serious challenges. Cyprus takes note of the Commission Communication on the European Green Deal. Cyprus expects the proposed enabling framework by the European Union that benefits all Member States and encompasses adequate instruments, incentives, support and investments to ensure a cost-effective, just, as well as socially balanced and fair transition, taking into account different national circumstances in terms of starting points. The transition will require significant public and private investments. In this context, Cyprus welcomes and supports the announcement by the EIB that it intends to support investment in climate action and environmental sustainability in the period from 2021 to 2030. It is underlined that the next MFF will significantly contribute to climate action. InvestEU has an important role in leveraging private investments for the transition. Tailored support for regions and sectors most affected by the transition will be made available from the forthcoming EU Just Transition Mechanism, which, as announced by the European Commission will aim at facilitating EUR 100 billion of investment through the Just Transition Mechanism. Details on the proposal of the European Commission on the Just Transition Mechanism are expected. Funding of transformation efforts must continue after 2030.  All relevant EU and national legislation and policies need to be consistent with, and contribute to, the fulfilment of the climate neutrality objective while respecting a level playing field. It has to be examined whether this requires an adjustment of the existing rules, 53  including on state aid and public procurement. Moreover, the environmental and socio-economic impact of the transition to climate neutrality needs continuous monitoring. competitiveness, including by developing effective measures to tackle carbon leakage. In this concerning carbon-intensive sectors is essential for Cyprus. Facilities in third countries need to adhere to the highest international environmental and safety standards. International engagement will be crucial for the success in addressing climate change and it is necessary to pay particular attention to climate diplomacy. Within this framework, Cyprus initiative on climate change is expected to have an important role in the regional cooperation on climate change. The Cyprus Government Initiative for Coordinating Climate Change Actions in the Eastern Mediterranean & Middle East aims at the development of a Regional Action Plan to address the specific needs and challenges countries are facing in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East region, to address and ameliorate the impact of climate change and advance mitigation actions in accordance with the Paris Agreement. To achieve the objective of developing a Regional Action Plan on Climate Action Coordination, a detailed work programme has been developed, consisting of two distinct components: a scientific and an intergovernmental component. Cyprus will keep progress towards the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 under review and give strategic guidance, as appropriate. 2.1.2. Renewable energy 2.1.2.1. i. The elements set out in point (a)(2) of Article 4 The Cyprus authorities taking into account various studies made11,12,13,14 towards a sustainable 2030 pathway, as well as the EC Recommendations, have revised their ambition target. Using recent available data and taking into account the recommendations received from the various stakeholders, the new trajectory can almost meet all the EU recommendations for Cyprus to achieve the 23% RES target by 2030.  In the transport sector, while the target is more difficult to be achieved, thus more synergies are needed from other sectors, Cyprus authorities with the PPM proposed, under certain conditions, can also meet the 14% RES target. As indicated in a study funded by SRSS15, there are some alternative options in the transport sector, that with the appropriate funding in                                                            11 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/energyse.nsf/C1028A7B5996CA7DC22580E2002621E3/$file/JR C%20LTEM%20Final%20Workshop%20-%20CyI%20results.pdf 12 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/energyse.nsf/C1028A7B5996CA7DC22580E2002621E3/$file/L ong%20Term%20Planning%20overview.pdf 13 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/energyse.nsf/C1028A7B5996CA7DC22580E2002621E3/$file/I RENA%20REPORT%202030_Jan_2015.pdf 14 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/energyse.nsf/C1028A7B5996CA7DC22580E2002621E3/$file/C yprus_RESGRID_summary_v16.pdf 15 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/energyse.nsf/C1028A7B5996CA7DC22580E2002621E3/$file/if eu%20Transport%20Study.pdf 54  infrastructure projects (Natural Gas Charging points and Electric Vehicles), besides the Modal Shift that is suggested in the study, Cyprus can achieve the set RES target.  From the various PPM that were examined16 and taking into account the level of implementation and estimated timeline of each, as shown in Figure 2.1, Cyprus can exceed the recommended trajectory targets set by Article 3 of EU Directive 2018/2001, at both 2022 (18%) and 2025 (45%) reference points. This is true though, in the case where Cyprus will be interconnected by the end of 2023. However, if Cyprus remains isolated, the third indicative reference point target cannot be met, since Cyprus can only reach the 57.3% instead of 65% of the RES target. The results of the sensitivity analysis performed (Appendix 2) show that the electricity interconnector will allow more RES Projects to be installed especially in the electricity sector. Curtailment levels will also be reduced for both Wind and Solar energy produced. RES 2020 Target (Baseline) and reference points In the PPM scenario it is assumed that natural gas will become available for use in the electricity supply sector by the end of 2021-beginning 2022, via an LNG regasification facility. This means that the supplied gas will not necessarily originate from the domestic gas reserves, but could be from any potential supplier. At the initial stages, natural gas will be used for electricity production and gradually it will be supplied to other industrial users.  Figure 2.1.

Estimated trajectories for the sectoral share of renewable energy in final energy consumption from 2021 to 2030 in the electricity, heating and cooling, and transport sector Based on the revised updated results for the RES in Final Energy Consumption, the results shown in Figure 2.2 were obtained in the three sectors, RES-H&C, RES-E and RES-T, under the PPM Scenario.  Figure 2.2. RES Sector evolvement from 2021-2030, estimated trajectories in PPM Scenario Table 2.3: Trajectories for the sectoral share of renewable energy in final energy consumption from 2021 to 2030 in the electricity, heating and cooling, and transport sector in two PPM Scenarios Scenario PPM  2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 RES in Gross Final Energy Consumption 14.8% 16.1% 16.5% 17.2% 17.7% 18.2% 18.7% 19.1% 21.0% 22.9% RES-H&C share 32.6% 33.1% 33.9% 34.5% 35.2% 35.8% 36.5% 37.2% 38.7% 39.4% RES-E share 15.8% 19.9% 20.8% 22.6% 23.3% 23.8% 24.1% 24.1% 27.6% 30.3% RES-T share  6.3% 6.3% 6.3% 6.3% 6.3% 6.6% 7.3% 8.0% 8.8% 14.1% Scenario PPM with interconnector                     RES in Gross Final Energy Consumption 14.8% 16.1% 16.5% 16.9% 17.3% 17.8% 20.8% 23.5% 26.6% 29.7% RES-H&C share 32.6% 33.1% 33.9% 34.5% 35.2% 35.8% 36.5% 37.2% 38.7% 39.4% RES-E share 15.8% 19.9% 20.8% 21.4% 22.1% 22.7% 31.4% 38.2% 45.1% 51.3% RES-T share  6.3% 6.3% 6.3% 6.3% 6.3% 6.5% 7.1% 7.9% 9.2% 14.8% From the results in Table 2.3, it can be easily observed that up to 2023 the two scenarios (PPM with and without Interconnector) are almost identical. This is because the planned policies and measures adopted were used in both scenarios since there was a budget approval already for implementing the PPMs for the period of 2020-2022. Most of the PPMs described in Deliverable 3 of SRSS Study17, especially RES projects for Electricity generation,                                                            17 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/EnergySe.nsf/All/4CFADF62B303D228C22584D6004AAB42/$fi le/SRSS-C2018-070_Deliverable_3.pdf 2020 RES Target (13%)  2030 RES Target (23%)  56  will materialise since most of those projects are under implementation. A total additional capacity of 360MW is expected to be installed until the end of 2023 that will bring the total RES penetration for the electricity sector up to the level of 700- Based on various studies performed from both MECI18 and the Transmission System Operator (TSO), the further penetration of RES without storage technologies will cost significantly to the energy system, since more reserves will be needed from the conventional diesel-fired flexible Gas Turbines. In addition, the further deployment of storage technologies that it is assumed in the PPM Scenario without the interconnector, adds extra cost to the hybrid system (RES+Storage) that make it less competitive than the conventional units that will be fired with natural gas. This is not the case for the PPM scenario with the presence of the interconnector (after 2023), where no storage technologies are needed till 2030. The above outcome verifies the assumption made in previous studies19, where the level of ambition in the electricity sector was lower due to the lack of electricity interconnection. Based on the modelling results in Table 2.3, it can be observed that electrification of heating and cooling and the electricity sector are boosted in the first short term period (2021-2023). The RES in heating and cooling sector continues to grow almost constantly during the whole period (mainly due to the heat-pumps and solar), while an increase in the RES in transport sector is observed during the end of the period. Based on the results of the impact assessment study (Chapter 5), it makes economic sense to implement measures in the transport sector towards the end of the period, i.e., 2029-2030. This is due to the expected increase of CO2 and oil prices towards the end of that period. In addition, it is expected that the evolution in technology and the price reduction of batteries will contribute to this effect. Furthermore, it is assumed that the other transport measures (modal shift and electric tram) will take place and be adopted during that period as well. The introduction of natural gas and the stricter restrictions regarding emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants that will be introduced after 2021 affect the electricity generation, transportation, and heating and cooling sectors. Similarly, once domestic gas reserves become operational, demand for natural gas may not be confined to just conventional power generation. Compressed natural gas may become a viable alternative in the transport sector. Also, the use of natural gas in industry, for residential heating purposes or for gasification of the transport sector, are potential alternatives. This was also highlighted in an Ifeu Study for Transport20, where the introduction of Natural Gas in transport will lead to very interesting results (natural gas can be used in transport sector, especially buses). However, in the PPM Scenario this aspect was not introduced, however, it                                                            18 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/energyse.nsf/C1028A7B5996CA7DC22580E2002621E3/$file/Cypr us_RESGRID_summary_v16.pdf 19 http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/environment/environmentnew.nsf/all/8D6EF81F38772607C2 25829400343871/$file/NECP_190123_1320_clean.pdf?openelement 20 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/energyse.nsf/C1028A7B5996CA7DC22580E2002621E3/$file/if eu%20Transport%20Study.pdf 57  seems that once natural gas will be available in Cyprus, the gasification of heavy trucks and busses (or even bunkering), will lead to increased decarbonisation levels. It is expected to evaluate this aspect (Gas in Transport) in the first revision of the NECP. Assumptions and Methodology  In order to extract the above results, wherever data were not available from local sources, assumptions were based on literature, PRIMES or POTEnCIA-IDEES database. The data presented were revised in relation to the draft plan of 2019 with more precise and accurate data. In addition, and as stated before, the PPM scenario with the interconnector has a much greater contribution in RES electricity Sector (51% vs 30%) and thus in total RES contribution in final energy consumption, where the level of RES can reach the 30%. At the same time, input was drawn from other parallel studies conducted for MECI by SRSS.  Due to the vast amount of data used in the modelling exercise, the following subsections present the key input and assumptions used to develop the model for each sector (all the assumptions used are listed in the Appendix 3). The importance of the interlinkages between these sectors relates to the many plausible synergies that can exist between technologies in one sector and how it affects demand in another sector, which was something that was requested from the European Commission technologically advanced system in 2030, the transmission system operator will be able to temporarily shed load from less important services, such as cooling of a shopping centre or desalination plants, so as to cope with potential rapid drops in generation. Similarly, the batteries in electric vehicles (with PV), can facilitate the use of higher shares of variable renewables and they might be charged when there is an increase in generation. This enables the grid operator to use them as demand response and a means of electric storage from which it can draw (together with selective load shedding) in cases of generation shortage or to smoothen out fluctuations in electricity demand. Electricity Sector The scenario with existing measures is dominated by natural gas-fired generation, once this fuel becomes available (Figure 2.3). The renewable energy share in generation is limited between 15% and 25% for the period 2021-2030. However, as gas prices and CO2 costs increase and investment costs of renewable energy technologies decrease along the model horizon, the share of renewable energy in generation increases in a non-linear way towards the years of 2029-2030. As it was illustrated in the corresponding IRENA21 and KTH22 work, solar PV is the most competitive of the renewable energy technologies and, as such, this is responsible for the increase in renewable energy. Solar PV capacity increases to a total of 750 MW by 2030 comparing with the 2020 target which is 288MW.                                                             21 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/energyse.nsf/C1028A7B5996CA7DC22580E2002621E3/$file/I RENA%20REPORT%202030_Jan_2015.pdf 22 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/energyse.nsf/C1028A7B5996CA7DC22580E2002621E3/$file/L ong%20Term%20Planning%20overview.pdf 58  It should once more pointed out that the modelling exercise confirms the importance of electricity interconnector, since, in that case, no storage technologies will be needed to be deployed and the different penetration of renewables in the electricity sector is more than 20%.  Figure 2.3: Projected generation mix till 2030  PPM scenario, with all available Technologies contribution Storage Options Two main electricity storage options were considered during the analysis. The pumped hydro storage facility was used as an option, but its deployment is delayed until 2027, as the -Cy and also based on the results of a FOSS study23. The reasoning for this is that no interest has been shown in such a facility yet and no technical feasibility assessment had been completed at the time of model development. In addition, the policy framework is not yet developed, as well as the cost and performance characteristics assumed for this facility may need to be revised, since the existence of periodic droughts in Cyprus may affect the attractiveness and viability of such a project.

Demand forecasts for heating and cooling, as well as techno-economic characteristics of technology options were also provided in the same study. Four levels of demand were examined based on various energy efficiency Policies and Measures. The technologies evaluated were residential cooling, residential heating, cooling in all other sectors, and heating in all other sectors. The seasonal variation in demand for heating and cooling was estimated based on historical measurements of heating and cooling degree days. An estimate of the demand profile within each day had to be assumed for each of the demands. In the case of cooling, this was based on the recorded electricity demand profile of each sector. However, analysis providing a more accurate demand profile may be needed for future enhancements of the model. Heat pumps and split units are the most competitive technology, as these increase their share substantially, displacing oil boilers and electric resistance heaters. Additionally, fuel-efficient oil boilers provide a considerable amount of heating in the services, industrial and agricultural sectors. Solar thermal panels in these sectors also increase their contribution by about twice their current yield, while solar thermal panels in the residential sector stay stable at the current levels. However, in the residential sector heat pumps/heat pump split-units take up the majority of the heating demand, as they are conceived to be the most cost-competitive technology. On the other hand, electric resistance heaters are not seen as efficient or cost-competitive and are phased out. Similarly, heat pumps/heat pump split-units take up the entire cooling demand throughout the model horizon, as currently is the case, with minimal contribution from efficient oil boilers. It should be clarified that the biomass CHP plants providing part of the heating demand refer to existing and future agricultural facilities making use of biogas, both for heating purposes as well as to generate electricity.

The percentage of biofuels in transport in energy content was 2.6% in 2018 and it is estimated to reach at 3.1% by 2019. The greenhouse gas emission reduction was at 1% for 2018 and it is estimated at 1.3% for 2019. These percentages will be increased in 2020 in order to meet the obligatory targets. According to the specific level, the suppliers of transport fuels (petrol and diesel) are obliged to blend biofuels to conventional transport fuels in order to achieve a certain target, which is a percentage of biofuels to whole annual sales of petrol and diesel, in energy content. The cost of biofuels is included in the retail price of petrol and diesel. In terms of policies and measures, the current biofuel blending was considered in the model. It should be noted that biodiesel is blended with diesel, but no bioethanol blending with petrol takes place due to concerns raised regarding fuel quality standards by local oil-product import companies. MARDE promotes a scheme for the local production of biofuels from waste, as a measure of management/recovery of waste. In case the project is successful, the prices of biofuels in diesel fuel will not be reduced significantly but this can change the penetration of biofuels since local biofuels will be make sense to be used for various reasons, such as, job creation, local content, environmental issues. Finally, as the model shows, the achievement of the EU objective for reaching a 14% share of renewable energy in transport by 2030 with PPM, as opposed to just 7% in the WEM scenario is achievable, if the appropriate EU funding is obtained as shown in the impact assessment study (Chapter 5).  32.60% 33.88% 35.21% 36.50% 39.44% 0.00%5.00%10.00%15.00%20.00%25.00%30.00%35.00%40.00%45.00%0510152025302021202220232024202520262027202820292030ElectricityHeating oil/light fuel oil/Gas OilPet CokeLPGBiomassGeothermalDistrict Heating and CoolingSolarRES share61  2.1.2.3. iii. Estimated trajectories by renewable energy technology that the Member State projects to use to achieve the overall and sectoral trajectories for renewable energy from 2021 to 2030, including expected total gross final energy consumption per technology and sector in Mtoe and total planned installed capacity (divided by new capacity and repowering) per technology and sector in MW Most of the existing RES projects were licenced for 15 or 20 years with a few of them starting operation in 2005, whilst the majority of them commenced operations after 2010. It is expected that after the expiration of their PPAs, the projects will be operated under a net-billing scheme or participate directly to the competitive electricity market. For the period up to 2030, a few biomass projects are expected to end their Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) Regime. These projects are expected to participate in the Electricity Market, while they will be able at the same time to use any energy needed for their own use. Alternatively, they could take advantage of a net-billing scheme. As far as other technologies (wind and solar) are concerned, only some small household PV systems up to 5kW will have their PPAs expired. These projects can continue their operation, based on the support scheme that will be in force at the time. So it is more likely that some of those projects will be converted to net-metering or net-billing scheme.  In that respect, the estimated energy amounts needing repowering up to 2030 are 10,4MW of Biomass plants and 5-10MW of small PV systems, mainly residential. The rest of the  The revised capacity projections (MW) for the Electricity Sector are listed below.

This is because due to the small size of the country, some projects that are consider small for other countries can play an important role for Cyprus (i.e. a small district heating network). A moderate decrease in the primary energy supply can be                                                            25 (CCGT) Combined Cycle Gas Turbine was selected among other possible technologies. 62  observed across the time horizon. The main driver of this is the incorporation of greater shares of renewable energy, which displaces fossil-fired generation in the electricity sector. Additionally, up to 2021 heavy fuel oil is till used to a considerable extent until the introduction of less carbon-intensive natural gas in the power sector by the end of 2021.  Figure 2.5: Energy Demand from all Sectors in ktoe, from 2021-2030 in PPM Scenario. National strategy for heating and cooling sector Following Article 14 and the recently revised Annex VIII of the EED, the Comprehensive Assessment (CA) of efficient heating and cooling potential shall be updated by 31 December 2020. It is anticipated that after the update of the CA, a national strategy for energy efficiency in heating and cooling will be set. It will consist of implementation steps and milestones for the shares of renewable energy sources (RES) in heating and cooling sector. This strategy will be included in the first revision of the NECP.

Despite the reduction in primary energy supply, final energy demand is projected to be almost stable. The main driver in this case is increased electricity demand, which in turn is generated by more efficient gas-fired plants and renewable energy technologies. Continued electrification of the heating and cooling sector, as well as the considerable volume of electricity consumed in the transport sector have a significant role in the growth of electricity demand. The contribution of fossil fuels decreases with time. Furthermore, the total contribution of solar thermal in the electricity supply sector and the heating and cooling sector is projected to meet the yearly target for increasing RES in heating and cooling sector from 2021 to 2030, however it will be important to gather more data for heat-pumps and also develop a calculation methodology for renewable cooling.  Useful insights can be provided through a comparison of the final energy demand with the primary energy supply. Even though final energy demand undergoes a moderate increase between 2020 and 2030, primary energy supply illustrates a moderate decrease. This is an indication of improved energy efficiency. Specifically, when final energy demand is measured as a share of primary energy supply, total energy efficiency amounts to 72% in 2020; this value increases to 78% in 2030. 020040060080010001200140016001800200022002021202220232024202520262027202820292030GasolineDieselAviation FuelHeating Oil/light fuel oilLiquefied Petroleum GasElectricityPet cokeBiomass & BiofuelsGeothermalSolar ThermalDistrict Heating/Cooling64  2.1.2.4. iv. Estimated trajectories on bioenergy demand, disaggregated between heat, electricity and transport, and on biomass supply by feedstocks and origin (distinguishing between domestic production and imports). For forest biomass, an assessment of its source and impact on the LULUCF sink The estimated trajectories for bioenergy demand, disaggregated between heat, electricity and transport as estimated with the PPM scenario up to 2030 are presented in Figure 2.8. Currently there is domestic production of biogas and no domestic production of biofuels. It is however foreseen that with the financial support schemes under preparation, local production of biofuels will occur from waste. This quantity however it is currently not possible to be estimated. No forest biomass is used or foreseen to be used in Cyprus; therefore there is no impact on LULUCF sink.   Figure 2.8: Trajectories for bioenergy demand, disaggregated between heat, electricity and transport 2.1.2.5. v. Where applicable, other national trajectories and objectives, including those that are long term or sectoral (e.g. share of renewable energy in district heating, renewable energy use in buildings, renewable energy produced by cities, renewable energy communities and renewables self-consumers, energy recovered from the sludge acquired through the treatment of wastewater) Regarding renewable energy use in buildings, as of 1.1.2017, a new legislation was applied for a minimum percentage of primary energy consumption to be covered by RES, indicating that at least 25% of primary energy consumption to be covered by RES for new single-family homes, 3% for new multi-apartment residential buildings, and 7% for non-residential ones. It is envisaged that the new buildings will be Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) by 31st of December and thus implies that all the new buildings will be covered at least by 25% of RES. In practice more of the systems installed over-exceed this capacity since it makes more sense with the existing net-metering scheme to cover almost 100% of Energy needs of each individual household, assuming that there is enough space on the roof to install such system. 01020304050607020172018201920202021202220232024202520262027202820292030ktoe Transport (Final Energy Demand)H&C (Final Energy Demand)Electricity (Primary energy)65   Installation of solar water heater for the production of hot water, especially in residential buildings, is very popular and is expected to continue and enhanced in the future by introducing new innovative technologies.  Regarding district heating or cooling several studies where done 26,27, while the studies initially showed that there was a technical potential after the impact assessment results and further analysis performed by another study28 it was shown that the economic potential does not exist for such systems. Moreover, as it was discussed during the concerted action for RES, it seems that in some regions in other MS, that already have district heating networks, consumers tend to prefer other more efficient options such as the use of heat pumps. This indicates that the economic potential is moving towards the use of heat-pumps and not to district heating and cooling. Hence more actions should be taken regarding the use of more RES in the electrification of heating and cooling sector (e.g. use of PV). This is especially true for Cyprus, where the heating degree days are being reduced, the cooling needs are increased and no waste cooling exists.  More details in section 3.1.2 (vi)
