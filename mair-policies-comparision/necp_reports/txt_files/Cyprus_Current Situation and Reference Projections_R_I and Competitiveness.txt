4.6. Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness 4.6.1. i. Current situation of the low-carbon-technologies sector and, to the extent possible, its position on the global market (that analysis is to be carried out at Union or global level) According to Smart Specialization Strategy, Cyprus has a high level of research potential in human capital that should be exploited to the greatest extent possible. This potential must include Cypriot scientists living and working outside Cyprus and foreigners working in Cyprus. Additionally, the development of public and private universities the last 10 years has significantly improved the research facilities. Especially, the establishment of research centres of KOIOS and FOSS by University of Cyprus and the establishment of Cyprus Institute have provided useful infrastructure dedicated research and innovation in energy and climate. Recent developments in establishing centres of excellence in research such as the Research Centre of Excellence on Interactive media, Smart systems and Emerging technologies (RISE), the Cyprus Marine and Maritime Institute (CMMI/ MARITEC- X) and the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East  Climate and Atmosphere Research Centre (EMME-CARE), are expected to further enhance infrastructure. 4.6.2. ii. Current level of public and, where available, private research and innovation spending on low-carbon-technologies, current number of patents, and current number of researchers The current allocation of national funds for projects that have started in the year of 2018, within the frame of RESTART 2016-m in total. It must be highlighted that the program has been designed and is managed by Research and Innovation  Figure 4.15 shows the allocation of the aforementioned budget for year 2018, into various categories, of which the highest funds received are for research in biological/human studies and on IT. Energy sector ranks third on funding engagement, whilst transport and environment sectors have much lower allocations (also see Table 3.10). 183  The total a breakdown of the national R&D expenditure for 2016 and 2017 and how is projected for 2023 is mentioned in paragraph 2.5.  As of the number of patents filed in, they appear to be low so far.  Figure 4.15: Allocation of national funds RESTART 2016-2020, for projects started within the year of 2018 4.6.3. iii.

Description of energy subsidies, including for fossil fuels Energy subsidies in Cyprus are divided in two main categories: Subsidies provided to support Renewable Energy Technologies, and subsidies in oil prices.  The long-term subsidies in RES technologies arise for the various PPAs that the RES and Energy Efficiency National Fund had signed in the period 2004-2015 due to old support schemes.  Table 4.20 shows the broken-down cost, by technologies and the actual subsidy payed to renewable energy producers for the last 10 years. As explained, is very difficult to estimate the actually prices, since there are no real market conditions at the moment in Cyprus. Since the market is expected to operate in 2021, the future subsidy prices (Table 4.7) will be re-evaluated after the first revision of the NECP. Table 4.20: Subsidy paid to RES Producers in million Euro per Year   Solar Wind Biogas* 2008 0.03 0  2009 0.135 0  2010 0.055 0 0.122 2011 1.365 3.607 0.696 2012 2.369 2.223 0 2013 4.402 5.725 0 2014 9.624 10.433 0.266 2015 11.349 19.637 1.565 2016 14.005 24.815 1.783 2017 11.957 18.299 1.222 2018 9.887 14.722 0.718 187  *In 2013-2014 the avoidance cost of electricity the so called market Price, was higher than FiT Price for Biomass Projects. The excess amount was returned to the RES and Energy Efficiency National Fund. As far as it concerns the PPM scenario (i.e. without the operation of the Electricity Market), s, there is a provision to compensate with less subsidy if the projects exceed a certain limit of production (i.e. 2 wind farms will receive no subsidy after their first 7000 hours of operation, for all the production that exceeds a certain threshold, while the new Wind Parks will receive no subsidy (at least 30MW). In that respect it is expected that the Average subsidy will be reduced by 20% for all the energy produced from Wind Parks. As mentioned before since 2015, all the new RES Commercial projects for Electricity production will receive the so-called avoidance cost, which corresponds to an ideal market price. Once electricity market will operate (in 2021), the RES projects will receive only the market price based on the market rules. The current and historical selling price for electricity produced by renewable sources (avoidance cost) is available at Electricity Authority of Cyprus website81. The details of the support scheme and all the relevant revisions are available on MECI website82. Assuming ideal market conditions and taking into consideration the evolution and the cost of technologies, it is estimated that the electricity prices (i.e. Avoidance cost) will be reduced when the natural Gas will be available in 2022 and the cost will drop in the range of 85 Euro/MWh. This Average price will gradually increase, up to 94 Euro/MWh towards 2030.  Figure 4.16: Electricity prices in the PPM Scenario, assuming ideal market conditions However, is hard to estimate the actual price of subsidy since in real market conditions it is expected than RES technologies will compete between them (i.e. Solar and Wind as well as Biomass). The energy modelling used was not able to provide detail pricing per half hour over the whole horizon of 2030. In that respect this analysis will be done by using more detail models in the future (PLEXOS model can be used).                                                            81 https://www.eac.com.cy/EL/EAC/RenewableEnergySources/Pages/resenergypurcheac.aspx. 82 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/EnergySe.nsf/All/822B56F7E4D67965C225849B0034558 2?OpenDocument 188  As mentioned above, since 2015 onwards all new commercial RES projects do not receive any subsidy from the RES and Energy Efficiency National Fund. The same applies to the self-consumption scheme and net-billing scheme. As far as it concerns the subsidies in oil prices a short summary was provided during the public consultations from Ministry of Finance83 (Table 4.21).
