74  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 2.6. Research, innovation and competitiveness  2.6.1. Current situation in research, innovation and boosting competitiveness and in the technology sector Current R&I and industry policies support R&I activities in different areas, however the development and implementation of clean technologies is not supported in a targeted way for the purposes of reaching specific energy efficiency and decarbonisation targets. Research capacity, i.e. the number of scientific employees (scientists, technical and service staff) in Latvia (full-time equivalent  FTE) in 2017 was 5378, which was 0.62 % of the total number of employees in Latvia, which is almost twice less than the EU average (1.39 %) (EUROSTAT, 2017). Out of the total Latvian scientific staff (FTE) approximately 1000 or 18 % are involved in research in priority areas of the Energy Union119  energy, construction, climate, environmental engineering technologies. In comparison with the 50 countries registered in the European Patent Office, in 2018, Latvia was ranked 39th with 6.2 patent applications per 1 million residents based on total patent activity indicators depending on the population. In the period from 2014 to 2017, 11 or 17 % of the patent applications of 63 Latvian residents registered with the European Patent Office120 related to smart energy and clean technologies (Engineering technologies, lighting, heat supply; Electricity; Mechanics, materials, and other engineering technologies). Patents registered for innovative biomass combustion equipment, biofuels, wind and solar energy technologies.  Taking into account current development trends, global challenges and potential opportunities of the industry towards production of high value added products, NIPG2020 has set the goal to promote the structural changes of economy in favour of production of goods and services with higher profitability, including the increase in the share of industry, modernization of industry and services and a broader range of exports. Several new initiatives have been started and implemented for fostering the innovation and business discovery process:  promotion of development of the start-up system  updating the regulation, support of a one-stop-shop agency for start-ups, incl. support for participation in international industry conferences and bilateral meetings with investors; ensuring the availability of risk capital funding, reliefs  start-up visas  to attract highly qualified young employees from third countries, which offers simplified conditions for receiving an EU blue card;  State capital companies innovation platform  created in 2018 as a cooperation platform for the implementation of inter-branch innovation projects for the purposes of promoting an increase in investments of Latvian State capital companies in research and development in order to create new innovative and export-capable products and services. The platform was created by the Ministry of Economics in close cooperation                                                        119National Information System of Research Activity (NISRA), Registry of Persons Elected in Academic Positions in Scientific Institutions, (data as at 08.08.2019.)

At the same time, measures under various aid programmes are helping improve the export capacity of companies and promote the entry into new export markets  support for undertaking to participate in international exhibitions using individual stands in foreign countries and in conferences, seminars abroad by means of stands, to participate in trade missions o foreign countries, to take part in visits by senior Latvian officials to foreign countries organised by IDAL, to man national stands organised by IDAL, to organise business travel events in Latvia, and to assess the  conformity of production facilities and products. 2.6.2. Measures to promote the implementation of innovative technologies The development of the sector of clean technologies is directly related to R&I capacity  human capital and public and private sector investments in R&I.  The most important measures funded by EU structural funds, which are aimed at the development of new technologies and innovations, knowledge and technology transfer, commercialisation of research results, creation of products and services with higher added value and improvement of competitiveness of companies, including in energy efficiency and decarbonisation areas, are: the practical research programme, competence centres, technology transfer programme and cluster programme. The practical research programme is aimed at the implementation of research and technology development projects aimed at commercialisation. The implementation of 118 projects started on 1 January 2019, 17 or 14 % of which are being implemented in areas relating to smart energy. Eight competence centres are up and running under  the competence centres measure, including the 121, which provides support to experimental and industrial research. Implementation of a total of 191 projects had been started in all competence centres by 31 December 2018. By 31 December 2018, 174 studies had been completed and the products created as a result of them are being manufactured or are expected to be manufactured in the very near future. 149 economic operators received support to introduce new products and technologies. The purpose of the technology transfer system is to promote knowledge and technology transfer and commercialisation of research results. 41 projects for the development of a feasibility study and a commercialisation strategy had been approved by the end of 2018 under the programme, 24 of which were supported for commercialisation of research results. In parallel, the cooperation of research organisations with undertakings is being promoted, with scouts from the Department of Technology being involved in the process. Technology scouts know research organisations, their staff and the services they provide. Scouts in research organisations identify potentially marketable research projects and help develop them. Currently, IDAL has seven technology scouts: one at the University of Latvia, one at the Riga Technical University and five in the following sectors: bio economy, smart energy, biomedicine, smart materials, information and communication technologies.  The cluster programme is implemented for the purposes of promoting cooperation between undertakings and research, education, municipal and other institutions operating in                                                       121 Competence Centre of Smart Engineering Systems, Transport and Energy, http://www.vitekc.lv/  76  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 interrelated industries, a national economy niche, a group of products or services or a value chain, or a region at local and international level with a view to improving the capacity of undertakings to create products and services with high added value and to promote their export capacity. 14 clusters are receiving support under the programme, two of which operate directly in the field of clean technologies (Cleantech and Green and clean technology cluster). Funds to assist 36 innovative energy efficiency and RES smart technology by means of demonstration projects were granted by the end of 2018 within EAAI covering both direct reduction of GHG emissions and indirect reduction of GHG emissions as a result of project demonstration and the multiplier effect. Indirect GHG reductions are very important, as reaching climate targets requires gradual, comprehensive and significant changes in the Greenhouse Gas Emissions  and encourage an increasing number of people to, if not transition to low energy consumption buildings, at least implement energy efficiency measures, with a significant investment multiplier effect in terms of the further reduction of GHG emissions in the building sector. In the waste management sector the plan is to provide funding for recycling biodegradable waste by using anaerobic digestion technology for producing biogas, thus also ensuring recovery and efficient use of methane through implementation in the 20142020 programming period. For the development of the internal energy market to strengthen  internal energy security and for reduce the use of fossil energy sources, projects for waste recovery with energy recovery for infrastructure development are being implemented. 2.6.3. Current expenditure  The development of the Latvian R&I system has been considerably delayed by low levels of funding for research  the target indicator set in the National Reform Programme of Latvia for the Implementation of the EU 2020 Strategy122 for investments in R&D for 2020 is 1.5 % of GDP, while investments in R&D have not reached 0.7 % of GDP in the last 5 years, which is a significant obstacle to the development of R&I in any economic sector. At the same time, compared to the EU average trend, Latvia has a considerably high share of public funding contributions and a small amount of private sector investments in the R&I energy area.                                                        122 http://polsis.mk.gov.lv/documents/4294 77  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 Figure 38.
