Dimension Energy efficiency i. Current primary and final energy consumption in the economy and per sector (including industry, residential, service and transport) The environmental impact of generating and using energy depends not only on the amount of energy consumed, but also on the type of resources used: primary or secondary, fossil or renewable. Actual energy needs in Wallonia are represented by gross inland (energy) consumption (GIC) (45). Unlike the more commonly used term GIC includes losses associated with the transformation and distribution of energy, as well as the fuel consumption of power plants. The graph below shows that overall Wallonia has consumed less energy each year since 2004, with a total reduction of 15% since 1990. This reduction in consumption is reflected in nuclear production, which fell from 65 TWh in 1990 to 58 TWh in 2017. This reduction in the nuclear share has been offset by the rise in renewables since the early 2000s, which now account for 12% of gross inland consumption. -sufficiency is therefore increasing each year.  Figure 11: Trend in gross inland consumption by energy carrier between 1990 and 2016  CIB (TWh PCI) GIC (TWh LCV) max en 2004 maximum in 2004 min en 2015 minimum in 2015 -16% p.r. à 1990 -14% p.r. à 2010 -0.5% p.r. à 2016 -16% compared with 1990 -14% compared with 2010 -0.5% compared with 2016 Solides Solid fuels Produits pétroliers Oil products Gaz naturel Natural gas Nucléaire Nuclear Electricité Electricity Autres Other CIB total Total GIC                                                            45 phical area. 85  However, the graph shows that 2015 was the first year with a net import balance for electricity since 1990. This means that Wallonia did not generate more electricity than it needed in 2015 and that overall it purchased more electricity from its neighbours than it sold to them. In 2017, Wallonia once again recorded a net export balance for electricity of 6 TWh. In parallel with the changing energy needs in Wallonia, the trend in final consumption reveals the links between the economic sectors responsible for that consumption and the consumption by energy carrier. For example, different sources of energy are used for transport purposes and for manufacturing industrial products. Changes in the breakdown by economic sector therefore change the breakdown by energy carrier. This is illustrated in the two graphs below.   Figure 12: Trend in total final consumption (46) by economic sector and energy carrier  SOLIDES  GAZ DERIVES SOLID FUELS  DERIVED GASES COMBUSTIBLES PETROLIERS OIL-BASED HEATING FUELS GAZ NATUREL NATURAL GAS CARBURANTS PETROLIERS OIL-BASED MOTOR FUELS ELECTRICITÉ  ELECTRICITY  AUTRES ENERGIES OTHER ENERGY SOURCES Indice 100 Index 100 INDUSTRIE INDUSTRY LOGEMENT HOUSING TRANSPORT TRANSPORT                                                            46 Total final consumption includes non-energy uses, i.e. energy used as a raw material in manufacturing processes. 86 TERTIAIRE TERTIARY AGRICULTURE AGRICULTURE  It is apparent from the second graph that industry, transport and buildings (tertiary and housing combined) account for the bulk of consumption. In chronological terms, it is clear that, although industry continues to be the most energy-intensive sector in Wallonia, it now accounts for only 35% of final consumption, whereas this figure was 52% in 1990. This fall has led to a reduction in the consumption of solid fuels (first graph), from 24% in 1990 to just 4% in 2017, which were primarily used in the steel industry. In addition, given the high level of CO2 emissions associated with this type of fuel, the industries using it have prioritised its elimination and/or replacement. The transport sector, which accounted for only 19% of energy consumption in 1990, currently consumes 29% of the energy used in Wallonia. shows that the share of oil-based motor fuels increased from 18% in 1990 to 27% in 2017. The 2% difference in 2017 relates to biofuels and renewable electricity used in the transport sector. Oil-based heating fuels have followed the same trend as solid fuels, albeit to a lesser extent. These two families of fuels have been partly replaced by natural gas and electricity. The use of electricity has increased more than natural gas in the residential sector, even though the latter seems to be a more appropriate substitute fuel for many applications. This is particularly because housing density is low in several areas of Wallonia, which limits development of the natural gas distribution system. These data also highlight the e on oil-based products, which form the energy source in 42% of cases.  ii. Current potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling  A. Estimated potential primary energy savings Based on defined economic potential, primary energy is calculated using a conversion factor of 2.5 for electricity and 1 for other energy carriers. With regard to cogeneration, this results in primary energy savings of around 15% of technical potential, i.e. 4,155 GWh. Primary energy savings for waste energy are 93.12 GWh. Total primary energy savings are estimated at around 4,288 GWh. This figure could increase in the event of more favourable economic parameters encouraging investments in cogeneration and recovery of high-temperature waste heat in electricity generation. Demand for heating and cooling could be met through high-efficiency cogeneration, including domestic micro-cogeneration, and through district heating and cooling systems. Demand for heating that could be met through high-efficiency cogeneration, including domestic micro-cogeneration, and through district heating and cooling systems is included under substitutable heating. This relates to applications operated at temperatures between 50°C and 250°C. Substitutable heating requirements are identified in the following table by sector (housing, tertiary and industry) and by use (DHW = domestic hot water).  87 Sector Process heat (high t°) Heating Space heating DHW Cooking Other uses TOTAL Total heating requirements Substitutable heating Share of substitutable heating Tertiary - 6,923.6 - 785.1 7.4 5,895.3 13,611.3 7,716.0 7,708.6 56.6% Housing - 20,180.8 2,245.7 3,608.3 878.2 4,187.5 31,100.5 26,913.1 26,034.9 83.7% Industry 19,585.2 11,319.0 - - - 10,725.7 41,629.9 30,904.2 11,319.0 27.2% Total 19,585.2 38,423.4 2,245.7 4,393.4 885.5 20,808.5 86,341.7 65,533.2 45,062.5 52.2% Table 1: Heating requirements   Total heating requirements (65.5 TWh) account for 76% of total energy consumption in the three sectors, which illustrates the importance of these needs in the energy balance. Over half (52.2%) of final energy consumption in the three sectors is substitutable heating requirements, i.e. a total of 45 TWh. Housing accounts for the largest share of this figure (26.0 TWh, 58%), followed by industry (11.3 TWh, 25%) and finally the tertiary sector (7.7 TWh, 17%). Cooling needs are 20.8 GWh for housing, 935 GWh for the tertiary sector (including 540 GWh of substitutable cooling, i.e. requirements that can be met by district cooling systems) and 830 GWh for industry (including 128 GWh of substitutable cooling). According to the information available at the time of the study, there are no facilities in Wallonia capable of producing recoverable cooling that can be routed through a distribution system or consumed on site. The only sectors with cooling potential the chemical and food industries.  B. Estimated potential  Cogeneration potential Technical potential of cogeneration The reporting methodology based on the requirements set out in Directive 2004/8/EC on the promotion of cogeneration was used together with the most recent available data in order to assess the technical potential of cogeneration. This exercise revealed that the potential thermal power is 529 MWth, of which 76% is in the industrial sector, with the corresponding thermal production being estimated at 3,172 GWh. The potential electrical power is 428 MWe, of which 81% is in the industrial sector, with the corresponding electricity generation being 2,621 GWh.

Figure 14: Economic potential of cogeneration  en MWe in MWe Potentiel technique Technical potential Potentiel économique Economic potential tertiaire tertiary industrie industry  It should be noted that cogeneration potential depends on various external or economic factors that can direct investments, such as the price per tonne of CO2, support mechanism or choice of payback period.

Table 3: Economic potential of waste heat  GWh GWh TRS (années) Simple payback period (years) Chaleur récupérable cumulée Cumulative recoverable heat Potential technique total Total technical potential TRS=2 Simple payback period=2 years  90 With a simple payback period constraint of two years or less, the economic potential is zero. Payback periods for systems recovering waste heat are currently very long. Given current energy prices, the ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle) subsector is not profitable without aid. - Low temperature The total economic potential is estimated at 93.12 GWh/year, which is equivalent to 31% of the total technical potential for the sectors studied. The figure below shows the results for each sector and the share of technical potential that would be economically viable.

Most (67%) of these systems are owned by public and rural bodies, as for the most part they were constructed under the Wood Energy and Rural Development Plan aimed at supporting the development of rural municipalities. Among these systems, 42 are powered by biomass, 2 by natural gas, 1 by deep geothermal energy and 1 by waste energy. These 46 systems annually produce 402 GWh and distribute 190 GWh of energy. They have a total length of 69.55 km, with over 90% of them having a length of less than 500 m. Technical potential Qualitative estimates of the technical potential of district heating systems are based on a bottom-up approach which assumes that conditions are favourable to the development of a district heating system. When the study was conducted, data were available at municipality level and could not therefore be used to extrapolate favourable conditions at district or street level, for example. Detailed data about heating requirements have been built up over time through the EPB legislation, in relation to new housing or housing being renovated under planning permission, or through the housing energy certification system. Likewise, the future energy certification system for non-residential buildings will enable detailed information to be gathered about heating and cooling needs in the tertiary sector. 91 Economic potential District heating systems offer development potential in terms of recovering waste heat and using renewable energy. However, new district heating systems must be able to adapt to changing conditions (loss of a source of waste heat, extension of the system, greater density) through a hub-and-spoke arrangement, variable flow rates, possibilities of adding extra power to the system, etc. There must be a minimum heating requirement before a district heating system can be envisaged. In view of the energy performance of new housing units, joint projects with other infrastructure (housing + offices/crèches/residential homes/hospitals/etc.) are essential. District heating systems can make financial sense in the long term, but each investment decision must be examined on a case-by-case basis using the results of a feasibility study.  C. Strategies, policies and measures that can be adopted to 2030 in order to harness potential The following cumulative financial support is available for cogeneration in Wallonia:  investment aid;  production aid in the form of green certificates for high-efficiency cogeneration, i.e. where CO2 is reduced by at least 10% compared with the benchmarks;  tax deduction by the Federal Government. The following cumulative support is available from the Walloon Government for the recovery of waste heat and for district heating and cooling systems:  investment aid;  tax deduction by the Federal Government. This budget priorities and the need for compliance with EU State aid rules, so that project owners can plan for the long term and make accurate profitability calculations. In order to help develop cogeneration, district heating and cooling systems and waste heat recovery, Wallonia has already proposed the following measures. - Sectoral agreements targeted at the most energy-intensive businesses. These agreements are based on a commitment to improve energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions between 2005 and 2020, and require businesses to carry out a comprehensive audit of their facilities with the aim of systematically identifying potential for the on-site recovery of waste heating and cooling. The feasibility of fossil and biomass cogeneration is studied wherever possible. - A renewable energy and energy efficiency service with the following tasks:  advise the target audience on cogeneration techniques, methods for recovering waste energy and options for installing district systems;  offer tailored advice to project owners;  help managers in the same sector to exchange best practices in relation to waste energy recovery;  make information tools and calculations available in order to ensure the success of projects;  train multipliers in these techniques and methods (both basic and advanced training). - An obligation to study new installations or installations to be renovated with an installed capacity of over 20 MWth (in line with the requirement under Article 14(5) of Directive 2012/27/EU). - Wallonia is preparing to review its auditor approval systems with a view to improving their quality and further formalising them in relation to the audit methodologies used. - Following an analysis, Wallonia plans to reduce the energy market barriers for low-voltage cogenerated electricity so that producers can resell any surplus that they have not used themselves. 92 - It is planned to adapt the categories of environmental permits so that the development of cogeneration projects involving biomass gasification can be encouraged due to these facilities not being regarded as Class 1, which seems an inappropriate categorisation given the actual impact of wood gasification technology on the environment (see point 3.1.2.(i)).  iii. Projections considering existing energy efficiency policies, measures and programmes as described in point 1.2. for primary and final energy consumption for each sector at least until 2030  Final energy consumption shows an upward trend between 2015 and 2030, mainly due to transport.  Figure 17: Trend in final energy consumption by sector  Consommation finale énergétique totale par secteur (GWh) Total final energy consumption by sector (GWh) Résidentiel Residential Tertiaire Tertiary Industrie Industry Agriculture Agriculture Transport Transport WEM WEM  Despite this increase, primary energy consumption falls to 2030 due to the closure of nuclear power plants, which will be partly replaced by CCGT and renewable electricity plants and relatively high imports.  iv. Cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements resulting from national calculations, in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU Articles 4 and 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings require Member States to set minimum energy performance requirements with a view to achieving the cost-optimal balance between the investments involved and the energy costs saved throughout the lifecycle of the building. A methodology framework for calculating cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements has been provided by the Commission so that Member States can compare their results. The results of this comparison and the data used to reach these results should be regularly reported to the Commission (no longer than five years). These reports should enable the Commission to assess and report on the progress of Member States in reaching cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements. 93 The first report (COZEB I) was submitted in 2013, with the second (CO II) in July 2018; these reports must be acknowledged by the Government.  Conclusions of CO II As stipulated in the guidelines, the gap (expressed in %) between the cost-optimal levels and the current requirements is calculated for each reference building. The gaps are weighted on the basis of their individual representativeness. The total of these weighted gaps divided by the number of buildings in the category in question gives the weighted average gap between the requirements and the cost-optimal level of each building. Checks are then carried out to ensure that this weighted average gap is not less than -15% (gaps greater than -15% are shown in red in the tables below), i.e. that the requirements are not lacking in ambition. However, the Commission allows requirements that are more ambitious than the cost-optimal level to be set.

This requirement is remarkably close to the cost-optimal (CO) improvement level and does not therefore need to be tightened up.

The optimal values obtained for the reference buildings are, however, systematically lower than the 2017 requirement level. The conclusions on the requirement levels for walls of new buildings could therefore also be applied to existing buildings subject to major renovation.

The optimal values obtained for the reference buildings are, however, systematically lower than the 2017 requirement level. The conclusions on the requirement levels for walls of new buildings could therefore also be applied to existing buildings subject to major renovation.

This requirement is close to the cost-optimal improvement level and does not therefore need to be tightened up.

Based on the criteria and the need to review the requirement levels by building element from 2021 onwards, the level could be increased so that it is in line with, or higher than, the cost-optimal level.  95 Table 10 - Cost-optimal level of roofs - New buildings Roofs Category of reference buildings  Requirement 2017/2021  CO  Weighted average gap New single-family houses 0.24 0.18 -36% New apartment blocks 0.2 -20% New offices 0.2 -20% New educational buildings 0.2 -20%  The weighted average optimal U of new roofs is systematically more efficient (around 20% for offices, schools and apartment blocks, and up to 36% for single-family houses) than the Umax 2017 requirement in force (0.24 W/m²K). Based on the criteria and the need to review the requirement levels by building element from 2021 onwards, the level could be increased so that it is in line with, or higher than, the cost-optimal level.

This is an indication that the construction methods and heat production systems currently available on the market allow residential housing to be built that is generally more efficient and less costly (over a period of 30 years) than housing that strictly complies with the overall performance requirements of the EPB regulations. The weighted average optimal Ew of 46 and Espec of 82 kWh/m²/year of new single-family houses are remarkably close to the requirement levels (Ew 45 and Espec 85 kWh/m²/year) stipulated for 2021. As regards the overall performance indicators (K and Ew) that apply to new non-residential buildings, the weighted average optimal Ew of offices (Ew 64) and the requirement level in force in 2017 for this segment (Ew 65) are almost exactly the same. For new schools, the weighted average optimal Ew of 48 is significantly more efficient than the 2017 requirement and very close to the 2021 requirement (Ew 45) stipulated for this segment. This is an indication that buildings in this segment can be constructed with a much higher level of efficiency than required by the current regulations while achieving cost-optimal levels. This trend is confirmed by the recent rise in the number of educational buildings constructed on the basis of passive-energy or very-low-energy standards. The weighted average optimal K of both offices (K41) and schools (K32) is not more than 15% below the 2017/2021 requirements (K35) as regards insulation of the building envelope. It can be concluded from these results that the overall requirement levels for new buildings in 2017 are lacking in ambition with regard to the current cost-optimal levels. Tightening the requirements in 2021 to achieve NZE (Nearly Zero Energy) performance will reduce this gap and the requirements will then be cost-optimal in accordance with the current results. However, these results will be reviewed every five years, as stipulated by the Directive, which will allow changes in construction costs due to technological advances to be taken into account.
