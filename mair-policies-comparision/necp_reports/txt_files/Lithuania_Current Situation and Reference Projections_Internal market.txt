4. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 219    4.5 Dimension internal energy market  Electricity interconnectivity In Lithuania, the level of interconnection of the electricity system already exceeds the EU 2030 target. Since the connectivity objective has been achieved, no measures are foreseen for this purpose. However, taking into account that the Lithuanian electricity system does not work in synchronous mode with CENs, the main objective in the electricity sector is the integration of Lithuania and the Baltic States into CENs in a synchronous mode. This is further described in section 4.5.2.  The maximum capacity in 2030 is estimated at 2389 MW. In this case, the nominal capacity of interconnectors at peak times is expected to be 111% in 2030 and the nominal capacity of interconnectors in terms of installed renewable energy generation capacity is expected to be 91%.

The gas transmission system consists of gas transmission pipelines, 2 gas compressor stations, 65 gas distribution stations, 3 metering stations, gas pipeline anti-corrosion protection equipment, data transmission and communication systems and other properties attributed to the transmission system. The pipelines in operation are 2,115 km in length and 100 to 1,220 mm in diameter. The longest-running gas pipelines were built in 1961. Most of the transmission system has a design pressure of 54 bar.  Depending on the price and contracts, natural gas supply companies choose the source for purchasing natural gas, i.e. they are supplied either from Russia by pipeline across the Lithuanian-Baltic border or via                                                            117 Source: Plan for the development of 400-110 kV networks of the Lithuanian power system in 2019-2028 https://www.litgrid.eu/index.php/tinklo-pletra/lietuvos-elektros-perdavimo-tinklu-10-metu-pletros-planas-/3850 4.

Other projects of local importance are described in the 10-year network development plan of the natural gas transmission system operator119. Basically, the key after 2022 will be to maintain a reliable system, as no new infrastructure projects for diversification or additional gas flows are envisaged.  Electricity and gas markets, energy prices  Electricity According to the NRA, in 2018 there were 1,621 market players in electricity generation (1,617 in 2017), 1 in transmission, 6 in distribution and 5 in public supply. From 2017 to 2018, electricity consumption in Lithuania increased by 3.2%, from 12.5 to 12.9 TWh: the amount of electricity supplied to consumers increased by 4.7%, the technological costs of the networks decreased by 10.0%, the amount of electricity needed to charge the Kruonis Pumped Storage Plant (Kruonis PSP) decreased by 12.5%. The installed capacity of power plants edged up by 0.4% in 2018 against 2017, from 3,662.9 to 3,679.2 MW . There is one company active in the electricity transmission market, AB LITGRID. In 2018, 11.7 TWh of electricity were supplied to the transmission networks, an increase of 3.9% on 2017. The amount of electricity transferred over transmission networks grew by 3.9% in 2018 compared to 2017, from 10,809.3 to 11,236.2 GWh, while losses in electricity networks and demand for electricity for own use grew by 3.9%, from 421.4 to 437.9 GWh. At the end of 2018, there were 6 market players in the electricity distribution market: AB Achema, AB  Tinklas and UAB Dainavos elektra, which were engaged in distribution activities in their corporate territories, and AB Energijos skirstymo operatorius carrying out distribution activities in the rest of the Lithuanian territory. In 2018 compared to 2017, electricity received into the distribution grids grew by 4.0%, from 9.9 to 10.3 TWh. The amount of electricity distributed to customers connected to the medium voltage (MV) network grew by 3.8%, from 2.87 to 2.98 TWh, while the amount distributed to customers connected to the low voltage (LV) network rose by 3.9%, from 6.40 to 6.65 TWh. Technological losses and own needs in distribution networks grew by 0.7% in 2018 compared to 2017, from 614.7 to 618.8 GWh. As of February 2019, there were 365 participants on the Nord Pool power exchange, 21 of which were legal entities registered in Lithuania. In 2018 compared to 2017, electricity exchange sales grew by 57.7%, from 3 637.7 to 5 737.1 GWh.

Gas In the natural gas sector, the NRA regulated 44 entities in 2018. Transmission, distribution, storage, LNG regasification, supply and market operator activities are subject to licences or authorisations. At the end of 2018, the licences issued by VERT were held by: the natural gas TSO AB Amber Grid, AB Energijos skirstymo operatorius, AB Achema, UAB Intergas, UAB Fortum Heat Lietuva, the natural gas DSO AB Agrofirma Josvainiai, GET Baltic. 33 companies were licensed to supply natural gas, of which 15 were active. In 2018, VERT issued 9 natural gas supply authorisations, revoked 2 natural gas supply authorisations and suspended 2 natural gas supply authorisations. Natural gas consumption decreased in Lithuania in 2018, while natural gas transit flows to Russia grew. In 2018, imports of natural gas amounted to 23,451 GWh, which is about 14% less than in 2017 (27,374 GWh). 50,152 GWh of natural gas (0.4% more than in 2017) were transported and 13,894 GWh delivered over the transmission system in 2018. In 2018, consumption in Lithuania amounted to 22 320 GWh, which is 8.13% less than in 2017.                                                                120 https://www.regula.lt/Puslapiai/naujienos/2018-metai/2018-lapkritis/2018-11-30/komisija-patvirtino-2019-m-elektros- energijos-tarifus-buitiniams-vartotojams.aspx 4.

Heat and cooling In 2018, 18,223 of the 27,833 buildings supplied by district heating systems were multi-apartment buildings (about 701,000 apartments), which accounted for around 72% of the total heat sales. The remaining consumers are budgetary institutions (14%) and business organisations (14%).                                                            121 https://www.regula.lt/dujos/Puslapiai/duju-rinkos-apzvalga/rinkos-stebesena.aspx 122 http://www.regula.lt/dujos/Puslapiai/duju-kainos/importo-kainos.aspx 4. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 230   49 State-licensed heat supply enterprises were operating in Lithuania, supplying 8.98 TWh of heat to the networks. There were 17 unregulated and 27 regulated IHPs in the DH production market, which sold 30.8% of the total heat supplied to the grid in 2018. At the end of 2018, installations with condensing economisers operated by heat supply companies and independent heat producers (IHP) had a total thermal capacity of nearly 1,600 MW. Of these, approximately 600 MW were installed in IHP boilers and power plants. In 2018, the maximum heat demand of central heat supply systems was 3,128 MW and the minimum was 388 MW.     Fig. 4.5.3.4. Changes in the average price of heat in district heating (excl. VAT) in Lithuania123  Private households not connected to central heat supply consume on average around 700,000 toe of fuels per year for heat production. This is almost the same amount of fuel as that consumed in 2018 by DH companies and independent heat producers (810,000 toe). Firewood and wood waste dominated the fuel mix of heat production in households in 2018, accounting for 72%, while natural gas accounted for 15% and solid fuels (coal, peat and briquettes) for 8% of all fuels. About 88%of all fuel is used for space heating and hot water and 12 percent for cooking. The forecast of developments in the heat and cooling market of Lithuania, including prices, with the existing policies and measures at least until 2040 (incl. 2030), has not been assessed.
