Energy Transmission Infrastructure i. Key characteristics of the existing transmission infrastructure for electricity and gas Gas Transmission System Gas Networks Ireland (GNI) operates both the transmission (2,427 km) and distribution networks (11,527 km) in Ireland. The transmission network transports gas from the entry points at Moffat, Inch and Bellanaboy to the distribution networks and connected loads (e.g. gas-fired power generators).  d Kingdom and allows for gas imports to Ireland via two subsea interconnectors (IC1 and IC2). The existing interconnectors do not allow Ireland to export gas to the United Kingdom as they are unidirectional. The landfall installations for the interconnectors entering Ireland are located close to Loughshinny for IC1 and Gormanston for IC2 in the East of Ireland. The Inch entry point connects Kinsale and Seven Heads gas fields to the onshore GNI network; the Bellanaboy entry point connects the Corrib gas field to the onshore GNI network. The delivers gas to Northern Ireland via the Scotland Northern Ireland Pipeline (SNIP). The South North Pipeline (SNP) is an onshore gas transmission pipeline from Gormanston to Northern Ireland.  The distribution network currently delivers gas to circa 700,000 customers across Ireland and the network.    196  Figure 19: Map of natural gas infrastructure     197 Table 31: Major gas network infrastructure in Ireland Infrastructure Function Capacity Moffat Entry Point (Scotland, UK) Entry point to GNI system serving Ireland via the onshore system in Scotland and sub-sea interconnectors, IC1 & IC2.

Future applications by LNG or other infrastructure projects for EU Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funding will be considered in context of national and EU climate policy objectives.  Electricity Transmission The transmission system comprises approximately 6,400 kilometres (km) of high voltage (HV) overhead lines and underground cables and over 200 substations. Electricity generated in power plants is transformed to higher voltage levels  110kV; 220 kV; 275 kV and 400 kV  and fed into the transmission system. The Dublin area is an exception as the 100kV lines and cables and some of the 220/110kV transformer stations belong to the distribution system. neighbouring countries. Ireland is currently exclusively connected to the United Kingdom through two electricity interconnectors: The 300 MW North-South interconnector, linking the electricity systems of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and the 500 MW East-West Interconnector connecting Ireland and Wales (United Kingdom). EirGrid owns and operates both interconnectors. Ireland is currently not meeting the indicative EU electricity interconnection target of at least 10% of installed capacity by 2020; its current level of interconnection is 7.4%. When the UK leaves the EU, Ireland will have no direct electrical interconnection with the rest of the EU until the planned connection of the Celtic interconnector with France in 2026 (as assumed in WAM). Higher RES-E penetration levels,   198 foreseen as part of the NECP, will necessitate further interconnection which is explored in the WAM scenario.  Figure 20:  ii. Projections of network expansion requirements at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) Gas There are currently no major plans for gas network expansion in Ireland. Gas Networks Ireland completes a Ten Year Network Development Plan on an annual basis.  Electricity EirGrid is currently working on two major extensions to the transmission system both related to expected strong demand increase in the greater Dublin area. The West Dublin Project includes the installation of a 220/110kV gas insulation switchgear substation that will connect   199 to an existing 220kV double circuit line. The project responding to a significant increase in demand associated with the growth of major multinational companies in a business park in western Dublin. This project is scheduled for completion in 2019 and is sized to accommodate potential future demand growth. The Kilkenny-Laois reinforcement project will address security of supply problems resulting from strongly growing demand and projected further growth. The project comprises a new 400/110 kV substation near Portlaoise which will be connected to the existing 400 kV and 110 kV lines, a new 110kV/38kV substation in Kilkenny and new110kV overhead lines that links with the new substation near Portlaoise. The project is scheduled for completion in 2021.

All three projects are on the fourth list of EU Projects of Common Interest (PCI). Only the Celtic interconnector would however, ensure continuous market coupling with the European Union once the United Kingdom has exited the EU. The existing North-South interconnector is running at full capacity and creates a market bottleneck. The construction of a new 400 kV AC 1500 MW overhead line, the North-South interconnector, is currently planned to improve the security of electricity supply across the   200 island of Ireland, and improve the capacity and reliability of both grids. The increased capacity will also facilitate the connection of additional renewable capacity to the grid and help reduce curtailment. The Celtic interconnector is a proposed 700 MW connection between the south coast of Ireland and the north-west coast of France. EirGrid is developing this project in partnership with the French Transmission System Operator, RTE. The length of the Celtic interconnector would be almost 600 km; about three times longer than the existing East-West project. When bu. The Greenlink project is a proposed 500 MW interconnector between Ireland and the United Kingdom. The proposed route is running from the Great Island substation, in Ireland, to the Pembroke substation, in Wales. Element Power, a private investor, is promoting the project. The construction is planned to start in 2020 with the interconnector becoming operational in 2023. The CRU has made an initial assessment on the Greenlink project in October 2018 and determined that it is in the public interest. Following the submission of sufficiently detailed financial and technical information from the Greenlink developer, the CRU expects to undertake consultation in 2020 on the proposed regulatory regime to support Greenlink. CRU is also closely liaising with the regulator for gas and electricity markets in Great Britain to explore the potential for a final project assessment process. -island generation capacity statement 2019-2028 provides further data on potential demand increases which will have network implications. EirGrid assumes that due to the expected growth in demand from large energy users, the electricity demand in Ireland could grow by up to 52.6% in the next 10 years in a high demand forecast. To be prudent, in the generation capacity statement, there is also a scenario where this growth is much lower, at 27.8% in a low demand forecast. 4.5.3. Electricity and Gas Markets, Energy Prices i. Current situation of electricity and gas markets, including energy prices Consistent with the evolution of EU energy policy, the regulation of retail market prices for electricity in Ireland ended in 2011 and for gas in 2014. Price setting is wholly a commercial and operational matter for electricity suppliers with no regulatory approval involved. Accordingly, Government policy on energy costs is focused on the competitive market and the provision of supports for energy efficiency. In this regard, government policy has supported competition to drive down prices, with data from approved price comparison sites (www.bonkers.ie, www.powertoswitch.ie and www.switcher.ie) also consistently   201 highlighting that consumers can make significant savings by switching energy suppliers in the competitive market. The thrust of national energy policy on prices has been to create the conditions for competition in electricity and gas markets, on the basis that competition among producers and suppliers will ultimately lead to lower consumer prices. The competitiveness of the Irish electricity retail market is illustrated by pan-EU switching data, which highlight that Ireland has consistently enjoyed amongst the highest regional switching rates. For instance, the most recent Retail Market Monitoring Report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) and the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) in December 2018 highlighted that Ireland had the fourth highest external switching rate in the EU during 2017 and third highest rate during 2012-2016. Also regarding market competition, it is important to note the number of new suppliers that have entered the Irish market since the end of price controls and incumbent utility unbundling.  Notwithstanding the above, there are a number of longstanding headwinds that have historically placed, and will likely continue to place, upward pressure on costs and consumer prices relative to many other EU member states. These factors include a lack of natural resourcesdispersed thinly spread population, which have served to place upward pressure on network costs.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), acting on behalf of EU statistics agency, Eurostat, is responsible for collecting and evaluating statistics on Irish electricity and gas prices, on which it publishes a regular six monthly report, including analysis of recent trends and a comparison between Ireland with EU and Euro Area averages. The most recent SEAI report covered the period January - June 2019.  A number of factors influence energy prices in Ireland. These include, but are not limited to, imported fuel prices, energy infrastructure investment costs, electricity generating fuel mix and non-energy costs that affect energy prices (for example, taxes levied, employment costs, raw material and shipping costs). Business Electricity The weighted average price of electricity to business consumers in Ireland has been above both Europe and Euro Area averages since the second half of 2011. In the current semester (January to June 2019) the weighted average price in Ireland increased by 2% and was 7% and 8% above the EU and Euro Area average respectively.     202 Table 33: Electricity consumption bands for business - January to June 2019 Band Band Share Ireland c/kWh Ireland Relative to: Ranking* in: Semester Price Change: EU Euro Area EU Euro Area Ireland EU Euro Area IA (<0.02)  6.9% 20.5 103% 96% 6 6  -2.7% 5.2% 7.1% IB (0.02 - 0.5)  26.5% 16.4 110% 105% 5 4  1.6% 6.2% 6.6% IC (0.5 - 2.0) 13.5% 14.0 113% 109% 5 4  3.8%  7.8% 7.8%  ID (2.0 - 20)  25.5% 11.7  109% 107% 7 6  5.6% 8.7% 8.9%  IE (20 - 70)  6.6% 10.1 113% 115% 5 4  -1.8% 8.3% 8.7% IF (70 - 150)  5.1% 9.2 110% 115% 7 6  -4.7% 7.0% 5.5% IG (>150)  15.8% 8.5 119% 133% 3 2  - 0.3% -1.7% Weighted Avg. - 14.0 107% 108% - - 2.0% 7.0% 7.4% *A ranking of 1 means most expensive Source: Eurostat and SEAI  Table 33 summarises the key changes for the electricity consumption bands for business in Ireland for the period January to June 2019 and compares with the changes across the EU and Euro Area.

Regarding price developments in the Irish energy retail markets, the CRU publishes regular quarterly and annual market monitoring reports, which include analysis of recent and long-term price trends. The latest CRU Market Monitoring annual report is for 2018.  In addition to the aforementioned SEAI and CRU publications covering prices in the Irish energy retail markets, the SEMC Market Monitoring Unit publishes a quarterly report analysing, inter alia, price trends within the all-island wholesale market. The latest such report covering the period July-September 2019 can be located on the SEMC website. ii. Projections of development with existing policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) Design of energy wholesale and retail markets will continue to evolve in line with EU and national policy objectives to facilitate increased levels of energy system decarbonisation, consistent with security of supply and price competitiveness.
