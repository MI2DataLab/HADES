4.6 Research, Innovation and Competitiveness dimension  4.6.1 The current situation within the low-carbon technologies sector and, to the greatest possible extent, its position on the global market (this analysis should be carried out at EU level or global level) The annual budget of the National energy research and innovation programme is approximately SEK 1.6 billion. Sweden excels in a number of fields of research and innovation, including the field of low-carbon technologies, and is also at the forefront of international efforts in the fields listed below.  Efficient biofuels for low-carbon energy transition, forestry and bioenergy Efforts in this field are focused on:   fuel supply; cultivation and extraction of biofuels, logistics, planning and fuel processing, with a focus on domestic biofuels from forests, arable land, waste, and marine biomass;  energy transformation; processes for producing electricity and heat in cogeneration installations and products of what are known as combined heat and power plants, in which surplus heat is used to produce pellets, biofuels or other energy carriers, for example.  Sweden is a global leader in the field of biofuels and waste-based cogeneration. Research has played an important role in the development of efficient and environmentally friendly biofuel- and waste-based cogeneration plants. 160 (199)  A great deal of research is being carried out in Sweden in relation to the use of forests as carbon sinks and the efficient use of bioenergy stocks. The aim -effective and sustainable harvesting of fuels based on widely in order to reduce the cost per cubic metre of extracting fuels based on forest products and to be able to spread machine costs over more hours. The project also focused on the extraction of small trees and best practice for drying and breaking down small trees for roadside storage. The project enhanced Swedish expertise in this field and the results provide a basis for more competitive fuels based on forest products.  The Industriklivet (Industrial Evolution) initiative  resource optimisation, energy efficiency measures and carbon neutrality in industry Sweden is at the forefront of research aimed at helping energy-intensive industry become more energy and resource efficient, with the ultimate aim of eliminating carbon emissions completely. The Industriklivet260 initiative is a long-term campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in industry. A total of SEK 300 million per year will be spent during the period 2018-2040 in order to support the transition in Swedish industry towards zero emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere in 2045. During 2019, the Swedish parliament acted on a proposal from the government to earmark a further SEK 200 million for this initiative, partly to increase the original remit and partly as a supplement to facilitate financing of measures contributing to negative greenhouse gas emissions261. The initiative provides support to companies at every step, from research and innovation projects to pilot and full-scale plants. The target group for this support measure is made up of industries with what are known as process-related emissions, but also universities or research institutes.  HYBRIT Within the framework of HYBRIT (HYdrogen BReakthrough Ironmaking Technology), which is financed by the Industriklivet initiative, research and pilot studies are under way in Sweden that may result in a breakthrough for fossil-free production of steel from iron ore. In addition to the support received from the Industriklivet initiative, the three HYBRIT-related projects described below have also received a total of SEK 906 million in funding from industry.  In 2016, a preliminary study received a grant of SEK 7.2 million and, in February 2017, the decision was made to support a four-year research project within the framework of the National energy research and                                                       260 Government press release, https://www.regeringen.se/pressmeddelanden/2017/08/langsiktig-satsning- for-att-minska-industrins-utslapp-av-vaxthusgaser/ 261 Bill No 2018/19:99, Report No 2018/19:FiU21, Parliamentary Letter No 2018/19:288. 161 (199) innovation programme. As part of this research project, studies were carried out into processes for fossil-free pellet production, hydrogen direct reduction,262 and the use of sponge iron263 in electric arc furnaces, as well as ways of supplying electricity for hydrogen production and storage. The research project has a budget of SEK 99 million, with the Swedish Energy Agency providing SEK 54 million in funding and the remaining SEK 45 million coming from the private sector.  During 2018, SEK 9.7 million was awarded for a feasibility study aimed at identifying the conditions for a pilot plant, as well as its basic design, location, and technology choices for further development. Later that same year, a total of SEK 528 million was awarded for the construction of two pilot plants. In one pilot plant, studies will be conducted on the development of fossil-free heating technology for sintering iron ore pellets. These studies aim to reduce emissions, but also to improve knowledge for designing an entirely new pelletisation process. In the other pilot plant, studies will be conducted to develop a process in which hydrogen gas is used to produce sponge iron from iron ore pellets, with that sponge iron then being smelted in an electric arc furnace to produce steel. Both the feasibility study on the pilot plant and the pilot plants themselves were authorised through the Industriklivet initiative.  Transition to a renewable electricity system and use of smart grids The Forum on smart electricity networks is a national forum set up by the Swedish government in 2016, see Heading 3.4.3. There are also a number of national centres and research and innovation programmes relating to smart electricity networks, namely SamspEL, the Swedish Centre for Future Electricity Grids and Energy Storage (SweGRIDS) and KTH ACCESS Linnaeus Centre (ACCESS-Autonomic Complex Communication Networks, Signals and Systems). Wind and solar energy are priority fields within Swedish energy research, with a number of projects under way in this field. One of these is the project -efficiency silicon multi-to develop silicon multi-junction solar cells. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate dual-junction solar cells with an efficiency level of close to 30% and triple-junction solar cells with an efficiency level of approximately 35%.  Research and demonstration in the transport sector Swedish authorities provide funding to a number of programs and large-scale projects that cover the entire chain, from cultivation of raw materials for bio-based motor fuels to the use of new fuels. All of the programmes listed below are funded within the framework of the National energy research and innovation programme. Strategic Vehicle Research and                                                       262 Direct reduction, https://www.jernkontoret.se/sv/om-oss/biblioteket/ordlista/ordlista-d/. 263 Sponge iron, https://www.jernkontoret.se/sv/om-oss/biblioteket/ordlista/ordlista-j/. 162 (199) Innovation (Fordonsstrategisk Forskning och Innovation  FFI) also receives funding from the Agency for Innovation Systems, VINNOVA.   FFI, a collaboration between the state and the automotive industry with regard to joint funding for research, innovation and development activities, with a focus on the fields of climate, environment and safety.  The Renewable Fuels and Systems 2018-2021 collaboration programme, a collaboration between the Swedish Energy Agency and the Swedish Knowledge Centre for Renewable Fuels (f3).  The Swedish Gasification Centre (Svenskt Förgasningscentrum  SFC), a research centre where numerous academic bodies collaborate with industry.  The Battery Fund Programme, a research programme focusing on battery recycling and batteries for electricity system and automotive applications.  Transport-Efficient Society, a research programme aimed at developing new knowledge and increasing competence in academia, institutes, the public sector and industry, by supporting research, development, innovation and demonstration and thus helping to ensure a transport-efficient society that is equal, accessible and resource efficient.  A maritime programme aimed at creating a sustainable maritime transport system.  One example of such a project is the company RenFuel K2B AB, which received support to develop and test its technology for producing renewable petrol and diesel from raw forest products at pilot scale. In the pilot project, lignin will be extracted from raw forest products at a pulp mill and transformed into an oil. The oil will then be transformed into renewable petrol and diesel in a conventional refinery.  The transition to electricity in the transport sector creates new opportunities. Large-transition and in order to reduce the climate impact of the transport sector, both in Sweden and worldwide. As part of this process, Northvolt Labs was awarded a sum of up to SEK 146 million for a pilot plant for large-scale battery production in Sweden. This decision represents an important step towards a new domestic industry and sustainable energy systems. The project relates to the construction and operation of a pilot plant for producing lithium-ion batteries, located in Västerås. The project is divided up into a number of phases and will run from 2018 to the end of 2023. In addition to testing and validating a new production and process model that will reduce the environmental impact of battery production, the pilot plant will also function as a research and development centre for sustainable and flexible battery production. The construction of a pilot plant in Västerås is a 163 (199) Skellefteå, and has triggered the creation of a European battery production supply chain. The support provided is also helping to create an ecosystem of Swedish companies across the entire battery value chain  from raw materials to battery systems. It is estimated that around 100 people, in addition to research and development personnel, will be employed at the pilot plant in Västerås. The factory in Skellefteå is expected to be fully operational in 2023 and should directly create between 2 000 and 2 500 jobs264.  A contract for a research and innovation platform for a fossil-free freight transport system has been awarded to a large consortium, Triple F265, by the Swedish Transport Administration. Triple F is focusing on three challenges: a more transport-efficient society, energy-efficient and fossil-free vehicles and aircraft; and a greater share of renewable fuels. The expected outcome is sector-wide collaboration and knowledge building to help reduce CO2 emissions in the freight transport system in line with set targets.  Electric aircraft may help reduce both direct emissions from aviation and the effects of altitude adjustments, particular over shorter distances, which may prove useful for air routes subject to public procurement for reasons of regional policy, amongst other things. A fully electric aircraft was flown for the first time in Sweden in 2018. The Swedish aviation industry is working to develop hybrid or fully electric aircraft with support from the ELISE (Elektrisk lufttransport i Sverige  Electric Air Transport in Sweden) initiative, amongst others. This initiative aims to have the first certified Swedish-made hybrid aircraft, with a flight limit of 400 km, flying domestic services in 2026. In the longer term, and as electric aircraft evolve, the need for charging infrastructure in the aviation industry will increase.  Energy-related building research The Swedish Energy Agency, as sectoral authority, has primary responsibility for the coordination of energy-related building research. Projects in this area are funded by Formas and VINNOVA, as well as by the Swedish Energy Agency. The Swedish Consumer Agency, the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, and the Environmental Protection Agency also have energy-related responsibilities in the construction sector. A key characteristic of energy-related building research is its system-wide perspective, with the aim of achieving resource- and energy-efficient construction through collaboration. The Swedish Energy Agency focuses on energy efficiency in a number of programs: Research and innovation for energy-efficient construction and housing, Design for energy efficiency in everyday life, and Energy efficiency in the lighting sector.                                                       264 Press release from the municipality of Skellefteå dated 12 June 2019 http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/skellefteakommun/pressreleases/klart-foer-byggstart-av-northvolts-batterifabrik-i-skellefteaa-2885665. 265 https://triplef.lindholmen.se/. 164 (199)  From research to market Sweden was named the 2019 innovation leader in the European Innovation Scoreboard, followed by Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands.266 The above report provides a comparative analysis of innovation performance in EU countries, other European countries, and regional neighbours. The report compares relative strengths and weaknesses of national innovation systems (Human resources, Attractive research systems, Innovation-friendly environment, Finance and support, Firm investments, Innovators, Linkages, Intellectual assets, Employment impacts and Sales impacts) and helps countries identify areas they need to address.  The transition to a sustainable energy system is creating a growing global demand for new technologies and new services. Due to its commercial and international nature, energy research and innovation in Sweden offers significant potential to meet this demand. Sweden provides support to companies for business development and the commercialisation and distribution of new energy technologies and services, at various different stages of development. This support is provided until such time as the innovation has achieved a stage of maturity at which private operators are willing to take on, finance and pursue continued development. Over the last three years, agencies have intensified their efforts to reach out to innovative companies and offer various different kinds of support. One of the tools  a challenge-driven innovation programme. The programme brings together relevant customers, transition towards carbon-free growth. The initiative focuses on ambitious challenges with the potential to transform fields such as fossil-free transport and 100% renewable energies. The programme uses competitions, tests and events to inspire the commercialisation of sustainable solutions and the creation of viable projects.  Sweden has supported several successful companies in bringing their research and innovations to market. In the field of solar energy, these include, for example, Exeger (Heffa Solar  a new cost-efficient Grätzel solar cell). In the field of marine energy, they include, for example, CorPower Ocean AB, high-efficiency Wave Energy Converter (WEC), Minesto, Waves4Power and Ocean Harvesting Technologies.  Pilot and demonstration collaborations between public and private operators Sweden has also supported successful pilot and demonstration projects in collaboration with public and private operators.                                                        266 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/innovation/facts-figures/scoreboards_en. 165 (199)  -emission haulage through the manufacture of electric, hybrid, plug-in hybrid and other hybrid vehicles, including fuel cell vehicles and heavy machinery, and support for the development of electric roads.

Taxes are levied on the price of the product, electrical energy, and VAT is payable on the taxes, electricity and network charges. For a typical apartment-dwelling customer (2 000 KWh annual consumption) with a variable electricity price contract, the total electricity cost for 2018 was, on average, SEK 299 a month. Network charges account for the largest share (41%) of the electricity cost for apartment-dwelling customers. Figure 37 shows a breakdown of the electricity price components for customers with an annual consumption of 2 000 KWh.   Figure 37.

In line with the tax loss method, tax expenditure is calculated as the tax reduction multiplied by the base (tax base). The calculation of tax expenditure is based on accrual accounting, which means that tax implications relate to the year in which the underlying economic activities occur.  Table 34 shows reductions in energy tax and carbon tax and the calculated size of the tax shortfall. Tax expenditure relating to petrol and diesel of fossil origin resulting from the reduction obligation scheme has been omitted. The tax incentives for mining activities that were in force in 2018 have also been omitted, as these were abolished in August 2019.  Table 34. Energy subsidies for fossil fuels, billions of SEK.
