150  5. Impact assessment of planned policies and measures 5.1. Impacts of planned policies and measures described in Section 3 on the energy system and GHG emissions and removals including a comparison to projections with existing policies and measures (as described in Section 4) 5.1.i. Projections of the development of the energy system and GHG emissions and removals as well as, where relevant, of emissions of air pollutants in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/2284 under the planned policies and measures at least until 10 years after the period covered by the plan (including for the last year of the period covered by the plan), including relevant Union policies and measures  Greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced by at least 55% by 2030 using suitable strategies and measures (see also Section 2.1.1.). In addition, primary energy consumption must fall by 30% by 2030 compared to final energy consumption must amount to 30% in 2030.  The present impact assessment analysing the planned strategies and measures is based on a scientific scenario which depicts a possible future development of the energy system in Germany. The scenario presented below is based on the baseline scenario (see Section 4)10. It also takes account of the planned ongoing measures (see Section 3). It is assumed that the exogenous factors described influence energy-system and GHG emissions development in unmodified form (see Section 4.1).  As the baseline scenario includes those policies and measures implemented or adopted before 31 December 2017, the scenario investigated below takes into account the policies and measures initiated since then, mme 2030 of autumn 2019 and the resulting specific legislative changes and measures11. Henceforth this scenario will be referred to as reduction effect of the climate protection programme 2030.  The results of the scenario presented here are categorically not to be taken as adopted by the Federal Government. Scenarios which extend until 2030 and 2040 are fraught with uncertainties. For example, the effects of the spread of the Corona virus on the economy and energy industry could not be foreseen in the available scenario analysis, as these effects only became apparent after the analysis work had been completed. In principle, the scenario is based on measures already adopted and finalised. Measures that have not yet been finalised or which will be decided at a later date could not be taken into account systematically.12  In general, different developments are predicted in different scenarios depending on the assumptions and methods used, including assumptions regarding the implementation of planned policies and measures. This is where the uncertainties which naturally exist for a forecasting period of 10 years or more reveal themselves. Thus the various studies and projections which have been developed for the Federal Government arrive at individually differing results13. The Federal Government will therefore also include other scenarios in its future considerations in addition to the present scenarios. It must also be borne in mind that the breakdown by sectors in the system of EU reporting differs from the national system of the Climate Action Plan 2050.  Greenhouse gas emissions  The projections of greenhouse gases in the Climate Action Programme scenario 2030 are described in Table                                                            10 The scenario analysis was published as a study under Prognos (2020): Energiewirtschaftliche Projektionen und Folgenabschätzungen 2030 [Energy projections and impact assessments for 2030], https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Publikationen/Wirtschaft/klimagutachten.html 11 In order, as required, to depict in the projections a point at least 10 years further on from the period recorded in the plan (2021-2030), i.e. at least 2040, a development was modelled in the underlying scenario with which the currently valid target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least -80% to -95% by 2050 could on average be achieved. As this development reaches even further into the future, the projection for this could naturally not be backed up with specific individual measures. 12 siness and civil society, is currently working out an assessment of the report from Prognos, Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, Institute of Economic Structures Research, International Institute for Sustainability Analysis and Strategy (2020) with regard to the transport sector. In this context investigations are also being made into how the measures already taken in the transport sector can be further accelerated and extended. 13 For the estimation of the reduction effect on greenhouse gases of the Climate Action Programme 2030, a further report for the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety and the Federal Environment Agency was drawn up in addition to the primarily cited report for the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (Prognos et al. (2020)): https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/1410/publikationen/2020-03-05_climate- change_12-2020_treibhausgasminderungswirkungen-klimaschutzprogramm-2030.docx_.pdf 151  B25. According to this, GHG emissions without international transport and LULUCF emissions decrease by 2030 to 598 million tonnes CO2eq. Compared to the baseline year 1990 with its emissions level of 1251 million tonnes CO2eq, this corresponds to a reduction of 52%, i.e. GHG emissions have been reduced by more than half compared with 1990.

With the report's estimated reduction to 593 million tonnes CO2eq as a result of the Climate Action Programme -55% in comparison to 1990 is expected to be achieved. Achievement of the overall target thus appears possible, as since the Climate Action Programme 2030 was adopted, there has been ongoing exploration of further measures that could not be taken into account in the Climate Action Programme 2030 scenario, for example, pro2 projections are based on measures that have already been adopted but that are still being finalised and implemented. The Federal Climate Protection Law will create transparency and planning security and ensure the possibility of a timely efficiency review of compliance with the climate goals. The Federal Climate Protection Law will also set up a national monitoring process, allowing progress to be verified and adjusted if necessary.

Table B26 sets out the spread of results of both reports to allow an estimate of the total greenhouse gas emissions for the years 2025 and 2030.

According to these, emissions decrease in the ETS sectors more markedly than in the other sectors. Emissions from European air transport are also covered by the emissions trading scheme. They are shown separately since they are not relevant to the achievement of national targets. Only domestic air transport is included in calculations for this purpose.

In this scenario, according to EU statistics, this results in a total energy generation from renewables of 371 TWh. The share of renewables in the underlying gross electricity consumption (591 TWh) amounts to 63%. The Federal Government aims to increase the share of renewables in the gross electricity consumption to 65% by 2030 with regard to a gross electricity consumption of 580 TWh (see Section 2.1.2) and will support attainment of the target using appropriate measures and monitor the growth of renewable energies and the gross electricity consumption in a monitoring programme.  According to the Climate Action Programme scenario, the share of renewables in the transport sector will increase significantly by 2030. Without multiple weighting, the share will increase to 11.6% by 2030 (baseline: 7.5%). According to the current scenario calculation, this is mainly due to the increasing use of renewable electricity for e-mobility, which will increase five-fold in comparison to 202016. The use of electricity will increase due to the mainstreaming of e-mobility, as will the share of electricity which is generated by renewable energies in the transport sector.  The heating and cooling sector covers space heating, hot water, process heating, process cooling and district heating. The Climate Action Programme scenario assumes that there the share of renewables in this area of                                                            15 In comparison to this, according to the estimate of the Öko-Institut et al. (2020), emissions in the ETS sector are 269.1 million tonnes CO2eq in 2030 and in the non-ETS sector 342.5 million tonnes CO2eq. 16 Beyond 2030, the share of renewables in the transport sector will rise to about 36% in 2040 (without multiple recognition). Once again, this is due primarily to the increase in the share of renewable electricity, which will approximately triple by 2040 compared to 2030. 153  energy consumption will increase from 15.8% in 2021 to 23.9% in 2030. In the baseline scenario their share will increase to 18.9% by 2030. The use of renewables for district heating purposes over this period will increase considerably. Biomass (including biogenic waste) will continue to represent the most important source of renewable energy for the generation of piped heat, even though the target scenario shows a slight drop in district heat generated using biomass. At the same time, however, waste heat, geothermal energy and ambient heat (used via high capacity heat pumps) will be increasingly used for district heating purposes. The consumption of renewables to generate decentralised space heating and hot water will increase by 15% between 2020 and 2030. This is primarily due to the ambient heat used in buildings by heat pumps. The use of solar thermal energy will also rise (inter alia due to the promotion of bivalent systems with gas), as will the use of biomass. Biomass (solid and gaseous) is the only renewable source of energy that will be used to generate process heating. Electricity will be the only source of energy used to generate process cooling.

The primary energy consumption decreases until 2030 to 10 372 PJ. In the baseline scenario the figure is 11 410 PJ. Compared with 14 380 PJ in 2008, primary energy consumption in the Climate Action Programme scenario decreases by 28% by 2030. The envisaged reduction of primary energy consumption by 30% in the period 2008-2030 will thus only narrowly be missed, according to the calculEnergy Efficiency Strategy will see the development of further energy efficiency measures which will supplement the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP 2.0) for the period up to 2030. In addition, the necessary adjustments for energy saving will be determined in the near future. This will be based on the annual monitoring report of NEEAP. With the NEEAP monitoring reports, the Federal Government has recorded the primary and final energy savings and greenhouse gas (GHG) savings of the major efficiency measures since 2015. This monitoring will be continued and in future will include the measures of NEEAP 2.0. The results of the NEEAP 2.0 monitoring report will be used by the Federal Government as the basis for the ongoing target achievement checks in the area of energy efficiency policy. At the same time, they are the basis for the possible adjustment and further development of NEEAP 2.0 in the decade 2021 to 2030. A first fundamental assessment will take place in 2023. Final energy consumption in this scenario is 7 765 PJ in 2030. In the baseline scenario the figure is 8 370 PJ. In the period from 2008 to 2030, final energy consumption in the Climate Action Programme scenario decreases by 15%.

Decreases in consumption are also observed in industry (-20%) and in commerce, trade and services (-12%).

The long investment cycles and high specific energy costs in these raw materials industries mean that switching to alternative production processes and fuels takes place slowly. ** including small amounts of district heat Source: Prognos, Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, Institute of Economic Structures Research, International Institute for Sustainability Analysis and Strategy, 2020  Table B30 shows the projection results in the Climate Action Programme scenario 2030 for the energy source structure of primary energy consumption. It changes significantly over time compared to the baseline scenario. The consumption of hard coal and lignite gradually reduces in line with the phase-out schedule. Compared to the baseline scenario, the decrease to 2030 amounts to -36.7 and -40.5% respectively. By comparison, the consumption of natural gas falls by -5.2% and that of petroleum by -10.9%. In contrast, the consumption of renewable energies rises by 15.4%. With the decommissioning of the last nuclear power station in 2022, consumption of nuclear energy ceases as per the baseline.   Air pollutants  The following emissions of air pollutants were calculated on the basis of the German emissions report 2018 and the development of emissions factors projected in the National Air Pollution Control Programme (in accordance with the new NEC [National Emission Ceiling] Directive (EU) 2016/2284). In addition, the activity data of the above-mentioned Climate Action Programme scenario 2030 (Prognos, 2020) were retained in order to guarantee consistency with the GHG projections.  The planned policies and measures of the Climate Action Programme have some significant effects on German air pollutants emissions (see tables below): In particular, the (largely energy-related) emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) will decrease more strongly during the period up to 2030 than as a result of technical emission-reducing measures alone. This also applies for emissions of particulate matter (PM2,5); although the reduction is less here, inter alia because the combustion of solid biomass leads to higher specific emissions than for example the combustion of gas or oil. Emissions of volatile hydrocarbons (NMVOC) are largely independent of energy policy measures. Ammonia emissions may rise, unless an expansion of biogas production is compensated by agricultural reduction measures (e.g. rapid incorporation of fermented substrates).

The Federal Climate Protection Law provides a strategic framework for this with the year-by-year and sector-by-sector determination of emission budgets. The gradual introduction of CO2 pricing for the transport and heating sectors sets systematic incentives for investments in low-emission and energy-efficient technologies. The Energy Efficiency Strategy in turn identifies efficiency potentials across all sectors, thus making it possible to set up and further develop targeted funding programmes. At the same time, the financial resources provided for this purpose will be massively increased. Due to the multiple interactions of individual strategies and measures, the integrated effect of the programme can only be calculated in this way and not as the sum of the effects of individual measures. Individual aspects are examined in more detail below:  Within a policy area, planned strategies and measures can support existing ones. For example, where previously limited funding is being continued, e.g. for heating networks, this contributes to continuity and helps the establishment of the existing programme.  For funding measures within a policy area, overlapping may occur in the assistance for planned and existing programmes; as a consequence, individual programmes may not completely achieve their specific potential for saving energy and reducing greenhouse gases. In designing the planned measures, the Federal Government ensures that these fit in well with the existing funding landscape and set complementary priorities where they are currently required. Moreover, existing subsidies, for example in funding for construction, are repackaged in order to achieve greater transparency and effectiveness.  For measures for saving energy, e.g. in the buildings sector or in industry, rebound effects may occur. 158  Immediately effective energy saving due to a measure is set against partially increased energy consumption. For example, tenants of a renovated building may heat their apartments to a higher temperature than prior to the renovation and thus use up part of the expected energy saving.  The interactions of energy efficiency measures are mathematically considered in the calculation of savings effects via individual interaction factors. Annex III of the NECP gives a corresponding overview. A description of how the additionality of the relevant measures has been ensured can be found in the description of the measures under Methodological Aspects.  In the area of the energy sector, with the gradual phasing out of coal-fired power generation and the accelerated growth of renewable energies, two major and ground-breaking strategic measures have been launched which are closely connected: The gradual reduction of fossil-fuel electricity generation from lignite and hard coal will be replaced by additional renewable electricity. This will maintain the security of supply.  For strategies and measures between different policy areas, a range of overlapping policy approaches and systemic connections are relevant. Four of these are highlighted below:  Increased electrification in transport and in heating and cooling contributes significantly to the substitution of fossil fuels and thus to effective decarbonising in these sectors. This strategy of sectoral coupling is essential for achieving the reduction of greenhouse gases in these sectors that are difficult to decarbonise and meeting the overarching climate goals. Measures such as the funding of e-mobility or the roll-out of heat pumps lead to increased demand for electricity. If overall an additional demand occurs which is covered by fossil fuel generation capacity, this leads to additional challenges for reaching the targets in the area of conversion, whether for the growth targets for renewable energies or the decarbonisation of electricity generation.  The overarching Energy Efficiency Strategy 2050 provides for energy efficiency measures that are intended to help address existing barriers to the realisation of efficiency potentials (e.g. lack of information, low motivation of stakeholders, red tape for financing). The Energy Efficiency Strategy therefore supports large efficiency funding programmes (such as the Federal subsidy for efficient buildings (BEG) and the Fuel Emissions Trading Act (BEHG)).  The Fuel Emissions Trading Act (BEHG) introduces a system for national CO2 pricing for the heating and transport sectors. This national emissions trading system links the participating sectors with each other. The market mechanism implemented in it will ensure over the long term that the measures in one sector also affect the resulting market price as well as the developments and strategies in another sector. The national CO2 pricing for emissions outside the EU ETS will make sustainable biomass more economically attractive as an energy source in various, sometimes competing, energy applications, such as electricity generation, biofuels or thermal recycling in industry and buildings. The sustainable potential for biomass use in Germany is limited, and this also applies for imported biomass, so it is important to channel the scarce biomass into efficient types of application using strategies and measures. A process of dialogue is currently in planning for bioenergy, in which criteria and measures for the distribution of biomass across the sectors will be analysed and discussed. In addition, the CO2 pricing established by the BEHG can also be levied on the affected companies. Any negative effects will be absorbed by appropriate carbon leakage measures; a corresponding regulation will be drawn up. The double taxation of companies already affected by the EU ETS will be avoided by means of a regulation which is currently still in preparation.  5.1.iii. Assessment of interactions between existing policies and measures and planned policies and measures, and between those policies and measures and Union climate and energy policy measures  As a matter of principle, policies and measures of the Federal Government will always be developed and concluded with regard to the existing and planned measures of the European Union. This also applies for the areas of energy and climate. In these areas it is important to achieve positive interactions between individual measures. Resulting synergies and spill-over effects are important, because they can support and accelerate the achievement of national and European energy and climate targets.  Thus with the governance system for the energy union and for climate protection and the associated EU legal for the national policies and measures of the EU member states. The Federal Government has taken this framework into account in formulating its measures in the Climate Action Programme 2030 and with the Federal Climate Protection Law. Many of the measures in the Climate Action Programme 2030 and the measures of the Federal Energy Efficiency Strategy 2050 are specifically aimed at supporting the achievement of European targets in the area of climate and energy.  Some aspects of the Climate Action Programme 2030 are examined in more detail below, with regard to their 159  interaction with EU climate and energy policy measures.  The national trade in certificates for fuel emissions supplements the EU emissions trading, because it includes the transport and heating sectors. In the heating sector, BEHG includes the emissions from heat generation in the buildings sector and in energy and industrial plants outside the EU emissions trading system. In the area of transport, the system also includes emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, but not intra-European air travel, which is subject to the EU ETS. EU ETS and BEHG complement each other usefully in the heating sector. Through national emissions trading, a price is put on heating-related CO2 emissions that were not previously captured by the EU ETS. This creates a market-oriented instrument for reducing CO2 emissions in the heating and buildings sector.  The Energy Efficiency Strategy 2050 (EffSTRA) will give impetus to the further development of the successful EU efficiency instruments Eco-Design and Energy Labelling, making sure that they are equipped with ambitious specifications. This includes both a commitment to the inclusion of further product groups (e.g. commercial ovens, commercial steam cookers and commercial tumble dryers) in the regulation as well as the further conceptual development of these instruments for suitable product groups toward a systematic approach. EffSTRA thus also takes possible rebound developments into consideration for product development. Finally, EffSTRA trends also extend to the acceleration of internal decision making on the Eco-Design and Energy Labelling instruments and the submission of new work programmes.  In the area of travel, EU fleet targets and national measures, such as, in particular, purchase premiums for electric vehicles, supplement and reinforce each other. While it is true that some sources also mention an increase in windfall effects, others see the purchase premiums as a necessary precondition for the realistic achievement of fleet values without economic disruption in the automotive industry. The relationship of the Eurovignette Directive (for the CO2 differentiation of heavy goods vehicle toll) to national emissions trade must be tested, so that double taxation of the goods forwarding industry as a result of emissions trading is avoided. On one hand, this may be linked to slightly lower economic efficiency. On the other hand, passenger car and heavy goods vehicle traffic can be influenced separately, which might simplify the achievement of other political targets, such as a simpler maintenance of affordable individual mass mobility. There is at present no EU framework for the funding of overhead cable infrastructures; this will be vital for the national funding of these technologies and their cross-border networking in the medium term.  5.2. Macroeconomic and, to the extent feasible, health, environmental, employment and education, skills and social impacts including just transition aspects (in terms of costs and benefits as well as cost-effectiveness) of the planned policies and measures described in Section 3 at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including a comparison to projections with existing policies and measures  The implementation of the planned policies and measures of the Climate Action Programme adopted at the end of 2019 has affected overall economic growth in many ways. This overall economic development in Germany is currently  at the time of submission of the German National Energy and Climate Plan  characterised by the far-reaching economic consequences resulting from the pandemic and the necessary measures for containing and combating it. Key data on total economic development will, in the near future at least, develop otherwise than had been expected at the end of 2019 and at the time of the subsequent scenario analysis. The projections below could not take account of the current developments during the pandemic. However, the projections and statements basically fulfil the requirements of the Governance regulation. Any changes will be communicated at the earliest opportunity, possibly in the NECP progress report.  Effects on the national economy and on education, skills and social impacts  In comparison to the baseline (see Section 4), the Climate Action Programme scenario produces a positive overall economic effect. The price-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) in 2030 is approximately 1.4% higher than in the baseline scenario (Prognos, Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, Institute of Economic Structures Research, International Institute for Sustainability Analysis and Strategy, 2020). The key reasons for this expansionary effect are the higher investments used to implement the Climate Action Programme 2030 (see Section 5.3), and at the same time the lower electricity prices in the Climate Action Programme scenario 2030 (see Section 5.4). Table B34 shows the estimates for the absolute changes of the individual components of GDP. The higher investments in equipment and buildings compared to the baseline are reflected in the increased investments due to the Climate Action Programme 2030. Various factors are responsible for the rise in consumption. These include the comparatively low electricity price, the low energy costs which increase over time and higher employment and wages linked to the increasing GDP. 160  As a result of the expansive effect on the overall economy, the demand for imports is higher, although imports of fossil fuels are increasingly lower than in the baseline. In contrast, exports fall slightly because the price competitiveness drops slightly with rising wages. Increasing export opportunities for climate protection products are not assumed in the projections.  Table B34: Changes in GDP and its components in the Climate Action Programme scenario  scenario compared to baseline  Absolute deviation of the price-adjusted GDP and its components in billion EUR2016 2020 2025 2030 GDP  8.9  48.4  51.3 Private consumption  2.9  20.9  24.5 State consumption  0.0  0.4  2.2 Equipment  5.7  23.4  35.6 Buildings  2.9  8.3  12.4 Exports  1.1  0.0  -7.7 Imports  3.8  5.3  14.5 Sources: Prognos, Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, Institute of Economic Structures Research, International Institute for Sustainability Analysis and Strategy (2020)   As a result of the GDP growth, which is higher than the baseline, higher employment can also be assumed. According to the projections, the number of people employed will grow by 0.5% in 2030. This corresponds to approximately 185 000 additional people employed, although the impact on employment will vary in individual sectors. The relative growth is thus not as large as for GDP. This is because an element of the higher economic performance leads to higher wages and consequently higher productivity, with a comparatively lower additional demand for employment. Employee compensation will be 3% higher than the baseline in 2030; with price adjustment the figure will be 1.7%. The cost of living index changes only slightly in the Climate Action Programme scenario 2030. However, because of the introduction of CO2 prices and higher capital costs for the additional investments in 2030, it lies 1.3% higher than in the baseline. The inflation rate is thus a good 0.1% per year higher than in the baseline. The positive development in the labour market contributes to higher hourly wages and employee compensation. In contrast to this we see lower electricity prices and the first energy savings.  Social impacts including aspects of just transition  Employment is changing, particularly in the energy sector. In addition to current questions of structural change and employment in the coal-mining areas, since 2000 there has been a gradual but perceptible shift in employment away from the classic, mostly conventional energy sectors towards renewables. This applies particularly if the employment effects in the sectors with a demand for investment in energy transition are also considered (German Institute for Economic Research, German Aerospace Centre, Institute of Economic Structures Research 2019). Such a development is a logical consequence of the proposed decarbonisation of the energy system in Germany and will continue.  In the area of transport, changes to employment and value creation can be expected as a result of the transition from conventional drive systems to alternative drive systems. However, these changes cannot yet be fully estimated at present. To date, only a few comprehensive studies have been carried out into the overall effects on the national economy. Depending on the scenario design and the assumptions made, various conclusions can be drawn from the study results regarding the future development of employment in the German automotive industry. Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that numerous comparisons with the status quo alone are of limited value, as many developments, including demographic changes, take place in parallel. Because of the range of the results, there is still a need for differentiated studies on the gross and net effects of employment and value creation caused by the transition to alternative drive systems. 161   Some areas of the German economy have recently shown occasional bottlenecks of skilled workers, particularly for professionally qualified staff. These are already a consequence of the demographic change and could slow down overall economic growth and hamper innovation. Whether and to what extent the economic sectors relevant for the implementation of the Climate Action Programme 2030 may be affected by this is the subject of investigation. After an initial study17 there are signs of shortages of skilled workers in professional groups related to energy transition, such as technical and building professions. Particularly for building professions, however, there is no uniform picture: The shortage of skilled workers varies considerably according to the category, level of performance and region; in some federal states there are no bottlenecks or only signs of them. It is also difficult to form a complete picture of professional groups related to energy transition and the share of the energy transition for employment. As the implementation of the energy transition also contributes to employment via the supply chain, there is also an indirect requirement for qualified skilled workers here.  End-user expenditure or final consumption costs are suitable indicators for the cost-effectiveness or affordability of energy (EWK 2012, 2019). End-user expenditure primarily consists of the purchased quantities and the prices paid, including fees, charges and taxes which have to be paid on the product (Institute of Economic Structures Research, 2017). End-user expenditure for final consumption costs can be calculated on the basis of the energy balance or its review. An overall economic consideration of energy expenditure can provide information about the affordability of energy in general. For this purpose, the aggregated information about all end consumers is reviewed.  Table B35 shows the development of end-user expenditure at current prices for the Climate Action Programme scenario18. The BEHG and the reduction of the surcharge under the Renewable Energy Sources Act have been taken into account. The expenditure for electricity rises considerably between 2020 and 2025, then remains almost unchanged until 2030 because of the reduction of the surcharge under the Renewable Energy Sources Act and the resulting largely stable, sometimes slightly decreasing electricity prices. Expenditure for electricity shows an above-average increase, because the importance of electricity increases significantly in the scenario with climate protection. Expenditure for heating also increases slightly until 2030. By contrast, end-user expenditure in the transport sector decreases (for liquid and gaseous fuels). Electricity consumption in transport is included in the end-user expenditure for electricity. Important factors for the overall total are that the price of electricity varies only slightly between the two scenarios, while the prices of fossil fuels increase sharply due to CO2 pricing.  Table B35: End-user expenditure in the Climate Action Programme scenario 2030  scenario  Changes in end-user expenditure for energy in billion EUR (current prices) 2020 2025 2030 Total  214.6  222.3  221.6 Electricity  85.1  97.2  97.9 Heating  58.0  63.5  73.6 Transport  71.5  61.6  50.1 Share of GDP in Climate Action Programme scenario  6.0%  5.4%  4.7% Share of GDP in baseline scenario  6.0%  5.7%  5.1% Source: Prognos, Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, Institute of Economic Structures Research, International Institute for Sustainability Analysis and Strategy, 2020  Finally, a comparison of the evolution of expenditure with the evolution of value creation gives an indication of the sustainability of energy expenditure for the national economy. Overall, end-user expenditure increases, but in relation to GDP it declines from 6.0% in 2020 to 4.7% in 2030. Economic performance increases more                                                            17 Institute of Economic Structures Research (2018), Possible bottlenecks for the energy transition. Institute of Economic Structures Research, Osnabrück. October 2018. 18 Price adjustments are waived, because the prices for heating and transport increase sharply as a result of the CO2 price in the Climate Action Plan scenario, which can lead to distortions in price adjustments in comparison to the baseline. 162  strongly and more rapidly in the scenario with climate action than expenditure for energy. Compared to the baseline, the share of GDP is lower.  Effects on the environment and health  The existing and planned policies and measures will have a positive impact on the environment and health, as well as synergy effects for a sustainable energy sector. For example, if fewer fossil fuels are burned and Germany phases out the commercial use of nuclear energy at the end of 2022, a reduction in environmental pollution and in health risks for people, animals and the natural environment can be assumed19. At the same time it is important to exclude harmful effects on the environment and health by continuing to expand renewable energies and other technological developments. To take account of this problem, the Federal Government has set the target of integrating environmental impact into the monitoring process for the energy transition.  Today, energy conversion processes are responsible for a large part of air pollution in Germany. In addition to greenhouse gases, air pollutants are released in all sectors where fossil and biogenic fuels are burnt20. Material discharges from the energy sector into the environment also have an effect on human health. For example, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a by-product of processes in furnaces and combustion motors, is an irritant gas which damages the airways and reinforces the irritant effect of other pollutants so that respiratory or cardiovascular diseases can occur. Particulate matter also has a negative effect on human health. The measures of the Climate Action Programme are aimed at reducing these emissions, and thus the burdens for humans and nature, in many areas. Projections for individual air pollutants are shown in Section 5.1.  Furthermore, the most efficient use of raw materials and a sustainable use of land make a significant contribution to climate protection, because the extraction, processing and transport of fuels and energy systems, including the upstream chains, is associated with the use of land. The challenge is to minimise this use of space and avoid a lasting deterioration of soils and the loss of agricultural land.  Table B36 shows the selected environmental effects in Germany from the use of bioenergy as a result of the planned policies and measures (International Institute for Sustainability Analysis and Strategy 2020). Possible analyses of environmental effects of other uses of fossil and renewable energies will be given at the next possible opportunity, such as in the NECP progress report. In addition to the effects on the consumption of minerals and ores and on the use of land, the effects on the consumption of water are also shown. These estimates are in turn based on the projections of the Climate Action Programme scenario (see Section 5.1.i) and the baseline scenario (see Section 4.2).  Table B36: Selected environmental effects in Germany from the use of bioenergy in the Climate Action Programme scenario compared to the baseline  Use of raw materials and land by the use of bioenergy 2020 2030 2030 (baseline) Water (in thousand tonnes) 18 25 25 Ores (in thousand tonnes) 13 16 22 Minerals (in thousand tonnes) 3 049 1 660 3 150 Land use (in thousand hectares) 1 603 681 1 276 Source: International Institute for Sustainability Analysis and Strategy (2020)  The use of water up to 2030 increases in both scenarios compared to 2020. The use of minerals in the period up to 2030 decreases by almost half in the Climate Action Programme scenario. A similar decrease up to 2030 also occurs in comparison with the baseline. In contrast, the use of ores increases up to 2030; however, not as strongly as in the baseline. The utilisation of land by bioenergy use shrinks significantly up to 2030. Also in comparison to the baseline, existing policies and measures result in lower land utilisation up to 2030.                                                            19 In addition to the effects on the environment and health of nuclear plants in normal use, potential contamination in the case of incidents or damage must be considered. Serious accidents occur rarely, but can have far-reaching consequences. By phasing out the use of nuclear energy for generating electricity, risks from the release of radioactive substances will be limited. The safe final storage of radioactive waste will contribute to minimising the radiological consequences of using nuclear energy over long periods. 20 The switch to electrical and other drive systems will allow greenhouse gas emissions and pollutant emissions which occur in transport as a result of the burning of fuels to be avoided or partially transferred from this area to the electricity sector, where measures for reducing pollutants can be taken in a more focused way. 163   In addition to these effects of national policies and measures on the utilisation of raw materials and land within Germany, the effects induced outside the borders of Germany can also be considered. The induced water use for bioenergy abroad in 2030 in the Climate Action Programme scenario is many times higher than domestic water use. The reason for this is inter alia the higher importance of irrigation abroad. The induced use of ores is also significantly higher abroad in 2030 than direct use in Germany. The opposite development is projected for minerals in 2030. Land use abroad in 2030 is only slightly higher than land use in Germany (International Institute for Sustainability Analysis and Strategy 2020). For all four indicators, use of raw materials and land for bioenergy in the Climate Action Programme scenario in 2030 is markedly lower than in the baseline scenario. With the exception of ores, this difference represents up to a half. The planned policies and measures thus contribute significantly to the reduction of the use of raw materials and land depicted.  In addition to the named environmental effects, other effects on human and animal health can be linked to the energy system and planned policies and measures. These include noise emissions or effects on biodiversity and the living conditions of flora, fauna and people (where these have not already been addressed by a sustainable use of land). Further insights into such possible effects will be notified at the next possible opportunity, such as in the NECP progress report.   5.3. Overview of necessary investments 5.3.i. Existing investment flows and assumptions concerning future investments in connection with the planned policies and measures  Making a success of the energy transformation and simultaneously providing a modern and efficient infrastructure will require increased investment in the coming years. Over the last two decades, the energy sector has already made high levels of investment in the transformation of the energy system. However, households and businesses in Germany have also made significant investments in areas of end energy demand.  The energy sector includes the provision of fuels, the operation and maintenance of energy generation, storage and distribution plant and trade in final energy. This applies both to fossil fuels and increasingly to renewable energy sources. In these areas of the energy sector, EUR 25.7 billion21 was invested in 2018 (German Institute for Economic Research, German Aerospace Centre, Institute of Economic Structures Research 2019). The majority of this was in investments for providing electricity and heating, at EUR 13.3 billion. Approx. EUR 9.9 billion was invested in infrastructure for the distribution of final energy (electricity, gas, heating) in 2018. The remaining investments were made in the areas of storage (gas, electricity, heating) (EUR 0.7 billion) and equipment for supplying fuels (coal, mineral oil, petroleum, natural gas as well as biomass and biofuels) (EUR 1.5 billion)22.  Investments made in the area of final energy demand concern mainly the heating and transport areas. Expenditure for energy-related building renovation is an important factor here. EUR 46.3 billion was invested here in 2017 (Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy 2019). Energy-related building renovation is one of the central measures for increasing energy efficiency; investments in other areas of energy efficiency can only be incompletely recorded to date.  Investments within the framework of existing measures are predominantly made by private households and businesses. Only in individual areas, such as public electricity and heat supply, are public providers direct investors in the conversion of the energy system. At the same time, the public sector is making significant financial means available to support private investments.  In order to describe future investments in connection with planned policies and measures, a model-based socio-economic impact assessment was carried out, building on projections for the energy system (see Section 5.1.i), to illustrate the differences in investments between the Climate Action Programme scenario 2030 and the baseline. Table B37 shows the difference in annual investments in the Climate Action Programme scenario 2030, which compared to the baseline are largely made in addition. Sector boundaries emerge from the data analysis of existing investment flows.  According to the impact assessment, the differential investments in 2030 in the conversion sector amount to EUR2016 16.7 billion. The additional investments in renewable energies and networks dominate here. In 2030, the final demand sectors account for a total of EUR2016 26.1 billion in additional investments. These are made                                                            21 Nominal prices, excluding tax 22 The figures shown are estimates based on official statistics and available studies. In total, data availability is very variable between the different technologies and sectors. 164  predominantly in industry, transport, private households and to a comparatively small extent in commerce, trade and services. Altogether, the additional investments in 2030 amount to around EUR2016 42.8 billion.

In the final demand sectors, the figure is EUR2016 184 billion in the same period. In total, the additional investments in the Climate Action Programme scenario thus amount to EUR2016 279.2 billion up to 2030. A comparable investigation of the Climate Action Programme by Öko-Institut et al (2019) arrives at similar results. For the period 2018 to 2030, cumulated differential investments compared to a baseline amount to between EUR2010 240 and 270 billion.  It should be noted that these figures refer to the additional investments. No statements can be made on this basis concerning the amount of ongoing investment flows connected with current policies and measures. In an overall assessment, however, these investment flows must be included.  In addition to the overarching individual analysis presented, there are also parallel estimates of future investments in individual sectors. German transmission system operators in the area of gas plan to invest approx. EUR 7.0 billion in the expansion of their gas infrastructure up to 2028 (investment volume of the compulsory gas network development plan 2018-2028).  For an analysis of the investments required for the electricity transmission infrastructure, the national network development plan (NDP) is relevant. On the basis of past network development plans, statutory provision has already been made in the Federal Requirements Planning Act and the Energy Line Expansion Act for 65 projects with a total of approximately 7 700 km of transmission infrastructure which is urgently needed, around 900 km of which are interconnectors. Germany will amend the Federal Requirements Planning Act in light of confirmation of the 2019-2030 Network Development Plan in 2020. In addition to the grid expansion projects already set out in the Federal Requirements Planning Act and the Energy Line Expansion Act, further grid expansion projects with a length of just under 3 600 km are required by 2030 in accordance with the 2019-2030 Network Development Plan, including new interconnector projects. The refinancing of necessary investments in the expansion, reinforcement and optimisation of the transmission system is regulated nationally via the Incentive Regulation and the Electricity Grid User Charge Ordinance. As a tool, the 165  investment measure is a separate refinancing instrument for essential investments aimed at expansion and restructuring in the transmission network. In addition, certain PCI projects can apply for financial subsidies for funds.  5.3.ii. Sector and market-related risk factors or obstacles in the national or regional context  Investments in climate protection and in a future-proof energy system in Germany cannot be considered in isolation in an overall economic growth vacuum. This was true even before the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Intended investments and the implementation of planned policies and measures can be hampered or at least slowed down by possible economic or structural bottlenecks.  The continuous investments amounting to several billion in the last few years can be seen as an indication that such risks of bottlenecks did not have great relevance until now. For example, public funding programmes, such as that of the KfW in particular, counteract possible financing bottlenecks for companies and private households, so that microeconomic investments which are (also) macroeconomically reasonable do not stop.  Moreover, sufficient raw materials must continue to be available so that the production of vital (investment) goods for climate protection and the energy transition is not restricted. The same applies for an adequate number of skilled workers, so that planned investments can be efficiently implemented. In addition it must be ensured that overarching effects such as rebound effects at the energy demand level and lock-in effects (path dependencies) for certain infrastructure investments do not limit an efficient implementation of energy transition investments and their effectiveness (cf. Institute of Economic Structures Research 2019).  The lack of planning security hampers investments in climate protection and in a future-proof energy system. or the implementation of the Climate Action Plan 2050 therefore also contains measures to create planning security. These include in particular CO2 pricing. This will be introduced in Germany from the beginning of 2021 with the Fuel Emissions Trading Act (BEHG) for the areas of heating and transport with a reliable price path. In addition, in the view of the Federal Government, the existing European emissions trading (for energy and industry) will be supplemented with a moderate European minimum price. The minimum price ensures that the price of the certificate can no longer arbitrarily fall even when demand is low. This creates planning security for climate investments in the ETS sectors.  A key determining factor in investment activity is the amount of state-regulated price components. Against this background, the Federal Government had embedded a test of the incentive and steering effect of government-instigated energy price components in the form of charges, levies and taxes in the Climate Action Plan 2050. With the resolutions on the introduction of the BEHG, the Federal Government intends that at the same time as the introduction of CO2 pricing, citizens and the economy will be relieved of some of the electricity price burden. This will also set the right incentives for increasing electrification, and promote the cross-sectoral energy transition  5.3.iii. Analysis of additional public grants and resources to close loopholes discovered in section ii  Where the measures of the Climate Action Programme are financed by public funding, this will be largely enshrined in the 2020 budget of the Energy and Climate Fund (EKF). The Energy and Climate Fund thus remains the central financial instrument for energy transition and climate protection in Germany. Up to 2030, total funding (i.e. together with funding measures outside the EKF) at the three-digit billion level will be made available for climate protection and energy transition.  The federal states spend significant resources from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for the promotion of climate protection and also plan to do this for the next financial period. In regions that are particularly heavily affected by structural change, such as coal-mining regions, future measures can also be funded by the new EU Just Transition Fund (JTF) which can be further reinforced by the allocation of funding from the ERDF and the European Social Fund. The JTF will provide financial assistance to regions particularly heavily affected by structural change, such as coal-mining regions, to achieve the climate goals. In future, the EU can thus receive financial support for innovations and the strengthening of competitiveness from the JTF in addition to funding from the established structural funds. The JTF will thus help to harmonise economy and ecology and enable support for structural change that complies with the principles of social justice.  Where planned policies and measures are continued and reinforced on the basis of existing measures, the current financing mechanisms are generally also continued, such as the financing of renewable energies in electricity generation via a levy or the funding of energy-related building renovation by means of national public funding programmes. It is currently not possible to say whether and to what extent individual EU 166  financing mechanisms will be used to finance necessary investments in Germany.   5.4. Effects of the planned policies and measures described in Section 3 on other member states and regional cooperation at least up to the last year of the validity period of the plan with a comparison to the projections for the current policies and measures 5.4.i. Where possible, effects on the energy system in neighbouring or other member states in the region  Electricity  The continuing expansion of power lines within Germany and to the neighbouring states and the continuing expansion of renewable energies in all European states will  by current estimates  lead to an increasing harmonisation of electricity systems in Germany and its neighbouring countries. The inter-regional exchange of electricity will contribute to better integration of volatile electricity generation, particularly from wind and PV, in the system as a whole, thus improving the security of supply in the entire region. At the same time, the efficiency of the electricity system in all countries will increase due to an inter-regional exchange of back-up capacities (power stations, storage facilities, load flexibility).  Natural gas  By 2030, climate protection programmes and decarbonisation efforts could already lead to decreases in the use of gas, particularly natural gas, in terms of primary and end energy. The reasons for this could lie in the reducing requirement for end energy in buildings due to energy-related renovations and growing shares of renewables, while the use of gas in smaller volume areas of conversion (power stations, district heat) could tend to increase. Depending on changes in demand in neighbouring countries, this could also lead to higher transit shares, due to the transit function of Germany.  5.4.ii. Effects on energy prices, utilities and the integration of the energy market  Energy prices  In both the baseline scenario and the Climate Action Programme scenario, fuel prices for natural gas, petroleum and hard coal are based on the EU baseline scenario 2016 and therefore follow the recommendations of the European Commission. These do not take account of the measures taken during the spread of the corona virus or its impact. Independently of this, it should primarily be assumed that decreasing demand for fossil fuels due to climate protection measures leads to falling energy prices. At the same time, increasing demand for bioenergies and hydrogen leads to rising prices. The effects of national measures on the international fuel markets should be estimated as low.  There is a slightly stronger influence  particularly on electric neighbouring countries  for electricity prices. A central measure of the Climate Action Programme is the phasing out of coal-fired power generation. At the same time, electricity generation from renewable energy sources is increasing. With high EU ETS prices, an increasing share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption leads in the long term to falling wholesale prices in Germany and in other member states. As the procurement costs play a central role in the level of end customer electricity prices, there are direct effects on consumers.  Table B38 summarises the energy prices that formed the basis for the projection for the Climate Action Programme scenario or were calculated on the basis of this. In general it should be noted that taxes, surcharges and fees are levied on the final consumer prices for natural gas and electricity. These price components refinance grid infrastructure and the growth of renewable energies, for example. In the interests of climate protection and considerations relating to energy policy and (in particular) distribution policy, it is, however, possible to conceive of other detailed refinancing routes which differ from the refinancing routes that are directly or implicitly assumed in this model. Against this backdrop, long-term trends in final consumer prices for fuels and electricity depend on various factors, including (global) price and cost developments, and are correspondingly uncertain.  For gas prices, there is a price rise for all consumer groups which is reflected in the slight increase in international gas prices. In addition, the increase can be traced back to the initially moderate CO2 pricing. For this reason, the prices are partly above the level of the baseline scenario (see Table B38).  The development of electricity prices is characterised by the demand for electricity during the implementation 167  of a stronger sectoral coupling for heat and transport. At the same time, the decrease in fees achieved by income from CO2 pricing for fossil fuels contributes to a decrease in electricity prices. As a result, the prices remain stable or decrease slightly. Compared to the baseline without the Climate Action Programme, consumer groups mainly profit from comparatively low electricity prices, which until now did not enjoy any exemptions from charges on electricity prices.  In this projection for the Climate Action Programme scenario, PtX products will not be used until the late 2020s. However, a stronger cost degression than in the baseline scenario has been assumed where no PtX products are used.

This estimate is based on an external report for the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy. The report shows that if the integration of the European electricity market continues to develop as planned, conventional power stations can be successively reduced without affecting the current level of security of supply in the European electricity system until 2030. In addition, the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy carries out regular monitoring of the security of supply in the area of grid-based supply of electricity and natural gas.  168  Integration of the energy market  A central point for the integration of the energy market is the further extension of trading capacities between member states. The direct and indirect network expansion measures aimed at in the Climate Action Programme create a basis for further reinforcement of electricity trading with electricity neighbour countries. Increasing cross-border trade helps to better integrate renewable energy sources in the electricity system and to use adjustable capacities and flexibility options more efficiently and to harmonise wholesale electricity prices. This enables electricity system costs to be reduced in all countries. The energy mix of German electricity imports will reflect the energy mix of the surrounding states from which Germany obtains electricity. Depending on the market situation, this will include varying proportions of electricity from renewable energies (wind, solar, hydropower, bioenergy) and from conventional energy sources (in particular coal, natural gas and nuclear energy23). The proportion of the latter may change due to reduction paths in some neighbouring states.  The significance of (net) energy imports of individual energy sources in relation to the relevant primary energy consumption does not change substantially up to 2030 due to the measures of the Climate Action Programme. Table B39 shows the development of net imports in the Climate Action Programme scenario. Changes to the baseline (cf. Section 4.4.ii; Table B39) are minimal. The middle of the decade onward will see a small extension of the first production capacities for electrolytically generated hydrogen in Germany, which will be used exclusively in mineral oil refineries. The increasing final energy consumption of hydrogen in the transport sector will be covered exclusively by imports from abroad until 2030. Domestic production capacities will be built up only slowly in the following years.

Possible effects on regional cooperation  Electricity Regional cooperation is expected to become increasingly important in the electricity system. The more closely national electricity systems are interconnected, the greater the importance of regular exchange between the states at regional level. Firstly, this enables a more intensive exchange of information than would be possible at European level. Secondly, region-specific aspects can be addressed better at regional level and suitable solutions found.  Thirdly, new, innovative, cross-border approaches to the operation of the electricity system that are absolutely essential in a system undergoing fundamental change can most easily be tried out in the context of regional cooperation. Joint learning curves can thus be organised before the tested measures go on to become the European standard.                                                             23 Eurostat regards nuclear energy as a domestic primary energy source. When examined in this way, the use of nuclear energy to generate electricity does not therefore increase dependency on imports. Only the balance of trade (net quantity) is shown for electricity. No distinction is made between the individual generation technologies. 169  Natural gas  In Germany and many of its neighbouring states there are intensive efforts to decarbonise the remaining gas requirements. By 2030 this may mean that the current pipeline infrastructure, where it is to be used for transporting hydrogen in future, will also have to be tested and if necessary upgraded across national borders to accommodate hydrogen admixtures; other pipelines could be completely converted for hydrogen transportation. This will require more extensive bilateral and regional coordination to achieve the corresponding cost-efficient upscaling.  Petroleum  Since 1995, the consumption of fuel oil has more than halved in Germany. The new measures of the Climate Action Programme 2030 and the many incentive programmes to increase energy efficiency, particularly in the area of housing, substantially support this trend and will lead to a sharp decrease in the consumption of fuel oil over the next few years. This move away from oil consumption for heating has led on the one hand to the development of environmentally sound fuel technologies, and on the other to the need to develop new -fuels). At the same time, the significance of regional/international cooperation will increase. Particularly against the background of the development of new technical usage systems for fuel oil and new developments of fuels for the future, cross-border cooperation takes on greater relevance. It is sufficient to develop solutions for new heating systems or drive systems on a national level while these hypotheses are still being discussed at laboratory level. If developments achieve market readiness, an international cooperation is essential in order for them to become established on the market.
