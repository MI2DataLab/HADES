Trends in GHG emissions and removals  This section presents the current GHG emissions and removals in the EU ETS, effort sharing and LULUCF sectors and different energy sectors. 159  According to the latest GHG inventory report submitted to the UNFCCC secretariat in November 201968, the total greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 (including LULUCF) were 8429 Gg CO2 eq., showing a decrease of 6% between 2005 and 2017. Compared to 1990, total emissions increased by 55% (Figure 4.1). High dependence of the energy sector on fossil fuels, of transport on private cars and of solid waste management on landfilling is evident in the trends and associated to high values of the greenhouse gas intensity indicator compared to other member states of the European Union. The reduction in emissions during the recent years is predominately due to the increased RES penetration in the final consumption, the energy efficiency improvement measures and the economic recession. The impact of anaerobic digestion for the treatment of animal waste also slightly stabilises the agricultural emissions. The contribution of the energy sector in the overall greenhouse gas emissions is the highest when compared to emission produced by other sectors of the economy. In particular, fossil fuel combustion for the electricity generation and heat constitutes the most important factor which contributes to the development of the existing situation.  Figure 4.1: GHG emissions by sector for the period 1990  2017 Figure 4.2 shows the development emissions with respect to the year 2005 in the total greenhouse gas emissions as well as the sectoral trends. More specifically, the reduction of emissions in the energy sector has been significant (reduction of 7% for 2017 with respect to the year 2005 [after an increase of 9% observed by 2008]) and along with agriculture, was higher than the corresponding percentage reduction achieved in the total of the emissions sectors. Greenhouse gas emissions in industrial processes increased by 8% while emission from waste management showed the largest increase compared to 2005 (17%). The increase in emissions of the IPPU sector is a result in the increase in the use of fluorinated gases, while for waste the increase is attributed to the increase of solid waste production.                                                            68 https://unfccc.int/documents/201011 (CRF tables only) -202468101214-200002000400060008000100001200019901992199419961998200020022004200620082010201220142016t CO2 eq./capita Gg CO2 eq.

These installations contributed 52% to the total national emissions in 2017.  Figure 4.3: Contribution of ETS and non-ETS emissions to the total (excluding LULUCF emissions) According to the latest GHG inventory, the majority of the non-ETS emissions come from road transport with 49% (Figure 4.4), followed by non-ETS energy (18%), solid and liquid waste management (14%), agriculture (12%) and use of fluorinated gases (6%). The remaining 2% comes from non-ETS industrial processes. For the ETS sectors, the majority of the emissions come from the production of electricity (70% in 2017) followed by cement production (29% in 2017) and ceramics (1% in 2017) (Figure 4.5). 60%70%80%90%100%110%120%2005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017Change compared to 2005 TotalEnergyIPPUAgricultureWaste0200040006000800010000120001990199119921993199419951996199719981999200020012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017ETSESD161   Figure 4.4: Contribution of non-ETS sectors to emissions (excluding LULUCF emissions)  Figure 4.5: Contribution of ETS sectors to ETS emissions  The contribution of the energy-related activities to the total emissions of the energy sector is presented in Figure 4.6.

In some occasions, absorptions reduce or there is even emission from the sector, due to wildfires.

Projections with existing national and Union policies and measures This section presents the projection of emissions based on expected sectoral developments with existing national and Union policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030). Establishing and implementing the policies and measures described in the section outlining existing measures, it is assessed that the greenhouse gas emissions outside the EU ETS will reduce to 3829 Gg CO2 eq. in 2030 as shown in Figure 4.8, which corresponds to a reduction of 10.2% compared to 2005. 010002000300040005000600070008000900019901991199219931994199519961997199819992000200120022003200420052006200720082009201020112012201320142015201620175.

A sharp decrease in the ETS emissions is expected in 2021, with the introduction of natural gas for electricity production.  Figure 4.8:  Projected greenhouse gas emissions with existing policies and measures Figure 4.9 shows the expected emissions until 2040 with respect to the year 2005 in the total greenhouse gas emissions as well as the sectoral trends. In the future, considerable reduction in emissions is expected from the waste sector, due to the implementation of the new EU waste and circular economy obligations (25% in 2030 compared to 2005). The energy sector also shows a notable reduction of 20% until 2030 compared to 2005. The agricultural and industrial processes sectors are expected to stabilise their emissions due to the limitations these sectors have in reducing emissions.

Renewable energy 4.2.2.1. i. Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in each of these sectors Cyprus must comply with a national renewable energy target currently set at 13% of gross final energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020. The renewable energy share for the power sector has been set at 16%, for heating and cooling 23.5% and for transport 4.9% (10% according to RES directive) by 2020 in the first National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP)69  The existing contribution of RES in Cyprus is listed in Table 4.2. From the preliminary results of 2018 it seems that Cyprus can exceed the overall target of 2020 for 13% of RES based on directive 2009/28/EC, since the RES contribution in 2018 was calculated at 13.8%. This is not the case though for transport target, while there are a lot of efforts needed in the next period to achieve the RES target. Table 4.2: Existing Status of RES in Final Energy Consumption as per 2009/28/EC provisions  2015 2016 2017 2018* RES in Heating and Cooling 23.60% 23.72% 24.95% 36.76% RES in Final Electricity Consumption 8.48% 8.64% 8.98% 9.36% RES in Transport 2.45% 2.65% 2.53% 2.69% Total RES in final Energy Consumption   9.27% 9.72% 13.8% Indicative Target for RES 7.45% 9.47% *preliminary Results from Eurostat 70 The leading technology in Cyprus due to favourable conditions is the Solar Technology where the solar thermal contribution, by the end of 2018 had a significant share of more than 44%. What is interesting though (as it will be explained in sections below) is the contribution also of heat-pumps and local biomass that had played a significant role in achieving the RES target of 2020. The 13% target RES share in gross final energy consumption in Cyprus by 2020 was achieved, without the anticipated contribution from transport (10 % RES) since an equal amount of RES was used in heating sector. The general target of 13 % was attained in a more cost-effective manner. The RES contribution in transport in Cyprus has resulted entirely from the obligation imposed in 2011 on all transport fuel suppliers, to mix biofuels that meet the sustainability criteria with conventional transport fuels (petrol and diesel) with a view to ensuring that the average annual biofuel energy content of conventional fuels represents 2.4% of the total energy content of the conventional fuels they place on the market. This obligation has remained unchanged to date (RAA 431/2011).                                                            69 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/EnergySe.nsf/All/24D7A7A5980258B7C225822F0023CC EC?OpenDocument 70 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/energy/data/shares 165   Figure 4.10: Share by Technology for Renewable Energy Share as of the end of 2018 To draw up a financially and technically optimal strategy for attaining the 10 % RES target in transport and to ensure the optimal penetration of alternative fuels in transport in Cyprus, conducted by GIZ GmbH71, which was financed by the SRSS (European Commission Structural Reform Support Services) and the German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy. The results of this study have been reviewed by the competent authorities in order to implement optimal actions towards attaining the 10 % RES target in transport by 2020. During the study the following concerns resulted:  The 10 % RES consumption target in transport by 2020 is hard to attain and cost-ineffective for Cyprus due to a number of technical difficulties associated with its attainment.   The very hot climate of Cyprus combined with the volatile nature of bioethanol does not allow for using petrol mixed with bioethanol, as the petrol specification laid down in standard EN 228, the vapor pressure specifications in particular, is not met. The study recommended the use of petrol mixed with bioethers, as the specifications of petrol are met for petrol mixtures with bioethers up to 15%.  The cost-optimal option for attaining the 10% RES target in transport by 2020 is to use double counting biofuels. However, to attain the target, it is necessary to convert a large number of petrol-driven vehicles into diesel-driven ones (approximately 40 %), which is unrealistic within such a short period of time.   The study also recommended the use of B100 in buses (in approximately 50 % of the fleet) as the most cost-effective method for attaining the 10 % RES target in transport. Due to restrictions in the contracts with public transport companies and other technical obstacles, the use of B100 in buses cannot be implemented till 1.1.2020.                                                            71  Solar thermal 30.98% Biofuels 3.85% Biomass 27.31% Electricity from PV  7.48% Electricity from biomass 1.94% Electricity from wind 8.22% Geothermal 0.67% Heat-Pumps 19.55% 166  The detailed analysis of the technologies used are published in the RES progress report for 2014-201672. The progress report for 2017-2018 is not available yet and it will be published in the MECI website once it is available.  In the section below a breakdown for the various technologies used in each category is shown, based on the analysis performed during the studies of SRSS (SRSS/C2018/070 & SRSS/C2017/077) for the NECP. Full reports of the above studies and analysis is listed in the MECI website73.  Electricity from RES The technologies used in Cyprus are Solar Photovoltaics, Wind Parks and Biomass plants that producing Biogas from animal Waste. The breakdown of the generation in GWh is presented in Table 4.3.

The biofuels used were the total sustainable biofuels, produced from feedstock listed in Annex IX Part B of Directive (EE) 2015/1513. The average RES share in transport in the two-year period 2017-2018 was 2,64 % and had no significant increase. The intermediate targets specified in the National Action Plan, for the two-year periods concerned, were not attained. In the two-year period 2017-2018, there was a small increase in the use of biofuels produced from used cooking oil, the contribution of which towards a 10 % RES target in transport is twice their energy content. All the biofuel used in 2018 was produced from used cooking oil.                                                             72 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/EnergySe.nsf/All/24D7A7A5980258B7C225822F0023CCEC?OpenDocument 73 http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/energyse.nsf/page27_gr/page27_gr?OpenDocument 167  Table 4.4: RES contribution in Transport Sector  Current Status  2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 RES contribution in Transport Sector 2.69% 2.59% 2.69% 2.52% 2.68% 2.6% Heating and Cooling Solar Thermal: Solar Panels for hot water use and for heating purposes.

Based on the methodology followed (as defined in Article 5(1)(b) and (4) of Directive 2009/28/EC) there was a significant increase in RES share in heating due to Renewable Energy from heat-pumps. In addition, there was a re-assessment from Statistical Service of Cyprus as far as it concerns the wood biomass for house use. The results of the recent assessment were submitted to Eurostat and a historical re-adjustment was made for the previous years as well. This re-adjustment has not affected the historical records of Cyprus and is not expected to affect the future RES share in this sector, since there is a declining trend of using wood-based biomass for home heating purposes. 168  4.2.2.2. ii. Indicative projections of development with existing policies for the year 2030 (with an outlook to the year 2040) In the short-term, as oil-fired generation is substituted by gas-fired generation, decarbonisation of the electricity sector is achieved to an extent. A key finding in the electricity supply sector is that conventional thermal generation retains its share of the generation mix in absolute terms until 2030 and 2040. However, growing electricity needs are satisfied by increased penetration of renewable energy technologies, and primarily an increasing deployment of solar photovoltaics. This is driven by decreasing capital cost of photovoltaics, and enabled by substantial investments in flexible thermal generation, as well as partial electrification of the transport sector. Renewable energy share in electricity reaches 26.5% by 2030. All the existing policies and measures for Self-Consumption will continue, and the participation of RES in the electricity market will materialized. In the scenario WEM there is a lack of substantial policies and measures in the transport sector and the dependence on passenger cars and marginalisation of public transport modes. Nonetheless, improvements in alternative technology performance and cost lead to the adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles, whose total corresponds to nearly 10% of the total passenger fleet by 2030. Continued investments in renewable energy, and especially solar thermal in buildings, increases the renewable energy share in the Heating and Cooling sector by 10% till 2030. The overall RES share increases to 20% by 2030 instead of 23% as recommended by EU, which is not adequate to meet the EU indicative targets. The results as well as the policies and measures of this scenario are included in the Appendix 4 and Deliverable 3 of the Impact Assessment study. Scenario WEM Results for RES From Figure 4.11 it clear that the transport sector is lagging behind while the other sectors, i.e. Electricity and heating and cooling have a constant increase of their RES contribution over the Horizon 2021-2030. It should be noted that the RES in transport is the most challenging sector, especially for Cyprus where there are not electric trams or adequate public transport (due to economies of scale) for public needs. In addition, the further penetration of Electric Vehicle (while there are favorable conditions in Cyprus due to the short distance and weather conditions) are not cost optimum to be deployed since the RES in electricity cannot further evolve due to the end of 2030. On the other hand, it is clear that as the RES electricity evolves the RES in Transport also increase in the post 2030 period. This is due to the significant reduction in purchase price of EVs. Also, during that period, the prices of Storage also decrease and thus more RES Technologies can enter into the Electricity System. 169   Figure 4.11: The evolution of RES in Sectors: Electricity, Heating and Cooling and Transport, till 2040 in the scenario WEM For the electricity sector, from the evolution of Technologies, in the case of no Electricity Interconnector, there is an increase need of Storage Technologies in order to avoid curtailing energy. It is more likely in order to avoid distorting the energy prices that RET can be curtailed without compensation if TSO requests to do so because of system security concerns, and no cap is set on max curtailment which creates a substantial risk for Renewable Energy Technology investors. As it is shown in sector 3.1.2 the use of Interconnector can help the RES to further penetrate earlier, while in the WEM scenario it seems that more RES will be introduced in the post 2030 period with technologies that using storage behind the meter. These technologies, based on the existing available data, include Concentrated Solar Thermal (CSP) and other storage technologies like Li-Ion Batteries and Pumped Hydro. A detailed overview of Storage technologies that can be deployed in Cyprus was made under an SRSS study by University of Cyprus74 and JRC75. The scenario results (WEM) have not evaluated the possibility and the effects of the Electricity Market.  The outcome of the above scenario (WEM) as far as it concerns the final technology mix is presented in Table 4.6 and the corresponding electricity generation is displayed in Figure 4.2.2.2.                                                                74http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/EnergySe.nsf/All/4CFADF62B303D228C22584D6004AAB42/$file/JRC%203-%20Storage.pdf 75 JRC Study for Storage 0.00%10.00%20.00%30.00%40.00%50.00%60.00%70.00%80.00%2020202120222023202420252026202720282029203020352040RES-H&C shareRES-E shareRES-T shareRES in Gross Final Energy Consumption170  Table 4.6: RES Technologies in Electricity Sector up to 2040  MW 2021 2025 2030 2035 2040 Light fuel oil CHP 0 0 0 4 26 Solar PV 380 468 750 1,447 1,631 Solar Thermal 0 50 50 350 700 Wind 158 198 198 198 198 Biogas 22 42 50 50 64 Pumped Hydro 0 0 130 130 130 Li-Ion Batteries 0 22 41 97 179   Figure 4.12.

Due to the lacking of methodological guidelines on how to account for renewable cooling, cooling currently does not play a role for target achievement. In addition, there were some technologies that were not examined in this scenario such as Open loop geothermal Technology and Process heat applications using Solar thermal (CSP technologies) or Solar Cooling (and Cooking) using solar panels or CSP Fresnel Technology.   - 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000202020212022202320242025202620272028202920302031203220332034203520362037203820392040Generation (GWh) DieselHFOGasWindSolar PVSolar ThermalBiomassNet ImportsDemand171   Figure 4.13: Heating and Cooling Share in towards 2040 in WEM Scenario As it is shown in Figure 4.2.2.4, while there is a significant solar potential in Cyprus, the increase of solar technologies is limited. The high penetration of solar water heaters limits the room for further development in the domestic hot water sector since almost the 92% of households and more than 55% of Commercial applications are using already the above technology. It should also be noted that based on the findings of a long term research study76 (see Figure 4.12) the heating needs for Cyprus will be reduced and this is also fact from the preliminary results of November 2019 (was the 2nd hottest November in last 140 years77).  This implies that the assumptions used in other modelling tools (as in IDEES (EU-JRC) Database) differ due to the fact that the heating degree days (HDD) and Cooling Degree Days (CDD) are not in line with the forecast of Figure 4.12. In other words, the impacts of the climate change and the increase in temperature will affect the days that the cooling will be needed based on thermal comfort while in contrary will reduce the days needed for heating. Based on the above it seems that the future trend in total average energy consumption will be increased especially for Cyprus, and thus the RES penetration will be reduced, since the RES technologies available at the moment in Cyprus that can produce renewable cooling are limited only to Solar Cooling, which is very expensive and not a mature technology.                                                             76 Zachariades and Hadjinicolaou, 2014 77 http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/ms/ms.nsf/DMLindex_gr/DMLindex_gr 0.0%10.0%20.0%30.0%40.0%50.0%60.0%0.005.0010.0015.0020.0025.0030.0035.00201720192021202320252027202920312033203520372039% RES PJ ElectricityHeating oil/light fuel oil/Gas OilPet CokeLPGBiomassGeothermalSolarRES share
