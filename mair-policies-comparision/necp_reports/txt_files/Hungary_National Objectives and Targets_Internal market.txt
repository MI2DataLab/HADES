FGSZ, as TSO, has drawn up its Ten-year Development Plan for the year 2018 relating to the Hungarian interconnected natural gas system based on proposals received from system operators involved in operating the high-pressure natural gas transmission system, and on other relevant information. Projects planned for implementation between 2019 and 2022:  Projects proposed for unconditional implementation during the next three years43  irrespective of the outcome of the HU-SK-AT44 and RO-HU45 projects  to ensure the security of supply: - Development aimed at implementing automatic reversal in Balassagyarmat, Szada, - Upgrade of Balassagyarmat metering installation to 800 em3/h, - m3/h capacity metering, - Security of supply in North-Eastern Hungary: Conversion of hubs at Városföld, Hajdúszoboszló, Nemesbikk, Beregdaróc.

(ii) Goals planned in relation to the utilisation rate of Hungarian gas pipelines: To increase the utilisation rate of energy infrastructures, reduce systemic costs and implement the climate-friendly transformation of the energy system, Hungary assigns a priority to implementing the most favourable heating and infrastructure solutions with the phasing out of energy infrastructures built in parallel, as regulated by Government Decision No 1772/2018 of 21 December 2018. (Further information is provided in point vi. of Chapter 3.2.) 2.4.3. Market integration i. National objectives related to other aspects of the internal energy market such as increasing system flexibility, in particular related to the promotion of competitively determined electricity prices in line with relevant sectoral law, market integration and coupling, aimed at increasing the tradeable capacity of existing interconnectors, smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re- dispatching and curtailment, and real-time price signals, including a timeframe for when the objectives shall be met Regional market integration facilitates the implementation of efficient trade flows, the balancing of demand and supply volatility between countries and improves the security of supply. The increase of cross-border capacities and the establishment of harmonised rules allowing efficient flows of electricity and natural gas between countries are the two prioritised objectives of energy market integration in the region. The drawing up of regulations enhancing the efficiency of wholesale and balancing markets should be continued; the framework of the above is provided by the implementation of European operational and operating regulations. Beyond the foregoing it is also necessary to promote projects enhancing the regional role and liquidity of Hungary's regulated electricity and gas markets. Electricity market (i) It is important to prevent outages in flexible capacities and to improve the capacity for flexibility. (Taking into account that flexibility is also justified for ensuring the security of supply, Chapter 2.3 also discusses this topic, and point ii. of this chapter is relevant in relation to energy storage and demand side responses.) (ii) Facilitating establishment of independent aggregators: the aggregation of consumers belonging to various consumer segments also plays an important role in exploiting consumer-side flexibility. Local energy communities represent a special form of aggregation based on renewable energy production. They contribute to ensuring the local consumption (e.g. within a transformer zone) of produced energy and that production fluctuations do not load the distribution network. (iii) Preparation of the electricity network for the growing spread of decentralised capacities. (This is also a relevant goal in relation to the security of supply. Further information is provided in Chapter 2.3.) (iv) Increase of cross-border capacities: Although the capacity of high-voltage cross-border lines reaches 50 % of Hungarian gross installed capacities, and Hungary can import electricity from all neighbouring countries, with the exception of Slovenia, the relatively limited capacities with Austria and Slovakia still limit imports of cheaper electricity. Due to limited cross-border capacities, the price of Hungarian wholesale electricity remains higher than in neighbouring countries. Based on a broad comparison in Hungary's region, Hungarian wholesale prices are relatively high (details relating to price trends are provided in Chapter 4.5.3). Further strengthening of regional market integration is therefore justified in this regard as well. (v) Market coupling: beyond the increase of cross-border capacities, it is also necessary to increase market coupling and to improve the efficiency of operating coupled markets. To this end, we aim to further enhance the coupling of both intra-day and day-ahead markets on the electricity market, and to  efficiently operate these markets. This, however, requires the coordinated determination of transfer capacities and their availability for trading. (vi) Encouragement of the market launch of innovative energy supply solutions. Gas market As a result of regulatory changes and infrastructure investments implemented in the past decade, a diversified supply model has evolved on the basis of multiple sources of supply. With the exception of Slovenia, Hungary has established gas network connections with all neighbouring countries. The expansion of import opportunities and the availability of alternative trade routes significantly contributed to the decline in domestic gas prices (see Chapter 4.5.3. for details on price trends). In the future Hungary aims to facilitate the operation of an integrated gas market, enabling the sustainable reduction of consumer energy costs, in accordance with relevant EU directives and regulations. The increase and optimisation of Hungary's natural gas purchase options offers is the biggest guarantee for achieving the above goal, and also guarantees the security of supply. The above is also crucial for the implementation of infrastructure development. In the short term, Hungary's key objective is the management of risks that threaten these favourable conditions due to the uncertainty of the route of Russian deliveries to Europe. The efforts aimed at ensuring the security of supply - presented in point i. of Chapter 3.3 - also advance regional gas market integration through the diversification of sources and routes. Although only a minimal quantity of gas can currently be imported from Croatia, Romania and Serbia due to lagging development in the partner countries, a real reverse flow interconnection from Romania46 and Croatia is already under implementation, and there are negotiations under way for ensuring access to Russian sources from Serbia expected to become available from 2021. Access to the LNG terminal planned on the island of Krk renders the establishment of potential gas imports from Croatia particularly important for Hungary. The above option, namely, would provide access to potentially competitively priced gas sources (with global prices similar to those of oil) for traders involved in supply in Hungary. This would also bolster Hungary's bargaining position vis-à-vis Russia in negotiations on improving the competitiveness of Croatian LNG, which in practice would lead to the elimination of cross-border tariffs. Negotiations on market integration  which may also contribute to the improved use of Hungarian storage capacities47  commenced in July 2019. To ensure implementation of the Croatian LNG                                                       46 In the first phase of upgrading the Romanian-Hungarian interconnection  expected in the second half of 2020  an uninterruptible transfer capacity of 896 678 kWh/h, i.e. 1.75 billion m3 annually, will become available from Romania to Hungary as well. 47 Storage capacity could become an important pillar of Croatian-Hungarian market coupling.  project, consultations are also held on acquisition of a Hungarian stake. The promotion of gas market integration in the region is a strategic goal going beyond the LNG project; a market free of cross-border tariffs, operating with single wholesale price signals can lead to more effective competition, lower prices and greater security of supply. We are therefore also exploring market coupling options with Slovakia, Slovenia, Austria and Romania. In parallel with the promotion of market integration, Hungary also aims to further strengthen the liquidity and regional price indicator function of CEEGEX, the Hungarian gas exchange. It is additionally aiming to support natural gas market integration by devising a regional sales model for its storage capacities. Sector coupling As regards integration, Hungary also aims to promote the interconnection of the production processes of various forms of energy (electricity and heat, and fuels). The gas and electricity markets are already connected ng cycles and regulatory framework is a priority. (Additional information on sector coupling is provided in point i. of Chapter 4.5.3.) ii. Where applicable, national objectives related to the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets, including a time-frame for when the objectives are to be met To ensure cost-effective levels of aid, in the future, aid within the REAS framework will only be available through technology-neutral renewable capacity tenders (details on the REAS scheme are provided in Chapter 3.1.2); production aid will be available within the conventional feed-in system only for experimental technologies and model projects. The first successful REAS tender launched in the autumn of 2019 demonstrated that the amount of necessary aid is adjusted to declining investment costs. The tender launched in the autumn of 2019 can ensure the adjustment of the amount of aid to decreasing investment costs. As regards the effective integration of renewables, a greater contribution of renewables producers to the reliable operation of the system is a key factor in the future. To ensure the cost-effective integration of renewables it is necessary to encourage the use of innovative technologies (energy storage, increased capacities of existing network elements) and operating modes (demand side responses) that support improvement of the dispatchability of the electricity system by also minimising the necessity of network development investments (and their costs) and allow the integration of decentralised energy production based on renewable energy sources to the extent possible. (Chapter 2.3 on the security of supply is also relevant in relation to storage and demand side responses.)   iii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to ensuring that consumers participate in the energy system and benefit from self-generation and new technologies, including smart meters The falling cost of renewable energy production, digitalisation and the growing affordability of smart metering are leading to a major paradigm shift: replaced with that of the active (partially self-sufficient) prosumer. This necessitates complex, differentiated energy policy solutions for consumer segments and at the same time a tailored and flexible approach, with the development of diversified service packages. A fundamental prerequisite for active consumer participation on the market is the regulation of consumption in cases where this is not yet possible. The more extensive use of smart meters in the electricity and natural gas sectors, appropriate implementation of heating centres serving homes with district heating, controllability of the systems and the wide ranging use of cost allocators, establishment of the active system operation capacity of distributors will allow consumers to receive accurate information on their energy consumption, competitive service plan offers from their suppliers with the maintained or improved quality of service. (Further information on goals relating to smart metering is provided in point vi. of Chapter 3.2.) Ensuring regulation of consumption not only enables active consumer participation in the electricity system, and thereby their participation in demand-side responses (DSR), but also facilitates consumer control of overhead costs. To this end, in relation to households and small corporate consumers, independent aggregators (a special form of energy communities) are needed, which combine several consumer load or production units for buying and selling on a regulated energy market (exchange, day-ahead market (DAM), intraday market (IDM), system level services market, local distribution flexibility market). With the spread of household-sized PV panels, a growing number of consumers can generate their own energy, which not only offers the option of a more active presence on the market beyond the conscious regulation of consumption, but also strengthens energy independence on a household scale. (Point v. of Chapter 2.1.2 provides additional details on enhancing energy production for private purposes, and the establishment and support of energy communities.)  iv. National objectives with regard to ensuring electricity system adequacy, as well as for the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production, including a time-frame for when the objectives shall be met The priority of improving flexibility should be ensured within the entire value-added chain, from the provision of resources to production and energy transmission, distribution and energy consumption (demand side). The reserve requirements of the electricity system and the determination of technical reserve requirements is in each case adjusted to the characteristics of the current system, in accordance with  Regulation (EU) 2017/1485, including the share of renewable energy. Such determination takes into account the maximum expected contingency and the expected balancing demand, together with the related probability distribution. At least 50 % of reserve capacity requirements - determined according to the methodology of the Regulation - must be provided from national sources. Points (i) and (ii) of this chapter and Chapter 2.3 present other flexibility objectives (including those related to energy storage and demand side responses).  v. Where applicable, national objectives to protect energy consumers and improve the competitiveness of the retail energy sector Low overhead costs, strengthening energy independence, broad freedom of choice: these values are relevant for consumers, which build on solutions proposed by the consumer-oriented energy strategy. The focus on consumers is expressed on multiple levels of the new Hungarian energy strategy, in the main programmes and objectives. Support of household energy production for private purposes  thereby encouragement of consumers to become energy producers (prosumers)  and facilitation of the use of smart meters are all means of shifting focus on consumers. On the side of suppliers and network operators, the sustainable reduction of overhead costs is supported by strengthening wholesale market competition, establishment of the smart grid and limits to infrastructure operating costs. On the side of consumers, a decline in demand through conscious energy consumption, use of opportunities offered by decentralised household energy production and optimisation of supply methods can contribute to cost-effective energy supply. In relation to point iii. of this chapter it may be necessary to carry out the conceptual reform of administrative price control of electricity, natural gas and district heat. In relation to electricity and natural gas, one option is the review of eligibility for universal service  in accordance with Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council48 and in relation to requirements set out in Government Decision No 1772/2018 of 21 December 201849  and the offer of different service packages within the framework supply, maintaining the results of the reduction of overhead costs. In relation to district heat, the option is to review the aid scheme, as the currently applied methodology does not encourage the cost-effective implementation of investments necessary for the modernisation and greening of the district heating system. Customers (consumers) should be projected a vision that not only reinforces the prosumer concept, but in which suppliers  offering flexible choices  can also play an active role. Due mainly to the fixed and cost-                                                      48 Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU (recast). 49 Government Decision No 1772/2018 of 21 December 2018 on decisions laying the groundwork for a new National Energy Strategy.  based nature of pricing, competitiveness of the sector can be ensured through the emergence of customer side needs to the extent possible and the development of satisfying such needs. For this reason we aim to enhance services provided to energy final customers (mainly those eligible for universal services) and establish regulatory conditions necessary for improving the customer experience. The programme covers the development of digital administration channels, introduction of digital signatures and the design of a consumer-friendly invoice template. Participants of the energy supply market assign a priority to vital systems and system components when repairing disruptions in energy supply. A sectoral regulatory framework  covering aspects of both procedural law and technology  should be drawn up that ensures the definition of exceptions and priorities necessary for the continuity of supply for organisations, service providers and operators involved in remedial and restoration measures. When planning and providing services, participants of the energy supply market should take into account dependencies between individual critical infrastructure sectors. To this end, legal standards ensuring effective protection measures should be drawn up after assessing the particular sectoral characteristics. 2.4.4. Energy poverty (i) Where applicable, national objectives with regard to energy poverty, including a time-frame for when the objectives are to be met The Government measures launched in January 2013, concerning consumers falling within the scope of universal services, have been guaranteeing affordable energy supply and financial foreseeability to consumers of universal services through fixed universal service tariffs for more than half a decade. As a result of reduced energy overhead costs, district heating, natural gas and electricity50 became extremely cheaper compared to the year 2013, thus the household energy costs of Hungarian consumers are one of the lowest in Europe. Hungary will measure the success of policies aimed at further easing heating related difficulties by monitoring the share of households spending at least 25 % of their income on energy costs (9.8 % in 2016). Hungary needs to assist, in particular, vulnerable consumer groups. In this regard we will mainly focus on two clearly distinct social groups: large families living in single-family houses in small municipalities and single pensioners living in apartment blocks (or to a lesser extent in single-family houses).51 The lignite-fired Mátra Power Plant plays an important role not only in energy production but also on the labour market, therefore  (for further details see point of Chapter 2.3).                                                       50 http://mekh.hu/download/8/22/c0000/nemzetkozi_arosszehasonlitas_2019_december.pdf 51 Századvég (2019): Strategic study  Survey of Hungarian energy poverty, drafting of policy proposals aimed at its mitigation, in consideration of the separation of energy and social policies to the maximum extent possible.
