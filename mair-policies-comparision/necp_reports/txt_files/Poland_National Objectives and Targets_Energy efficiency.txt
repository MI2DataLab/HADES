  II. II. National objectives and targets - Dimension Energy efficiency 29  2.2. Energy efficiency The objectives and priority lines related to the energy efficiency dimension are set out by sectoral development strategies, primarily by:  Draft Polish Energy Policy  strategy for the development of the fuel and energy sector (November 2019).  Sustainable Transport Development Strategy 2030 of 24 September 2019 The above strategies identify the entities responsible for the implementation of individual activities and define the funding framework. a) Indicative national energy efficiency contribution to achieving the  referred to in Article 1(1) and Article 3(4) of Directive 2012/27/EU, as amended by Directive 2018/20029, based on either primary or final energy consumption, primary or final energy savings, or energy intensity; expressed in terms of the absolute level of primary energy consumption and final energy consumption in 2020 and 2030, with a linear trajectory for that contribution from 2021 onwards; including the underlying methodology and the conversion factors used In its energy policy, Poland will continue to pursue directions contributing to an increase in energy efficiency. Improving energy efficiency is horizontal in nature and produces positive effects in all sectors of the economy, helping to enhance their competitiveness. Improving energy efficiency limits the increase in demand for fuels and energy, enhancing energy security through reduced energy demand and dependence on imports, and works to mitigate environmental impacts of the energy sector by supporting rational use of resources, abating pollution and GHG emissions, and reducing waste. Pro-efficiency measures produce real effects by reducing energy costs. They also involve the implementation of new technologies and enhance innovation of the economy, improving its attractiveness and competitiveness. As at 2020, Poland confirms the target for reducing primary energy consumption at forecast (PRIMES  Baseline 2007). In absolute terms, the target translates into primary consumption at a level of 96.4 Mtoe and final consumption reaching 71.6 Mtoe in 2020. On the basis of an analysis of the effects and impact on the GDP and the potential for savings, Poland declares a national 2030 energy efficiency improvement target of 23% for primary energy consumption compared to the PRIMES 2007 forecast. As is projected by this National Energy and Climate Plan, in 2030, primary energy consumption will be around 91.3 Mtoe, which means that, in natural values, the above target will translate into a reduction of primary energy consumption by approx. 27.3 Mtoe compared to the PRIMES 2007 forecast (which estimates primary energy consumption at approximately 118.6 Mtoe for the year). The projected final energy consumption until 2030 will be around 67 Mtoe, and therefore the measures provided for in the National Plan will lead to a reduction of final energy consumption by around 18.4 Mtoe compared to the PRIMES 2007 forecasts. In the period 2021-2030, Poland will continue to apply the energy efficiency obligation  Detailed information on absolute levels of primary and final energy consumption in the                                             9 Directive (EU) 2018/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 amending Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency (OJ L328, 21.12.2018).  II. II. National objectives and targets - Dimension Energy efficiency 30  years 2020 and 2030, along with the linear trajectory of the associated contribution, is included in the analytic b) Aggregate value of energy savings to be achieved in the period 2021-2030 in accordance with Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU, as amended by Directive 2018/2002, which concerns energy saving commitment. The total cumulative final energy savings in the period 2021-2030, calculated in accordance with the guidelines of the amended EED using forecasts on the annual average final energy consumption from the period 2016-2018, will amount to ca. 30,635 ktoe. For information on the methods and measures used by Poland to implement Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency see paragraph 5.1.3.3 of Annex 2. c) The indicative milestones of the long-term strategy for the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, the roadmap with domestically established measurable progress indicators, an evidence-based estimate of expected energy savings and wider benefits, and the contributions to the Union's energy efficiency targets pursuant to Directive 2012/27/EU in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU; Pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 2012/27/EU, 3% of the total heated or cooled area in buildings owned by governmental institutions and occupied by such institutions should undergo renovation on an annual basis in order to meet at least the minimum energy performance requirements determined with the application of Directive 2010/31/EU. The 2018 report, prepared in line with Part 1 of Annex XIV to Directive 2012/27/EU, shows savings of 4945.85 MWh attributable to such measures as improving the thermal transmittance parameters of public building envelopes, replacing window woodwork or lighting sources, or providing employees with internal training on how to save energy. Poland has adopted an alternative solution whereby the expected 2021-2030 target energy savings achievable as a result of measures improving the energy performance of buildings should amount to 43 440.1 MWh. The long-term renovation targets for the national housing stock are specified in the National Housing Plan: - the share of thermally insulated residential buildings in the total housing stock will amount to 70% in 2030 (as compared with 58.8% in 2015), - the number of people living in sub-standard conditions due to overpopulation, poor technical condition or absence of technical facilities will decrease to 3,300,000 in 2030 (from 5,360,000 in 2011). Poland is preparing a strategy for renovating the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private ones, which will be aimed at ensuring improved energy efficiency and low-emissiveness of the building stock, by facilitating a cost-effective transformation of existing buildings into nearly zero-energy ones. The Strategy will be communicated to the EC in line with the requirements of the revised Directive 2010/31/EU as a separate document, other than an annex to the National Energy and Climate Plan. d) If applicable, other national targets, including long-term targets or strategies and sectorial targets. National targets in areas such as energy efficiency in the transport sector and with regard to heating and cooling. 1. Development of environment-friendly and efficient district heating systems In 2018, only about 20% of the district heating or cooling systems that provide around 85% of the total district heat volume in the country meet the criterion of an energy-efficient system. It is expected that in 2030 at least 85% of district heating or cooling systems with an ordered capacity of more than 5 MW will meet the criteria of an energy-efficient heating system.  II. II. National objectives and targets - Dimension Energy efficiency 31   The above target will be pursued by the following activities: - development of cogeneration; - converting power plants into heat and power plants; - increasing the use of RES and natural gas in district heating; - increasing the utilisation of waste for energy purposes9; - modernisation and expansion of the heating and cooling distribution systems; - promoting heat storage facilities and smart networks; - promotion of smart networks; - ensuring conditions for increasing the use of district heating, especially through: - simplification of procedures for investing in district heating network infrastructure; - changing the heat market model and tariff policy. The demand for heat should primarily be satisfied through the use of district heat, which ensures that fuels are utilised efficiently, improves the quality of life for citizens, and -10. If connection to the heating network is not possible, efforts should be made to use individual sources with the lowest possible emissivity. In 2015, 61% of households were connected to district heating networks within urban areas  the objective is to increase this rate gradually. The target is to ensure that 70% of households within urban municipalities are connected to district heating networks by 2030. In accordance with the 2040 target set, the heating needs of all households are to be satisfied by district heating or zero- or low-emission heat sources. 2. Development of heat production in cogeneration processes Poland has potential for considerably increasing the production of heat in cogeneration processes by replacing heating boilers with cogeneration sources. Exploiting the potential for high-efficiency cogeneration will add efficiency to the use of primary energy carriers, reduce CO2 emissions, and decrease the resource intensity of the national economy. Support for electricity generated through high-efficiency cogeneration will be maintained. The scheme will be active as long as there is a need for market intervention. In the long run, district heat should be produced mainly through CHP.                                             10 See also Direction 8.
