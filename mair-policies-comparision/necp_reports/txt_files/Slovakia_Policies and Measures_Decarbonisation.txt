3.1. Dimension: decarbonisation 3.1.1. GHG emissions and removals  i. Policies and measures to achieve the target set under Regulation (EU) 2018/842 as referred in point 2.1.1 and policies and measures to comply with Regulation (EU) 2018/841, covering all key emitting sectors and sectors for the enhancement of removals, with an outlook to the long-term vision and goal to become a low emission economy and achieving a balance between emissions and removals in accordance with the Paris Agreement This chapter provides information on the most important policies and measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions with a base year of 2016. It describes both existing and planned measures. a) Sectoral policies and measures in the energy sector - In addition to the legislative instruments on the trading of greenhouse gas emission allowances, an important role is played by Act No 137/2010, on air protection, as amended, which serves to control and regulate emission limits through the introduction of emission limits for basic air pollutants. This Act is supplemented by Act No 401/1998, on air pollution charges, which serves as an economic tool to reduce emissions. Improving energy efficiency - Measures on the energy consumption side, pursuant to which energy savings are seen as a reduction in final energy consumption. These measures are broken down by sector (buildings, industry, public sector, transport and appliances). The measures set minimum requirements as regards the energy performance of new and existing buildings, and the renovation of buildings, the most important sources of potential energy savings to 2030. Greenhouse gases affected: CO2 Type of measure: regulatory  Condition: in force since 2014 Implemented in scenario: WEM Implementation of the EU Winter Package - The Winter Package, part of the implementation of the Energy Union, promotes the transition to clean energy and takes into account the impact of RES on heat and electricity generation. It is anticipated that the RES Directive will need to be revised and concrete recommendations will be prepared to meet the EU target of a 32% share of renewable energy in total consumption by 2030. Greenhouse gases affected: CO2 Type of measure: regulatory and economic Condition: in force since 2016 Implemented in scenario: WEM National Action Plan for Renewable Energy, Government Resolution No 677/2010 - The RES Action Plan sets out Slovakias national targets for the percentage of renewable energy consumed in the transport, electricity and heat and cooling sectors in 2020, the trajectories of anticipated growth in the use of RES in each sector in the 2010-2020 period, the measures to achieve the objectives, support systems, and the total anticipated contribution of measures for individual technologies to produce renewable energy and to achieve binding efficiency and energy savings targets. The RES Action Plan set RES targets (including for biomass, support for fast-growing tree species, and regulatory measures for technological innovation in timber felling, etc.). The Slovak Republic has an obligation to increase the use of renewable energy sources in relation to gross final energy  consumption from 6.7% in 2005 to 14% in 2020, which means partial targets of a 14.6% share of RES in heat and cold production, a 24% share of RES in electricity generation and a 10% share of RES in energy demanded in the transport sector. Greenhouse gases affected: CO2 Type of measure: regulatory and economic Condition: in force since 2011 Implemented in scenario: WEM Implementation of the European Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme - the EU ETS stimulates the use of biomass in the fuel mix of energy producers and motivates technological innovation. It also motivates the energy-efficient use of industrial waste gases. This policy is an economic and regulatory measure with a high positive impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases affected: CO2 Type of measure: regulatory and economic Condition: in force since 2013 Implemented in scenario: WEM District heating optimization - District heating optimization will be implemented by installing cogeneration units with combined heat and power (CHP) in district heating systems. Industrial cogeneration plants produce industrial steam, which can also be used for district heating. Other measures are also taken into account (e.g. improving the efficiency of district heating systems (DHS), installing innovative district heating technologies, and improving heat supply from combined heat and power plants). Greenhouse gases affected: CO2 Type of measure: regulatory Condition: in force since 2015 Implemented in scenario: WEM Termination of heating plants after 2025 - Gradual decommissioning of solid fossil fuel heating plants after 2025. Greenhouse gases affected: CO2 Type of measure: regulatory Condition: in force since 2015 Implemented in scenario: WEM EU ETS carbon price increases - The EU ETS carbon price affects both the energy sector and energy-intensive industries and is a major driver for reducing emissions. Electricity producers will have to exert pressure to raise the price of emission allowances to facilitate their own conversion from coal to gas. Greenhouse gases affected: CO2 Type of measure: regulatory and economic Condition: in force from 2020 Implemented in scenario: WAM Transformation of solid fossil fuel power plants  the termination of electricity generation in Nováky in the general economic interest in accordance with the Action Plan for the Transformation of the Upper Nitra Coal Region and Transformation of the Fuel Base at the Vojany power plant. In accordance with the Action Plan for the Transformation of Upper Nitra, the Nováky power plant, after its transformation from solid fossil fuels, can remain the primary heat source for the region.  The Vojany plant is being considered for transformation into a facility to use secondary fuels to free it from dependence on imported primary energy sources and to support the circular economy in the region. Greenhouse gases affected: CO2 Type of measure: regulatory and economic Condition: anticipated after 2023 Implemented in scenario: WAM Decarbonisation of electricity generation - Decarbonisation of electricity generation will be achieved through nuclear power plants and renewable sources, which will gradually replace electricity generation from fossil fuels. The suitable renewable energy technologies are solar photovoltaic power plants, onshore wind turbines and biomass. Greenhouse gases affected: CO2 Type of measure: regulatory Condition: anticipated after 2020 Implemented in scenario: WAM Increase the share of nuclear energy in the Slovak Republic energy mix - Increase the share of nuclear energy in the medium term (2020-2025) through the commissioning of two new nuclear reactors in Mochovce. Greenhouse gases affected: CO2 Type of measure: regulatory and economic Condition: anticipated after 2025 Implemented in scenario: WAM Continuation of the reduction in final energy consumption in all sectors - This measure emphasizes policies supporting faster renovation of old buildings compared to historical trends, and energy insulation for renovated buildings. Energy efficiency policies also include high standards for new buildings, support for heat recovery, best available techniques in industry (BAT including waste gas use), infrastructure as well as soft measures for greater efficiency in the transport sector. Greenhouse gases affected: CO2 Type of measure: regulatory and economic Condition: anticipated after 2020 Implemented in scenario: WAM b) Sectoral policies and measures in transport Environmental design and use of products - The aim of this measure is to reduce the environmental impact at all stages of the product life cycle. The measure lays down regulations for household appliances, motors and other electrical equipment with a negative environmental impact throughout the energy-using product life cycle (e.g. boilers, computers, cars, household appliances (white goods, black goods)). The automotive industry will be forced to take the entire life cycle of a vehicle into account. In addition to reducing fuel consumption and emissions, the actual production as well as the end-of-life phase of a vehicle must be taken into account. Ecodesign as a product development process identifies key environmental areas with an environmental impact throughout the product life cycle. It examines and evaluates all the activities, materials and substances associated with the sourcing of raw materials, and the production, distribution, use and final disposal of the product.  One challenge in the application of ecodesign in the automotive industry is the complex interactions between various, partly conflicting factors. The use of vehicles produced in this way will reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector.   Greenhouse gases affected: CO2 Type of measure: regulatory Condition: in force since 2010 Implemented in scenario: WEM CO2 emission standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, efficiency standards for trucks, together with transport electrification - Increasing vehicle efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars, light commercial vehicles and trucks. A reduction in fuel consumption in trucks is anticipated from increased engine and production efficiency. Greenhouse gases affected: CO2 Type of measure: regulatory Condition: in force since 2007 Implemented in scenario: WEM Promoting biofuels in road transport - Slovakia intends to accelerate the implementation of second-generation biofuels made from non-food crops such as wood, organic waste, waste from food crops and specific biomass crops. Operators must mix biofuels with a minimum energy content as follows: a) 5.8% in 2017, b) 5.8% in 2018, c) 6.9% in 2019, d) 7.6% in 2020, e) 8.0% in 2021, f) 8.2% between 2022 and 2030. The energy share from advanced biofuels must be at least: a) 0.1% in 2019; b) 0.5% between 2020 and 2024, c) 0.75% between 2025 and 2030.  Greenhouse gases affected: CO2, CH4 Type of measure: regulatory and economic Condition: in force since 2010 Implemented in scenario: WEM Electrification of transport - Increase the share of electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles to replace vehicles with internal combustion engines. Greenhouse gases affected: CO2 Type of measure: regulatory and economic Condition: anticipated after 2020 Implemented in scenario: WAM c) Sectoral policies and measures in agriculture New fertiliser management - Slovak Government Regulation No 342/2014, laying down rules for granting support in agriculture in the context of decoupled direct payment schemes. New measures on fertiliser handling and processing and the introduction of a new animal feeding policy.  Greenhouse gases affected: N2O Type of measure: economic and regulatory Condition: in force since 2015 Implemented in scenario: WEM   Implementation of a new animal feeding policy - Slovak Government Regulation No 342/2014, laying down rules for granting support in agriculture in the context of decoupled direct payment schemes. The measures include a reduction in the number of dairy cows and intensive feeding with active substances.  Greenhouse gases affected: CH4 Type of measure: regulatory and economic Condition: in force since 2015 Implemented in scenario: WEM  Agricultural land - Slovak Government Regulation No 342/2014, laying down rules for granting support in agriculture in the context of decoupled direct payment schemes. The Regulation introduces the efficient use and appropriate timing of use of nitrogen doses from mineral fertilizers.  Greenhouse gases affected: N2O Type of measure: economic and regulatory Condition: in force since 2010 Implemented in scenario: WEM Agricultural land after 2015 - Slovak Government Regulation No 342/2014, laying down rules for granting support in agriculture in the context of decoupled direct payment schemes. The Regulation introduces the efficient use and appropriate timing of use of nitrogen doses from mineral fertilizers after 2015.  Greenhouse gases affected: N2O Type of measure: economic and regulatory Condition: in force since 2015 Implemented in scenario: WEM d) Sectoral policies and measures in the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector Rural Development Programme for 2014-2020  A financial support system programme for selected thematic rural development priorities. The programme will improve the competitiveness of agriculture and forestry (by supporting investment on 1 250 farms and in 400 food enterprises). It contains 56 framework objectives for specific policies and measures in this sector with positive environmental impacts. It will ensure adequate management of natural resources and promote climate-friendly farming practices. About 20% of agricultural land will be managed in a way that protects biodiversity, soil and water resources. Greenhouse gases affected: NO2 Type of measure: regulatory and economic Condition: in force since 2015 Implemented in scenario: WEM e) Sectoral policies and measures in waste management  Waste Management Programme of the Slovak Republic for 2016-2020  The Waste Management Strategy is a set of measures setting national targets. These include:   Reducing the amount of mixed municipal waste by 50% compared to 2016 by 2025;  Reducing the amount of biodegradable waste in mixed municipal waste by 60% compared to 2016 by 2025;  Reducing the municipal waste landfill rate to a maximum of 10% by 2035. When evaluating the specific measures for the objectives of the Waste Management Programme 2011-2015, it was found that most of the original objectives were not achieved.  Greenhouse gases affected: CH4 Type of measure: regulatory  Condition: in force since 2016 Implemented in scenario: WEM  Waste Prevention Programme for 2019-2025  The Waste Prevention Programme of the Slovak Republic for 2019-2025 was approved by the Government of the Slovak Republic in January 2019. The objectives of this programme are to minimise waste generation and strict adherence to the waste hierarchy. The new waste management information system will help improve control of waste flows. The system will focus on monitoring waste from generation to recovery, respectively disposal.  Greenhouse gases affected: CO2, CH4 Type of measure: regulatory  Condition: in force since February 2019 Implemented in scenario: WAM  ii. Where relevant, regional cooperation in this area Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council, which obliges Member States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in the event of an excess of allocated allowances the Slovak Republic may apply flexibility instruments through borrowing, banking and transferring allocated emission allowances to other Member States. iii. Without prejudice to the applicability of State aid rules, financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds, in this area at national level, where applicable Financing measures: a) Financing measures from EU funds: Operational Programme Quality of Environment  (OP QoE) - The OP QoE is the SR programming document for drawing assistance from the EU Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund in the programming period 2014-2020 for the sustainable and efficient use of natural resources, ensuring environmental protection, active adaptation to climate change and promoting an energy efficient low-carbon economy.  The global objective of the OP QoE is to promote the sustainable and efficient use of natural resources, ensuring environmental protection, active adaptation to climate change and promoting an energy efficient low-carbon economy. In order to achieve this global objection, three core thematic objectives were included in the investment strategy of the OP QoE, namely:  Supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy in all sectors (TC4);  Promoting climate change adaptation, risk prevention and management (TC5);  Preserving and protecting the environment and promoting resource efficiency (TC6);  Of the five priority axes, three are devoted to climate change and energy:  Priority axis 2: Adaptation to the adverse impacts of climate change with a focus on flood protection (EUR 419.3 mil. from the Cohesion Fund, 13.36% of the OP QoE allocation). Promoting investment in adaptation to climate change, including ecosystem-based approaches.  Priority axis 3: Promoting risk management, emergency management and resilience to exceptional events affected by climate change (EUR 260.9 mil. from the European Regional Development Fund, 8.31% of the OP QoE allocation). Promoting investment to address specific risks, ensuring disaster resilience and developing disaster management systems.  Priority axis 4: Energy-efficient low-carbon economy in all sectors (EUR 938.88 million from the European Regional Development Fund, 29.92% of the OP QoE allocation). Promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy use in enterprises. Promoting energy efficiency, smart energy management and the use of renewable energy in public infrastructures, including public buildings and the housing sector. Promoting low-carbon strategies for all types of territories, especially urban areas, including the promotion of sustainable multimodal urban mobility and adaptation measures to mitigate climate change. Encouraging the use of high-efficiency cogeneration based on the demand for usable heat. Slovak Investment Holding (SIH) is a national development institution responsible for the implementation of financial instruments from EU sources in the current and previous programming period. The financial instruments are repayable forms of EU funding, and these are also used in the field of energy efficiency. SIH provides, inter alia, financial instruments to improve energy efficiency in apartment buildings in the current programming period, while preparing financial instruments to improve energy efficiency in public buildings and small and medium-sized enterprises. The financial instruments in question are financed from the OP QoE as well as from the Integrated Regional Operational Programme (IROP). Given the economic effectiveness of financial instruments compared to non-repayable financial assistance, the use of financial instruments through SIH is anticipated to continue in the next programming period. b) Financing measures from other sources: SlovSEFF III - The SlovSEFF III programme is a credit line to promote the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources in Slovakia. The programme is aimed at supporting projects:  which include the purchase and installation of equipment, systems and processes using renewable energy sources for the production of electricity and/or heat and/or cooling and/or any other form of energy replacing fossil fuel sources;  which include equipment, systems and processes enabling the reduction of primary energy consumption, final consumption of electricity, fuels or other forms of energy for the production of goods and/or the provision of energy services related to the production of goods or the provision of services related to industry;   measures in residential buildings, which are comprehensive, large projects for the reconstruction of the thermal ratios of apartment buildings, consisting of the thermal insulation of the external casing (external walls, roofs, cellars), together with additional measures.  The programme consists of a combination of loans provided by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development with a grant component co-financed by funds obtained from the sale of AAUs to Spain. State Environmental Protection Aid Scheme for the Reduction of GHG and Pollutants in the Manufacturing Industries (Industries Scheme) - The State aid scheme was prepared in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014 of 17 June 2014 declaring certain categories of aid compatible with the internal market in application of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty . The purpose of the aid is to encourage enterprises, as part of their activities, and in compliance with 36(2)(a) of the Block Exemption Regulation to increase the level of environmental protection by going beyond the applicable Union standards, by supporting projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants to air by introducing the best available technologies. The scheme was approved by the Slovak Competition Office by letter No -3471/2017 of 7 July 2017 and was published on 17 July 2017 in Official Journal 135/2017 under number G000019. On 11 August 2017, the scheme was also registered in SANI2 under number SA.48924. The scheme is valid until 2020, the implementation of projects is possible up to the end of 2023. The scheme may be funded from funds raised from the sale of emission allowances at auction, no call for proposals had been issued by November 2019. State aid scheme for enterprises in sectors and subsectors deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage due to EU ETS allowance costs passed on in electricity prices (Compensation Scheme) - The state aid scheme has been prepared in accordance with the Commission Notice - Guidelines on certain State aid measures in the context of the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme post-2012. The objective of the State aid is to prevent a significant risk of carbon leakage due to greenhouse gas allowance costs passed on in electricity prices borne by the beneficiary, if its competitors from third countries do not face similar CO2 costs in their electricity prices and the beneficiary is unable to pass on those costs to product prices without losing significant market share.  The purpose of this aid is to avoid the significant risk of carbon leakage in connection with the transfer of the costs of greenhouse gas emission allowances into electricity prices borne by the aid beneficiary, if its third-country competitors need not include similar CO2 costs in their electricity prices and the aid beneficiary cannot transfer these costs into product prices without losing significant market share. This aid will be reviewed based on the profitability of these enterprises and a realistic assessment of the risk of departure to third countries. Priority is given to funding projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution in general.  State aid is intended to compensate for the rise in electricity prices in connection with the passing on of greenhouse gas emission costs to those prices following the introduction of the EU ETS. The scheme was approved by Commission Decision C (2015) 9479 final of 14 December 2015 (case SA.43509 (2015/N) - Compensation of indirect CO2 -related costs in Slovakia). The scheme was published in the European Commercial Bulletin on 22 April 2016, as well as in the Commercial Bulletin of the Slovak Republic No 74/2016 issued 19 April 2016 under G000007. The scheme is valid until 2021, the compensation can still be provided in 2021 (for 2020). The scheme is funded from funds raised from the sale of emission allowances at auction. Amendment No 1 has been prepared for the Compensation Scheme in order to update the national legislation in the area of State aid and extend the term of the scheme from the original 22 April 2016  to 31 December 2020 to the new 22 April 2016 to 31 December 2021. The modifications to the Compensation Scheme in Amendment No 1 did not need to be notified to the European Commission as neither the substance nor the conditions for the provision of the aid through the Scheme had changed. The Scheme, as amended by Amendment No 1, was published on 6 August 2018 in Commercial Bulletin No 150/2018 with ID: 1933496  State aid and other support programmes - under number G000027. 3.1.2. Renewable energy  i. Policies and measures to achieve the national contribution towards the binding 2030 Union target for renewable energy and trajectories as referred to in point (a)(2) Article 4, and, where applicable or available, the elements referred to in point 2.1.2, including sector- and technology-specific measures24 Existing policies and measures The RES policy and the follow-up measures follow up on previous strategic documents approved by the Government of the SR (Energy Security Strategy (2008), National Renewable Energy Action Plan (2010) and Energy Policy of the SR (2014)). These documents promoted increasing the share of renewable energy sources in energy consumption and reducing the share of fossil fuels. These policies thus enabled a reduction in the share of coal in the energy mix. Table 27: Existing policies and measures Seq.

Support for the renovation of heat distribution pipes   financial energy saving, promotion of district heating investors 2014       In some of the existing electricity generation measures, the anticipated contribution from the individual electricity generation technologies of Chapter 2.1.2 was included in the anticipated result.  Policies and proposed measures to achieve the national contribution  The principle stated in the Energy Policy of the Slovak Republic which, when projecting RES use, took into account the principle of cost minimization in an integrated approach to the use of renewable energy sources and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, remains valid for the upcoming period. Maintaining this principle will mean setting up support for RES will ensure the objectives set are achieved in a cost-effective way and will prevent significant negative effects on electricity prices. In order to achieve the RES objectives, it is essential to exploit all available options, one of the greatest potentials being in the development of waste recovery in the production of biomethane and energy recovery from waste that cannot be recycled and that would thus end up in landfill. In district heating systems, the energy potential of geothermal and solar energy, biomass and biomethane will be used in particular.  The policy of increased RES use will be directed to the following areas:  1. Support for the introduction of low-power electricity and heat generation installations in family houses and apartment buildings One sustainable approach is to encourage the installation of small-scale power generation equipment, whereby aid recipients are motivated to consume as much of their own electricity as possible and to minimise their supply to the grid. This approach addresses their energy self-sufficiency and reduces the impact of variable RES on the electricity grid. As part of support for small sources, support for the installation of heat generation facilities using RES will continue. A reduction in local emissions will be achieved not only through the promotion of proven technologies, but it is also appropriate to promote new fuel cell technologies with reduced carbon footprint in the case of natural gas or zero carbon footprint in the case of biomethane or pure hydrogen.  2. Develop the use of 2nd generation biofuels  The priority for RES in the transport sector is the development of biofuels with high greenhouse gas emission savings. These are advanced biofuels (the term defined in the RES Support Act, also called 2nd generation biofuels) made from raw materials pursuant to Annex No IX part A, and biofuels made from raw materials according to Annex No IX Part B of the RES Directive. At the same time, given the existing biofuel production capacity from food and feed crops, this policy will maintain the maximum possible share of these biofuels, which is counted towards meeting the targets for transport.  3. Continue the promotion of support for electricity generation from RES Support for electricity generation from RES will continue, mainly based on operating aid as set up after the reform of support effective from the start of 2019. The basic form of support for installations with installed power of over 500 kW will remain a surcharge, while the electricity producer is responsible for selling the electricity on the market and for any deviation caused. Auction success is a prerequisite for providing support in the form of a surcharge. This system is complemented by a system of support through purchase prices set in advance (FIT support system), which applies to new producers with an installed capacity of up to 500 kW. Installations with an installed capacity of up to 250 kW have the possibility, in the FIT system, to obtain support in the form of the purchase of electricity and take responsibility for any deviation. This form of support for equipment up to 250 kW will be provided until 2033, when the activity of the buyer who carries out the above activities will terminate. Existing aid for electricity generation is in accordance with Commission Regulation No 651/2014 declaring certain categories of aid compatible with the internal market in application of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty. It is estimated that the largest new installed capacity will be in solar (600 MW) and wind power plants (500 MW).  4. Creation of a support mechanism to increase the RES share in the heating sector and in district heating systems, also through generation from RES in high-efficiency cogeneration Slovakia considers heating and cooling to be a key sector for meeting the RES target for 2030. There are two options for decarbonising the heating supply in buildings through the use of environmentally friendly and highly efficient equipment and technologies saving primary energy:  at the level of each building separately; or  at the level of existing district heating and cooling systems supplying several buildings at once. All the analyses comparing the two alternatives favour the latter, given its lower costs and economies of scale.  The existing district heating infrastructure is an ideal base for building an intelligent city energy system and has all the prerequisites to fulfil the role of integrator of individual RES solutions in its territory. District heating systems already play an important role in cities in maintaining favourable air quality, as these systems can deliver environmentally friendly heat that meets the strictest legal standards and emission limits. Individual heat sources are virtually uncontrolled in terms of emissions, do not have to meet such strict standards, and therefore pose a greater risk to the population from air pollution.  Local governments are currently facing major changes connected with their efforts to ensure sustainable growth based on a low-carbon economy. They are therefore looking for intelligent or smart solutions.  The developed district heating infrastructure, which is already largely modernized, is gradually integrating new intelligent solutions. District heating systems will be irreplaceable for future Smart Cities. The deployment of these modern intelligent solutions aims to build so-called 4th generation  district heating systems that create efficient and intelligent systems in cities. Such systems can flexibly interconnect production and consumption, store energy at times of surplus, integrate the various forms of energy generated in the city, including renewable energy, and utilize waste heat from industrial processes or the tertiary sector (e.g. data centres and hospitals) that otherwise escapes in the form of air emissions and contributes to global warming. It is more acceptable for citizens to have a minimum number of chimneys in the city under constant monitoring and not hundreds or thousands of non-monitored ones.  District heating systems already use cogeneration of electricity, heat and cold, renewable energy sources, emission-reducing technologies, energy storage facilities, etc. District heating is no longer just heat generation, but also combined heat and power (CHP), which uses about 20% less fuel than producing the same amount of electricity or heat alone. CHP enables the provision of support services in electricity systems and the storage of energy in the form of heat. Last but not least, by reducing the purchasing of fossil fuels, which are predominantly imported from abroad, funds remain for their purchase in the region in question and thus support the development of the local economy.  In existing buildings (classic prefabricated apartment buildings), the supply of cold from district heating systems is a dream for the future, however this solution is already starting to be successfully implemented in new buildings. Projects for the absorption generation of cold have been successfully implemented in , with more projects in preparation.  In developed countries, district heating systems are considered to be the most efficient and environmentally friendly way of generating heat and tools for decarbonising the energy sector. New trends in the energy sector are bringing new challenges and opportunities for the heating industry. Slovakia has all the prerequisites for building and developing 4th generation CHP systems. District heating systems are suitable for the integration of RES in the form of biomethane mainly derived from plant and animal production waste, the biodegradable part of municipal waste, biodegradable kitchen and restaurant waste, and waste water treatment plant waste.  Table 28 Individual types of waste in relation to biomethane  Waste type Annual production in tonnes Biomethane quantity Quantity ktoe Excrement from livestock 10.1 million tonnes*   155 mil. m3  205 mil. m3  (methane content of biogas 55%)  141  187 ktoe   Biodegradable component of municipal waste (BDMW) 1 million tonnes  (50% of total volume of MW*)  65 mil. m3   60 ktoe   Biodegradable component of kitchen and restaurant waste (canteens, hotels, schools etc.) 0.35 million tonnes   42 mil. m3   38 ktoe    Energy potential of agricultural biomass = 115.2 PJ (2 750 ktoe) The waste component (grass silage and straw phytomass) represents approximately 40% of the stated volume (1 100 ktoe) * * SIEA - National roadmap for development of biomethane production and use in Slovakia In addition to increasing the use of RES, the heating and cooling policy aims to actively participate in the smart cities concept and thus contribute towards creating quality living conditions for urban citizens, exploiting and developing the energy thermal infrastructure to ensure energy savings, ensure healthier air, recycle waste and use energy recovery from waste. CHP systems are a response to the current global issues and challenges of modern, rapidly developing cities where clean air is a key quality of life indicator.  5. Support for biomethane and hydrogen production  Biomethane and hydrogen are very promising fuels that also allow energy storage. Biomethane will be preferentially used in transport and high-efficiency cogeneration. A realistic target is more than 300 mil. m3/year of biomethane by 2030. Biomethane can be obtained from  the transition from biogas to biomethane  energy recovery from biodegradable municipal waste (BDMW), kitchen and restaurant waste  energy recovery from waste from plant and animal production for biomethane production The objective of supporting hydrogen from RES is 100% coverage of the consumption of hydrogen filling stations and the partial replacement of hydrogen from fossil fuels in industry (2030).  Proposed legislative and regulatory measures:  In order to implement measures aimed at increasing the RES share in the heating and cooling sectors, the following legislative and regulatory measures will need to be adopted. This will include regulatory measures, in addition to the transposition of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and Directive (EU) 2018/2002. The aim will also be to introduce incentive mechanisms for district heating and cooling system operators aimed at increasing the RES share in the fuel mix (for example, a more favourable calculation of reasonable profit for operators using RES in their fuel mix, regardless of other economically justifiable costs and the maximum cost of heat, and increasing the importance of energy efficiency indicators when calculating fuel costs if RES is used for heat generation).  Support from public sources will be allowed for projects in district heating, where cost and environmental efficiency will be demonstrated. District heating systems are also suitable for the integration of RES in the form of biomethane, mainly from waste from plant and animal production, the biodegradable part of municipal waste, biodegradable kitchen and restaurant waste, and waste water treatment plant waste. While the potential for geothermal energy to generate heat is sufficient, its use must be adequately supported, which will require an overall increase in support. One the RES Action Plan for 2011-2020 developed in 2009 envisaged the use of geothermal energy in heat generation.  The conditions of the regulatory periods after 2022 in the area of thermal energy will take into account the obligation to increase the RES share in district heating systems. They will also take into account the connection of own-consumption/energy communities producing RES to the district heating system.  Table 29 Overview of measures for the heating and cooling sector  Measure name Measure type / concise measure description Anticipated result Target group Measure start and end dates 1.

This binding target will not be set for individual district heating and cooling operators, but for the entire district heating sector so that the real contributions of the operators can be calculated. District heating and cooling system operators will be able to contribute towards the achievement of this mandatory target by changing their own fuel base by connecting suppliers of RES heat under Article 24(4)(b) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 or by connecting self-consumers and RES-producing communities.  The connection of suppliers of heat from RES will be ensured through a mandatory heat take-off mechanism based on non-discriminatory criteria and, in order to meet the demand of new customers, by replacing existing heat and cooling capacity or by extending existing capacity under Article 24(5) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Non-discriminatory conditions and reasonable charges shall be applied to the connection of RES energy suppliers to district heating and cooling systems ensuring that a reasonable proportion of the fixed costs associated with the operation of the district heating system are met and the storage of the necessary capacity by the district heating system operator to meet the heat demand due to insufficient capacity of the RES heat suppliers equipment.  Measure 2: Mandatory connection to efficient district heating using RES  Another measure to increase the RES share in the heating and cooling sector will be connecting new buildings and existing buildings which are undergoing major renovation to district heating and cooling systems that fulfil the condition of efficient district heat supply and use RES, where the site has such a district heating and cooling system and where there is sufficient capacity to connect the building and supply it with heat or cold. For existing buildings that were not connected to the district heating and cooling system prior to their major renovation, connection will only be required if this  leads to a higher level of energy performance of the buildings compared to the operation of individual equipment for self-consumption of energy from RES or renewables energy communities.  Measure 3: Information obligation  Suppliers from district heating and cooling systems will be obliged to notify at regular intervals (at least once a year) the RES share in the heat supply in the district heating and cooling system and whether the system meets the condition of an efficient district heat supply or is in the process of transition to an efficient district heat supply system.  4. Supporting consumption of own heat  In accordance with Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, renewables self-consumers and renewables energy communities will be entitled to install their own equipment to produce heat from RES to provide heat for their own consumption, enable the storage of heat produced from RES and the sale of excess production. In districts with district heating and cooling systems, it will only be possible to install heat generation equipment for renewables self-consumers and renewables energy communities by connecting it to the district heating and cooling system, except for equipment of renewables self-consumers or renewables energy communities in existing buildings not connected to the district heating and cooling system and that do not have an obligation to connect to carry out a major renovation of an existing building.  Renewables self-consumers and renewables energy communities will only be subject to non-discriminatory fees and payments ensuring the payment of a reasonable part of the fixed costs associated with the operation of the district heating system and the storage of the necessary capacity by the district heating system operator to meet the heat demand due to insufficient capacity of the equipment of the renewables self-consumers and renewables energy communities.  The right of renewables self-consumers and renewables energy communities to set up a heat generation plant in a building to cover their own heat consumption, energy storage and the sale of excess heat generation will only be exercised at the level of the whole building and, for family houses with multiple dwellings and apartment buildings, only at the level of the whole family house with multiple dwellings or apartment building (Article 24(7) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001).  5. The right to disconnect An end-user of a district heating and cooling system which does not become an efficient district heating and cooling system by 31 December 2025 will be entitled to disconnect from that system if they install equipment to produce heat exclusively from RES, under the conditions laid down in Article 24(2) and (3) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. To this end, the competent national authority will approve a plan for a switch to an efficient district heat supply for individual district heating and cooling system operators. Except in the event of serious deficiencies in the fulfilment of contractual obligations which the district heating and cooling operator has not remedied within a reasonable period after receipt of the customers notice, customers will not be allowed to disconnect from the district heat supply systems otherwise than based on an agreement with the operator of an efficient district heating system. This will not preclude the right of the final customer to install their own heat generation equipment as a renewables self-consumer or renewable energy community generating heat under conditions applicable to self-consumers and energy communities.  6. Recovery of waste and waste heat This measure will support the integration of RES (favouring the construction of production facilities for biomethane mainly derived from plant and animal waste, the biodegradable part of municipal  waste, biodegradable kitchen and restaurant waste and waste water treatment plant waste), as well as the integration and use of waste heat in district heating systems, including waste heat generated as a by-product in industrial and energy sector facilities.  ii. Where relevant, specific measures for regional cooperation, as well as, as an option, the estimated excess production of energy from renewable sources which could be transferred to other Member States in order to achieve the national contribution and trajectories referred to in point 2.1.2 The use of voluntary statistical transfer of RES to another Member State is not anticipated. The Slovak Republic will primarily seek to fulfil its contribution towards the European objective, set out in Chapter 2.1.2. This contribution is designed so that it can be fulfilled. If Slovakia exceeds its target, it will consider the use of statistical transfer. In the event of suitable projects, Slovakia will participate in projects of common interest (PCI) in RES or in projects supported by the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The SR welcomes the creation of an EU financial mechanism for RES and will consider participation in this mechanism depending on  the conditions. iii. Specific measures on financial support, where applicable, including Union support and the use of Union funds, for the promotion of the production and use of energy from renewable sources in electricity, heating and cooling, and transport  Financial support measures to achieve the objectives - operating aid. In order to implement measures aimed at increasing the RES share, increasing energy efficiency, reducing primary energy consumption, replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, and implementing the best available technologies to reduce greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions in the heating and cooling and electricity sectors, the use of investment aid instruments is also proposed. It is anticipated that the support mechanism for the construction of new plants for the generation of electricity and heat from renewable energy sources will be retained through a tendering procedure, while in the case of plants using biomass and its processing products, there is a legal requirement for electricity and heat generation through cogeneration with the preferential placement of heat in district heating and cooling systems. An amendment to Act No 309/2009, on the promotion of renewable energy sources and high-efficiency cogeneration, which governs the operating aid rules for electricity generation, is therefore anticipated. A more comprehensive form of operating aid will only be granted if a less extensive form is not sufficient for these purposes. 1. Operating aid for heat generation from RES Currently, in 2019, RES support is linked to electricity generation, while the heating sector has access to it only for cogeneration technologies, and only for biomass and biogas technologies. In order to achieve RES targets by 2030, it will also be necessary to consider operating aid that will allow separate operating aid for the production of heat from RES linked to the construction of new plants for the production of heat from biomass, biogas, biomethane, geothermal and solar energy and aerothermal, geothermal and hydrothermal energy used in heat pumps.  Operating aid may be granted in the form of a surcharge or green bonus on an annual basis in accordance with the rules resulting from Article 43 of Regulation (EU) 651/2014 and Chapter 3.3.2.2 of the State Aid Guidelines on Environmental Protection and Energy 2014-2020 (2014/C 200/01) (or  its future changes) until the full depreciation of the investment in RES according to the usual accounting principles. The aid will be limited to the construction of installations whose operators have built a new district heating and cooling system (with preference for sites with deteriorated air quality) or have approved a plan to switch to an efficient district heat supply (Article 24(2) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001) and who, precisely based on the installation of the supported equipment, will meet the conditions for an efficient district heat supply. This form of operating aid will also be financed from the proceeds from the auctioning of emission allowances.  2. Operating aid for electricity generation in CHP plants using RES technology with installed capacity up to 1 MW Act No 309/2009, on the promotion of renewable energy sources and high-efficiency cogeneration and amending certain other acts, as amended, currently allows support for electricity generation in new cogeneration plants (irrespective of the use of RES) in the case of plants with an installed capacity of up to 1 MWe, of which at least 60% of the heat produced is used to supply heat through a district heat supply and the primary energy saving is at least 10%.  In order to increase incentives for investors into technologies to generate electricity and heat from RES, it will be necessary to modify this form of aid to cover new cogeneration plants installed together with plants generating heat from RES. The aid should be provided in the form of a guaranteed feed-in tariff in accordance with the rules resulting from Article 43 of Regulation (EU) 651/2014 and Chapter 3.3.2.2 of the Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy 2014-2020 (2014/C 200/01) (or its future changes) for the period until full depreciation of investments in cogeneration and RES technology according to normal accounting principles. The aid will be limited to the construction of installations whose operators are building a new district heating and cooling system (with preference for sites with deteriorated air quality) or have a plan to switch to an efficient district heat supply approved by the competent national authorities (Article 24(2) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and who, precisely because of the installation of the supported equipment, meet the conditions for an efficient district heat supply.  3. Operating aid for electricity generation in modernized combined heat and power plants using RES technology Act No 309/2009, on the promotion of renewable energy sources and high-efficiency cogeneration, currently allows aid for electricity generation in modernised cogeneration plants (irrespective of the use of RES) with an installed capacity of up to 125 MWe, provided that the overall cogeneration efficiency is at least 80% in the case of combined cycle combustion turbines and condensation steam turbines with steam extraction, or 75% for other cogeneration plants, at least 60% of the heat produced in the cogeneration plant will be supplied through a district heat supply, and at least 60% of the total heat supply by district heat supply will be heat supply to the public. Aid for electricity generation is provided through a guaranteed feed-in tariff.  To increase incentives for investors into electricity and heat generation from RES technologies, it would be necessary to modify this form of aid so that it only applies under existing conditions to cogeneration facilities that will be modernised, provided the modernisation also includes the installation of equipment to produce heat from RES, or where the district heating plant operator concludes a long-term contract for the supply of biomethane. Aid should be provided through a  guaranteed feed-in tariff in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 43 of Regulation (EU) 651/2014 and Chapter 3.3.2.2 of the Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy 2014-2020 (2014/C 200/01) (or its future changes) for the period until full depreciation of investments in cogeneration and RES technology according to normal accounting principles.  4. Operating aid to maintain the combined production of electricity and heat from biomass This will be a new form of operating aid, the provision of which is allowed under the Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy 2014-2020 (2014/C 200/01) in point 3.3.2.3. Operating aid will be granted to biomass cogeneration plants to offset the differences between the plants operating costs and the market prices of electricity and heat. Aid will be provided through a feed-in tariff for a period of three years, with the possibility of extending the aid period if, after the expiry of the previous aid period, the differences have not been offset. Operating aid for the cogeneration of electricity and heat from biomass will only be provided in air quality management areas if it complies with stricter technological requirements.  5. Operating aid for new CHP plants using renewable energy sources with an installed capacity exceeding 1 MW The existing system of aid for electricity generation in CHP plants using renewable energy sources through transparent tendering (auctions) will be maintained, with an increased emphasis on supporting such facilities that will place the bulk of their heat output into district heating and cooling systems. If installations from renewable energy sources, which allow the use of usable heat to be technologically supported, will receive aid, the heat output will have to be placed in district heating and cooling systems.  6. Using waste and waste heat This measure will support the integration of renewable energy sources (favouring the construction of production facilities for biomethane mainly derived from plant and animal waste, the biodegradable part of municipal waste, biodegradable kitchen and restaurant waste and waste water treatment plant waste), as well as the integration and use of waste heat in CHP systems, including waste heat generated as a by-product in industrial and energy sector facilities.  Financial support measures to achieve the objectives - investment aid To implement measures aimed at increasing the RES share, the use of investment aid instruments is also proposed: 1. EU funds 2. The Modernisation Fund consisting of the sale of emission allowances and other instruments linked to the EU ETS 3. The Environment Fund. As part of the preparation of the new programming period for the use of EU funds for 2021 to 2027, the EC Report on Slovakia identified, in connection with the use of renewable energy sources, investment priorities related to support for the deployment of decentralized capacities as part of small RES projects and the transfer to RES for heating and cooling (in accordance with sustainability criteria).  In line with the Initial Proposal for the Priorities of the Slovak Republic for the Cohesion Policy for the Programming Period 2014-2020, the priorities for increasing energy efficiency, promoting RES and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the programming period 2021-2027 will be: - increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy use in enterprises, including the energy sector, and improving the energy performance of buildings, - promoting renewable energy sources and efficient district heating systems (DHS) in heat and cold supply and smart energy systems, energy storage, - promoting sustainable mobility by increasing the share of alternative greener propulsion systems in transport. The programming period 2021-2027 will focus, as regards the use of RES, in particular on:  - support for meeting RES targets and increasing the RES share in district heating and cooling systems, including increasing the efficiency of the generation and distribution of heat in district heating systems and the use of RES in energy carriers to provide heating and cooling, - providing support for plants using RES, energy distribution and storage facilities (including smart management systems) to increase the efficiency of existing installations, and the installation of new plants using RES (business, public and households sectors), - exploiting geothermal energy and supporting the development of local heat supply systems, - supporting transport infrastructure for charging electric vehicles and for refilling hydrogen-powered vehicles, as well as for the electrification of public passenger transport (electrification of railway lines, construction of new tram and trolleybus lines instead of bus transport). The Environment Fund accumulates funds raised from the auctioning of emission allowances, and at least 35% of revenues will also be used for projects in the energy generation sector with support for efficient and sustainable district heating, cogeneration and the development of renewable energy sources. The aim will be to support the projects of district heating and cooling system operators for switching to efficient district heating and cooling by constructing new or upgrading existing heat and CHP plants using renewable energy sources.  Continued support for households after 2023  To promote the development of household appliances, it is proposed to continue support through subsidies for the purchase and installation of equipment using RES. Experience from the currently running Green for Households II subsidy programme has so far been positive. This is the National Project of the Slovak Innovation and Energy Agency (SIEA), in which family houses and apartment buildings can apply for aid through a voucher for small installations using renewable energy sources. The project is financed from the Operational Programme Quality of Environment. The aid is set up to give households an incentive to buy quality systems with reasonable performance, longer life and higher energy conversion efficiency, and not to underestimate the need for installation expertise. The aid may not exceed 50% of the eligible expenditure.   The following are devices supported through the programme:   small power plants with an output of 10 kW or less o photovoltaic panels  o wind turbines (these devices cannot yet be supported)  heat plants covering the energy needs of a family house or residential building o solar panels o biomass boilers o heat pumps  micro fuel cell cogeneration installations. Concurrence of investment and operating aid In order to reduce operating aid, the possibility of concurrent investment and operating aid will be ensured in such a way as to ensure the condition of proportionality from the point of view of State aid and to comply with the requirements for deducting possible investment aid from the total investment amount when calculating the average cost of energy generation (LCOE).  Other measures with similar effects to investment and operating aid  To implement measures aimed at increasing the RES share in the heating and cooling sector, fiscal measures, e.g. a reduced VAT rate on heat from district heating and cooling using RES, may be introduced.  Measures in the transport sector  Table 30 Measures in the transport sector Measure name Measure type/concise measure description Anticipated result Target group Measure start and end dates 1. increasing the minimum share for fuel suppliers regulatory / in line with the indicative trajectory, to achieve a 14% share of RES in fuels in 2030 Achieving the 14% RES target in transport fuel suppliers 2022-2030   2. increasing the contribution of advanced biofuels regulatory / increasing the share of advanced biofuels under Annex IX, Part A as a share of final energy consumption in transport Share of advanced BP: 2022: 0.2% 2025: 1.0% 2030: 3.5% fuel suppliers 2022-2030   3. increasing the share of biofuels in transport prepare an analysis of the need to introduce fuels with a higher content of biofuels for the purpose of meeting the RES objectives in transport Achieving the 14% RES target in transport fuel suppliers biofuel suppliers ME SR MEnv SR by 2022  Measures in the biomethane and hydrogen sectors Table 31 Measures in the biomethane and hydrogen sectors Measure name Measure type/concise measure description Anticipated result Target group Measure start and end dates 1. introduction of guarantees of origin for biomethane legislative / the introduction of guarantees of origin of biomethane for the purpose of developing the market for market for biomethane guarantees biomethane producers 2022 Formatted: French (France) biomethane marketed in the EU 2. promoting the transition from biogas to biomethane regulatory / support for the transition from biogas to biomethane to be used in transport or high-efficiency cogeneration production of 250 mil. m3 (200 ktoe) of biomethane biomethane producers 2022 3. support for the recovery of waste from plant and animal production regulatory / support for the recovery of waste from plant and animal production for the production of biomethane Production of 60 mil. m3 (50 ktoe) of biomethane biomethane producers 2022 4. support for the recovery of waste from the biodegradable part of municipal (BDMW), industrial, kitchen and restaurant waste regulatory / support for waste recovery Production of 30 mil. m3 (25 ktoe) of biomethane landfilling less than 10% of generated municipal waste  processors of BDMW, industrial, kitchen and restaurant waste 2022 5.

Where applicable, the assessment of the support for electricity from renewable sources that Member States are to carry out pursuant to Article 6(4) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 The Slovak Republic will review the effectiveness of its support systems for electricity from RES and their significant distributional effects on different groups of consumers and investments every five years and by the end of 2024 at the latest. This assessment will take the impact of possible changes to the support systems into account. The results of this assessment will be taken into account within the framework of indicative long-term planning governing aid decisions and proposals for new aid. This assessment will be included in the progress reports in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. v. Specific measures to introduce one or more contact points, streamline administrative procedures, provide information and training, and facilitate the uptake of power purchase agreements A summary of policies and measures under the enabling framework that Member States must implement under Article 21(6) and Article 22(5) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 to promote and facilitate the development of energy self-consumption and renewable energy communities. The contact point referred to in Article 16(1) will be the Slovak Innovation and Energy Agency (SIEA). The Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic will authorize the SIEA as its organization to establish one or more locations within its four branches to guide applicants throughout the entire administrative process of the application for and issue of permits to build, modernise and operate  facilities using RES and the equipment needed to connect them to the grid. The Ministry of Economy of the SR will promote more efficient administrative procedures by optimizing the setting of boundaries for environmental impact assessment to ensure that installations using renewable energy sources have a significantly lower administrative burden compared to fossil fuels. Awareness of RES is already provided through the SIEA. The training of installers of RES equipment is provided through accredited training through which installers are certified. Upon completion of the professional training, the installer has the skills required to install the appropriate equipment and systems to meet the consumers performance and reliability needs, to perform quality work, and to comply with all relevant regulations. The professional training course is completed with an examination based on which a certificate is issued free of charge by the Ministry of Economy of the SR. Such certificate is valid for 5 years and is automatically renewed once by another 5 years if the certificate holder participates in an update of their professional training. In preparing this plan, existing unjustified barriers and the potential for self-consumption of energy from RES were assessed. The result of the assessment is that there are no regulatory or other legislative obstacles for such self-consumers. The only real barrier for over half of households is the costly installation of the equipment. The cost of installing the equipment as an additional or replacement heat source in terms of return on investment results in a low level of interest in these sources. The situation changes if there is a subsidy for such equipment. One example is the Green for Households programme, which provides supports for such equipment to provide a reasonable payback period. The interest in installing devices has thus increased several fold. It is therefore proposed to continue subsidies for households through the existing Green for Households programme also in the period after 2021. The measure under Article 22(6) of the RES Directive is a financial subsidy for households and apartment buildings. vi. Assessing the need to build new infrastructure for district heating and cooling using renewable sources To implement measures aimed at increasing the RES share in the heating and cooling sector and to improve air quality in locations with increased emission burdens (mainly due to particulate matter emissions), the construction of new district heating and cooling systems based on facilities for the production of heat from RES appears necessary (in particular geothermal energy, biomass, biogas, biomethane, solar energy and aerothermal, geothermal and hydrothermal energy used in heat pumps), potentially in combination with high-efficiency cogeneration facilities. In the event of insufficient interest from heat and cold market participants in building new district heating and cooling systems under market conditions, the competent authority will launch a call for tenders for new district heating and cooling capacities with the possibility of participation in any of the above-mentioned investment or operating aid programmes. Another challenge is to build infrastructure to generate and supply cold using new or existing district heating infrastructure, absorption cooling technology and heat pumps. Projects for such infrastructure will be able to participate in investment and operating aid programmes provided they use renewable energy sources, potentially in combination with high-efficiency cogeneration technology. vii. Where applicable, specific measures on the promotion of the use of energy from biomass, especially for new biomass mobilisation:  The preparation of special measures within the competence of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic is anticipated to increase the availability of biomass sources focused mainly on the cultivation of fast-growing trees. 3.1.3. Other elements of the dimension i. Where applicable, national policies and measures affecting the EU ETS sector and assessment of the complementarity and impacts on the EU ETS Table 32 below shows the effects of mitigation measures. The overall impact of policies and measures was determined as the difference between scenarios after defining the impact of a specific measure.

Policies and measures to achieve other national targets, where applicable On 17 October 2018, Government Resolution No 478/2018 approved the updated Strategy for the Adaptation of the Slovak Republic to Climate Change. The main objective of the updated adaptation strategy is to increase resilience and improve the readiness of the Slovak Republic to face the adverse effects of climate change and to establish an institutional framework and coordination mechanism to ensure effective implementation of adaptation measures at all levels and in all areas. The fulfilment of the following partial objectives should contribute towards the achievement of the main adaptation objective: ensuring the active development of the national adaptation policy, implementing adaptation measures and monitoring their effectiveness, strengthening the projection of objectives and recommendations of the adaptation strategy in multilevel governance and promoting entrepreneurship, improving public awareness of climate change, promoting synergies between adaptation and mitigation measures and using an ecosystem approach in implementing adaptation measures, and promoting the projection of the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. The strategy seeks, within as wide a scope of areas and sectors as possible, to link scenarios and the possible consequences of climate change with proposals for appropriate adaptation measures. In terms of adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change, key areas and sectors are considered to be: the rock environment and geology, soil environment, natural environment and biodiversity, landscapes and water management, residential environment, population health, agriculture, forestry, transport, tourism, industry, energy, and other areas of business and risk management. The preparation of an adaptation Action Plan, which began in 2018, is managed by the Ministry of the Environment of the Slovak Republic in cooperation with the Prognostic Office of the Slovak Academy of Sciences. Adaptation measures will be prioritized in the Action Plan after qualitative and quantitative analysis. This prioritization will be based on the results of the participatory process, involving all the relevant actors. Short-term measures for the 2020-2022 period and medium-term for the 2022-2025 period with a view to 2028 will be identified. Measures will be prioritized by importance, feasibility and the availability of financial resources. The Action Plan should contribute towards better translation of adaptation measures into the sectoral policies of the relevant ministries. It should also include a proposal for a system for monitoring vulnerability, a proposal for a system of mid-term evaluation of the adaptation process in Slovakia, including the monitoring of cost-benefit linkages, and a proposal for a platform for publishing and sharing positive experience. As a basis for the preparation of the Action Plan, the strategy defines six objectives that should be addressed as a priority. These are:  setting specific objectives, priority measures and instruments for selected areas and sectors,  formulating specific tasks for fulfilling selected priority AMs,  determining coordinators, timetables and deadlines for tasks,  quantifying economic costs for the implementation of tasks,  mapping legislative, organisational and financial obstacles to implementation, Formatted: French (France)  defining selected indicators for priority AMs and monitoring. iii. Policies and measures to achieve low emission mobility (including electrification of transport) The Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic has prepared the Draft Action Plan for the Development of Electromobility in the SR, which follows on from the conclusions and recommendations of the GEAR 2030 High Level Group of 18 October 2017, as well as the EC strategy document Europe on the Move and the adopted Clean Mobility Package. The Action Plan contains 15 measures which are direct support for the use of low-emission vehicles and the possibility for a financial mechanism to support the development of charging infrastructure, as well as incentive support.
