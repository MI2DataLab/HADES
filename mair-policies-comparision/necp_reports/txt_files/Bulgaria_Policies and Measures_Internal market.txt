3.4 Dimension Internal energy market11 3.4.1 Electricity infrastructure i. Policy measures to achieve the targeted level of interconnectivity set out in Article 4(d) In accordance with Article 16 (8) of Regulation (EU) No 2019/943 on the internal market                                            11    153  operators shall not limit the volume of interconnection capacity to be made available to market participants as a means of solving congestion inside their own bidding zone or as a means of managing flows resulting from transactions internal to bidding zoneensured by reaching the minimum threshold of at least 70 % of transmission capacity between gas trading zones thereby guaranteeing compliance with the safety standards for network operation, including the safety standard in emergency situations (N-1). Direct obligations under the Regulation currently arise for Greece, Bulgaria and Romania, which have taken the necessary technical and organisational measures to ensure implementation. However, there is a lack of clarity as regards third countries, which requires the conclusion of additional agreements to ensure implementation of Article 16 (8) of Regulation (EU) No 2019/943. Please see the project information set out in sections 2.4.1 and 4.5.1.  ii. Regional co-operation in this area Bulgaria fully recognises the role of the projects of common interest pursuant to Regulation No 347/2013 concerning the trans-European energy infrastructure for the  the EU energy policy in order to ensure the security of electricity supplies for the country and the region of South-Eastern Europe.  iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds Financing key projects for modernisation and expansion of the electricity transmission network in Bulgaria: To finance key projects in the area of electricity transmission infrastructure, Bulgaria plans to use funds from the Connecting Europe Facility, the new facilities for financing low-carbon innovations and energy sector modernisation within phase 4 of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and other programmes financed by the EU and from the national budget. See the information set out in section 5.3. 3.4.2 Electricity and gas transmission infrastructure i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.2, including, where applicable, specific measures to enable the delivery of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and other key infrastructure projects The Bulgarian electricity transmission network is part of the integrated transmission network of the countries in continental Europe and its development is closely related to the development of the networks neighbouring countries.    154  In the context of the European objectives for establishing an interconnected and single line with the projects for development of the Southern Gas Corridor and with the plans for development of the gas infrastructure in the region and in Europe. The strategic objectives for improved security of supply and diversification of the sources of natural gas supply have an important role in the European energy policy. For the purpose of achieving these goals, a number of measures designed to ensure the effective implementation of projects that are essential for the development of electricity and gas transmission infrastructure have been planned. For more information, see sections 2.4.2 and 4.5.2 ii. Regional cooperation in this area12  iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds To finance key projects in the area of electricity transmission infrastructure, Bulgaria plans to use funds from the Connecting Europe Facility, the new facilities for financing low-carbon innovations and energy sector modernisation within phase 4 of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and other programmes with European and national financing.  Key projects in the gas distribution infrastructure are partially financed through the European Energy Programme for Recovery, Operational Programme Innovations and Competitiveness 20142020 (OPIC), Operational Programme Development of the Competitiveness of the Bulgarian Economy and the Connecting Europe Facility programme. See section 5.3 3.4.3 Market integration i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.3 In order to ensure compliance with Directive (EU) 2019/943 on the internal market for electricity the Energy Sector Act and the implementing regulations thereto will be amended. This will create conditions enabling the launch of full electricity market liberalisation. The process is expected to commence in 2020 and develop with progressive deregulation of the prices for household consumers and small non-household consumers over the next 3 to 5 years. The derogation under Article 5(6) of Directive (EU) 2019/943 will be applied as a temporary measure until full liberalisation of the retail market for electricity. The policy measures will aim to:                                            12 Regional groups other than the PCIs established under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013   155   Promote local energy communities by creating incentives for more active and efficient participation of energy consumers in the market and enabling the smooth transition of active customers to an open and fully liberalised market for electricity.  Granting consumers the right to conclude dynamic electricity price contracts and consumption aggregation and optimisation contracts as incentives to promote the more active and efficient participation of energy consumers in the market and enable the smooth transition of active customers to an open and fully liberalised market for electricity.  Developing a platform of tools enabling customers to compare the offers of retails that additionally promotes their active participation in the market and supports them in the selection of service aggregation contracts while ensuring transparency of relations within civilian energy communities. The measure should at minimum cover household consumers and micro enterprises with a projected annual electricity consumption of less than 100 000 kWh.  The Bulgarian electricity transmission grid operator has applied for a derogation under Article 16(9) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943. The decision to grant the derogation is subject to approval by the regulatory authority following consultations with the regulatory authorities of other countries in the region. The derogation may be granted for a maximum period of 1 year.  Taking steps to ensure that Bulgarian electricity market joins the Manually Activated Reserves Initiative (MARI);  Taking steps to join the Platform for the International Coordination of Automated Frequency Restoration and Stable System Operation (PICASSO) for the purpose of connecting the balancing market.  integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC)  the electricity system operator is a full member of the platform and actively participates in its work.  Implementation of a market-based electricity system capacity mechanism for a period of 10 years. Regulation (EU) No 2019/943 on the internal market for electricity allows Member States to implement a capacity mechanism, where concerns arise as regards the adequacy of national resources. This mechanism should function in line with market principles and comply with the requirements for CO2 limit values of 550 gCO2 of fossil fuel per kWh of electricity and the limit value of 350 kgCO2 of fossil fuel on average per year per installed kW from 1 July 2025. In order to integrate the electricity market into the single European energy market, the countries.  Day-ahead market   156  As an EU Member State, Bulgaria is currently implementing all procedures relating to Single Day-ahead Coupling (SDAC). The electricity transmission grid operator and the Bulgarian market operator (BNEB EAD) are full members of the Single Day-ahead Coupling [allocation mechanism]. Despite Bulgar-ahead market coupling, it remains isolated from the integration processes under way at Community level due to specifics of the electricity markets in neighbouring countries.  Romania is part of the 4M MC market coupling (the local coupling of Romania, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia). Prior to the launch of the international project for market coupling at the German, Austrian and Polish borders with 4M at the end of 2018, the launch of a markets coupling project at the Bulgarian-Romanian border was impossible due to the technical incompatibility between 4M MC and MRC market couplings,  Following the launch of the international project, at the beginning of 2020 the local project for a market coupling between Bulgaria and Romania has been launched. The participants in the project have approved a road map according to which the market coupling between Bulgaria and Romania should become operational in December 2020.  Greece has not established an operational day-ahead market in accordance with the requirements laid down in EU law. In view of the forthcoming launch of a local market and in order to accelerate the process of implementing a market coupling project, the Bulgarian and Greek grid and market operators, supported by the regulatory authorities of the two countries, have submitted an application for the Bulgarian-Geek border to be integrated into the Italian borders working table (IBWT) initiative. This step will enable a market coupling with Greece at the earliest possible stage after a local market is established and becomes operational. The transmission system operator has completed the formalities necessary to join the IBWT and will commence work on the coupling of the Bulgarian market with Greece on 1 March 2020 as full project member. In line with the road map adopted by the two countries, the market coupling at the Bulgaria-Greek border is expected to become fully operational during the first quarter of 2021.  In 2018, the Bulgarian electricity system operator, the exchange operator and the Energy and Water Regulatory Commission (KEVR) signed a memorandum on the coupling of the Bulgarian and Macedonian day-ahead markets with the Macedonian electricity system operator (MEPSO) and the Energy Regulation Commission of North Macedonia. The initiative was implemented within the framework of the Western Balkan 6 Initiative (WB6) for coupling the energy markets of West Balkan countries. Following several meetings under the project, the parties currently agree that amendments to North Macedonian legislation are required to ensure that market organisation will comply with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2015/1222.    157   In 2018, negotiations were launched for a trilateral coupling between Bulgaria, Serbia and Croatia. In 2019, the three countries conducted a project feasibility analysis. The implementation of project activities continues and the next steps to be taken involve amendments to Serbian legislation to ensure that compliance with the requirements for market organisation laid down in Regulation (EU) 2015/1222.  The efficient functioning of a single internal market in Europe requires that the day-ahead and intraday markets of EU Member States and European Energy Community members operate in accordance with a single set of rules and requirements for market organisation. Bulgaria, which has borders with non-EU Member States has a strong interest in the development of common rules to ensure effective market coupling. Intraday market XBID is the only intraday market coupling project in Europe at present. In line with the EU target model for full intraday market coupling, the process is planned to take place in three waves: The first and second wave have been operational since June 2018 and November 2019, respectively, in 21 countries. The third wave is expected to become operational at the end of 2020. The Intraday market coupling is implemented through Local Implementation Projects (LIPs). The electricity operator and the exchange operator participated in LIP 15, which was part of the second wave of intraday market coupling. The second wave entailed the implementation of two local projects  LIP 15 and LIP 16 The project involved the exchange operators and the transmission system operators of Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Poland, Austria and Germany  Following the launch of the second wave on 19 November 2019, Bulgaria is already part of the Singe Intraday Coupling (SIDC) via the coupling at the Bulgarian-Romanian border. In 2020, the third wave of the intraday market coupling is expected to become operational. The third wave includes LIP 14, i.e. all Italian borders and the Bulgarian-Greek border. The electricity operators have successfully completed all formalities necessary to join LIP 14 and has been working on project implementation since February 2020. The intraday market coupling on the Bulgarian-Greek border is expected to become operational by the end of 2020. Demand response  By introducing amendments to national law, Bulgaria plans to establish suitable conditions for creating active consumers, opportunities for associations through aggregators or energy communities and their active participation in demand response in different market segments.    158  ii. Measures to increase the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production such as smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, real-time price signals, including the roll-out of intraday market coupling and cross-border balancing markets  Introducing smart metering devices as an incentive for the active and effective participation of consumers in the market;  Wishing to modernise its energy sector and in accordance with Article 10(c) of Directive (EU) 2018/410 [amending Directive 2003/87/EC] to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments and Decision (EU) 2015/1814, Bulgaria will further use the possibility for transitional free allocation of greenhouse gas emission allowances to electricity generation during the fourth stage of EU ETS transition period 2021-2030. To this end, the National Investment Framework for the period 2021-2030 will be implemented, which envisages a possibility to free allowances to be allocated to operators against an obligation to invest in energy sector modernisation. During the period in question, Bulgaria envisages to introduce interim measures to enable the implementation of the following reforms:  Introducing price limits on the balancing market in order to send correct price signals to investors. Maximum and minimum prices consistent with the day-ahead and intraday time intervals and in line with the Balancing Regulation.  Creating appropriate conditions and increased participation of demand response, in individual or aggregated terms, both in the wholesale market and in the balancing market.  Upgrade of the transmission network to alleviate internal overloads. Increased interconnection capacity. The implementation of the Yadenitsa project aimed at increasing the volume of the lower reservoir of Chaira Pumped Storage Plant (PAVETs) by the construction of Yadenitsa reservoir and a reversible pressure tunnel connection with Chaira reservoir will ensure a electricity generation from renewable energy sources according to the long-term strategies for energy development in Bulgaria and the European Union. iii. Where applicable, measures to ensure the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets Regulatory framework development to ensure that consumers have the right to use renewable electricity obtained from auto-production. The framework should ensure that the consumers of such electricity, either individually or through aggregators, have the right to act as auto-producers of electricity from renewable sources, including for their   159  own use, accumulate and sell surplus electricity from renewable sources, including through agreements for the purchase of electricity from renewable sources, electricity suppliers and [under] commercial agreements between partners, without being subjected to any assessment [for the purpose of] pending or disproportionate procedures and charges [sic]. iv. Policy measures to protect consumers with a focus on vulnerable consumers and, where applicable, consumers at risk of energy poverty, and to improve the competitiveness and affordability of the retail electricity market. At present assistance is provided to vulnerable consumers on a means tested basis. Pursuant to the Social Assistance Act and Regulation No RD-07-5 of 16 May 2008 on the terms and procedure for allocation of targeted heating assistance, targeted heating assistance is provided to some socially vulnerable groups during the heating season. The programme covers the persons and families that meet the legally established conditions and requirements for income, property and health status, marital status, age, training and job employment, etc. The regulation defines 17 risk groups with differentiated minimum income that are eligible for heating assistance depending on the degree of risk and the priorities set. At present, about 250 000 individuals and families are recipients of such assistance.  The assistance mechanism is as follows: Heating allowances are provided for the respective heating season (1 November31 March), i.e. for 5 months, in an amount determined by an order of the Minister for Labour and Social Policy adopted before the beginning of the season, taking into account the electricity price for household customers determined by the KEVR on the basis of a projected consumption of 385 kWh electricity, including 280 kWh at the daytime rate and 105 kWh at the night-time rate (the quantity of energy required for heating one room). There is an option to select the type of fuel: solid fuel, electricity, gas or heat. This type of assistance will continue to be applied as a measure to support energy poor people.  The electricity market in Bulgaria is partly liberalised, with a regulated share of 40 %. In line with Third Liberalisation Package of the EU, Bulgaria took steps toward full liberalisation of its electricity market. The phasing out of regulated prices for all final consumers will boost competition among electricity suppliers but it will also expose consumers to greater price volatiliprotection to vulnerable household consumers of electricity. In this regard, on the basis of a detailed analysis, policy measures were developed to ensure that the transition to a liberalised retail electricity market will be smooth and staged for household consumers. The transition will involve a partial regulation of the price in the beginning until the regulated component of the price is completely eliminated. Before the process of full liberalisation of the electricity market commences, a mechanism for protection of vulnerable consumers of electricity will be implemented; it will include criteria for identification of such customers and financial and non-financial measures for their   160  protection. The mechanism for protection of vulnerable consumers will be implemented [sic]. The mechanism for protection of vulnerable consumers of electricity aims to ensure all-year cover of minimum electricity needs other than heating needs. In addition to these short-term measures, long-term measures for investment in energy efficiency or lowering consumption and demand for heating and cooling in the household sector are being sought. Energy efficiency measures will lead to a decrease in the number of consumers who currently satisfy the criteria for energy poverty. An improvement in energy efficiency is likely to have several positive effects, including by lowering energy poverty. In the long-term, the entire EU building stock must undergo (deep) renovation and conversion into near zero-energy consumption buildings and national renovation strategies must facilitate a cost-efficient transformation, taking into account that some households are energy poor. There is a need for the development of national action plans or other appropriate frameworks to overcome energy poverty and Member States must ensure the necessary supply of energy to vulnerable clients by adopting appropriate social policies or improving the energy efficiency of buildings. (Http://enr-network.org/wp-content/uploads/ENERGYPOVERTY-EnRPositionPaper-January-2019.pdf) A National programme for energy efficiency of multi-family residential buildings, the requirements and procedure for providing grant assistance under the programme and for the designation of the bodies responsible for its implementation was adopted by Regulation No 18 of 2 February 2015. The programme is aimed at the renovation of multi-family residential buildings by implementing energy efficiency measures to create better living conditions for citizens in multi-family residential buildings and ensure heat comfort and higher quality of the living environment.  v. Description of measures to enable and develop demand response including those addressing tariffs to support dynamic pricing13 thod has introduced to determine natural gas transmission tariffs in accordance with the European regulation. It provides an opportunity for tariff setting. 3.4.4 Energy poverty i. Where applicable, policy measures to achieve the objectives set out in point 2.4.4 In addition to the measures designed to encourage the active participation of consumers in the electricity supply market, measures designed to protect consumers will also be applied. In connection with this, the policy for full electricity market liberalisation will include measures guaranteeing a smooth and gradual transition for household                                            13 In accordance with Article 15(8) of Directive 2012/27/EU.   161  customers. During this gradual transition the retail prices of electricity will be deregulated in several stages until fully liberalised. Full electricity price liberalisation in the household sector will be given the green light only after a mechanism for the protection of vulnerable consumers of electricity has been put in place. These are the household consumers in a state of energy poverty due to a combination of low income, high energy costs and low energy efficiency of the homes they live in. The mechanism for protection of vulnerable consumers will include criteria for their identification, and financial and non-financial measures for their protection. It aims to ensure that the minimum quantity of electricity, other than the quantity of energy for heating for which consumers in this group are entitled to receive a separate allowance, are covered throughout the year. In the long term, measures to improve the energy efficiency of the homes of energy poor consumers in order to lower their energy costs and improve their living comfort will be implemented in addition to the above measures. At present assistance is provided to vulnerable consumers on a means tested basis. Pursuant to the Social Assistance Act and Regulation No RD-07-5 of 16 May 2008 on the terms and procedure for allocation of targeted heating assistance, targeted heating assistance is provided to some socially vulnerable groups during the heating season.

The mechanism for protection of vulnerable consumers of electricity aims to ensure all-year cover of minimum electricity needs other than heating needs. 3.5 Research, innovation and competitiveness dimension i. Policy measures related to the elements set out in point 2.5.3 support the adoption of new technologies with a view to achieving overall energy cost savings, introducing new energy efficiency standards and enabling the transition to lower and more sustainable energy consumption in Bulgaria. In connection with this, the Innovation Strategy for Smart Specialisation 20142020 identifies as a priority area the development of clean technologies with a focus on transport and energy (energy storage, energy saving and efficient distribution, electrical vehicles and eco-mobility, hydrogen-based models and technologies, waste-free technologies, technologies and methods that include the use of by-products and materials from one production in other productions). With a view to achieving these goals, the Ministry of Economy has launched a process of preparation of the Innovation Strategy for Smart Specialisation 20212027, along with an Action Plan to it.   Over the last decade research and innovation have evolved into a key policy priority for the EU. Bulgaria therefore considers research and innovation as a genuine opportunity to improve the competitiveness of the national economy, transforming them into a driver for economic growth and job creation. The to promote:   the deployment of highly efficient energy technologies;  the deployment of smart grids and energy storage technologies;  research in the area of nuclear technology;  research into the possibilities to deploy electrochemical power sources, such as rechargeable batteries, hydrogen and fuel cell technologies. With a view to implementing innovation policy, the following measures will be taken:  increasing the number of innovative start-ups (innovation implementation and development) in high-tech and intensive sectors in line with the Strategy for Smart Specialisation;   increasing the competitiveness and effectiveness of research by placing an emphasis on results and providing incentives (such as better working   163  conditions, international co-operation and mobility, co-operation with business) with a view to attracting high-skilled research teams;  Developing skills at the level of universities and research institutions that enhance the commercial viability and market importance of their research projects and ability to participate in research consortiums;  Support for co-operation between research organisations and businesses, technology transfer and exploitation of research results;  Promoting business investments in research and the deployment of innovation in the form of industrial and household applications; A pilot project for a hydrogen plant with total installed capacity of 20 MW will be developed. On the basis of project results an analysis of the further development of hydrogen power plants after 2030 will be conducted. In addition, Bulgaria intends to participate in the following research and development initiatives:   CROSSBOW  Cross-border management of variable renewable energies and storage units enabling greater flexibility of the energy system as regards the production of renewable energy;  FLEXITRANSTORE  an Integrated Platform for increased flexibility in smart transmission grids with storage entities and large penetration of renewable energy sources, which will increase flexibility on the internal energy market;  INTERRFACE  Consumer interface architecture to provide innovative grid services for an efficient power system thereby increasing flexibility on the internal energy market;  SDN-microSENSE-SDN  microgrid resilient electrical energy system, a project aiming to enhance security on the internal energy market;  FORESIGHT  Advanced cyber-security simulation platform for preparedness training in aviation, naval and power-grid environments aiming to enhance security on the internal energy market;  X-FLEX  Integrated energy solutions and new market mechanisms for an extended flexibility of the European grid;  FARCROSS  Facilitating regional cross-border electricity transmission through innovation, extending IEM system flexibility, facilitating regional cooperation and enhancing system security;  TRINITY  Increasing transmission capacity across regional borders through smart market technologies, extending IEM system flexibility to expand regional co-operation;  Financial compensation mechanism to support the competitiveness of industries at risk, aiming to reduce the harmful emissions they release;    164   National research programmes of the Ministry of Education and Science  Low-carbon economy for transport and life (EPLUS) and Environmental protection and lowering the risk of adverse events and natural disasters, aiming to generate know-how with a focus on the storage and conversion of renewable energy, hydrogen-based technologies and eco-mobility, conducting fundamental and applied research. The programmes will be implemented over a period of 3 to 5 years. In the coming years, the government will focus its efforts on the implementation of new energy saving technologies with a significant contribution to lowering carbon emissions in the air, combating the greenhouse effect and preventing buildings from overheating. The use of advanced innovative technologies with a potential to significantly reduce the penetration of ultraviolet and infrared radiation with a harmful impact on human health into buildings through glass surfaces will be stimulated. The aim is to significantly reduce energy costs ensuring a relatively rapid return on investment with a view to improving the living and working environment for Bulgarian citizens. The low-carbon economy will have a major contribution to achieving the target for the lowering noxious substances released in the atmosphere. In connection with this, steps will be taken to lower the noxious atmospheric emissions from transport, agriculture and the industry. For this purpose, innovative air aspiration and filtering systems will be implemented that conform to the highest EU requirements for the capture of more than 90 % of noxious gases, steam and particulate emissions released during energy production, metal production and processing, inert material excavation and processing (cement, lime, asphalt, marble etc.), the pharmaceutical industry, the chemical industry (acid gases, hydrogen sulphide, hydrogen cyanide, hydrochloric acid, etc.), the food industry (NOx, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, etc.). Technologies and innovative products, varying from portable industrial units for temporary suction of pollutants from the air to centralised systems for large sectors and manufacturing operations may also be used. The Bulgarian government will support the deployment in working environments of energy saving innovations and solutions that reduce the harmful emissions of particular matter released into the atmosphere in order to ensure healthier and safer living and working conditions for citizens. Options for the use electrochemical sources of power, such as chargeable batteries, hydrogen energy and fuel elements will continue to be explored. ii. Where applicable, cooperation with other Member States in this area, including, where appropriate, information on how the SET plan objectives and policies are being translated to a national context In view of the importance of innovations for the future development of a clean and highly efficient energy sector, the attention and efforts of the Bulgarian government will be focused on the implementation of projects for the deployment of innovations in energy sector in line with the Strategic Energy Technology Plan for Europe. Changes to the overall energy sector model are currently deliberated, including the penetration of smart   165  grids, energy storage systems and highly efficient energy technologies and systems in the economy and daily life with a view to lowering energy costs for consumers. The passive design of a green living environment will require a branch new approach, including finding a balance between building orientation, glass elements in construction, ventilation systems and the implementation of highly efficient insulation technologies, systems and materials. The implementation of advanced highly efficient technologies and new generation systems for buildings and glass panelling will significantly lower energy costs for final consumers and contribute to finding solutions to the challenge of decarbonisation while improving living and working conditions. In order to promote the cost-effective development of low-carbon technologies in Bulgaria, the government will also rely on the SET Plan developed at EU level, which promotes cross-sector co-operation on innovation, and on the European Innovation Fund. iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds Bulgaria finances public research institutions on the basis of effectiveness criteria and has developed national research programmes with the aim of consolidating research potential  total public investment. In the multi-annual financial framework for the period 20142020, the financial envelope from the EU Structural and Investment Funds earmarked as support intended to help Bulgaria address reform challenges is in the amount of EUR 11.7 billion or approximately 2.8 institutions, innovative companies and researchers have received grants from other sources and EU programmes, such as the Horizon 2020 Programme. Their currently stands at approximately EUR 65 million EU financing helps companies and research institutions mobilise additional private investments. Grant assistance from the European Regional Development Fund alone has generated approximately EUR 113 million in additional private capital for companies. A total of 5.2 % of the financing available under the European Regional Development Fund has been earmarked for RD&I and SMEs, entrepreneurship, energy efficiency, urban development and environmental management. These funds will help raise an additional EUR 247 million in public and private investment. Six infrastructure and innovation projects in which Bulgaria will participate have been approved to date. Their total amount is EUR 302 million, which in turn is expected to generate EUR 769 million in investments.  The energy and energy efficiency infrastructure projects are financed under an 20142020. For this purpose, grant assistance in the amount of BGN 76.2 million was provided for the construction of the GreeceBulgaria interconnector. The implementation of this project will enable the construction of gas transmission infrastructure for the Southern Gas Corridor and ensure the security of gas supply for Bulgaria by enhancing transit capacity to the countries of South East Europe. This will help diversify imported gas through additional sources of supply from the Caspian region, the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean.   166      167  SECTION B: ANALYTICAL BASIS  4.

Technology cost developments 4.2 Decarbonisation 4.2.1 GHG emissions and removals i. Current share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption and in different sectors (heating and cooling, electricity and transport) as well as per technology in each of these sectors In 2016, GHG emissions in Bulgaria amounted to 59 060 Gg CO2, excluding the LULUCF sector. Emissions have decreased by 49.41 % compared to 1988 (baseline) and by 4.4 % compared to the emissions in the previous year (2015). The main reasons for the reduction of GHG emissions in Bulgaria are:  the structural reforms in the economy that resulted from the transition from planned to market economy;  the reduced electricity generation by thermal power plants (and increased shares of water and nuclear energy);  the structural changes in industry (including the lower output of energy-intensive enterprises and the improved energy efficiency);  implementing energy efficiency measures in the housing sector;  shift from solid and liquid fuels to natural gas in energy consumption;  the decline in the populations of bovine animals and sheep and in the use of fertilisers.

The share of emissions covered by the emissions trading scheme in total GHG emissions stood at 56.6 % in 2016, and the share of emissions outside the scheme stood at 42.2 %. Energy sector In 2016, the emissions from the Energy sector decreased by 47.9 % compared to the baseline year (42 386 Gg CO2eq in 2016 compared to 81 320 Gg CO2eq in 1988). Compared to the previous year, in 2016 the emissions decreased by 6.9 % due to the lower electricity output from fossil fuels. The main source of emissions in the sector is the incineration of solid fuels which accounted for 57.8 % of the emissions in the sector in 2016, followed by liquid fuels at 29.0 % and gaseous fuels at 12.2 %. GHG emissions between 1988 and 2016 were driven by the significant reduction in emissions from fuel combustion in the energy industries (35.7 %) and in the use of energy in the manufacturing industry and construction (83.4 %) and in other sectors (commercial, residential, forestry)  72.3 %, as well as by the clear increase in GHG emissions from transport by 30.2 %.

Emissions in 2016 decreased by 54.9 % as compared to the baseline year 1988. In 2016, the IPUS sector had a share of 10.3 % of total national emissions of greenhouse gases (excluding LULUCF) as compared to 11.5 % in the baseline year 1988. in 2016 GHG emissions from IPUS stood at 6 062 Gg CO2 as compared to 13 438 Gg CO2 in the baseline year 1988. In 2016, the most important category were mineral products (mainly production of clinker and lime) with a 40.44 % share in total emissions from IPUS. The second category was the chemical industry (production of ammonia and nitric acid) with 30.32 %, followed by the use of products intended as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances with a share of 23.1 % and the manufacturing of metals (steel) with a share of 3.69 %. The GHG emissions from the IPUS sector vary over time and reached a record low in 2009. The reduction in 2016 for the entire sector was 54.9 % of the baseline year value, with the highest reduction of 94.4 % in metals manufacturing. This was mainly due to the economic crisis and the 2009 global economic crisis in particular. After 1996, a process of privatisation began, which led to lower output of enterprises. This process was followed by restructuring and modernisation of production while some enterprises discontinued their operation. The overall decline in emissions over the years was also influenced by the deployment of better technologies at company level. Table 35  Year 1988 1990 2016 Aggregated emissions, Gg CO2 eq. 13.438 10.047 6.062  Agriculture sector The total reduction of emissions in the sector for the period since 1988 was 52.6 %. In 2016, agriculture generated 11.0 % to total GHG emissions in Bulgaria (excluding LULUCF). The emissions reduction was mainly due to the consistent decrease in agricultural land as a result of abandoned cropland and lower livestock population. The decreased use of fertilisers was another driver of emissions reduction.   172  Table 36: Projected GHG emissions in the Agriculture sector, Gg 2eq. Year 1988 1990 2016 Aggregated emissions, Gg CO2 eq. 13.768 12.462 6.583  Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector The LULUCF sector plays the role of greenhouse gas remover for Bulgaria through the CO2 2 emissions. Net CO2 removals from the LULUCF sector decreased by 57.1 % as compared to 1988 (baseline). The main reason for the drop in CO2 emission removals was the drop in removals by Forests and the small increase of emissions from the categories Cropland, Settlements and Wetland.  The key reason for the reduced removals by the Forests category was the reported decline in the growth of forests as the average age of forests has been consistently increasing during the reporting period. Despite the drop, the share of removals in total 2 eq) is still significant. This is because the emissions in the other sectors have decreased too. The share of removals in the baseline year was 15.01 % of 2 emissions, and in 2016 their share stood at 12.44 %. Compared to the baseline year, an increase in cropland, settlements and wetland is observed. Total emissions from cropland fluctuated throughout the period. Emissions from settlements increased in recent years due to changes from other land uses near to the EU. Figure 21: Emissions and removals in LULUCF 1989  2016, Gg  eq.  Baseline year LULUCF D.

Harvested wood products Source: National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report   173  Waste sector The 24 and N2O emissions. The main share of CH4 emissions from the sector is due to municipal solid waste disposal. N2O emissions are generated in waste water treatment and biological treatment and incineration of waste. CO2 comes from waste incineration. The trends reflect the current state-of-play in waste management in accordance with applicable legislation with the aim of reducing the quantity of waste going to landfills and in line with the waste management hierarchy. Planned measures for GHG emission reduction in the sector involve mainly the management of municipal solid waste. Bulgarian waste management policy is implemented in strict compliance with the waste hierarchy principle: Prevention -> Preparation for re-use -> Recycling -> Other use -> Landfilling Good waste management lowers pressure from waste disposal and mitigates the effects of landfilling. The European Environmental Agency (EEA) has estimated that improved waste management significantly lowers annual net GHG emissions, with the greatest share of emissions reduction being achieved after 2000. The main factors contributing to this positive development are the lower methane emissions from landfills and the avoidance of emissions through recycling. An additional instrument for expanding recycling is that demand for certain materials is largely satisfied by recycled materials. Waste constitute a loss of material resources (through metals and other recyclable materials) as they have a potential as energy sources. Waste management is beset by major challenges. Waste treatment activities such as re-use and recycling are environmentally-friendly and lead to landfill diversion. In 2016, the total municipal waste produced per person in Bulgaria was 404 against the EU average of 483 kg) Figure 22: Progress achieved in waste management in Bulgaria as compared to EU average (1/2)  Municipal waste recycling Municipal waste landfilling EU target 2035 EU target 2035 EU target 2020   Bulgaria 2016 Bulgaria 2016  Source: Eurostat news release   174   Figure 23 Progress achieved in waste management in Bulgaria as compared to EU average (2/2)  Recycling of packaging waste Recycling of plastic packaging waste Electric and electronic waste EU target 2030 EU target 2030 EU target 2006 EU target 2008* EU target 2008*    Bulgaria 2016 Bulgaria 2016 Bulgaria 2016  *Bulgaria was expected to achieve its goals in 2014. Source: Eurostat news release  The measures to reduce GHG emissions in the sector are mainly related too solid municipal waste management and to the continual fall in population in the last 10 years. The respective measures are set out in two plans  the National Waste Management Plan and the Third National Climate Change Action Plan. Both plans have a time horizon until 2020. In 2016, emissions from the waste sector decreased by 50.39 % (4 081.82 Gg CO2 eq. in 2016 against 8 227.31 Gg CO2 eq. in 1988) as compared to baseline levels.  Table 37: Trend in 2eq.

Projections by sector with the existing national and Union policies and measures by 2040 (including 2030) (recast) Projected GHG emissions for the Energy sector Projected GHG emissions for the energy sector are based on an analysis of the change in existing measures planned and used as basic assumptions. The analysis is based on the (B)EST modelling software for long-term assessment of energy needs and energy planning. The projections take into account all existing measures for greenhouse gas emissions reduction and the existing measures to achieve the targets for energy from renewable sources and energy efficiency set out in detail in the relevant sections of this Plan. The general trends for the energy sector are as follows: Table 39: Projected emissions in the Energy sector, CO2 eq. ktoe Emissions 2015 2020 2025 2030 2 emissions, in ktoe CO2 eq.  45 428.60 44 516.48 43 590.16 37 923.98 CH4 and N2O emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 1 822.85 2 085.07 2 102.87 2 065.62 Total GHG emissions, ktoe CO2 eq. 47 251.45 46 601.55 45 693.02 39 989.60 Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling   176   The results of the modelling set out in the table above show that by 2030 GHG emissions will decrease by 15.4 % as compared to emission levels in 2015 (baseline). The main specifically the fact that during the period analysed primary energy production decreased by 8.5 TWh. This s largely due to the projected continual decrease in the production of energy from solid fuels in the period 2020-2030, which the main source of GHG emissions in the energy sector. The shares of wind, hydro- and geothermal power are projected to remain the same against an increase in the share of natural gas from 1.06 % in 2020 up to 2.34 % in 2030. Solar power is projected to increase from 1.18 % in 2020 to 3.95 % in 2030. In 2030, nuclear energy is expected to continue to play an important role in energy production. More information about the changes in the energy mix contributing to a reduction in the greenhouse emissions analysed in this section is set out in the sections on the increase in the use of energy from renewable sources, energy efficiency, the internal energy market and energy security.
