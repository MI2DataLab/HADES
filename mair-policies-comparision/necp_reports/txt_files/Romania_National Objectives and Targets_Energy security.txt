2.3. Dimension energy security i. The elements set out in point (c) of Article 4 In order to establish and to align the national objectives pertaining to this dimension, an inventory was made with the various initiatives, decisions and current developments that bring forward the specific objectives of this dimension and which underpin the activities and strategic action plans for the period 2021-2030, with an outlook on 2050.  The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         ii. National objectives with regard to increasing: the diversification of energy sources and energy supply from third countries; for the purpose of reducing import dependency Romania considers that the primary objective for the national energy security is to ensure energy supply from internal sources. Romania proposes to maintain a diversified energy mix by 2030 taking into account both the decarbonisation objective of the energy system and the assurance of its flexibility and adequacy. In this respect, the trend in the installed capacities in the period 2020-2030 is set out in the chart below: Chart 11  Indicative trajectory of the net installed capacity per source, [MW]   Source: Deloitte calculation based on the information submitted by the INECP Interinstitutional  RO EN Hidroenergie Hydro Eolian Wind Solar Solar energy  Biomass  Crude oil and petroleum products Gaze naturale  Natural gas  Combustibili solizi  Solid fuels   Nuclear energy  In order to secure energy consumption, the installed capacity will increase by approximately 35 % in 2030 compared to 2020 due to the deployment of new wind energy capacities (of 2 302 MW by 2030) and solar energy capacities (3 692 by 2030), which will result in an increase in the domestic energy production, thus ensuring a higher level of energy independence. The positive impact is visible especially in the reduction of dependency on imports from third countries from a rate of 20.8 %, as projected in 2020, to 17.8 % in 2030, accounting for one of the lowest rates of dependency on energy imports in the EU. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         Moreover, there is a prospect of replacing several coal-based units with natural gas-supplied combined cycle units, of refurbishing a nuclear plan and of building at least one new nuclear plant by 2030. As regards natural gas supply21, Romania envisages in particular the development of the National System of Natural Gas Transmission on the Bulgaria-Romania-Hungary-Austria Corridor (BRHA) and the development of the Southern Transmission Corridor to take over the natural gas from the Black Sea shore. The current interconnections will be further used to the north--east (Isaccea) with Ukraine, to the west with Hungary, to the south with Bulgaria and to the east with the Republic of Moldova. iii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to reducing energy import dependency from third countries, for the purpose of increasing the resilience of regional and national energy systems Romania considers that it still has primary resource deposits so their tapping was included as an objective in this Plan in order to achieve a low level of energy dependency and to secure the operation of the NES. In this respect, the expeditious implementation of the legal framework required for the final decisions on investment in the tapping of natural gas resources in the Black Sea area is a significant objective for Romania. See Chapter 3.3.i for more details. iv. National objectives with regard to increasing the flexibility of the national energy system, in particular by means of deploying domestic energy sources, demand response and energy storage A significant objective for Romania in the field of energy security is to ensure the flexibility and adequacy of the national energy system. In connection with the objective of ensuring a diversified energy mix, as described in Chapter 2.3.ii, Romania proposes to replace the electricity production capacities to be decommissioned with new effective low-carbon capacities by 2030 (see the Decarbonisation Plan proposed by the Oltenia Energy Complex Unit). Until the replacement of coal-based capacities with new capacities based on low-carbon technologies, rehabilitation works will be envisaged, as well as the increase in energy efficiency on the existing capacities, which will remain in operation for reasons of energy security for Romania. Romania also sets forth objectives to foster demand response consumption in order to ensure response to the demand variations and objectives regarding storage of energy. The development and tapping of the technical and economic potential of RES in the NES depend on the development of storage capacities and of technologies for injection of hydrogen in the form of synthesis gas from RES and the use of hydrogen in industrial processes. As regards the response to the demand variations, Romania implemented in 201222 a legal framework regarding consumption management by using a legal act to limit consumption of electricity for each concessionaire distribution system operator. Another important objective for consumption management is to operationalise the dynamic tariffs under the secondary law applicable to TSO and DSO. Romania also proposes to integrate battery energy storage systems (BESS) into the NES based on the calculation assumptions and information available at TSO level. See Chapter 3.3.i for further details.  As regards the assurance of adequacy for the energy system, according to the assessments of Transelectrica, the acceptable limits for the power produced from wind and photovoltaic                                                 21 Development Plan for the National Natural Gas Transmission System for 2019-2028 (NNGTS) - Transgaz SA - approved by ANRE 22 Government Decision No 83/2012 for adopting certain security measures on the electricity market The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         sources are highly contingent on the level of hydraulicity and heat regime. From the viewpoint of the flexibility of residual power, hours with high consumption in winter/summer, heat minimum/maximum hours and extreme (minimum/maximum) hydraulicity hours are thus essential. The abovementioned assessments point to the need to install additional capacities of at least 400 MW by 2020 and 600 MW (in addition to 2020) in 2025. Having regard to the abovementioned deadlines, Romania is likely to give priority to certain projects (indicated in Chapter 3.3) for the support of which to provide for support scheme (CfD), where the market mechanisms are not sufficient
