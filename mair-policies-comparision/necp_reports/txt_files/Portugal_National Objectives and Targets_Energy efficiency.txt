Dimension Energy efficiency i.1 The indicative national energy efficiency contribution to achieving the Union's binding energy efficiency target of 32.5 % by 203014 The Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) set a target of a maximum limit for the consumption of Primary or Final Energy by 2030 on the basis of forecasts by the 2007 PRIMES model, which is the last COM modelling exercise that did not consider energy efficiency plans and used 2005 as the reference year. The target is equivalent to a reduction of 32.5%, by implementing measures to promote energy efficiency. Just as Portugal showed high levels of ambition and determination to be at the forefront of energy transition by focusing strongly on renewables, energy efficiency also plays a relevant role for the 2030 horizon.  Table 13- The indicative national energy efficiency contribution to achieving the Union's binding energy efficiency target of 32.5% by 2030  2020 2030 Reduction in primary energy consumption target15 25% 35%   The primary energy consumption estimate for the 2030 horizon makes it possible to view compliance with the goal of reducing energy consumption by 35%, as compared to the EU Reference Scenario of 2007 (PRIMES efficiency for the Union in 2030.

Accumulated energy savings to be achieved from 2021-203017 Article 7 of the EED directs all Member States to achieve cumulative savings of final energy, equivalent to new annual savings, from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030, of 0.8% of the average annual consumption of final energy of the last three years prior to 1 January 2019. As such, average final energy consumption was calculated for 2014 to 2016, resulting in a total saving of 6 739 682 toe in the period 2021-2030. This amount of savings is also a goal to be achieved in terms of implementing the aforesaid Article 7 of the EED. The following figure shows accumulated energy savings to be achieved from 2021 to 2030 as a result of the abovementioned article. Figure 23 - The cumulative amount of energy savings to be achieved over the 2021-2030 period under Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU   Ensuring compliance with the goals and targets for energy efficiency will include:  Renovating buildings and NZEB Rehabilitating and making buildings more efficient makes it possible to achieve multiple objectives (e.g. reducing energy bills, improving comfort levels), and as such, the energy renovation of buildings is particularly relevant and a priority action. In this regard, the transposition of the amendments to the EPBD Directive (Energy Performance of Buildings Directive), the new energy certification, the review of the Energy Certification System (SCE) and redesigning mechanisms to fund/support the renovation of buildings are particularly relevant. Furthermore, NZEB (Nearly Zero Energy Buildings) buildings are increasingly important, since they have low or negligible energy needs for air-conditioning systems. Mobility and Transport The path to energy transition and carbon neutrality undoubtedly includes the transport sector. A combination of active and shared mobility, reinforcing public transport and electric mobility will all confer significant benefits in terms of energy efficiency in the transport sector.                                                              16 Excludes non-energy uses 17 Due to Article 7 on the energy saving obligations of Directive 2012/27/EU [version as amended in accordance with proposal COM(2016)761] 43 NECP 2030 Section A - National Plan - Chapter 2. objectives and targets    Industry Promoting the decarbonisation of the industrial sector includes focusing on greater efficiency, use of less resources and a circular economy, optimising as far as possible the nexus of energy, water and material efficiency in manufacturing processes while also ensuring increased productivity and competitiveness. Agroforestry There is a clear opportunity in this sector to create new avenues for improvements in energy consumption, with a view to promoting rational energy use in facilities and processes, contributing toward cost reduction. More efficient agricultural and forestry practices will be promoted, along with the acquisition and use of management tools and the installation and use of more efficient technologies. Equipment Electric equipment, particularly in the domestic and services sector, represents a significant share of energy consumption and it is thus important to make current equipment more efficient by promoting its substitution.   i.3 The indicative milestones of the long-term strategy for the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private18 The long-term strategy is currently being developed for the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, in accordance with Directive 2018/844 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018, amending Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings and Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency. As such, the indicative targets of the strategy, more specifically with regard to renovated area and energy savings, have not yet been defined. These targets will form part of the strategy which, in accordance with Directive 2018/844, are to be defined by 31 March 2020.   i.4 Total area of construction to be renovated or equivalent annual energy savings to be achieved from 2020 to 2030 to promote the exemplary role of public buildings19 As mentioned, the long-term strategy is currently being developed for the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, in accordance with Directive 2018/844 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018, amending Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings and Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency. The indicators to be created for 2030, 2040 and 2050 will reflect the contribution of the measures identified in the strategy to achieve the energy efficiency objectives.   ii. The indicative milestones for 2030, 2040 and 2050, the domestically established measurable progress indicators, an evidence-based estimate of expected energy savings and wider benefits, and their contribution to the Union's energy efficiency targets as included in the roadmaps set out in the long-term renovation strategies for the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, (public and private)20 As mentioned, the long-term strategy is currently being developed for the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, in accordance with Directive 2018/844 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018, amending Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings and Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency.
