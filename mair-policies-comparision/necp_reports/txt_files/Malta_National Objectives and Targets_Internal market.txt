2.4 DIMENSION INTERNAL ENERGY MARKET 2.4.1  Electricity interconnectivity   The level of electricity interconnectivity aimed for in 2030  The electricity networks in Malta and Sicily (Italy) are linked by a 200MW HVAC interconnector, connecting Malta to the European electricity grid, which came into full operation in 2015. This contributes to the robustness of the electricity system and hence the security of supply in Malta, while enabling the trading (predominantly for import and balancing) of electricity on the Italian electricity wholesale market. Malta is considered as a foreign virtual consumption/production zone within the Italian market. The interconnector is operated by Enemalta and considered as part of its distribution system.   remaining well above the EU 15% interconnectivity target. The Government is currently undertaking an assessment to determine which infrastructure requirements are required in the medium-term (until 2035) to ensure the desired level of generation adequacy is maintained. In the area of electricity  53  30 in the area of interconnectivity is therefore to remain above the 15% EU target.  Figure 18 - Electricity interconnectivity level under WPM scenario   Indicators of urgency of action:  1) Price differential in the wholesale market exceeding an indicative threshold of 2EUR/MWh between Member States, regions or bidding zones Enemalta is obliged to dispatch electricity from local generation plants and/or from the interconnector based on their order of economic merit. Any imbalances between the volumes determined on the day-ahead market and actual electricity flows over the interconnector are settled at the prices calculated using the methodology determined by AEEGSI (now ARERA) through its decision 549/2015/R/EEL (Deliberazione 20 Novembre 2015: Disciplina degli sbilanciamenti effettivi applicabile -Malta). In the absence of a liquid wholesale market in Malta, the Regulator (REWS) determines a proxy of the wholesale market price on an annual basis by estimating the variable cost of meeting the demand forecast for a given year from local fossil fuel generation and imported electricity, excluding that portion of forecasted demand which is not expected to be met by conventional sources or imported electricity. The proxy is published annually in Schedule 4 of SL. 545.27 and was included in the State Aid decision issued in relation to the notified competitive bidding process for the granting of aid to generators producing electricity from RES with capacity of 1MWp or more. However, given the structure of the electricity system in Malta, the proxy for the market price is not deemed to be an appropriate indicator to benchmark against the 2EUR/MWh indicative threshold. 2) ak Electricity Load The nominal transmission capacity of the interconnector is 200 MW. Based on projections of national peak load under the WPM scenario, it is expected that the capacity of the interconnector shall remain 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%20172018201920202021202220232024202520262027202820292030Electricity interconnectivity (WPM)WPM2030 EU Target 54  above the indicative threshold of 30% of peak load43 throughout the projected period until 2040 (Figure 19). Nevertheless, moving towards 2040 the nominal transmission capacity of the interconnector will be just sufficient to satisfy this 30% threshold. This is being taken into account in the assessment currently being conducted by the Government, and the best level of interconnectivity will be reviewed once this is concluded. Figure 19 - Nominal transmission capacity of interconnector vs 30% of peak load (WPM), 2018-2040   3) Capacity of interconnector in relation to installed RES The capacity of the interconnector is not expected to be exceeded by the indicative threshold of 30% of projected installed renewable electricity generation capacity between 2021-2030 under the WPM scenario, as shown in Figure 20threshold has limited relevance. RES electricity in Malta is almost exclusively generated from photovoltaic systems with no storage capability and significant intermittency caused by highly variable and localized cloud cover.                                                            43 The projection of peak load does not take into account potential (and likely) variations from the climatic average, that is, the impact of temperatures on peak loads.   0100200300400500600700201820192020202120222023202420252026202720282029203020352040MWCapacity of interconnector vs 30% hourly peak load (MW)Interconnector capacityHourly peak load (MW) - average year30% of peak load 55  Figure 20 - Nominal transmission capacity of interconnector and installed RES generation capacity, 2018-2030  Figure 21  Solar PV generation during a typical day in April with intermittent cloud cover (MW)  Figure 21 shows how, with an installed PV capacity of 133MWp, transients of circa 60MW are experienced within 60 minutes. As the installed renewable electricity generation capacity grows to a projected 266MWp by 2030, these transients are expected to increase proportionally.  In view of the relatively small size of the Maltese grid, such transients are significant and consequential, resulting in interconnector imbalances requiring rapid load shifting, as well as frequent start-up and shutdown of the conventional generating plants.  In practice this means that the interconnector capacity needs to handle the full extent of the imbalances, at least until conventional power plants can be ramped up, if spare capacity is available. This scenario also has significant implications for the DSO which is responsible for balancing the Maltese electricity system, which could be partially mitigated if the Italian electricity intraday wholesale market (with reference to the Sicilian bidding zone) would allow bids closer to gate closure time.

Malta was granted derogations pursuant to Article 66 of Directive EU/2019/944 from the requirements of Article 43 (Unbundling of transmission systems operators), Article 35 (Unbundling of DSO), Article 6 (Third party access), and until 5th July 2027, from Article 4 (Free Choice of Supplier).  Natural Gas Transmission Infrastructure Projects The proposed Malta-Italy Natural Gas Pipeline (MTGP) (Project of Common Interest 5.19) is described in Section 3.3.i. under the Energy Security dimension.  Modernisation projects new, upgraded and more efficient generation capacity which allows the DSO to meet future demand with significantly higher efficiency and lower emissions.  Between 2014-2017, the DSO invested over quality of service. Therefore, no other major modernisation projects are envisaged in the short-term.   Main infrastructure projects envisaged other than Projects of Common Interest LNG storage as a back-up in case of gas disruption The Energy and Water Agency, in cooperation with Transport Malta, conducted a feasibility study, funded under the CEF Synergy, to assess the potential of LNG as marine fuel in Malta. The first part of the study concluded that while the demand for LNG bunkering in the Central Mediterranean is expected to increase at a rather modest rate during the next decade, medium- to long-term solutions will rely on access to LNG storage facilities. Based on the outcomes of this study, synergies with the power sector and the option of having an LNG storage facility to cater for potential gas disruptions shall be explored in the framework of the ongoing study by the Government.    57  2.4.3 Market integration  National objectives related to other aspects of internal energy market, such as increasing system flexibility, market integration and coupling, smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching, curtailment and real-time price signals There is no liquid wholesale market in Malta.  Malta is also eligible to derogate from the application of a number of provisions of Directive (EU) 2019/944.  These acknowledge the specificities of the Maltese electricity system, in particular its size (consumption of circa 2.4TWh per year) and its peripherality at the edge of the EU grid.  These features also contribute to a significant cost to ensure approved availability payments as part of a Power Purchase Agreements and Gas Supply Agreement for the provision of additional generation capacity and gas supply. Enemalta plc is designated as the sole supplier of electricity in Malta.     [If applicable] National objectives related to the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets including a timeframe for when the objectives should be met  The Electricity Market Regulations (SL. 545.13), subject to the fulfilment of requirements related to the maintenance of reliability, safety and stability of the distribution system, oblige the DSO to:   Guarantee the distribution of electricity produced from RES wherever technically feasible and with regard to system stability;   Provide for priority access to the distribution system of electricity produced from RES;   Give priority to generating installations using RES44; and  Ensure that appropriate distribution systems and market-related operational measures are taken in order to minimise the curtailment of electricity produced from RES.   National objectives with regard to ensuring that consumers participate in the energy system and benefit from self-generation and new technologies, including smart meters In line with its programme to ensure an efficient distribution system, Enemalta has equipped 99.6% of its consumers with smart meters and has adopted a tariff system that favours the prudent use of energy. Objectives and actions concerning renewable self-generation are discussed in section 3.1.2.vi. The expected increased share of renewable self-consumption by consumers with an installed PV system would provide additional benefits in the form of reduced stress on the electricity grid, in particular during peak hours in the summer months.  Additionally, a second generation of smart meters are being installed which will allow the consumer to be more aware of his energy consumption. This will be done through the consumer energy                                                            44 This shall be aligned with Article 12 to Regulation (EU) 2019/943.  58  management system where in-house display systems, smart phones and other devices will provide the consumer with real-time information on their consumption. Through this readily accessible information, the consumer has the opportunity to better understand his consumption patterns, resulting in increased energy conservation.  National objectives with regard to ensuring electricity system adequacy, as well as for the flexibility of energy system with regard to renewable energy production, including a timeframe for when the objectives shall be met Measures related to the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production are set out in Section 3.3.i. Enemalta is responsible to ensure the desired level of electricity system adequacy.  Gsame site), a peaking power plant (also at the same site), an interconnector with Sicily, and several small-scale PV generators, Enemalta adopts a N-1 approach when establishing generation system adequacy. In other words, Enemalta aims to be in a position to still meet the peak demand in the event of the failure of the largest generator. Enemalta shall continue to abide by the national objective to maintain the same level of generation adequacy, based on the present approach.  Furthermore, in view of current grid integration issues of renewables on the low voltage side, Enemalta shall continue to upgrade its sub-stations with transformers integrated with voltage tap-changers, as well as take onboard new technologies which mitigate against these issues and allow further deployment of small scale PV systems on rooftops.  Support for additional PV capacity shall also be aligned with the exigencies of a stable grid and shall consider options which facilitate the integration of battery storage.  This promises to provide several benefits, including mitigation of overvoltage on the LV network, peak shaving, increased self-consumption and demand management. However, this depends significantly on the availability of storage solutions at an appropriate price point, such that any Government intervention can yield the desired results.   National objectives to protect energy consumers and improve the competitiveness of the retail energy sector Competition in the supply of fuels is ensured through existing legislation enforced by the Regulator for Energy and Water Services and the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority.  A number of suppliers are active in this sector.  There is only one supplier of electricity in Malta.  Details about policies and measures addressing vulnerable and energy poor consumers is provided    59  2.4.4 Energy poverty  [If applicable] National objectives with regard to energy poverty Governance Regulation is described in section 3.4.4. The assessment concluded that Malta does not have a significant number of households under energy poverty and therefore national objectives in this area have not been set. Nevertheless, as described in 3.4.4. Malta will continue to assess potential measures focusing on the alleviation of energy poverty and vulnerable groups of consumers.
