NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 160   5. IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF PLANNED POLICIES AND MEASURES 5.1. Impacts of planned policies and measures on the energy system and on GHG emissions and removals, including comparison with projections based on existing policies and measures  i. Projections of the evolution of the energy system and GHG emissions and removals as well as, where relevant of emissions of air pollutants in accordance with Directive (UE) 2016/2284 under the planned policies and measures  With respect to projections for total primary energy consumption for the 2030 horizon, it is expectable that, given the policies and measures planned for implementation in the 2020-2030 period, particularly the focus on renewable energies and the decommissioning of coal-fired plants, consumption of energy will continue on a downward trend which could lead to aagr of between -0.5% and -2.3%. As a result of the decommissioning of the two coal-fired plants, this source of energy will no longer feature in the mix of primary energy consumption, contributing significantly to a reduction in the energy bill. In 2030, renewables will have the largest weighting in the energy mix, standing at more than 40%, almost double the weighting of 2015. The weighting of natural gas will remain practically unchanged in the coming decade, and oil products will drop below 40% in the weighting.

Electricity is gaining increasing relevance in the mix of final energy consumption. Projections show that the weighting of electricity in total consumption will be above 30% by 2030, meaning that it will be the main energy used in 2030. Biomass and natural gas will gain further expression by 2030 and hydrogen will appear as a new energy source, while the consumption of heat will remain stable in coming years. On an opposite trajectory will be oil products which will see their weighting in the energy mix reduce in the next decade between 13 p.p. and 20 p.p. over figures for 2015. These changes will depend greatly on the speed of the electrification of the economy and the penetration of renewable gases such as hydrogen. It is important to mention that the growing importance given to renewable gases, particularly hydrogen, does not have any direct influence of the scenarios presented. The potential of such renewable gases in Portugal requires a more in-depth analysis, which will take place in 2020-2021 and appear in the NECP review to take place in 2023, for submission to the Commission at the end of 2024.

Petrolíferos Oil products  As part of work under RCN2050, projections were made for the activity trajectories and the respective GHG emissions of the corresponding sectors, the energy system (including the production, transmission and consumption of energy sectors), agriculture, forestry and other land uses and waste and wastewater. This exercise further included an equally detailed assessment for 2030 and 2040 which allowed new emissions trajectories to be delineated compatible with the national objective to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. A new development in relation to similar exercises conducted in the past is the fact that some of the expectable climate changes for the horizon 2050 were included in the modelling. These changes included alterations in the efficiency of technologies, demand for services and the availability of resources (such as a reduction in hydro availability or an increase in cooling requirements).  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 163   Results from these projections have allowed potential national emission reduction to be reanalysed, confirming the technical and economic viability of pursuing a low-carbon trajectory for 2020/2030, on the road to carbon neutrality in 2050. A sector analysis of emissions trajectories confirms that all sectors have significant potential to reduce GHG emissions, although the speeds of reduction may differ. Analysis of the behaviour of the different sectors in the conditions established for the existing policies scenario, as well as for the additional policies (or neutrality scenarios) helps identify key factors, trends and behaviours for the same timeframe considered. The methodologies used to estimate GHG emissions is that set out in the National Inventory Report (NIR). A specific projection methodology for the respective activity variables was adopted for each of the sectors of activity. However, it was based on the same socio-economic framework to ensure consistency in the projections obtained. It should be further noted that, for the purposes of the projections presented in the existing policies scenario, the policies and measures instruments approved and published up to 31 December 2017 were taken into account, as were a number of commitments undertaken by Portugal, such as the termination of power production from coal. Shown below is a results summary of modelling carried out on GHG emissions per sector for the 2030 and 2040 horizons, in existing and additional policies scenarios.

Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 164   decades, and cost-effective potential exists for Portugal to reduce total emissions by 2030 of around 51% in relation to 2005. This figure will rise to 60% by 2040 (without LULUCF). In 2030, this reduction will be largely the result of the closure of coal-fired power plants and focus on the role of renewable energies in the national energy mix, particularly solar. By 2030, the electricity production sector has the potential to reduce GHG emissions by around 93% with respect to 2005 (and around a 97% reduction by 2040). The transport and mobility sector is also expected to see far-reaching changes with much increased use of electric vehicles and potential emissions reduction of around 41% by 2030 with respect to 2005 and around 60% by 2040. The services and wastes sectors also have solid potential to reduce GHG emissions, contributing with 62% and 49%, respectively by 2030 (and 73% and 64%, respectively, by 2040). This will be due to increased energy efficiency and compliance with the Landfill Directive restricting deposits to just 10% by 2035. In relation to the waste sector, the existing policies scenario already assumes compliance with the target set out in the Landfill Directive, and as such, the projections for this sector are identical in both in the existing policies as well as in the additional policies scenarios. In the same timeframe, the residential, industrial and agriculture sectors have lower decarbonisation potential. Even so, the residential sector could contribute with a reduction of 23% by 2030 (around 27% by 2040) and the industrial sector with 42% (around 47% in 2040). For the agricultural sector, figures show a reduction of 3% by 2030. Taking into account the effect of agricultural land and pasture, reductions could reach 22% by this time. With regard to F-gases, the relevance of which terms of emissions has increased in recent years, reductions are expected of around 20% by 2030 and 52% by 2040. As was the case in the waste sector, compliance with the targets set out in the Kigali Amendment are also assumed in the F-gases sector, and as such, the projections for this sector are identical in both in the existing policies as well as in the additional policies scenarios. However, additional policy measures need to be considered for the majority of sectors, so as to achieve a more ambitious low-carbon trajectory allowing carbon neutrality to be reached by 2050. Additional Policies Scenario (WAM) With respect to the Additional Policies Scenario (or neutrality scenario), unlike the previous scenario, restrictions are imposed on emissions to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This scenario thus allows the additional effort required by each sector to be assessed, so that overall neutrality is achieved, not exactly reflecting a typical scenario of assessing the impact of planned policies and measures. It can also be seen that cost-effective potential exists to reduce GHG emissions more quickly with respect to the existing policies scenario, around 55% in relation to 2005, with this figure rising to 73% by 2040 (without LULUCF). decarbonising almost all electricity production and drastically reducing emissions from mobility and transport and buildings in the coming two decades (2020-2040). As such, in an additional policies scenario, in 2030 the electricity production would present potential GHG emissions reduction of around 95% over 2005, the transport sector around 46% and the buildings sector 48%. By 2040, these figures would stand at 98%, 84% and 82%, respectively. With respect to industry, reductions of around 47% are expected by 2030 and 59% by 2040, due to the expected improvements in the efficiency of processes and the use of less polluting fuels, with the incorporation of more RDF, biomass and the electrification of a number of sub-sectors. NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 165   In an additional policies scenario, the agricultural sector could contribute to emissions reduction of around 6% by 2030. Taking into account the effect of agricultural land and pasture, reductions could reach 36% by the same date. With respect to waste and F-gases, and in light of the commitments to comply with the targets set out in the Landfill Directive and the Kigali Amendment, respectfully, it can be seen that evolution is similar to the existing policies scenario. In this regard, the role of the forest sink and other soil uses must be reinforced. Efficient agro-forestry management is a determining factor if the objective of carbon neutrality is to be achieved by 2050.

Total without LULUCF -51%. -60%. -55%. -73%.   This neutrality scenario also served to inform on the new targets to reduce the GHG emissions defined for 2030, 2040 and 2050, dropping by -45% to -55% by 2030, -65% to -75% by 2040, and -85% to -90% by 2050 over figures for 2005, as already mentioned. Results obtained show that significant levels of renewable energies in final energy consumption could be achieved, reaching 85-90% in 2050, particularly in electricity production and transport which could achieve full electrification in 2050 (road and rail sectors). There would also be a significant increase in the efficiency of the economy, resulting in a reduction in primary energy consumption of 40% by 2050 and a significant reduction in the energy intensity of the economy   ii. Assessment of policy interactions (between existing policies and measures and planned policies and measures within a strategic policy dimension and between existing policies and measures and planned policies and measures of different dimensions) at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, in particular to establish  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 166   a robust understanding of the impact of energy efficiency and savings policies on the sizing of the energy system and to reduce the risk of stranded investment in energy supply  Not applicable.  iii. Assessment of interactions between existing policies and measures and planned policies and measures, and between those policies and measures and Union climate and energy policy measures  Resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change The special report from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change on the impact of global warming of 1.5 shows that ensuring this maximum ceiling on the mean global temperature increase will have as a practical consequence a significant reduction in associated risks and impacts. According to the majority of studies, countries in southern Europe have greater vulnerabilities and less opportunities as a result of climate change when compared to other sub-regions of the European continent. They will also suffer more deaths caused by heat, water restrictions, loss of habitats, energy needs for cooling and rural fires. This is exemplified in the PESETA II52 project which demonstrated that the economic losses associated with climate change are distributed in a highly asymmetrical manner, with a clear bias towards the regions of southern Europe. In a scenario where the mean temperature rise is 2°C before the end of the century, this study concludes that losses in well-being in terms of GDP would vary from 0.2% in northern Europe to 3% in southern Europe, in the last third of this century. In recent years, the negative effects of climate change have been seen in Portugal, with extreme weather events occurring with greater intensity and frequency, as has been the case with major storms, frequent droughts, large-scale rural fires, heat waves and the worsening of coastal erosion. To adapt in an integrated manner to these effects and prepare the country for possible more serious future scenarios, Portugal has had a National Adaptation Strategy in place since 2010 (ENAAC), built on a solid scientific base and which was reviewed in 2015 (ENAAC 2020). This strategy focuses essentially on improving coordination between areas, particularly those of a transversal nature, on the integration of sector policies and on implementing adaptation measures. Recognising that the impacts of climate change have a strong territorial component means that adaptation must be implemented by local agents. This was one of the central aspects which led to the creation of the AdaPT Programme. Financed by EEA Grants and the Environmental Fund, it was an important milestone in the national adaptation process, bringing about structural projects such as Climadapt.local, originating 27 municipal adaptation strategies and the Climate Portal, an information base providing climate scenarios for Portugal. This programme was the driver for many other projects funded by national and European financing instruments, on both a municipal as well as intermunicipal level, such as the conclusion of adaptation measures, particularly in coastal protection, the efficient use of water, rural fire prevention and the preservation of nature. Currently, the majority of Portuguese territory is covered by more than 50 municipal and intermunicipal adaptation plans. With a view to emphasising the implementation of adaptation measures, mobilising different current financing instruments and defining the framework of future instruments, in 2019, the Action Programme for Adaptation to Climate Change was implemented (P-3AC), for 2030. This programme defines priority areas of intervention in                                                               52 Available at: http://ipts.jrc.ec.europa.eu/publications/pub.cfm?id=7181  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 167   response to the main vulnerabilities and impacts of climate changes identified for national territory:  Increase in the frequency and intensity of rural fires;  Increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves;  Increase in the frequency and intensity of periods of drought and water shortages;  Increase in susceptibility to desertification;  Increase in the maximum temperature;  Increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme rain events;  Rise in seawater levels;  Increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme phenomena causing sea wall breaches and coastal erosion. To counteract such impacts and the vulnerabilities of national territory, a series of interventions with direct impact on the territory was set out in eight action lines plus one line for support instruments. The activities involved were also described along with the respective monitoring indicators and potential sources of funding. The action lines were organised as follows: 1. Prevention of rural fires - structural interventions in agricultural and forestry areas; 2. Implementation of conservation techniques and improvement of soil fertility; 3. Implementation of good practices for water management in agriculture, industry and on an urban level to prevent impacts arising from drought and water shortages; 4. Increase the resilience of ecosystems, species and habitats to the effects of climate change; 5. Reduce the vulnerability of urban areas to heat waves and the increase in the maximum temperature; 6. Prevention of the planting and expansion of invasive exotic species with vector transmitted diseases and agricultural and forestry diseases and pests; 7. Reduce or minimise the risks associated with flooding; 8. Increase coastal resilience and protection in areas presenting high risks of erosion, sea wall breaches and flooding; 9. Development of decision support tools and empowerment and awareness actions.  The total amount of funding granted in recent years under increase in these amounts is expected for the future programme up to 2030, depending on the results of negotiations underway on the multi-annual financial framework. With a view to meeting the challenge of monitoring the effectiveness of the adaptation measures in Portugal, P-3AC instigated quantified targets for a vast range of indicators. In light of this scenario, in 2019 the Action Programme for Adaptation to Climate Change (P-3AC) was implemented, for 2030, which defines the priority areas of intervention in response to the main vulnerabilities and impacts of climate changes identified for national territory. It is further important to note as relevant under this Programme, that there are a number of decarbonisation measures and options which have evident synergies with adaptation to the effects of climate change. These include, measures which contribute to carbon capture by forests and agriculture (increasing organic material in soils and their capacity to retain water, combating desertification), natural base solutions (installation of green roofs and other green infrastructure in urban areas, rewilding of waterproofed areas, etc.). There are also measures to improve energy efficiency which have already helped reduce total energy consumption and thus lessen the vulnerability of the energy system to pressures arising from extreme events. Furthermore, the impacts of climate change must be taken into consideration in mitigation options, more specifically with regard to future hydro availability, heating and cooling requirements and rural fire risks. NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 168   Renewable energy projections thus take into account the falling availability of water to produce electricity, which is expectable in the RCP 4.5. climate scenario now considered as probable. It is estimated that hydro production will, on average, suffer a reduction of 9% by 2050 over figures for 2020, considering a hydraulicity index of 0.8. The greatest needs for cooling were also taken into account in energy demand scenarios, particularly in the residential and services sectors. In this regard, it is partcarbon sink - reduction in the average annual area consumed by fire - will be hindered in a scenario where the effects of climate change worsen. It is therefore, undeniable that the implementation of adaptation measures is one of the critical factors in decarbonisation objectives, both with regard to the reduction of emissions as well as sequestration capacity. Similarly, carbon neutrality is one of the guarantees of adaptation capacity, as achieving this aim will only be possible if the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere do not exceed a specific threshold, after which adaptation will no longer be possible and society as we know it will cease to exist. The synergies for mitigation and adaptation which can be seen in a range of measures are a further sign that integrated action is required between both these aspects in all components of society.   Role of the Circular Economy The role of the Circular Economy is vital, it is a basic and structural argument in transition and will provide the foundation for the decarbonisation of the Portuguese economy. It has thus been considered an integral part of the narrative in the socio-economic scenarios developed and was reflected in the assumptions for different sectors on which GHG modelling was based. The role of the Circular Economy has been subject to intense scrutiny within the value chain of a series of sectors considered as important for the success of the aims of this Plan and the aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Relevant impact from circularity is foreseen for these sectors  the mobility sector, the agri-food sector, forestry, construction and waste. The potential effects of circular strategies were assessed, for example, in energy consumption, the production of waste and in carbon retention, and modelling variables (sector based) of emissions impacted were identified. In the mobility sector, the transitions created in the circular economy point to less use of individual transport and growth in shared and multimodal mobility services (both in relation to public transport as well as private transport) and an increase in the car occupancy rate. New business models appear which replace the supply of goods (vehicles) with the provision of services and ownership through use. Moreover, the increased interconnectivity of supply chains (more on-line shopping, more reverse logistics) also increases the demand for the mobility of goods, also increasing the pressure on this sector. Similarly, it will be necessary to increase the load capacity of heavy and light goods vehicles, fleet autonomy and the technological replacement rate of such fleets so as to obtain improvements in the efficiency of vehicles (passenger, and heavy and light goods). This approach will allow more competitive business models, with lower operating costs and less GHG emissions. Such changes do not have much impact within the timeline of this plan, but effects start to be seen as of 2040. NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 169   In the agri-food sector, the implementation of regenerative and more efficient agricultural practices in the use of resources such as water and power, and new eating habits and lifestyles help reduce waste and the respective organic fraction (by reducing food waste), thus also allowing emissions to be reduced. The expansion of biological agriculture, conservation and precision agriculture, along with permanent pastures, will allow a reduction in emissions from the use of synthetic fertilizers and animal effluents. It will also increase carbon sequestration as a result of increases in the organic matter content of soils (the use of compost to replace synthetic nitrogen fertilizers is a circular measure). These circular strategies will lead to a reduction in GHG emissions in the agricultural sector of around 11% by 2030. Similarly, an increase in forestation, promotion of more efficient forestry practices in the use of resources and in risk management and improvement of ecosystem services will lead to a growing role for the bioeconomy impacting on carbon retention and the net balance of emissions. Productivity gains in the future may come from the use of best practices in forest management and less losses through fires. Forestry is a value chain which even today has a high degree of circularity, and forests play an undeniable role in decarbonisation. As such, it can be seen that investment in forestry to increase biological carbon sequestration could lead to gains of more than 40% by 2050 (when compared to a non-circular scenario). In construction, circular strategies to be followed include an increase in urban rehabilitation and the reuse of buildings, multi-function and shared buildings with the corresponding reduction in constructed area, along with the use of new, more sophisticated materials offering greater energy efficiency and durability, and renewable materials with a smaller carbon footprint (e.g. Wood and cork). These circular economy strategies could lead to a reduction in GHG emissions in the residential sector of around -4% by 2040. Circularity strategies for waste, which have always been closely linked to this sector, will allow a reduction in the amount of waste per capita and the respective organic fraction, particularly by reducing food waste and the use of plastics. An increase in the selective collection of bio-waste is also expected along with an increase in the selective collection of multi-material and the development of recycling chains. The depositing of urban waste in landfills is also expected to be minimised. It can thus be seen that the circular economy can lead to significant reductions in the GHG emissions associated with waste management (including the use of urban waste for generating power) of up to 69% by 2050.

Macroeconomic impacts and, as far as it is viable, on health, the environment, employment, education, social competences and impacts, including transitory aspects53  With respect to opportunities, it is undeniable that there will be a positive effect on GDP and employment. Even within an extremely conservative scenario, the macro-economic analysis conducted under NECP 2030 and RCN2050 points to a positive overall impact on GDP as a result of the almost total decarbonisation of the national energy system. This will lead to significant growth in investment and private consumption and a net gain, although marginal, in jobs. There will also be exceptional opportunities for new business models to appear and the creation of new clusters with the potential for net generation of employment, more specifically in the:  Production of renewable energies; storage and battery technologies; smart networks;  The electric vehicle value chain (including production, batteries, charging network; logistics and services connected to shared and autonomous mobility);  Value chain of the hydrogen economy and other renewable gases;  Urban rehabilitation and technologies associated with the improvement of thermal comfort in buildings;  Automation engineering;  Value chain in agricultural production, including new technologies and precision agriculture;  Research, innovation and development associated with all areas of decarbonisation and energy transition; This new vision will further drive the acquisition of new competences and lead to the need for requalification and training in the sectors and activities impacted most, particularly those connected to fossil fuels. It will therefore be necessary to programme a series of actions to create the conditions and skills necessary for fair transition.                                                              53 (With regard to the costs and benefits and cost-effectiveness ratio) of the planned policies and measures described in Section 3, at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including a comparison with projections based on existing policies and measures.  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 171   It should also be noted that estimates do not include quantified impacts with respect to the co-benefits obtained through the damage avoided, for example, in relation to health and biodiversity, or the respective costs of adapting to climate change.   Co-benefits of decarbonisation and energy transition for the quality of air and public health Many processes which emit GHG are also responsible for the emission of other atmospheric pollutants which cause environmental problems such as deterioration in the quality of air, acidification and eutrophication, resulting in damage to ecosystems and the subsequent loss of biodiversity and problems affecting human health, particularly respiratory and cardiovascular problems. Air pollution also has considerable economic impact, reducing average life expectancy, increasing medical costs and reducing productivity impacting on all areas of the economy. Air pollution is today identified as one of the greatest environmental risks to health. The World Health Organization has identified particulate matter (PM), Nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and atmospheric ozone (O3) as the most harmful air pollutants. Unlike other pollutants, ozone is not emitted directly, but is a pollutant which forms in the atmosphere in the presence of other pollutants, such as Nitrogen oxides. Particulate matter has numerous origins but comes mainly from the burning of fossil fuels and biomass and is the most harmful group of pollutants to health. The smaller these particulates are, the greater the probability is that they will penetrate deep into the respiratory system and a greater risk exists that they will induce negative effects on health. Smaller, inhalable particulates (PM10 and PM2.5) reach the lungs and finer PM2.5 particulates even enter the bloodstream. Sulphur oxides do not currently represent a serious problem to air quality due to numerous measures already taken, such as requirements to reduce the sulphur content in fossil fuels. Furthermore, Nitrogen oxides come mainly from road traffic, and in large cities, they are primarily responsible for poor air quality. The implementation of measures spatial planning and road traffic management may thus minimise the impacts of these pollutants. When climate change affects weather conditions, such as through the frequency of heat waves and long atmospheric stability, the periods in which ozone levels are high tend to be prolonged, and can contribute to an increase in the concentration of suspended particulates, leading to a deterioration in air quality and increased risk of diseases associated with air pollution. In 2018, Portugal saw an increase of 3.3% over thair quality. An analysis of the 2002 to 2018 period shows that there is a downward trend in the percentage of days  Despite the improvement seen in recent years, air quality problems persist in Portugal in some locations, mainly in densely populated urban areas where concentrations of a number of air pollutants frequently exceed limits, such as those for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and suspended particulates (PM10). There are also areas where values greater than those set for long-term ozone levels are frequently seen. NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 172   Estimates on the impact on human health attributable to ling-term exposure to air pollution54 indicate that concentrations of PM2.5 in 2016 were responsible for 412 000 premature deaths in Europe, of which 374 000 occurred in EU-28. In 2016, it was estimated that exposure to concentrations of NO2 and O3 among the European population caused around 71 000 and 15 100 premature deaths per year, respectively. Figures for the EU-28 were around 68 000 and 14 000, respectively. It is also estimated that there are around 6 000 premature deaths per year in Portugal due to exposure to air pollution caused by these three pollutants. Although GHG do not have a direct effect on human health or ecosystems, it is expected that the policies to reduce them will also contribute to a reduction in air pollutants as such pollutants have the same origins. Decarbonisation strategies will impact on economic activities and consequently on the generating of air pollutant emissions. It is therefore expectable that the planned energy transition and the goal for carbon neutrality will provide co-benefits to improve air quality, with positive effects on human health, particularly with regard to respiratory diseases. This effect will be especially relevant in cities due to the transformation planned for mobility, with the reinforcing of public transport and intermodality, the decarbonisation of fleets through zero or low-emission technologies and the increase in active and shared mobility. Positive impacts can also be expected in relation to ecosystems, where air pollution harms the growth of vegetation and causes damage to agriculture and biodiversity as it affects both water and soil quality and consequently, fauna and flora. In contrast, a trade-off for air quality, is an increase in the consumption of biomass to produce electricity and in industrial processes, with a possible impact resulting from an increase in emissions from non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and fine particulates (PM2.5), a situation which requires monitoring. With respect to work under RCN2050, estimates were also drawn up of other air pollutant emissions. Of note is that the current National Strategy for the Air (ENAR 2014-2020) is aligned with PNAC and was developed in parallel and based on the same energy demand scenarios and with a number of common measures with regard to sector initiatives for atmospheric emissions. It was seen that the trajectory for carbon neutrality associated with the GHG projections presented earlier, also represents potential for reducing emissions of other air pollutants by 2030 (over figures for 2005) of around:  68% for NOx;  27% for NMVOCs;  85% for SOx;  17% for NH3;  37% for PM2.5.  Despite the significant reductions planned for 2030 under RCN2050, mainly in the emissions of air pollutants such as SOx and NOx, it can be seen that such reductions will be insufficient to comply with PM2.5 and NMVOC emissions ceilings as of 2030. Additional measures must be developed in the coming decade.                                                              54   Report by the European Environment Agency, October 2019, available at: https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/air-quality-in-europe-2019  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 173   In 2030, PM2.5 particulates will be essentially emitted by industry, although a significant contribution will also come from the buildings sector due to the use of biomass for heating (even when contemplating an additional reduction of PM2.5 emissions resulting from the implementation of the Ecodesign Directive). NMVOC will also be essentially emitted by industry, even when an additional reduction of emissions is considered due to the implementation of control strategies, such as measures with mitigation potential in the industrial use of solvents. It should be noted that although the planned reduction of NH3 emissions indicates compliance with emissions ceilings, the margin of uncertainty of emissions estimates for the post 2030 period does not ensure compliance where the agricultural sector is the dominant source of NH3, contributing to the formation and secondary particulates. As such. industry, transport, agriculture and the residential and services sectors will be the most relevant for action in the reduction of emissions of other air pollutants. It will therefore be necessary to develop additional measures for industry, also taking into account possible additional measures for agriculture, in light of the small margin seen in relation to the 2030 ceiling (in the case of NH3). These additional measures will be prepared under the National Air Pollution Control Programme (PNCPA), to be submitted to the European Commission, by September 2020. It will also be vital to ensure coordination of climate and air policies, also under this NECP, maximising synergies and aligning measures which both address this matter.   5.3. Overview of investment needs  i. Existing investment flows and forward investment assumptions with regard to the planned policies and measures  Decarbonisation and energy transition represent a unique opportunity for the country to consolidate an inclusive and sustainable development model focused on people and based on innovation, knowledge and competitiveness, while also contributing to improve the health and well-being of people and ecosystems. This vision naturally forms part of this integrated energy and climate plan and must be also reflected in the different sector plans and policy instruments in the specific areas of transport, industry, commerce, services, waste, agriculture and forestry. Although a greater need for investment is seen for the coming decade in the reduction of GHG emissions and energy transition, this investment will have broad impact and returns in all sectors of activity and the co-benefits will be seen across society. The Portuguese transition strategy for a carbon neutral economy is based, in the medium-term, on a combination of the different policy options and measures identified above, as well as on modelled cost-effective technological options, seeking synergies between the different alternatives. Projections showed that it is possible to achieve the planned decarbonisation and energy transition with current technologies. The development of new technologies in the future will allow targets to be reached more quickly and effectively than estimated today. Decarbonisation and energy transition will thus stimulate a deeper and quicker transformation of society, more focused on technologies which emit less with consequences in multiple aspects of the economy, the day-to-day life of citizens and social organisation. In the final analysis, investment in carbon neutrality and energy transition  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 174   is only a small fraction of the overall investment which the Portuguese economy will have to make over time in order to remain competitive. According to the results of RCN2050, the total amount of investment in the energy sector up to 2030 will be between 407 to 431 billion euros, of which 396 to 417 billion euros will be undertaken anyway as a result of the normal dynamics of the modernisation of the economy, driven by the policies underway to ensure the functioning of the energy system, representing an annual value of around 29 billion euros. Total investment up to 2030 thus includes additional investment to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 of around 11 to 15 billion euros for the coming decade, in other words, around 1 billion euros per year. In addition to the reduction in emissions which, in the energy system, rises from 70% to 90%, this investment will also lead to substantial gains in energy efficiency and in a reduction in energy dependency, which will have considerable implications (positive) in the reduct However, it can be seen that the breakdown of total investment into normal investment and additional investment for neutrality, will change over the different decades, with the difference for neutrality gaining greater expression up to 2050 (representing around 3% of all investment in the 2016-2030 period and 13% in 2031-2040). This investment will also be, depending on the type of investment, shared with investment by families (e.g. More efficient home appliances, electric cars, insulation in housing, etc.), by companies (for example, in renewable energies, hydrogen driven trucks, electric furnaces and boilers, etc.) and by the State (e.g. electric public transport, decarbonisation of public buildings and public vehicles, etc.). The private sector and households will be responsible for the vast majority of this investment. The State will play a vital role in defining and adapting the regulatory and taxation systems and offer incentives which provide clear long-term signs so as to facilitate and direct the investment required for transition and avoid obsolete equipment and the maintaining of subsidies which are considered harmful for the environment. Table 42- Estimated overall and additional volume of investment for energy sector neutrality in the 2016-2040 period  2016-2030 2031-2040 Overall Total 406.6 | 431.3 263.4 | 273 Overall investment without neutrality 395.9 | 416.6 229.7 | 235.1 Electricity 22.4 | 22.1 16.6 | 19.6 Transport 193.7 | 201.3 74.5 | 62.3 Buildings 165 | 176.4 124 | 138.3 Industry 14 | 16 14.4 | 14.7 Other 0.7 | 0.8 0.2 | 0.1 Additional to achieve neutrality 10.8 | 14.7 33.7 | 37.9 Electricity 1.2 | 2.2 9 | 11.3 Transport 5.1 | 6.2 17.3 | 17.6 Buildings 3.1 | 4.8 5.6 | 6.1 Industry 1 | 1.3 1.2 | 0.9 Overall Total 406.6 | 431.3 263.4 | 273 NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 175   In the electrical power production sector, the gradual reduction in the use of fossil fuels and the increase in demand caused by the growing electrification of the economy have led to the need to make significant investment in renewable capacity (also taking into account that existing capacity will also be reaching the end of working life and require replacement). It is thus expected that more than half the investment required in this sector will be in the installation of solar capacity. The first stage will be more focused on centralised solar power plants and the second stage will involve decentralised production (e.g. the rooftops of residential and services buildings) of photovoltaic power and energy communities. Also of note are significant investments in wind farms, which will firstly focus on onshore installations, also via repowering and new equipment, and then on offshore systems. The mobility and transport sector will be an area which will see greater technological replacement and as a consequence will require most investment, particularly to replace both goods as well as passenger vehicles. This high level of investment will be required to comply with requirements both to reduce emissions, focusing on new energy sources such as electricity and hydrogen, as well as in relation to the short working life of the equipment itself. In the residential and services buildings sector, most investment relates to the renewal and replacement of electrical and electronic equipment for more efficient models. Although this is low-cost equipment it has significant impact in terms of quantities on a national level. Also important will be investment in building insulation, which will allow an increase in thermal comfort through a reduction in heating needs in the winter and cooling in the summer, thus reducing energy poverty. Investment in industry will relate to energy transition, with the focus being on energy efficiency, renewable gases and electrification. In addition to the investment identified as necessary in the energy system, other investment to consider is that required in agriculture and forestry and waste and wastewater. However, such investment is more difficult to calculate given the wide variety of factors to take into account, such as the sums required to combat rural fires, mitigation measures such as improvement in animal foodstuff digestibility, or even the implementation of circular economy measures and the reduction of organic loads. The development of new technologies and the improvement of existing low-carbon technologies also requires significant effort investment in innovation and research which will be achieved by adopting an ambitious and wide-ranging agenda which takes into consideration all phases of the technological development cycle until sale.   ii. Sector or market risk factors or barriers in the national or regional context  N/A   iii. Analysis of additional public finance support or resources to fill identified gaps identified under point ii  Among its action lines for a carbon neutral society, the Roadmap to Carbon Neutrality 2050 identifies the need ourable framework for sustainable financing and greater involvement of the financial system, as well as the respective  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 176   Transiting to a carbon neutral society with a circular economy means promoting investment in the different sectors of activity, ensuring social justice in how such investment is financed. Investment in these areas will drive the economy and promote the creation of new jobs. Although all sectors will contribute to the decarbonisation of the economy, in the coming decade it will be transport and the production and consumption of energy from renewable sources which will see the greatest change. Naturally, these areas will also see the greatest investment. Also of note will be buildings due to urban rehabilitation and the incorporation of energy efficiency measures. Internationally, the investment necessary to comply with the Paris Agreement will come from different sources. The European Commission recognises that the vast majority of investment will be made by the private sector and families. ECOFIN also recognised the importance of ensuring that financial flows are consistent with low-carbon development, emphasising the importance of the private financial sector, as sufficient public funds do not exist for investment requirements. It is for this reason that an international drive is being seen to reorient financial flows to energy transition and to a carbon neutral economy. Different types of financing will appear in the future, some of which can already be identified. Particularly of note is the Action Plan to Finance Sustainable Growth, proposed by the European Commission and which seeks to reorient capital flows to sustainable investment, manage the financial risks arising from climate change and promote transparency and long-term vision in financial and economic activities. European commitment to environmental sustainability. On a European level, the Multi-annual Financial Framework 2021-2027, which is still under discussion, will be one of the main sources of financing for the decarbonisation of the economy. This is because it establishes a commitment (still under negotiation) to allocate 25% of total budget spending to climate action. As such, the preparation of the financing framework for the 2021-2027 period will reflect the guidelines set out on a European level and form one of the main sources of financing for this plan. As a precursor, of note nationally is the National Investment Plan (NIP) 2030 which defines the decarbonisation of the economy as one of the structural areas, and contemplates more than 60% of the investment in areas which contribute to these aims. Fiscal policy will also play an important role in the upcoming transition. Fiscal and pricing policy must be designed so that it reflects real costs, addresses the main social and environmental costs, internalising the externalities, and influencing behavioural change as a determining factor in fair and sustainable competition. It will also play a vital role in the allocating of public funding. Fiscal policy must be aligned with the aims of energy transition and the decarbonisation of the economy, introducing the right signs into the economy while also allowing public income to be generated which can then be applied to decarbonisation measures and ensuring fair transition. As such, a green taxation policy must be pursued which has a triple dividend as its aim. The principle must be that income generated by climate policies be channelled to ensuring the financing of the transition to a carbon neutral economy. It should be noted that the decarbonisation of the economy will lead to significant income being generated by climate policy, with emphasis on income from EU ETS licences which is allocated to the Environmental Fund.   NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 177   This will allow income to be recycled, for example, to the financing of the Support Programme for the Reduction of Public Transport Tariffs (PART) and the reduction of the tariff deficit through transfers to the National Electricity System. In this regard, the Environmental Fund will play a key role as the main instrument of the Portuguese State to finance climate action, for adaptation and mitigation, including energy transition. The financial sector must also incorporate incentives in its investment policies and financial products which are suitable for the objectives of this plan, so that the private sector is able to access the necessary financing to make investments and acquisitions for and in an increasingly decarbonised society. Portugal is committed to redirecting financial flows to promote decarbonisation and energy transition, fostering the development if a favourable framework for sustainable financing and greater involvement of the financial system in these areas in the coming decade. To achieve this aim, a significant contribution will come from the Sustainable Financing Analysis Group, formed in 2019, coordinated by the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Action in partnership with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Economy and Digital Transition. This group also includes the main public and private actors from the financial sector in and is supported by the Bank of Portugal. This group identified the key areas and a series of recommendations55 sector can assist in the process to accelerate this transition. The active participation and consensus reached n of specific commitments for financing which promotes the decarbonisation of the economy and sustainable development. In addition to continuing to accompany and participate in future work arising from the Analysis Group, the signatory financial institutions and Euronext Lisbon also made the following commitments:  To promote debate among their Boards of Directors on sustainability and on the associated environmental, social and governance risks and opportunities with a view to defining their respective strategies in relation to such risks and opportunities;  To promote training in sustainable financing for their staff at different levels (including the Board of Directors), focusing on the analysis of credit risk, financial products and the marketing and production of such products;  To monitor the review of SME Leader and SME Excellence programme criteria so as to gradually incorporate sustainability into such criteria and accept the possibility of creating PME Green or PME Sustainable categories;  To promote the gradual integration of environmental, social and governance criteria into financing and investment analyses. Other equally important commitments were also made which will greatly contribute to the success of Sustainable Financing in Portugal. These commitments were made by the Bank of Portugal, the Securities Markets Commission, the Insurance and Pensions Fund Supervisory Authority, the Portuguese Association of Banks, the Portuguese Insurers Association, the Association of Publicly Quoted Companies in Portugal, the Portuguese Investment, Pension and Property Funds Association and by the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Action, the Ministry of the Economy and Digital Transition and the Ministry of Finance. Finally, so that potential investment and, consequently growth is achieved, it is vital that public policy gives clear and long-term signs to investors.                                                              55 Guidelines to accelerate sustainable financing in Portugal, July 2019, available at https://www.fundoambiental.pt/ficheiros/b1-linhas_orientacao_financiamento_sustentavel_ptvf-pdf.aspx  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 178   The Roadmap to Carbon Neutrality 2050 and this Plan set out a vision, the objectives and targets and the main lines of action which will determine the evolution of the national economy in the medium and long-term. For the objectives in this plan to be achieved and for the economy to be set on a path to carbon neutrality, the following guidelines have been established:  Maximise the new Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 to guide the next financing cycle towards the decarbonisation of society and energy transition, avoiding the financing of investments which are not in line with this objective; Align national public funds with the aims set out in this plan, integrating criteria relating to these aims in the different lines of funding; Guide Direct Foreign Investment to the economy of the future, aligned with the aims of decarbonisation and energy transition; Make taxation an instrument for transition to a carbon neutral society; Align the financial system with the aims of decarbonisation, in line with work underway on a national and European level to integrate sustainable financing into the activity of financial institutions.The Programme of the XXII Constitutional Government identifies as a challenge the mobilisation of economic incentives for decarbonisation through the implementation of green taxation and the promoting of sustainable financing. Of note among the measures identified are the drawing up of a national strategy for sustainable financing and the development of a Green Bank through the Financial Institution for Development (Instituição Financeira de Desenvolvimento, S.A) with the aims of providing financial capacity and accelerating existing sources of financing specialising in investment projects for carbon neutrality and the circular economy, and the promotion of (Green Bonds).   EUROPEAN FUNDING The negotiations underway for the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 reinforce the need for a long-term budget for the EU 27 to be established, which will allow the priority goals undertaken to be achieved and for technological, demographic and climate change challenges to be met. To increase the level of ambition with respect to financing the fight against climate change, the Commission proposed that at least 25% of the EU budget would be used to achieve climate action objectives. This would mean allocating 320 billion euros in the 2021 to 2027 period. In this regard, of note are several instruments, some of which are still under negotiation, which focus on the centrality of climate policy and energy transition. LIFE Programme - Programme for the Environment and Climate Action This programme focuses on the development and execution of innovative forms of meeting environmental and climate challenges, such as the transition to clean energy. The Commission proposed that 5.4 billion euros be allocated in the next European budget. The Commission increased the financing for the LIFE Programme, which saw the largest proportional increase among EU funding programmes for the 2021-2027 period. In addition to its direct action, the LIFE Programme will also function as a catalyst for other funds. Financing will be intended mainly for environmental protection and attenuating climate change. It will support the transition to clean energies with a view to increasing energy efficiency and the share of renewable energies NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 179   in the range of energy sources. This is one of the instruments which will allow the EU to achieve its climate goals and aims to climate neutrality by 2050. The main characteristics of the new LIFE (2021-2027) programme are as follows:  Continuous support for the transition to a circular economy and for attenuating climate change: the programme mainly involves the financing required to achieve the main policy objectives as set out in the EU long-term strategic vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate neutral economy by 2050. The planned measures will continue to support the full transition to a circular economy, the protection and improvement of air and water quality in the EU, the application of the EU action framework with respect to the climate and energy for 2030 and compliance with the commitments made by the Union under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change; Greater attention for support in the transition to clean energy: a new specific sub-programme will stimulate investment and support activities relating to energy efficiency and renewable energies, particularly in European regions and sectors which have fallen behind in terms of the transition to clean energy; Greater attention for the protection of nature and biodiversity: traditional elements of the LIFE Programme, the new strategic projects to protect nature are specialised and are intended for all Member States. They will contribute to the strategic objectives with respect to the protection of nature and biodiversity in other areas of action and funding programmes, such as agriculture and rural development, ensuring a more coherent approach in all sectors; A simple and flexible strategy, focused on the development and implementation of innovative forms of meeting environmental and climate challenges.Cohesion Policy With a total indicative budget of 273 billion euros, this policy supports sustainable development through investment in adaptation to climate change and risk prevention, as well as environmental and infrastructure protection measures. The sustainable development objectives are set out in the regulations which govern the funds and which must be promoted at all stages of preparation and implementation. Of note in this regard are the Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Policy requiring Member States to invest 30% to 50% of their part of the Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in innovation related projects, and at least 30% in projects which combat climate change and contribute to the circular economy. 6% to 10% of national ERDF is also required to be allocated to sustainable urban development. The Cohesion Fund will continue to focus on investment in environmental and transport infrastructure. InvestEU This is a new European Union instrument providing guarantees with the aim of mobilising public and private financing for strategic investment under table policy framework. It includes compliance with requirements for investment sustainability and aid in orienting capital flows towards sustainable investment. The InvestEU programme will cover the period from 2021 to 2027 and will bring a wide variety of EU financial instruments which are currently available under a single umbrella, thus expanding the model of the Juncker Plan. The InvestEU Fund will mobilise public and private investment through a guarantee from the EU budget of 38 billion euros which will support the investment projects of financial partners such as the group of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and others, reinforcing their risk absorption capacity.  Financial partners must contribute a minimum of 9.5 billion euros of risk absorption capacity. It is hoped that, in conjunction with the banking sector, that it will be possible to leverage at least 650 billion euros of investment. The guarantee is required to have a provision equivalent to 40%, meaning that a reserve of 15.2 billion euros from the EU budget  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 180   is created in the event of it being necessary to activate the guarantee. This budget guarantee will be divided among the different areas of intervention as follows:  Sustainable infrastructure, with 11.5 billion euros; Research, innovation and digitalisation, with 11.25 billion euros; Small and medium enterprises, with 11.25 billion euros; Social and skills investment, with 4 billion euros.certain conditions, regional and national development banks and other Member State institutions able to provide specific knowledge and experience may become financial partners. The decision to broaden the possibility of benefiting from the EU guarantee to other institutions is due to the fact that other experienced potential financial partners exist in the EU which have specific sector or financial competences, excellent knowledge of the local market or greater capacity for sharing risks with the EU in certain sectors. This approach will increase and diversify the project reserve and increase the potential number of final beneficiaries. Connecting Europe Facility Mechanism (CEF) (CEF, currently defined in Regulations (EU) 1316/2013 and (EU) 283/2014) for the 2021-2027 period, which will allow the funding of infrastructure projects in the energy, transport and digital sectors. In the energy sector, this funding facility is directly related to European Union Projects of Common Interest (PCIs), under Regulation (EU)347/2013 on trans-European energy infrastructure (Regulation TEN-E). This review of the CEF facility also sets out a new area for the energy sector relating to cross-border renewable energy projects. Of note in the transport sector is the setting up of pre-defined railway corridors and stretches. Cross-   The total planned budget for the new CEF facility for the 2021-2027 horizon is around 43 billion euros broken down among the respective sectors: 31 billion euros in the transport sector; 9 billion euros in the energy sector; and 3 billion euros in the digital sector. It is expected that the new regulation defining the new CEF facility will be concluded in 2019. The current CEF facility is defined for the 2014-2020 horizon. Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to covering to climate action. According to the sustainable agriculture. The aims are to promote the resilience of the sector and support the income and viability of farmers. It is required to ensure that agriculture fully plays its role in the environment and with respect to climate change and that it fully integrates the digital innovations which facilitate the work of farmers, reduce bureaucracy and support generational renovation. More than 50% of the EU population live in rural zones and efforts are therefore required to maintain these rural areas attractive as vital places to live in terms of growth and employment, but also in terms of infrastructure, mobility and basic services. By contributing to the economic dynamics of rural zones and to respective socio-cultural life, EU agriculture plays an important role. The same situation applies to the new CAP, which seeks to maintain substantial agriculture throughout Europe, investing in the development of rural areas and communities.  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 181   The future CAP will focus on nine general aims which reflect the economic, environmental and social importance of this policy:  Support income and the resilience of viable farms throughout the EU in order to reinforce food security; Reinforce market orientation and increase competitiveness, with greater emphasis on research, technology and digitalisation; Improve the position of farmers in the value chain; Contribute to adaptation to climate change, to the mitigation of its effects, and to sustainable energy. Promote sustainable development and the efficient management of natural resources such as water, land and air; Contribute to the protection of biodiversity, improve services connected to ecosystems and preserve habitats and landscapes; Attract young farmers and facilitate the development of companies in rural areas; Promote employment, growth, social inclusion and local development in rural areas, more specifically, the bio-economy and sustainable forestry; Improve the response by European agriculture to the demands of society with respect to food products and health, including the supply of safe, nutritive and sustainable foodstuff products, while also improving animal welfare.Foster knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural development as a transversal objective. Horizon Europe With an indicative budget of 97.6 billion euros, this programme specialises in research and innovation and is a driver of economic growth and employment. Its aim is to support policies for transition to a low-carbon economy, environmental protection and climate action. Horizon Europe is proposed as the most ambitious funding programme ever for research and innovation with the goal of driving scientific excellence in Europe, enhancing the scientific, economic and society impact of EU funding. Its main lines of action are: Reinforce science and technology in the EU due to the increase in investment in highly qualified people and innovative research; Promote the industrial competitiveness of the EU and its performance in innovation, more specifically by supporting the creation of innovation through the European Innovation Council and the European Institute  Paris Agreement on climate change, and tackle the challenges which affect the quality of life of Europeans. The fund is built on three pillars, and of note in this regard is Pillar 2 - Global Challenges and Industrial Competitiveness (52.7 billion euros) which directly supports research into social challenges, reinforces technological and industrial capacities and EU level missions with the ambitious objective to tackle a number of d Industry, the Climate, Energy and Mobility and Food and Natural Resources. Innovation Fund (NER 450) The Innovation Fund is one of the largest funding programmes for demonstrating projects for innovative low-carbon technologies and focuses on:  Innovative low-carbon technologies and processes in carbon intensive industries, including the substitution of carbon intensive products; Carbon capture and use (CCU); Construction and maintenance of carbon capture and storage; Production of innovative renewable electricity;NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 182    Energy Storage. Income for this fund comes from the auctioning of ETS licences. For this purpose, 450 million licences have been allocated for between 2020 and 2030. The money not used by the NER 300 programme will also be allocated to this fund. It is estimated that the Innovation Fund could stand at 10 billion euros, depending on the price of carbon. In addition to the fund, EU ETS also constitutes the largest long-term incentive for the application of innovative and low-carbon technologies. The Innovation Fund is a key element to achieving the aim of a carbon neutral Europe by 2050 and for complying with the Paris Agreement. Innovation Fund The Innovation Fund is one of the largest funding programmes internationally for demonstrating projects for innovative low-carbon technologies. This fund focuses on: innovative, low-carbon technologies and processes in intensive energy industries, including products which substitute carbon-intensive products; carbon capture and use (CCU); carbon capture and storage (CCS); innovative generation of renewable energy; energy storage. The budget for this fund could reach approximately 10 billion euros, depending on the price of carbon. InnovFin Energy Demo Projects This funding mechanism consists of loans, loan guarantees or property type funding, normally between 7.5 to 75 million euros for innovative projects to transform energy systems, including: renewable energy technologies, smart energy systems, energy storage, carbon capture and storage and carbon capture and use. This funding mechanism is complemented by the European Investment Bank. Just Transition Fund The Just Transition Fund is a new fund to support the transition of regions most affected by the need to abandon an economic model built on fossil fuels to a carbon-neutral scenario, and is intended for regions which are carbon intensive. The Just Transition Fund will be one of the initiatives to be presented under the European Green Deal as a result of the work of the new Commission. Although the eligibility criteria and type of project to be supported are still under discussion, it is hoped that some regions of Portugal will be able to benefit. European Investment Bank The European Investment Bank (EIB) is the largest multilateral financial institution in the world, and is one of the entities with greatest weighting in climate financing. The EIB is the bank in the European Union which focuses on granting loans and strives to finance projects which contribute to achieving the aims of the European Union. which explicitly seeks the end to the financing of fossil fuel infrastructure as of 2021. The EIB is also the largest shareholder in the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), which funds investment in small and medium enterprises. EFSI is one of the three pillars of the Investment Plan for Europe and its aim is to overcome current market shortcomings, addressing these failings and mobilising private investment. Assist in the funding of strategic investment in key areas such as infrastructure, research and innovation, education, renewable energy and energy efficiency, and also to provide risk financing for small and medium enterprises (SME).   NATIONAL PUBLIC FINANCING NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 183   With respect to public financing, national funds currently exist which support the decarbonisation of the economy and energy transition and provide a number of funding possibilities which are available to both the public and private sectors. The application of this plan will require the strengthening of action by the funds identified with emphasis on the objectives established, together with close coordination between the different sources of funding. The application of European funds will also be equally important. Environmental Fund (EF) The aim of the EF is to support environmental policies to achieve sustainable development objectives, thus contributing to compliance with national and international objectives and commitments, more specifically those relating to climate change, water resources, waste and the preservation of nature and biodiversity. This instrument provides grants for projects which contribute to public environmental policies through applications which are submitted further to notices. Beneficiaries of this fund include: companies, NGOs, public entities, municipalities or foundations. Each notice identifies the respective beneficiaries. The EF has played an important role in supporting projects for the decarbonisation of the economy, with special not for the fact that its main source of income comes from the auctioning of EU ETS licences. Innovation, Technology and Circular Economy Fund (ITCEF) This fund was created through Decree-Law No 86-C/2016 of 29 December 2016 and its purpose is to support policies which enhance scientific and technological knowledge, transforming such knowledge into innovation, while also stimulating cooperation among higher education institutions, technological interface centres (TCI) and companies. It also seeks to promote the more efficient use of resources through material and energy efficiency. Energy Efficiency Fund (EEF) The Energy Efficiency Fund (EEF) was created through Decree-Law No 50/2010 and its purpose is to fund the programmes and measures provided for in the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency (PNAEE), as set out in the annex to Council of Ministers Resolution No 80/2008 of 20 May 2008. This is achieved through the following lines of action: a) Support for projects which are predominantly technological in nature in the transport, residential and services, industry and public sectors; b) Support for actions which are transversal in nature and engender energy efficiency in behaviour, taxation and incentives and financing. Fund for the Systemic Sustainability of the Energy Sector (FSSES) The Fund for the Systemic Sustainability of the Energy Sector, created by Decree Law No 55/2014 of 9 April 2014 seeks to promote balance and systemic sustainability between the energy sector and national energy policy by funding energy sector policies which are social and environmental in nature and are related to measures for energy efficiency and reducing the national electricity system tariff debt. Innovation Support fund (ISF)  The aims of ISF are to support innovation, technological development and investment in renewable energies and energy efficiency in order to achieve the targets set out in PNAER, PNAEE and the National Energy Strategy. ISF can support projects through reimbursable and non-reimbursable subsidies, and any public or private entities may submit applications to ISF. Fundo Azul The aim of the Blue Fund, created through Decree-Law No 16/2016 of 9 March 2016, is to develop the maritime economy, scientific and technological research, the protection and monitoring of the marine environment and NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 184   maritime security. This is achieved by creating or reinforcing funding mechanisms for entities, activities or projects which meet the needs set out in the abovementioned Decree-Law. National Fund for Building Rehabilitation (NFBR) The Building Rehabilitation (NFBR) is a special property investment fund, which is a privately subscribed closed fund to develop rehabilitation projects aimed mainly at the permanent housing rental market, thus providing housing under favourable conditions. The main aim of NFBR is to develop and implement property rehabilitation projects for housing rental with a view to urban regeneration and bringing people back to urban centres. The goal is to achieve growth in the investment over the medium and long-term. The Social Security Fund for Financial Stabilisation (SSFFS) may contribute funds and NFBR may also use other forms of financing. Other funding mechanisms  The Energy Efficiency Credit Line, an agreement between the investment body SPGM, and the Mutual Guarantee Societies, Agrogarante, Garval, Lisgarante and Norgarante and the main national credit institutions, has 100 million euros to enable industrial and tourism companies more modern and competitive by implementing measures which reduce energy consumption and the change from fossil fuel energy to renewable energy. This approach contributes to the national targets set out in the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency (PNAEE) and in the National Action Plan for Renewable Energies (PNAER). The beneficiaries are micro and small and medium enterprises, certified by an electronic declaration issues by IAPMEI, located in national territory, whose main activity features on the agreed list of Economic Activity Codes (CAE) as set out in Annex I of the Dissemination Document, which do not have uncorrected incidents at banks and are up to date with bank responsibilities, taxation and social security payments at the time of funding. The Efficient House Programme (Casa Eficiente 2020) grants loans under favourable conditions to operations which promote the improvement of the environmental performance of private housing, with special focus on energy and water efficiency and on the management of urban waste. Owners of residential buildings or parts thereof and the respective condominiums may submit applications. Buildings may be located anywhere in national territory. Operations may involve private or common areas. The programme is run by the Portuguese State and promoted by CPCI  Portuguese Construction and Property Confederation. Technical support is provided by APA - Portuguese Environmental Agency, EPAL  Portuguese Water Company and ADENE  Energy Agency. The programme is co-funded by the European Investment Bank and by participating commercial banks which act as financial intermediaries between EIB and beneficiaries. For the 2018 to 2021 period, total funding under the programme stands banks. The aims of the Financial Instrument for Urban Rehabilitation and Revitalisation 2020 (IFRRU 2020) are to revitalise cities, support the rehabilitation of areas dedicated to disadvantaged communities and support energy efficiency in housing. The Renovate to Rent and Renovate to Rent  accessible housing programmes provide funding for rehabilitation operations in buildings which are 30 or more years old. After such rehabilitation, such buildings are required to be predominantly for housing purposes, and ithe dwellings are intended for rent under the conditional rental regime.NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 185    The purpose of the Plan to Promote Efficiency in the Consumption of Energy (PPEC) is to promote measures to improve efficiency in the consumption of electrical energy though actions undertaken by different sector agents (from suppliers to consumers).  FINANCING THROUGH THE PRIVATE FINANCIAL SECTOR  International dynamics with respect to sustainable financing has led to the development of new financial products. It is thus expected that some of these products will also be developed in Portugal by the Portuguese financial sector. A number of European financial institutions have placed financial products on the market which stimulate access to financing which has a positive environmental impact, these include green bonds, green loans, sustainable investment funds and impact funds.  Green Bonds - Green Bonds are any type of bond instrument where the value of the debt taken on will be exclusively used to finance or refinance, wholly or partly, new and/or eligible green projects. The definition of project eligibility is normally governed by the Green Bond Principles issued by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA). The European Commission (as of May 2019) is working on the definition of a European standard for green bonds. This is a market which is undergoing growth and in 2018 the total value of green bonds issued internationally reached 167.3 billion dollars. The countries responsible for the issue of 47% of such green bonds were the USA, China and France. On an international level, there are numerous banks providing corporate clients with this method of raising capital. It is therefore expected that the use of green bonds will increase significantly as investors have reacted positively to companies and countries which present such options for capturing investment. In Portugal, at least two corporate groups have already issued green bonds as a way of financing green projects and technologies. Green Loans: Green loans refer to any type of loan instrument provided exclusively to finance or re-finance, in whole or in part, new projects, and/or existing eligible green projects. They consist of allocating a loan to an entity where the environmental goals defined and agreed between the financing institution and the borrower. For a loan to be considered green, several procedures are referred to in the Green Loans Principles produced by the Loan Market Association. This option is currently available in a number of international banks which provide companies with the possibility of taking out a green loan that is for the general operation of the company (and not for a technology or specific project as is the case with Green Bonds) and which may benefit from a lower interest rate, if the company, as a whole, achieves certain specifically defined objectives. Sustainable investment funds: Sustainable investment funds are those which have environmental, social and governance criteria in the selection of their assets. In other words, they are funds which seek to acquire company shares and/or bonds which have demonstrated sustainability practices. These funds are experiencing significant growth, and 53% of European funds have some type of environmental, social and governance criteria in the structuring of their portfolio. On an international level, only 26% of funds incorporate any type of sustainability criteria, demonstrating the pioneering nature of the European capitals market.Impact Funds: Impact Funds are investments made in companies, organisations and funds with the intention of generating measurable environmental and social impact together with a financial return. Impact Funds are associated with philanthropic investors and foundations seeking to invest in projects which bring about a positive environmental and social impact, and which also generate some type of financial return. This type of fund is also experiencing growth, and internationally, around 228 billion dollars are currently invested with an impact approach. NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 5. Impact Assessment of Planned Policies and Measures 186    Blended Finance: Another funding concept which has appeared is called Blended Finance. It arose with the aim of catalysing the mobilisation of additional capital for investment related to sustainable development. Blended Finance uses a combination of public and private financing (or philanthropic) to -return profile, in other words, its commercial viability for a private investor.The investment dynamics associated with the decarbonisation of the economy and energy transition also constitute an opportunity for innovation in the financial sector through the creation of new products and services for this new green economy. Moreover, the financial sector must analyse the continuation of stranded assets. These approaches contribute to reducing the risks associated with investment and help capture new clients.   5.4. Impacts of planned policies and measures in other Member States and on regional cooperation  i. Impacts on the energy system in neighbouring and other MS in the region (*)  With respect to energy systems, the objectives and targets defined and the respective policies are expected to result in greater systems integration and improved levels of connection, leading to higher resilience for both the national and Spanish energy systems (as a neighbouring Member State). The impact for other MS will be conditioned by the level of EU internal market integration. For increasingly improved levels of integration, already identified obstacles and constraints will have to be overcome.   ii. Impacts on energy prices, public services and the integration of the energy market  From a regional perspective, it is considered that the objectives and targets and policies and measures planned (set out in Chapters 2 and 3, respectively) for both the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL) as well as the Iberian Natural Gas Market (MIBGÁS) will bring greater maturity and liquidity with positive impacts, for example on energy prices.  It should also be noted that growing technological maturity, with a consequent reduction in investment costs in facilities, as well as the implementation of measures regarding taxation, tariffs and systems costs could impact on the functioning of markets with a knock-on effect on energy sale prices.   iii. If relevant, impacts on regional cogeneration  Not available at this stage.
