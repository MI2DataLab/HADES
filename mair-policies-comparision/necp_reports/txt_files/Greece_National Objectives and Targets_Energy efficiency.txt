67 2.4 Improvement in energy efficiency 2.4.1 Objectives As regards the energy efficiency dimension, the objective is to improve energy efficiency in final energy consumption by at least 38% in relation to the foreseen evolution of final energy consumption by 2030, as estimated in 2007 in the context of the EU energy policies, thus resulting in final energy consumption levels of not more than 16.5 Mtoe in 2030. There is also satisfactory performance in terms of the relevant evaluation indicators regarding the rate of reduction both with regard to final energy consumption for 2017 (16.8 Mtoe) and the energy savings target for 2020 (18.4 Mtoe), taking into account the increase in final energy consumption in order to reverse the impact of the economic recession of the previous years. This rate of reduction is even higher if adjusted to primary energy consumption, in which case it stands at more than 43%. This demonstrates that the overall objective is to achieve an improvement in energy efficiency across the energy system, attaining a particularly high level of improvement in terms of how energy is made available for consumption, always in the most cost-effective way. An additional objective is set in respect of the cumulative amount of energy savings to be attained over the period 2021-2030 in accordance with Article 7 of Directive 2012/27/EU on energy savings obligations. According to the available final energy consumption figures, cumulative energy savings of at least 7.3 Mtoe should be achieved over the period 2021-2030. However, the objective will be re-calculated on the basis of the final energy consumption figures for the years 2016-2018. In addition to that, an objective is set for the annual energy renovation of a total floor area of the thermal zone of central public administration buildings equal to 5 400 square meters, representing 3% of the total floor area, as shown in Table 13.

To that end, it is necessary to establish a central quantitative objective for the renovation and replacement of residential buildings with new nearly zero-energy buildings, which could in aggregate amount to 12-15% of all residential buildings by 2030. The annual objective is to have an average of 60 000 buildings or building units upgraded in terms of energy and/or replaced with new more energy-efficient ones. This particular objective will contribute 69 significantly to the major upgrading of the ageing building stock, while at the same time giving a substantial boost to the construction industry through high added value technologies and essentially ensuring increased financial and operating benefits for households in Greece, also enabling them to cover their energy needs. Moreover, in respect of this dimension as well as other dimensions of the NECP, the aim is also to increase the use of natural gas in final consumption. More specifically, natural gas is expected to be the intermediate fuel for switching to a low GHG emissions model in all final consumption sectors, and may also lead to both improved energy efficiency and lower energy costs compared to other conventional technologies. A key aim is to achieve a higher gas share in all final consumption sectors and, essentially, to ensure that its increased use replaces part of the current consumption of petroleum products in these sectors. The development of the necessary transmission and distribution infrastructure to allow access to natural gas for higher percentages of end users in the building sector and the further increase in its use in industry and transport are priorities for the forthcoming period. The quantitative objective for this priority is to increase the direct use of natural gas in the final consumption sectors by at least 50% compared to 2017. Finally, the implementation of all the necessary investments in final energy consumption sectors with a view to improving energy efficiency requires that more effective financing mechanisms be planned in order to increase and maximise the current levels of private capital leverage. The active involvement of the financial sector and the promotion of innovative financing mechanisms and market mechanisms, including energy performance contracts, are critical parameters for attaining this objective. 2.4.2 Challenges In the case of policy measures relating to infrastructure development, technical complexity and the definition of both the technical specifications and the implementation mechanism are the main problems, causing significant delays. It should also be stressed that there is a need to develop effective mechanisms for measuring, controlling and monitoring the policy measures, which must be accompanied by the development of the necessary tools and formats. Training, development of certification systems and smooth market adaptation to the technical requirements are considered to be essential prerequisites for the effective planning and implementation of policy measures.   70 Several policy measures require the adaptation of the regulatory framework, while in the case of public procurement, including interventions in public buildings and using new innovative design standards and digital models, complexity is an indisputable challenge that needs to be addressed. With regard to existing funding mechanisms, the key challenges include the selection of cost-effective applications, the simplification of existing procedures, the absence of incentives to implement efficient measures and technologies and the difficulty in financing projects through energy performance contracts. In addition to that, there must be a transition to the next implementation phase for specific policy measures. For example, in the case of energy efficiency obligation schemes, the main challenges are the transition from behavioural to technical measures and the further expansion of the existing scheme through the option of exchanging certified energy-saving units. Moreover, with regard to the energy upgrading of public and private buildings, ensuring economic efficiency and technical and operational feasibility for different uses and categories of buildings requires relevant changes to the legislative framework. Finally, the planning of policy measures should in any case be holistic in order to avoid possible incompatibilities between the policy measures already in place and the new measures being planned.
