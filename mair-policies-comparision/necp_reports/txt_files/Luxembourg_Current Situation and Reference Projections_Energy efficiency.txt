The majority of the final energy demand in Luxembourg, 59%, is accounted for by the transport sector (Figure 7). Of this, a majority of around 34% is accounted for by foreign road transport. According to energy statistics, this includes the refuelling caused by all non-domestic vehicle owners. This includes through traffic of heavy goods and passenger vehicles, as well as cross-border commuters with passenger vehicles not registered in Luxembourg. At the same time, air transport accounts for about 12% of total final energy demand, which means that domesthe agricultural sector accounts for the lowest share in the final energy demand at around 0.2%, the industrial sector requires the greatest share of energy in Luxembourg at just over 17%.

It should be noted here that cogeneration plants are able to provide heat at temperatures up to 500 °C. (Klobasa, Steinbach & Pudlik 2016).  Further potential for the use of high-efficiency cogeneration can be found in the following areas:  Decentralised cogeneration plants in buildings   Use of cogeneration in industry   Heating network supply and centralised cogeneration  The economic potential of the use of cogeneration plants and supply based on heating networks depends largely on the development of renovation activities in the building sector and therefore on the development of the heat demand of buildings as a whole. In the field of the decentralised supply of buildings, the use of cogeneration in the power range below 500 kW of electric power is well-established. On account of the building-specific heating or cooling demand values, there is still untapped economic potential for highly efficient cogeneration or district heating, mainly in the area of multi-family buildings.   The economic potential of cogeneration in the building sector is currently being realised at about 50% through existing local heating concepts. Therefore, in Luxembourg, there is currently an economic cogeneration potential of around 1,170 GWh of useful energy in the building sector alone (Klobasa, Steinbach & Pudlik 2016).  At the same time, a limited economic potential of around 500 GWh of final energy or 425 GWh of useful energy is seen in industry by 2030 (see Table 12). Relevant sectors here are the chemical industry, the timber industry and the food industry. However, to realise this industrial potential, good site conditions with long plant running times are absolutely essential (Klobasa, Steinbach & Pudlik 2016).       and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 143   Table 12: Additional potential for the cogeneration of heat in industry by 2030 based on final energy use in industry  Fuel demand in GWh Cogeneration suitable (<500 °C) in GWh Cogeneration existing in GWh Expansion potential in GWh Sector 2014 2030 2014 2030 2014 2030 Steel 1 670 1 422 67 57   Stone/earth 1 094 589 164 88   Chemistry 319 295 316 292  210 Textiles 226 208 226 208   Timber 274 253 274 253 65 150 Food 61 57 60 56   Construction 77 71 0 0   Mechanical engineering 13 12 13 12   Paper 51 47 50 46   Other 157 154 145 134 122 115 Total 3 952 3 107 1 315 1 146 187 500   Cogeneration heat*  425   Cogeneration electricity**  255 Source: Klobasa, Steinbach & Pudlik 2016  Energy demand development in Luxembourg by 2040 The energy demand developments of the reference scenario and the target scenario from 2015 to 2040 are modelled using a bottom-up model. This model takes account of a number of very different drivers depending on the sector under consideration (private households; trade, commerce and services sector; industry and transport). In the model, these drivers are linked to corresponding specific energy demand parameters in both the reference and target scenarios. The annual energy demand development is then calculated by mathematically linking drivers with the associated energy demand characteristics and other influencing factors. As a basis for the data and a source of information, wherever possible, the model draws on existing accessible data sets or other sources of information (inventory, reports from research projects, previous projects, etc.) for the relevant factors and influencing variables. These come, for example, from Statec or other institutions. If no relevant data are available, assumptions and expert estimates must be used. However, as a result of this, the project is unable to reflect the real situation in Luxembourg in all sectors and sub-sectors in such a way that the modelled results can always be reflected in exactly the same way as the results of other projects or data sets. The large number of influencing factors taken into account demands a certain degree of abstraction or generalisation for the individual control variables. As a result, all project results may differ to some extent from data or data sets that are already available. Understandably, this applies not only to the demand side, but also to the supply side calculations.   and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 144   commerce and services; industry and transport It is possible to draw a distinction here between non-ETS (private households; trade, commerce and services; industry) and ETS (industry, aviation). In the case of -ETS sector will rise by 15% in the period from 2015 to 2040; from just under 36 TWh per year to around 42 TWh. The final energy demand of the transport sector will show the largest percentage increase here, growing to around 26.5 TWh in 2040 (+ 19.5%). At the same time, the electricity demand will increase by around 8% to reach 6.4 TWh and the final energy demand for heat generation will show minor growth of 2.9% (from approximately 10.5 TWh to just under 10.9 TWh).  During that same period, the electricity demand of the non-ETS sector of industry will increase by approx. 180 GWh to just over 1.2 TWh in 2040 (+ 17%). At the same time, the fuel required by non-ETS industry will also increase by just over 21% from 0.9 TWh in 2015 to approximately 1.1 TWh. By contrast, after a slight increase in 2020, the electricity demand of ETS industry will decrease by almost 6% to 1.9 TWh in 2040.  (see Figure 9).   It should also be noted here that a further increase in electricity consumption seems possible, as this information does not take account of the fact that larger electricity consumers could settle in Luxembourg in the near to medium term.  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 145    GWh GWh Strombedarf Industrie ETS Electricity demand industry ETS Brennstoffbedarf Industrie ETS Fuel demand industry ETS Source: Own illustration 2019 Figure 9:  Electricity and fuel required by industry (ETS sector only) in the period from 2015 to 2040 in the event of the reference scenario The final energy demand for heat generation (excluding electricity) in the non-ETS sector shows a slight increase of 8% overall over the entire study period (+ 1.0% compared to 2030), i.e. the final energy demand for heating (excluding electricity) will increase from around 9.4 TWh to just under 10.1 TWh. This increase is based on the increased use of wood and other renewable energies (+ 263% in 2040 when compared with 2015) and other fuels (+ 18% in 2040 when compared with 2015), while the use of the fossil energy sources, natural gas, fuel oil and coal, will see a significant drop. This increase in the final energy demand for heat n in 2015; most of the increase will be seen in the period up to 2030, while the final energy demand of the sector will only grow by just under 2% in the period from 2030 to 2040 (see Figure 10). On the other hand, the final energy demand of non-ETS industry will also increase at a near-identical rate (+ 21.3%) from  and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 | 146   0.9 TWh to approximately 1.1 TWh. In contrast to private households and non-generation in 2040 when compared with 2015 (see Figure 10). The final energy demand in the transport sector, which will see strong growth by 2040 (+ 19.5%) and which is based on a growing number of vehicles and ever increasing distances driven, is covered almost exclusively by the conventional fossil energy sources, petrol (+ 2.0 TWh when compared with 2015) and diesel (+ 1.8 TWh when compared with 2015) (see Figure 11). In the same period, biofuels will see an absolute increase of just under 0.5 TWh.
