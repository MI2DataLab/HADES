Dimension Energy Security i. The elements set out in point (c) of Article 4 Under Article 4(c) of Regulation (EU) No 2018/1999, the NECP 2030 document should provide information on the objective or target:  in security of supply, i.e. in diversification of the use of energy sources and third-country imports;  in increasing the flexibility of the energy system;  in the case of difficulties in the supply of energy source(s). The following gives an overview of the sectoral targets in different energy systems by parts. Flexibility of the energy system The adequacy and flexibility of the electrical system (and the increase thereof) is ensured by the Electrical Market Act and harmonisation with the legislation laid down pursuant to it. According to the current Electrical Market Act, the system operator (including the  transmission system operator) in Estonia develops the system in their service area in a way that ensures provision of consistent network service that is based on the legislation and an operating licence to consumers, producers, transmission line owners and other system operators who are connected to the system considering their justified needs and to connect to the electrical installation of the market operator in their service area By developing the grid, the system operator will follow the need for ensuring the security of supply, efficiency and market integration considering the results of the studies carried out in these areas66. The targets under measure 1.1 (Developing the electrical energy production) and 1.2 (Transmission eligible for electrical energy sector needs and efficient transmission) are used to ensure the adequacy of the electricity system adequacy and development of energy system flexibility. (see Table 12 and point 2.4.3) of the sub-target of NDPES 2030 security of supply. Table 12. Targets for ensuring electricity system adequacy and the flexibility of the energy system65 NDPES 2030 target: 1. Security of supply Estonia has guaranteed lasting security of supply NDPES 2030 measure Dimension Indicative target level 1.1 Share of fuel-free energy sources (sun, wind, hydro energy) in final power consumption, % >25% (2030) 1.1 Total electric power of the cogeneration stations producing to the district heating network built, MWel >600 (2030) 1.2 Average total duration of unscheduled or disruptive interruptions in the distribution system per point of consumption a year, minutes <90 (2030) 1.2 Amount of energy not provided in the transmission system, MWh <150 (2030)  Security of supply of the electrical system Security of supply of the electrical system is based on sub-target measure 1.1 of the NDPES 2030 regarding security of supply (Developing the electrical energy production) and 1.2 (Transmission eligible for electrical energy sector needs and efficient transmission) (see Table 13 and point 2.4.3) Table 13. Targets for ensuring the security of the electricity supply65 NDPES 2030 target: 1. Security of supply Estonia has guaranteed lasting security of supply NDPES 2030 measure Dimension Indicative target level 1.1 Existence of local power generation capacities for compliance with the N-1-1 criterion Achieved (2030) 1.1 Share of fuel-free energy sources (sun, wind, hydroenergy) in final power consumption, % >25% (2030) 1.1 Electric power of the cogeneration stations producing to the district heating network built, MWel >600 (2030) 1.1 Share of imported fuel in electricity production <50% 1.2 Share of domestic electricity under open market conditions >60 % 1.2 Average total duration of unscheduled or disruptive interruptions in the distribution system per point of consumption a year, minutes  1.2 Amount of energy not provided in the transmission system, MWh  1.2 Preparedness to use international connectivity, % 96% (2030) 1.2 Construction of new 330 kV lines (Sindi-Riga and Sindi-Harku) Built (2020) 1.2 Estonia is connection to the frequency Connected (2030)  Investments made within the framework of the synchronisation project of the Baltic States (see point 2.4.2) that help eliminate bottlenecks and increase the readiness of external connections and flexibility of the electrical system for fast changes in the power generation also contribute to the resilience of the electrical system. When the production of electricity from oil shale is reduced (phasing out of direct combustion), new production capacities and interconnections with neighbouring countries will ensure the security of the electricity supply.  Ensuring the minimum requirements for security of supply should not exclude, if needed, the application of capacity mechanisms in the future according to the EU market organisation rules in force. The system operator is responsible for ensuring the security of supply of the electrical system. Under Regulation (EU) No 2019/943, the State undertakes to determine the security of supply standard. Although flexibility has not been aligned with the Electricity Market Act to the extent set out in the Electricity Market Directive (Directive (EU) 2019/944), the flexibility-related issues will be reflected in the Act after adopting the Directive. Gas system According to the Natural Gas Act, the system operator is responsible for ensuring the security of the natural gas supply.  The system operator is obliged to ensure the security of supply and balance of the gas system at any time according to the agreements in force.  The system operator develops the system on the basis of known and projected demand, including new known connectees. Therefore the N-1 criterion52 of the infrastructure standard must be met at any time. Sub-objective 1.3 (Ensuring the gas supply) is reflected in NDPES 2030 by ensuring the security of supply of the gas system. Table 14. Development targets for the gas system and market and diversification of gas supply NDPES 2030 target: 1.

If, upon interruption, it is possible to reorganise the supply so that there will be no disturbances in the supply, the N-1 criterion is met.  53 HHI - Herfindahl-Hirschman index that varies within the range of 010000 and for which the squares of dependency on the gas market on one gas seller. For HHI<2000, there are 7 gas sellers and the largest  connection Balticconnector  To reduce the probability of the factors that impact the security of gas supply and to ensure readiness for coping with large-scale supply disruptions, the Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure approves a plan for safeguarding against gas supply disruptions and a preventive action plan for reducing the risks that affect the security of gas supply every two years (based on Regulation (EU) No 2017/1938).  The most recent plan was adopted in 201754. ii. National objectives with regard to increasing: the diversification of energy sources and supply from third countries for the purpose of increasing the resilience of regional and national energy systems Estonia used to have one of the lowest rates of dependency on imported energy in the EU but largely depends on imports for natural gas and motor fuels. While it is possible to use different supply channels, for motor fuels, opportunities are more limited for natural gas supplies. In response, NDPES 2030 includes targets for diversification of the gas supply, described in Table 14 of Chapter 2.3.i. the energy balance. As part of the diversification of the energy sources, Estonia has started to produce biomethane from local raw material. In 2018 Estonia produced 40 GWh of biomethane. The country has set a target of increasing biomethane production volumes to 380 GWh per year by 2030. iii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to reducing energy import dependency from third countries, for the purpose of increasing the resilience of regional and national energy systems To maintain low import dependency, it is necessary to maintain a high proportion of domestic fuels in the energy balance.  An overview of the targets is included in Chapter 2.3.i (see Table 13). iv. National objectives with regard to increasing the flexibility of the national energy system, in particular by means of deploying domestic energy sources, demand response55 and energy storage Issues related to electrical system flexibility are described in Chapter 2.3.i                                                            54 Preventive action plan for reducing the risks affecting the security of gas supply Plan for safeguarding the gas supply disruptions (2017) - http://www.konkurentsiamet.ee/index.php?id=18309  55
