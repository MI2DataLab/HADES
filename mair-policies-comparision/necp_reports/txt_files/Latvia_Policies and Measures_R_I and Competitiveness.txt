99  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 All the action lines included in the Plan Status quo R&I is being developed in Latvia in accordance with the Smart Specialisation Strategy (RIS3) in five specialisation areas: smart energy; knowledge intensive bio economy; biomedicine, medical appliances, bio-pharmacy and bio-technology; advanced materials, technologies and engineering systems; and information and communication technologies. nologies or new materials, research and development of engineering and digital solutions for acquisition, storage and integration of RE into the energy system, improvement of energy efficiency in construction and automation and optimisation of production processes, as well as the development of alternative fuels for transport. Development of the clean technologies sector is directly related to R&I capacity, i.e. the number of researchers and highly qualified specialists and public and private sector investments in R&I. Of Latviascientific community staff (FTE personnel), approximately 1 000 or 18 % are engaged in research in priority areas of the EnU165  energy, construction, climate, environmental engineering technologies, whereas research in the field of energy amounts to just 8 %. EUR 34.3 million or 19.8 % of the total R&I funding raised in RIS3 areas166 were invested in R&I development of competences and new technological solutions for improvement of energy efficiency, development of smart grids and improvement of management efficiency of energy systems, research and testing of alternative fuels and sources of RE acquisition. Every year, study programmes relating followed by just 4.5 % of all Latvian students on average, and the observed trend is for just 50 % of the students enrolled in bachelor and master study programmes to complete their studies. The situation with doctoral sapplied research orientation focusing on handling pressing challenges of the industry, whilst research excellence and international visibility, recognition, cooperation and competitiveness compared with the Baltic States and EU-28 average indicators needs a considerable boost sity, 2) the Institute of Solid State Physics of the University of Latvia and 3) the LLU. In the private sector, the most important environmental, green and clean technology and new product solutions are mainly being developed in several competence centres  the Competence Centre of Smart Engineering Systems, Transport and Energy, the Competence Centre of Smart Materials and Technologies, Competence Centre of Mechanical Engineering and the Competence Centre of Information and Communication Technologies. The clusters created in Latvia, for example the Green and clean technology cluster, the Latvian wood construction cluster, the Clean technology cluster, the Smart city cluster, have a positive impact on the creation of                                                       165National Information System of Research Activity (NISRA), Registry of Persons Elected in Academic Positions in Scientific Institutions, (data as at 08.08.2019.)

Research and innovation 100  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 cooperation networks of undertakings, research organisations and other stakeholders, as well as the development of projects by companies in one sector, or multi-sector project, in the area of clean and green technologies. In the period from 2014 to 2016, 30.3 % of all Latvian companies were innovative, while in the EU countries this indicator is 50.6 % on average (2014-2016; EUROSTAT). This is related to the fact that micro and small enterprises having limited capacity (funding, relevant human resources) to invest in R&I activities dominate in the total structure of enterprises in Latvia, and the fact that these enterprises lack understanding of the impact of R&I investments on competitiveness of enterprises. In all, about 50 enterprises belong to innovative companies  Target status quo by 2030:  Investments in research and innovation are 2 % of GDP, including at least 25 % of the total volume are invested in research and innovation to achieve climate neutrality.  Scientific personnel (FTE) in the priority areas of the Energy Union  1 800. Benefits to society and economy  The use of innovative solutions to improve energy efficiency in all sectors of the national economy is an approach that is sustainable and the most cost efficient way of bolstering energy security.  Research-based innovation is the basis for creating and implementing a more resource-efficient, zero emission technologies and higher value added products, which would not only help to reduce the negative impact on climate and environment, but would also foster export capability, cooperation opportunities and the long-term competitiveness of Latvian enterprises on a global scale.  The development of the R&I system will help create the new knowledge and skills needed in the professions and job that will be created when the economic system is realigned to take account of the transition to clean energy and climate neutrality. Main challenges 1)  to increase research and innovation capacity in the energy area and to establish a more meaningful link between research, innovation and energy industry development priorities  Research in thermal energy, energy efficiency, electrotechnical and bioenergy production areas, as well as research for improvement of smart grids and energy system management are developing widely in Latvia. However, in order to develop in-depth research competence and excellence focusing on the achievement of climate neutrality objectives, it is necessary to clearly define the priorities of the energy industry (and of other industries contributing to the achievement of climate neutrality objectives), where research and innovation capacity should be developed. 2) to establish a meaningful link between fundamental research and commercialisation and the introduction of research results Given the ambitiousness of the plan and the long-term objectives, it is necessary to ensure that R&I is developed to make a contribution to the achievement of climate neutrality objectives. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an effective link between research, 101  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 development of technology and innovative solutions, their commercialisation and practical implementation by developing more coordinated and target-focused cooperation between research organisations, enterprises and municipalities, including pilot research projects and demonstration projects, and providing proper financial instruments for them. Such initiatives would practically demonstrate research competences, innovation potential, cooperation cultures and a supportive institutional environment, which may directly or indirectly increase competitiveness in terms of attracting both international cooperation partners and investors. In order to achieve the objectives , and to fulfil ambitious long-term objectives, much greater volumes of private investment must be invested in R&I, particularly the research and development of clean energy technologies, sources of and technological solutions for acquisition of RE, the development and introduction of energy efficiency solutions and industrial research. Main action line (horizontal action line) R&I integration and efficient implementation for the achievement of the targets set in the plan Key actions and activities 1) Strengthening the contribution of R&I to the achievement of energy and climate targets and defining priorities for targeted investments The plan defines potential priority action lines in RIS3 for energy:  Innovative solutions in the field of RES technologies, including the production and use of biomethane, hydrogen and modern biofuels, smart use of biomass before combustion, use of solar energy in transport.  Innovative solutions for energy storage, integration and smart transmission, as well as innovative solutions for capturing and reuse of carbon.  Innovative solutions in the field of energy efficiency and sustainability of buildings, including the development of heat insulation materials and technologies, creation of materials with high resource efficiency and energy efficiency and the development of production technologies To achieve the objectives, within R&I (1) support will be provided to the development of research, technologies and (2) for the implementation of demonstration projects and development of new technologies, solutions and user-centred products and services in the following areas:  Production of renewable electricity and thermal energy, for example: research into materials and engineering technologies for the acquisition and storage of RE (in particular, solar, hydrogen energy), research into the sources and acquisition technologies for bioenergy (biomass, biogas) and ways of improving these, research into wave energy acquisition technologies.  Smart grids, energy storage and recovery, and integration of renewable energy in the energy system, for example, automation of management of energy systems (electricity and heat), digitalisation and energy transformation and storage technologies, including 102  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 batteries, for automation of industrial production, self-generation of energy and development of electric mobility.

Smart mobility, for example, alternative fuels and biofuels  hydrogen, biogas, electric drive and energy recover technologies, automated transport and intelligent transport systems, solutions for introduction and development of electric mobility, planning and design of resource-efficiency and decarbonisation oriented transport and mobility, incl. multimodal, systems.  Development of market models of a new type  peer-to-peer trading, aggregation services, energy as a service, local community energy systems.  2) Development of efficient cooperation and coordination mechanisms between implementers of R&I and stakeholders for commercialisation and implementation of research results To achieve the objectives , as part of R&I provision will be made for aid or non-financial measures to foster mutual cooperation among undertakings, higher education institutions and research organisations, State and municipal institutions, NGOs and other stakeholders for piloting and implementation of new technologies and innovative solutions. Business growth and competitiveness depends on the ability to scientifically create and sell knowledge-intensive products and services which are in demand by self-streamlining with upstream value added global chains.  In order to foster competitiveness and develop digitalisation in business, work on digital transformation that has stated so far will continue. A more detailed plan of further actions with measures to improve competitiveness will be included in the National Industrial Policy Guidelines for 2021-2027. Cross-border cooperation In order to develop competence in the implementation of RIS3 and to build cooperation in the field of R&I with other EU regions, since 2014 Latvia has been part of the EU RIS3 platform167. It is coordinated by the Joint Research Centre created by the EC, which is functioning as an analytical, informative and cooperative platform and monitoring agency for the implementation of EC RIS3 policy.  In 2018, a cooperation agreement on cooperation in energy research was concluded between Baltic and Nordic countries for 2018-2021 with the general objective of promoting research and analysis in the field of energy in the Baltic Countries, mutual cooperation between Baltic countries, cooperation of Baltic countries with Nordic countries, and research in the Baltic and Nordic countries. This objective is expected to be achieved by implementing three main measures: 1. Promotion of mutual research projects from the Baltic States and research projects between the Baltic and Nordic States with participation of researchers from the Baltic States; 2. Cooperation between the Baltic and Nordic States with regard to doctoral studies;                                                       167 Joint Research centre, Smart specialisation platform, http://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ 103  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 3.
