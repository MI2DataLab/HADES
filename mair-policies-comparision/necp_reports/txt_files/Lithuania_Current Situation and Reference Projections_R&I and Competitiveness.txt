CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 231   The biomass energy industry in Lithuania is growing rapidly, with an increasing number of companies entering the production of advanced biofuel technologies. In Lithuania, the profiles of companies producing biofuel technologies are very diverse. Companies, in cooperation with scientists, are constantly improving their equipment, which is why the manufacturers of unique, modern technologies are setting up in Lithuania. Lithuania may have an industrial niche in the production of biomass combustion equipment. This would contribute to the European Commission's roadmap 2050 to make Europe a producer and consumer of green energy and the world leader in innovative green energy technologies. Companies operating in Lithuania design and manufacture biofuel pellet presses, technology lines for the production of biofuel pellets, biofuel boilers, condensing economizers, furnaces, straw and hay choppers and sawdust briquettes presses and build cogeneration plants, and one of the companies was the first to manufacture and install a steam boiler in Lithuania. Baltpool, the Lithuanian biofuel exchange, became operational in 2012. 362 members from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are trading on it currently. In 2018, the Baltpool model ensures the competitiveness of the biofuels market and a consistent quality of biofuels.   Solar energy Lithuania has big renewable energy development ambitions and has made significant progress in this area. Companies operating in Lithuania produce and export highly innovative solar modules to foreign markets. The potential of Lithuanian scientific and educational institutions and businesses in the solar energy field is relatively high. The institutions carry out fundamental and contract-based research in collaboration with Lithuanian and foreign companies and research institutions; highly qualified specialists are being trained. Research related to solar energy, optimisation of combustion processes, energy efficient materials, efficient lighting, industrial biotechnologies, biofuel production, hydrogen technologies and other relevant studies are carried out in Lithuania.   Clustering Lithuania is developing clusters to stimulate innovation. In addition to Biopower Plants Development Cluster (development of modern, innovative biofuel equipment and technologies for efficient use of biomass) and the Photovoltaic Technology Cluster (development of environmental energy technologies), a number of new ones have been set up. These include the Smart Green City Cluster (promoting the use of new technologies for environmentally friendly solutions), the Cleantech Cluster Lithuania and the Circular Economy Cluster. The growing number of clusters demonstrates that Lithuanian businesses are becoming more environmentally responsible and understand the benefits of eco-innovation. These clusters are also a sound foundation for the future of Lithuanian circular economy as they already base their operations on energy efficiency and effective use of resources.   Research, technologies and innovation policies The Ministry of Education, Science and Sport formulates the country's policy on higher education and science. Higher education and RDI are closely linked to all areas of national development. The Government-approved National Programme for the Development of Higher Education, Research and Experimental (Social, Cultural) Development 20132020 aims to promote the harmonious development of humans and society, strengthening the country's competitiveness and enabling innovation through the development of higher education and RDI. High quality research contributes to solutions to global challenges as well as 4. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 232   climate change, encourages the involvement of Lithuanian researchers in Horizon 2020 and other international scientific programmes and integration into international RDI infrastructures such as the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The Ministry of Economy and Innovation is responsible for the formulation of the technology and innovation policy. The innovation objectives of the various economic sectors (energy systems, industry, transport, agriculture) are included in the overall framework of the innovation policy. Lithuania's innovation policy is currently implemented in the framework of the Lithuanian progress strategy Lithuania 2030, the National Progress Programme 2014-2020 based on the said progress strategy, and the Programme of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania. In addition, different aspects of innovation policy are covered by the Lithuanian Innovation Development Programme 20142020. The aim of this programme is to create a legal model to strengthen the innovation potential of the business sector, as well as to develop more effective policies and innovative public sectors, and to stimulate joint activities between business, science and education institutions. One of the measures laid down in the implementation plan of the programme is intended to support eco-friendly, energy efficient and green RDI activities to produce and sell high added-value products. In addition, areas related to energy and sustainable environment are also supported through pre-commercial procurement aimed at developing innovative products in this area.   Horizon 2020 The Lithuanian Energy Institute (LEI) carries out fundamental and applied research and development work in the field of energy at international level for Lithuanian and foreign institutions of science, government and municipalities, and trains the most qualified researchers for research work the field of energy. The Institute employs 130 energy scientists/researchers and has 11 research laboratories. The Institute has carried out 16 projects under Horizon 2020, with a further 7 projects now under negotiation. Horizon 2020 has provided EUR 1.9 million in funding to the Institute.   European Innovation Scoreboard In the European Innovation Scoreboard 2019, Lithuania belongs to the group of moderate innovators and ranks 21st in the EU. However, the European Innovation Scoreboard 2019 shows that Lithuania's innovation ecosystem is improving. For several consecutive years Lithuania has maintained a leading position in the EU in terms of long-Innovation Index increased by 25.7%. This is the best result for the EU. Lithuania's strengths include an innovation-friendly environment, innovation-friendly small and medium-sized enterprises, science-to-business relations and the number of higher education graduates. Lithuania scored the lowest points in the attractiveness of the research system, employment in the knowledge-intensive sector, and intellectual property indicators.   National funding of RDI In 2018, EUR 396.8 million was allocated to RDI activities in Lithuania. Expenditure on RDI increased by EUR 17.9 million, or 4.7%, compared to 2017. The ratio of RDI expenditure to gross domestic product (GDP) was 0.88% in 2018 (0.90% in 2017). According to the sources of funding, the largest share of RDI expenditure, 34.8%, came from the state budget, 35.5% from business enterprises, 28.1% from foreign funds, and 3.6% from higher education and non-profit institutions.  4. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 233   Number of researchers: 1,588 researchers worked in the technological science area in 2017, calculated on the basis of full-time equivalent (2017).  Number of patents: the Lithuanian Energy Institute mentioned in section 3.5. and the present section has been granted a total of 15 patents, most of them in the field of hydrogen use.  Price elements In Lithuania, public price caps are set annually, taking into account the approved price caps for services and the electricity purchase price calculated by the public supplier (see Figure 4.6.1). According to Article 43 (2) of the Law on Electricity, from 1 January 2013 onwards, only household consumers and socially vulnerable consumers or groups thereof may purchase electricity at public tariffs. 4.
