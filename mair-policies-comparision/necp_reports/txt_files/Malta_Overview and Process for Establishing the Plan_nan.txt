 1  1  OVERVIEW AND PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE PLAN  1.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   Political, economic, environmental and social context of the plan  climate issues are at the forefront of political and societal debate and the implications of climate change are ever so perceptible. At European level there is a clear drive towards climate neutrality by 2050. The new European Commission acknowledges that although Europe is currently on track to meet its 2030 emission reduction targets and goals enshrined in the Paris Agreement, reaching climate neutrality by 2050 will require more ambitious contributions of all sectors. In view of this increased ambition, the Commission is expected to present a proposal for the European Green deal which will include even more ambitious proposals in the area of Energy and Climate Change.  The Governance Regulation1, which sets out the framework for the NECP, aims to ensure the -international commitments under the Paris Agreement.  A bottom-up approach is adopted, whereby Member States present their fair and ambitious efforts and contributions towards a decarbonised energy system and towards mitigating climate change. Whilst the Governance Regulation sets the basis for the development of this plan, this is complimented by a package of new EU legislation targeting energy efficiency, renewable energy, energy security and market design, appropriately  n follows the scope of the Energy Union and covers its five dimensions: decarbonisation, energy efficiency, energy security, internal energy market, and research, innovation and competitiveness. The five dimensions are considered as being closely related and mutually reinforcing and are correspondingly treated as such within the plan. The underlying of the NECP. In line with the iterative process outlined in NECP was submitted to the European Commission in December 2018 and updated during the course of 2019 whilst taking due account of the Recommendation2 published by the European Commission  Malof the Plan and contains a description of the policies and measures that need to be implemented in order to reach these objectives in Section 3. This is supplemented by an analytical basis consisting of a description of the current situation in the five dimensions as well as projections until 2040 which are based on robust and consistent data, assumptions and modelling exercises. Projections under the                                                            1 Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parlaiment and of the Council on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action. 2 Commission recommendation of 18.6.2019.

Whilst the Ministry responsible for finance and budget has been actively involved in the are subject to review and endorsement on annual basis by the Ministry responsible for finance and budget.  It is crucial that the current social, economic and environmental context of the Maltese Islands and its impact on the energy system and climate change mitigation is kept in mind when reading this plan. service-based economy and a corresponding increased demand for labour force, leading to significant net inwards migration.  The NECP provides a clear path for Malta to attain the overarching objectives of a sustainable, affordable and secure energy system which needs to follow a decarbonisation trajectory, whilst recognising the inherent challenges and opportunities brought about by national specificities such as spatial constraints, high population density, and a mild Mediterranean climate. This calls for specific solutions in each of the five dimensions, which may also depend on further technological and cost developments.   Strategy relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union  -carbon economy, primarily through the pursuit of upholding national GHG emissions reduction commitments, and by cefforts towards climate change mitigation and adaptation are enacted in the Climate Action Act, established in 2015, and further strengthened through the ratification of the Paris Agreement, whereby Malta reaffirmed its commitment to address climate issues to its fullest potential and compared to 1990 levels.  In the area of renewable energy, Malta will continue its efforts to increase its renewable energy share, a task which is progressively becoming ever more daunting given the growth in final energy consumption.  Malta will extend its current support framework for RES to the period until 2030 and  3  launch new initiatives tailored to local specificities to ensure that technically and economically viable indigenous sources of renewable energy may be exploited.  Temperate climatic conditions and lack of energy-intensive industries mean that Malta has the second lowest final energy consumption per capita across all EU Member States. Nevertheless, the specific electricity distributor/supplier, the absence of natural gas and district heating and cooling networks, and the small size and number of suppliers and market players limit the range of measures available to meet energy savings obligations. Steep population and GDP growth in recent years has made it post-2020 will seek to achieve cost efficient energy savings in the relative sectors whilst taking into account the effective potential. Malta will strive to continue decreasing the overall energy intensity of its economy and uphold its obligations under the Energy Efficiency Directive3.  commitment to achieving greater security of supply through the diversification of energy sources and suppliers and reduce energy import dependency primarily through the deployment of indigenous RES. Periodic contingency planning in the case of supply disruption for electricity, gas and oil sectors will be ensured, while energy security is also tackled within the context of the long-term objective of decarbonising the energy system, which will pose new challenges for Malta and thus will require new solutions.  Malta considers the Gas Pipeline project with Italy as an important element to secure its energy supply and tap future opportunities such as the supply of biogas blended with natural gas and possibly also Hydrogen.  uropean grid via the 200MW Malta-Italy subsea -wide target of 15%4 throughout the whole projected period. The interconnector contributes to the robustness of the elean electricity transmission system or a liquid wholesale market and is eligible to derogate from the application of a number of provisions of the Electricity Market Directive5 due to the small size and measures under the internal energy market and energy security dimensions are driven primarily by the delivery of the gas pipeline project, but also focus on increasing the flexibility of the energy system and ensuring that vulnerable and energy poor consumers are duly protected.  Malta will endeavour to boost research, innovation and competitiveness, and a national R&I strategy driven by the smart specialization process is expected to be finalized by 2020. In order to foster research & innovation specifically in the area of energy and low-carbon technologies, it was determined that a sector-specific strategy for R&I in energy (and water) will be developed to fully take advantage of the value-added of such targeted investment. The National Strategy for Research and Innovation in Energy and Water (2021-2030) is expected to be                                                            3 Directive (EU) 2018/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency.  4 Calculated as electricity interconnection capacity (i.e capacity of the electricity interconnector with Italy) over the net installed capacity in Malta.  5 Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU  4  -impact and decarbonised economy in an effective, just and timely manner; strengthen competitiveness, growth and commercial attractiveness; and increase the level of domestic support for R&I in Malta.     5    Overview table with key objectives, policies and measures of the plan Dimension Key objectives Key policies and measures Decarbonisation  GHG emissions and removals -19% GHG emissions reduction target under the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR); Contributing to the EU -40% GHG emission reduction target; Fulfilling obligations of the Paris Agreement;   Management of Farm Slurries in the Maltese Islands;  Waste Management Plan 2020-2030;  Development of Waste-to-Energy Facility;  Sustainable mobility measures;   Renewable Energy 11.5% share of Renewable energy in gross final energy consumption in 2030;  14% RES share in the transport sector in line with Renewable Energy Directive;  Measures exploiting all technically and economically viable indigenous RES sources;  Extension of current policy framework in the area of RES for the period until 2030 whilst providing new initiatives tailored to local specificities. - Financial support schemes for Solar PV; - Schemes to support solar water heaters and heat pump water heaters; - Biofuels substitution obligation;  Energy  Efficiency Energy intensity of 0.07 to2005 in 2030.

A number of these objectives have been successfully addressed. ished Priority was given to the swift upgrading of inefficient conventional electricity production infrastructure and the introduction of LNG as fuel for power generation, which until then was reliant on heavy fuel oil. Malta closed the inefficient Marsa Power Station; completed and placed in operation the 200MW interconnector with the European grid; and has commissioned a new 205MW gas-fired, high efficiency combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant as well as an LNG facility for the provision of natural gas in the short term with a view to replace this option by a permanent multi-purpose gas pipeline with Sicily. In addition, the recently built 149MW power plant which comprises eight diesel engines has been converted to run on natural gas instead of heavy fuel oil. Four of these engines can also run on diesel oil, a feature sought to contribute towards the desired level of security of supply.  The developments in the generation sector that have taken place have been given the highest priority as these have resulted in significant primary energy savings and in substantial reductions in GHG emissions from the energy sector. Investments in the power generation sector were guided by the Energy Efficiency first principle and indeed managed to increase the overall conversion efficiency from 25-30% to more than 50%.  The Distribution System Operator (DSO) executed a number of upgrades in its Distribution Centres to consolidate the national electricity distribution grid. It also invested more than 100 million7 over the                                                            7 https://www.enemalta.com.mt/upgrading-your-network/2014-2017/  8  period 2014-2017 to upgrade and expand major nodes of the national electricity network and improve the quality of service.  Government increased its efforts to support the deployment of renewable energy, especially photovoltaics, solar water heaters and heat pump water heaters (which are particularly well suited to barriers limiting renewable energy potential, Malta continues to support the exploitation of viable indigenous sources of renewable energy.  Malta does not have a natural gas network (LNG is only made available to the power plant), although uses of natural gas in niche applications may start to develop if the Malta-Italy gas pipeline is pursued. Throughout the years, Malta continued in its effort to address climate action. These efforts culminated in 2015 with the development and enactment of the Climate Action Act. This provides the legal framework within which climate action is pursued and establishes a governance structure.  Climate mitigation and adaptation strategies were devised with programmes of measures to address the local context.  Through the ratification of the Paris Agreement, Malta reaffirmed its commitment to address climate issues to their fullest potential and to contribute totarget of 40% reduction of its GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.   Current energy and climate policies and measures relating to the five Energy Union dimensions The policy framework for energy and climate in the Maltese Islands is described in the following key documents:   The National Energy Policy, published in 2012;   The National Renewable Energy Action Plan for 2020, published in 2017;  The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for 2020, published in 2017;  National Strategy for Policy and Abatement Measures Relating to the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, published in 2009; and    Other supporting documents amplify aspects of these policy frameworks and include measures designed to implement the various policies. The policies and measures described in the above-rio.  National Energy Policy (2012) The major policy areas and objectives set out in the 2012 National Energy Policy are listed below, broadly annotated under the five dimensions of the Energy Union. These policy areas remain generally valid within the current policy framework until 2030, even though priorities and emphases may have changed, and various major projects have been implemented.   Decarbonisation: The 2012 Energy Policy focused on Government support targeting the sustainable development of renewable energy sources, including commitments to reduce GHG emissions related to the production, distribution and consumption of energy. The  9  reduction of GHG and other emissions was to be reflected in policy, legislation and implementation of projects.   Energy efficiency: Government focused on encouraging and facilitating the achievement of increased energy efficiency in electricity generation and distribution, and in energy end-use, and through leading by example.  Energy security: Teliance on oil products, replacement of ageing power plants, and ensuring that contingency plans are in place to cater for short-term disruption of oil or LNG supply. The government continued to support the sustainable deployment of viable indigenous renewable energy sources.   Internal energy market: The objective was to establish an electricity and gas interconnection with the European grids to provide the basis for integration with the EU internal energy market. The Government also aimed to ensure that the legal and regulatory frameworks result in affordable energy pricing, whilst encouraging competition within the limits imposed by the market size and structure.  Social measures are also in place to support and protect vulnerable consumers.  Research, innovation and competitiveness: The Government committed that its fiscal policy and its education and research policies support the general objectives of ensuring security of supply, environmental protection and competitiveness. As a consequence of the changed priorities and of major projects undertaken in recent years, various measures arising out of the Energy Policy (2012) have been implemented, others superseded or rendered irrelevant.  Several, certainly the more important, were achieved earlier than originally planned.  The National Renewable Energy Action Plan (2017)8 The need for an updated action plan covering the period 2015 to 2020 arose after reconsideration of the RES options triggered by technological, social and economic developments. The plan includes a revision of the national RES perspective while remaining faithful to the underlying Energy Policy of 2012 the 10% Renewable Energy Target in line with Directive 2009/28/EC. The Policy measures set out in 2015 and updated in 2017 are listed below. These are classified under   Indigenous sources of RES to be prioritised: Malta will seek to reasonably exploit indigenous to security of energy supply, green job creation and foreign investment.  : Malta will consider Cooperation Mechanisms with other countries to meet its 2020 Renewable Energy target only as fall-back in the case that there will be a minor shortfall in meeting its 2020 target.                                                            8 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/renewable-energy/national-action-plans   10    to be diverse and multi-faceted to counter natural constraints: Malta will exploit all cost-effective sources of RES that can make a contribution, however small, to the final target. This is to counter its specific geographic, environmental and spatial constraints (limited land area and high population density and its rich but fragile natural environment).  RES and conventional energy are to be considered holistically: Government and competent authorities will ensure in their decisions that all the components of the local energy sector, of which RES is part, must holistically contribute to reach the objectives of the energy policy.   Well managed deployment of RES: Government will ensure that investment and incentives in RES are staggered in such a way as to avoid creating shocks and economic bubbles, while achieving targets in a timely manner.   Investment in Renewable Energy will be incentivised: Government will put forward incentive schemes, consistent with national and EU legislation, to make up for the cost premium over conventional energy and that are optimised to achieve their objectives at the lowest cost.   Energy efficiency to be prioritised: Government will robustly and effectively promote efficient use of energy resources, in line with the framework in Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council    Building a Knowledge base and support Research: Government supports indigenous research, development and innovation (RDI), intended to address specific challenges faced by Malta by virtue of its particular geographic specificities, while contributing towards building the competence and prestige of local institutions.  Government supports the development of appropriate technology to harness renewable marine energy.  This is of particular relevance to Malta given the limited landmass.  The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (2017)9 The NEEAP of 2017, revising that of 2014, describes the policies and measures until 2020 targeting enduse efficiency in Malta. The Plan was drawn up as required by, and in line with Directive 2012/27/EU. The Policies guiding that NEEAP were the following:  Energy Efficiency Obligation Scheme upon the national electricity supplier, to apply a progressive (rising block) residential tariff system which is inductive of efficient use of electricity.  Financing schemes/instruments and fiscal incentives to incentivize target sectors to adopt more energy efficient technologies. Measures aim to target the residential, industrial, commercial and transport sectors.   Regulations and voluntary agreements with relatively high consumers of energy, encouraging them to adopt more energy efficient technologies.                                                            9 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-directive/national-energy-efficiency-action-plans   11   Public Sector leading by example whereby Government and public entities are being seen to actively pursue energy efficient measures and projects.   The National Strategy for Policy and Abatement Measures Relating to the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (2009)10 This strategy, commonly referred Mitigation Strategy, provides a policy framework to address Greenhouse gases across all sectors. It includes a national governance structure for management of greenhouse gases, as well as outlining actions to instil a cultural shift towards a better appreciation of our individual responsibility towards climate protection. These principles were later enshrined in the Climate Action Act 2015 (CAP543) which provided a solid basis in the form of a legal structure for governance of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.  The Mitigation Strategy primarily addresses the decarbonisation pillar of the Energy Union Strategy but, in doing so, has considered other aspects including energy efficiency and R&I, as described below.  Decarbonisation: In general, the strategy addresses measures contributing towards a general unquantified reduction for Greenhouse gas emissions. It also envisaged the basic governance and administrative structure currently in place.  Energy efficiency: The strategy included provisions regarding energy efficiency, especially in the building and electricity sector.  Research, innovation and competitiveness: The strategy embodied actions that addressed Research and Development and Innovation (RDI), especially in the local scene and with specific sectoral scopes.  (2017)11 This document was prepared as a stepping-stone  Low Carbon Development Strategy, which legislation and the obligations under the Climate Change Act 2015 (CAP543). The Vision focuses on ways and means to transform Malta into a low-carbon and climate resilient country through symbiotic societal and economic collective actions by 2050.  The Vision has, at its core, a focus on integrating various mitigation and adaptation measures to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions. It identifies a number of key areas with potential for carbon emissions reduction and where diversification is possible. The areas identified for action include energy, transport, waste, agriculture, water, enterprise, tourism, information and communication technologies (ICT), infrastructure (planning and monitoring of existence infrastructure), finance and expert knowledge. Through the Vision, Malta commits to:                                                            10https://msdec.gov.mt/en/Document%20Repository/Malta%20Climate%20Change%20Adaptation%20Strategy/National%20Climate%20Change%20MITIGATION%20Strategy.pdf 11 https://meae.gov.mt/en/Public_Consultations/MSDEC/Documents/MSDEC%20LCDS%20Vision.PDF  12   Uphold national GHG emissions reduction targets as required by EU legislation by 2020;  To move towards a reduction of national GHG emissions as opposed to pursuing a continued limited increase in emission levels post 2020;  Reduce national GHG emissions post-priorities of the time;  Set sector specific GHG emission reduction targets post-2020 to contribute to meeting national targets; and  Identify and implement opportunities to enhance climate resilience in Malta.  Energy Performance of Buildings The main piece of legislation related to the energy performance of buildings is Legal Notice 47 of 2018 transposing Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings (recast).  Following the transposition of the first Directive on the energy performance of buildings (Directive 2002/91/EC), the  Miniregulating the minimum energy performance of buildings was issued in 2006. This first technical guidance on the energy performance of buildings only specified certain aspects of energy performance, such as the maximum building element U-value and design parameters. For instance whilst its specified the maximum allowable glazing to wall ratio or the building services efficiency, no energy thresholds were included. In 2015, a F  Minimum Energy Performance Requirements for Buildings in Malta 2015energy performance requirements, and listing the overall energy thresholds for residential buildings and offices.  In 2015, Malta published its first plan on how Nearly Zero Energy Buildings will be addressed in Malta. This policy document establishes targets for new nearly zero energy buildings, both for residential and other buildings, and examines possible barriers.  A number of policies and measures have been put in place to promote energy-efficiency in buildings. Predominantly, these have taken the form of financial incentives or grants. For example, as of 2018, REWS offers a grant on the purchase of roof insulation and double-glazing products for domestic use that reduce the consumption of energy. As part of a process to preserve and restore the built heritage of the Maltese Islands and promote sustainable regeneration, the restoration grant scheme Irrestawra Darek12, aimed at privately owned residential buildings within urban conservation areas, was launched to promote investment. Other policies and measures focused on financial incentives and grants for the deployment of renewable energy, soft loans for green or energy efficiency investments, as well as financial investments assisting businesses in becoming more energy-efficient and education campaigns.                                                             12 More information available at: https://www.pa.org.mt/en/irrestawra-darek  13   Key issues of cross-border relevance Issues of cross-border relevance for Malta have to be viewed within the context of an island with no land borders and with effectively one neighbouring Member State. This has direct implications on nergy Security and Internal Energy Market dimensions.  Therefore, issues of cross-border relevance relate primarily to commercial contracts relevant to importation of electricity via the electricity interconnector and LNG for fuelling of the power station. As from April 2015, the Maltese electricity system has been synchronised with the Italian system, with scheduled imports through the 200MW HVAC 220kV electricity interconnector. The interconnector is operated by Enemalta plc in coordination with the transmission system operator in Italy, Terna. According to this arrangement, the Maltese electricity system is being treated as a virtual consumption and production point connected to the Italian transmission grid. The interconnector is prevalently used for imports of electricity and balancing. The planned gas pipeline interconnection between Malta and Gela (Sicily, Italy) has reached the permitting stage and technical, financial and environmental studies are underway.  The pipeline is  scheduled for completion in 2025 provided it secures the necessary financing. Cross-border cooperation in areas falling under the other dimensions, such as joint projects in renewables, cooperation and sharing of best-practices on measures targeting energy efficiency and possible joint projects in the area of research & innovation in low-carbon technologies are also considered.   Administrative structure of implementing national energy and climate policies An Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee (IMSC) was established through Cabinet Decision was established to ensure that all national stakeholders contribute effectively towards the National Plan, as the development of the Plan required the coordination and contribution from several entities. Each Ministry forming part of the IMSC designated a high-level political representative to sit on the Committee. Under the IMSC, two Technical Working Groups were established, one on energy modelling and another on non-energy, climate-related modelling, tasked with providing relevant quantitative assessments and technical input to the IMSC. The main role of the IMSC is that of aligning diverse Ministerial priorities so as to develop a holistic and integrated NECP. By the end of 2018, the another five times during 2019 in order to ensure the timely development and completion of the remaining outcomes from the public consultation process and recommendations published by the European structure or a similar one will remain in place post-2019 to overlook the implementation of policies and measures which have been established as part of the NECP.  Given that the legal basis of the Governance Regulation falls primarily within the remit of the Directorate-General for Energy, the Ministry for Energy and Water Management is the lead Ministry  14  in the development of the NECP. The following Ministries, all of which are represented on the IMSC, are considered as important contributors to the drafting of the Plan and have been tasked with providing input to sections falling under their remit.   The Office of the Prime Minister  Ministry for the Environment, Sustainable Development and Climate Change   Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Capital Projects   Ministry for the Economy, Investment and Small Business  Ministry for Finance  Ministry for European Affairs and Equality  Ministry for Education and Employment  Ministry for Justice, Culture and Local Government  Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation Apart from the individual Ministries sitting on the IMSC which are listed above, other national governmental entities are considered as key stakeholders responsible for the implementation of specific sections of national energy and climate policies falling and are also represented on the IMSC.    Technical assistance on the NECP  the use of technical support programmes provided by European Commission services. Malta participated in a oject in which Member States were provided assistance in developing national greenhouse gas projections13. The results and recommendations of this project fed into another Commission project through which technical assistance was provided to six Member States in their development of the Plan14. The scope of this project from DG CLIMA and DG ENERGY was to provide support to Member States in preparing aspects covering climate-related data gaps. Technical assistance was being provided in relation to expert peer-review of the models available at the Malta Resources Authority for the elaboration of projections of GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks for the sectors Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), Agriculture, Land Use, land-use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), and Waste. Malta also benefitted from technical assistance through the  Service (SRSS) contract. As part of the SRSS, the Ministry for Energy and Water Management benefited from the services of experts for a period of 12 months, who assisted with the development of energy models.  The Ministry for Environment15, Sustainable Development and Climate Change applied for Advisory Service concerning the Agricultural Sector.  Technical assistance was provided by E4SMA who focused primarily on the review of the analytical , supporting updating of the NECP modelling framework, development of the Impact Assessment section, as well as on the preparation of terms of reference for the Strategic Environmental Assessment. Support was provided on running the updated and enhanced modelling framework, in particular to conduct a scenario and sensitivity analysis. In relation to the Impact                                                            13 Service request No. 2016/03 under framework contract CLIMA.001/FRA/2015/0014 14 CLIMA/C.2/SER/2017/0002 15 Technical support for the development of the integrated NECP of Malta  15  Assessment, support was provided primarily on section 5.2 (macroeconomic, social, health impacts) and 5.3 (overview of investment needs).  The the beneficiary of which was the Ministry for Environment, Sustainable Development, and Climate Change reviewed the existing and potentially new data providers to establish the most appropriate data streams on improving the agriculture inventory.  1.3 CONSULTATIONS AND INVOLVEMENT OF NATIONAL AND EU ENTITIES AND THEIR OUTCOME  Involvement of Parliament Plan by the Parliament. As outlined in Section 1.2, through Cabinet Decision CAB/90/XIII/17, the IMSC on the NECP was established to ensure a coordinated approach of all Ministries relevant to the development of the Plan. The Cabinet of Ministers has been regularly updated on the status of the national energy and climate policies post-2020, were presented to Cabinet on the 4th December 2018 Commission by the end of 2018.  f Ministers on 3 December 2019, prior to its formal submission to the Commission in December 2019 in line with the requirements of the Governance Regulation.  Involvement of local and regional authorities  st. Local Councils form the most basic form of local government; however, their role is primarily administrative and their involvement in energy and climate policy design is marginal. The Local Government Division at the Ministry for Justice, Culture and Local Government is responsible for assisting the Ministry in the formulation of strategies, policies NECP as part of the formal online public consultation process which took place at the beginning of 2019.  This is further detailed in the section below.  Consultations with stakeholders, social partners, and engagement of civil society and the general public The involvement of local authorities, social partners, civil society organisations, the business community, industry and other stakeholders as well as the general public is considered key under the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union. Article 10 of the Regulation also requires that Member States ensure that the general public is given early and effective opportunities to participate in the preparation of the plans. The process of stakeholder engagement kicked-off early on in the preparatory stages of the draft NECP. The public consultation process was then carried out at the   16  stages:  Early stakeholder consultations (during the drafting stage); and  Online public consultation (after finalization of Draft NECP).    Figure 1 - Public consultation process on the NECP   Early consultations with key stakeholders  Early consultations with key stakeholders were held from April 2018 until October 2018. The aim of consultations with stakeholders such as licensed fuel suppliers, academia and the business and industry community in the early stages of drafting of the NECP was to provide stakeholders with an opportunity to discuss issues of interest and to ensure that sufficient time was provided for the submission of feedback, whether formal or informal, which could then be effectively considered in the preparation of the draft plan. Stakeholders were presented with the legislative background of the EU Regulation and the NECP, and were given an opportunity to comment and provide their views on the beyond. It was highlighted to the stakeholders that the NECP adopts a bottom-up approach and provides each Member State the opportunity to come up with ambitious, but realistic, national   17  Individual meetings were held with the following entities which were considered as key stakeholders  policies:   Building Industry Consultative Council (BICC)  Malta Developers Association (MDA)  Malta Business Bureau (MBB)  Institute for Climate Change and Sustainable Development (University of Malta)  Institute for Sustainable Energy (University of Malta)  Malta College for Arts, Science and Technology (MCAST)  Malta Hotels & Restaurants Association  The Commission for Environment of CURIA (Il-Kummissjoni Ambjent tal-Knisja)  Malta Chamber of Commerce  EneMalta Plc  EneMed Ltd  Liquigas Malta Ltd  Easygas Ltd  Electrogas Ltd Additionally, a number of stakeholders were invited but declined. Public consultation  In order to comply with Article 10 of the Governance Regulation, the second stage of the public 9 and taken into consideration in the Final version of the NECP.  The public consultation process was conducted early in 2019. The process followed the already established national procedure for online public consultations.16 Using a platform administered by the Ministry for European Affairs and Equality, the general public, civil society organisations, trade unions, business organizations, government institutions and the general public are given the opportunity to participate in the online public consultation process. A notice of the consultation period was posted on the website of the Energy & Water Agency, the national entity leading the NECP process, on the  as well as on the MEUSAC website (Malta-EU Steering and Action Committee). Publicity was given due consideration and open consultation notice advertisements were also posted in the major newspaper outlets.   Online public consultation took place during March and April 2019. Written feedback was received via the platform from 13 organisations and/or public citizens. The comments received through the online platform were subsequently analysed and discussed during subsequent meetings of the Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee. Each entity represented on the IMSC was requested to take due account of the comments received falling under its remit and requested to provide feedback on how                                                              16 Online public consultation platform: www.konsultazzjoni.gov.mt  18  Public consultation event on the Draft NECP (April 2019) MEUSAC, together with the Ministry for Energy and Water Management (MEW) and the Ministry for the Environment, Sustainable Development and Climate Change (MESDC) organized a consultation session on the Draft NECP on 4 April 2019. The scope of the consultation session was for stakeholders to provide their views and feedback on the Plan in person. The event was initiated by the chairman of the IMSC tasked with the coordination of the development of the NECP who introduced the topic. All Ministries represented on the IMSC were present for the consultation session. The Energy & Water Agency then provided a presentation highlighting the legislative background, the process for the development of the Draft Plan as well as the main contents and objectives of the plan in the five respective dimensions of the Energy Union. Following the presentation, a discussion ensued and the floor was opened to all attendees for comments, questions and suggestions. The outcome of the public consultation event and the comments received were then also discussed post the event at IMSC level in conjunction with other written feedback received through the online public consultation process. Other consultation processes Apart from the general public consultation on the NECP, a separate public and stakeholder consultation was conducted within the processes of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) on the NECP and the Research & Innovation Strategy for Energy and Water being developed by the Energy & Water Agency.  Stakeholders were consulted throughout the process of the SEA in order to ensure their effective participation. All relevant parties were given the opportunity to provide their opinions on the environmental impacts of the measures proposed in the draft NECP. In order to conform with the national SEA regulation (S.L. 549.61) a statement of adoption and an outline of monitoring measures will be made public. The statement of adoption will include a summary of how environmental considerations have been integrated into the NECP, as well as how the environmental report and the results of the consultations have been taken into account. The statement will also include monitoring measures. It must be pointed out that the timeframes for the development and finalization of the SEA the SEA process was at scoping stage. It is expected that the SEA will be concluded during the course of 2020 and any major recommendations integrated in future NECP updates. Additionally, the Energy & Water Agency is developing an R&I strategy for energy and water covering the period 2021-2030. The development of the strategy included a separate set of stakeholder consultations focused primarily on research institutes, academia, the national authority responsible for research & innovation and other stakeholders. This stakeholder consultation was concluded in October 2019 and will be reflected in more detail in the National R&I Strategy for Energy & Water which will be published in the course of 2020.   of comments, questions and requests for clarifications. As part of the online public consultation process, 13 organisations and/or citizens provided written feedback. The feedback received originated from the general public, the industry, academia, NGOs as well as national authorities and touched  19  upon various subjects linked to all five Energy Union dimensions and issues pertaining to the specificities of Malta. The section hereunder provides a summary of the views of various stakeholders re detailed description of the feedback received during the public consultation phase, as well as specific comments from the Ministries and entities responsible for the development of the NECP can be found in Annex I.  The public provided a number of general and cross-sectoral comments, for example that the NECP did not sufficiently build on top of previous and existing plans and strategies. The NECP is a holistic and integrated plan, which streamlines previous reporting obligations in the fields of energy and climate into one and introduces new reporting obligations in dimensions, such as the internal energy market, energy security and research & innovation and competitiveness. Comments addressing the lack of involvement of NGOs during the preparation of the Draft Plan had also been received.  In the area of climate and GHG emission and reductionslevel of progress towards its ESR target of -regarding the purchasing of allowances to meet this target. The Government was urged to address mitigation and adaptation to climate change in the plan and acknowledge the negative effects of climate change in Malta on the environment, health as well as on energy demand. The question of discussed during the public consultation process. Some of the comments received raised the need for -pays prinsecond highest consumer of energy.  Multiple comments, questions and suggestions were received in the area of renewable energy. The ution and urged the setting of progressive targets for Malta in the area of renewable energy. Other questions were related to the absence of alternative sources of RES, such as wind, off-for the next decade. Malexploit indigenous RES sources within the present technical and geophysical limitations. The relevant circumstances affecting renewable energy deployment are described in section 2.1.2 of the NECP. The incentives in the area of RES and communal solar PV farms were also topics discussed as part of the public consultation process.  In the area of energy efficiency lacks a serious approach in addressing energy efficiency on the demand side as well as the lack of effective incentives for energy savings or to curb energy consumption in the future. Concerns were raised that energy efficiency measures in the commercial sector are not sufficiently addressed and that the Draft Plan missed the opportunity for mobilizing new local markets to invest and propel energy efficiency. Feedback received pointed out that energy efficiency measures in the commercial sector are not sufficiently addressed.  The entities and citizens involved in the public consultation process also raised several issues with respect to the area of buildings, in particular that the area of energy performance of buildings is lightly considered in the Draft NECP. Several suggestions were highlighted, such as possible incentives to promote green rooftops, more stringent enforcement of energy efficiency measures in new buildings, as well as the integration of renewables in new and refurbished buildings in conjunction with the  20  allocation of more space on residential rooftops for the installation of solar water heaters. Some feedback touched upon how NZEB obligations -term Renovation Strategy, which is seen by the public as an opportunity to make the building sector more energy-positive. Increasing the financial discussed.   Some feedback was also received on the internal energy market and security of supply dimensions. Awareness was raised with regards to what was perceived as high security, high ecological, high technological and high governance risks associated to the gas pipeline project. Other citizens and entities raised queries with respect to future plans for a gas distribution network to serve domestic users after the commissioning of the pipeline. The importance of utility battery storage systems for security of supply reasons was also raised during the public consultation process, while other comments and queries received in this area were related to the energy poverty assessment, the necessity to put low-income households at the centre when designing policy, and the functionalities of installed smart meters with respect to providing useful energy consumption information to the consumer.  A relatively large number of comments were received in the area of transport, which plays an important role with respect to Malta reaching its targets in the areas of reducing GHG emissions, energy efficiency as well as renewable energy. Specific comments from participants in the public consultation process addressed the lack of alternative options for public transportation, showed support for a mass-transit system and asked about incentivizing and disincentivizing measures with respect to electric vehicles and ICE vehicles, respectively. Some comments pointed out the necessity the need to encourage the construction of additional walk-lanes and bicycle lanes in Malta. Additional queries were raised with respect to second-hand imports of vehicles, which do not contribute to either an increase in average vehicle efficiency or a reduction in fleet age.    Consultations with other Member States Malta fully appreciates the benefits which may reaped through engagement in regional cooperation and has consulted with relevant neighbouring Member States during the development of the NECP in osition at the edge of the European Union, but connected to the European electricity grid through Italy and in the process of strengthening this interconnection by the development of a gas pipeline between Malta and Sicily, the regional consultation process focused on discussions with Italy.  As part of the regional consultation process, a bilateral meeting was held on 11 September 2019 between key representatives from both Member States. During the meeting a number of different topics relevant to both Member States were discussed, including the possibility of finding common approaches towards similar challenges to meet 2030 EU targets, and how the two sides could , a discussion on the expected developments of the electricity market in Italy and in particular in Sicily, as well progress on the Malta-Sicily gas pipeline project were also held.  21    Iterative process with the European Commission  Discussions for the prepabeing held to discuss best-practices and information relevant for the development of the Plan.  In line with the Governance Regulation, on 18 June 2019 the European Commission published an EU--specific recommendations, as well as accompanying documents with more detailed iThe ten recommendations received by Malta focus primarily on additional domestic measures to achieve the ESR target, increasing the national ambition in the area of renewables, increasing ambition towards reaching energy efficiency targets and completing missing sections of the Plan, such as the Impact Assessment and the R&I dimension. The Recommendations issued to Malta also suggest providing more information on energy subsidies, analysing interactions with air quality policy, as well as making improvements to the overall detail of objectives and policies and measures included in the Plan. In line with Article 34 of the Governance Regulation, Member States have to indicate in the Final Plan how it has taken due account of the recommendation or otherwise provide a justification. The below table includes the list of recommendations and whether they have been addressed or otherwise.  Table 1 - Recommendations on Draft NECP issued to Malta and corresponding justifications Recommendation17  Section in which Recommendation has been addressed/ Justification in case this has not been addressed 1. Plan additional domestic measures, in particular in the building and transport sectors, and quantify their expected impacts, in order to reduce the significant gap to its 2030 greenhouse gas target for sectors not covered by the EU emissions trading system of -19% compared to 2005. For reasons of cost-effectiveness some transfers of annual emission allocation from other Member States, as provided for by Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and Council, could be justified.  Malta is bound to reduce its GHG emissions by mitigation potential, arising from our service-based economy have resultant high mitigation costs coupled with significant socio-economic considerations.  Diseconomies of scale also hinder resorting to alternative technologies.  These challenges have led us to seek the most flexible options available in line with the provisions under the Effort Sharing Regulation, given the limited geographical area, which restricts options for enhancement of land-based carbon sinks.  Nonetheless, the NECP is a live document, which shall be updated with additional, new decarbonisation domestic polices, and measures which Government would decide to embark on, even following the finalisation of its national long-term decarbonisation strategy.                                                            17 Commission recommendation of 18.6.2019. SWD(2019)268. Available online: https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/mt_rec_en.pdf  22  2. Significantly increase the level of ambition for 2030 to a renewable energy share of at least 21 % for renewable energy, as indicated by the formula in Annex II under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 and after due consideration of relevant circumstances and national constraints. Include an indicative trajectory in the final integrated national energy and climate plan that reaches all the reference points pursuant to Article 4(a)(2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 in accordance with that share, in view of the need to increase the level of efforts for reaching this target collectively. Put forward detailed and quantified policies and measures that are in line with the obligations laid down in Directive 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and Council9, to enable a timely and cost-effective achievement of this contribution. Increase the level of ambition in the heating and cooling sector to meet the indicative target included in Article 23 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Provide more detailed measures to meet the transport target in Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Provide more details on the enabling frameworks for renewable self-consumption and renewable energy communities, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. deployment of effective indigenous renewable energy sources and cooperate at regional level where this can lead to benefits to all parties. This overarching policy will be pursued until 2030 with new initiatives launched and tailored to local national constraints affecting the deployment of described in Section 2.1.2.    The indicative RES trajectory, including the three reference points in 2022, 2025 and 2027 are included in section 2.1.2 of the Plan. Additionally, detailed and quantified policies and measures are described in Section 3.1.2.   In line with Article 23 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, Malta shall endeavour to increase its share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector, as outlined in Section 2.2 v .   For the scope of meeting the requirements of Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, Malta intends to consider biofuels from feedstocks listed in Annex IX of the Directive as twice their energy content.   Details on the enabling frameworks for renewable self-consumption is provided in Section 3.1.2.v of the Plan. The Government will continue to promote renewable self-consumption of electricity from Solar PV systems and ensure that no discriminatory charges apply. In view of the foreseen that renewable energy communities will develop. 3. Substantially increase the ambition towards reducing final and primary energy consumption in 2030 in view of the need to increase the level of efficiency target. Propose more ambitious policies and measures that would deliver additional energy savings by 2030. Concrete additional National circumstances affecting primary and final energy consumption and other barriers impede a more ambitious contribution to the population and GDP, corresponding growing demand in the housing market, and the year on year growth in tourist arrivals, have made it  23  energy efficiency measures particularly in the building and transport sectors are needed in order to meet to be proposed for the 2021-2030 period. difficult to restrain an increase in energy consumption. These national circumstances and barriers are described in more detail in Section 2.2 of the NECP.   Policies and measures expected to deliver energy savings by 2030 are outlined in Section 3.2. 4. Specify the measures supporting the energy security objectives on diversification and reduction of energy dependency, including measures ensuring flexibility and possibly the increased role of demand response in the electricity sector.  The Energy Security and Internal Energy Market dimensions in Section 3 have been complemented with further details on measures supporting diversification, reducing energy dependency, contingency planning in the area of security of supply as well as measures intended to increase the flexibility of the energy system. Preventive and emergency measures under the Gas Security of Supply Regulations have also been outlined.  5. Further elaborate national objectives and funding targets in research, innovation and competitiveness, specifically related to the Energy Union, to be achieved between now and 2030, so that they are readily measurable and fit for purpose to support the implementation of targets in the other dimensions of the integrated national energy and climate plan. Underpin such objectives with specific and adequate policies and measures, including those to be developed in cooperation with other Member States, such as the Strategic Energy Technology Plan. Malta is in the process of developing a Research & Innovation Strategy in the areas of energy and water management for 2021-2030. This strategy will identify key thematic areas for R&I over the coming decade, reflecting national policies and objectives for the energy and water sectors. This strategy will form the basis of the fifth dimension R&I in energy are specified in Section 2.5, while policies and measures to reach these targets are highlighted in Section 3.5 of the Plan.  6. Further improve the level of detail of the objectives and policies and measures of the final integrated national energy and climate plan notably to set clear, measureable and forward-looking objectives for the internal market dimension and research, innovation and competitiveness dimensions; and illustrate to what extent the envisaged plans of petroleum exploration are in line with longer-term decarbonisation goals. As outlined above, the level of detail of objectives and policies and measures in the dimension of research & innovation and competitiveness was strengthened by the development and inclusion of aspects of the National Strategy for R&I in Energy and Water for 2021  2030 in the NECP.   National objectives for Malta in the internal energy market dimension reflect the specific such as its size, having a sole supplier of electricity and the absence of a liquid wholesale market or electricity transmission system. The electricity interconnection level is expected to remain well above the Union 15% target throughout the whole projection period, reaching 24% in 2030.  24  Objectives for transmission infrastructure and market integration are therefore confined by these realities. Nevertheless, objectives, policies and measures are described within the relevant dimension of the Plan. An ongoing Electricity Supply Study will provide more details on future energy system solutions.  Apart from the increasing deployment of renewable energy sources, Malta has no indigenous energy sources that would provide a secure energy supply and is therefore dependent on imported fuels and electricity over the interconnector to meet its energy demand. Although the Government will continue to promote petroleum exploration opportunities, these should not be considered in contradiction to the long-term decarbonisation goals of the EU and its Member States, which stand at the forefront of the National Energy and Climate Plans.  7. Complement the mainly qualitative references to some of the projected investment needs, expenditures and funding sources, with further quantification in order to obtain a comprehensive assessment of overall investment needs to achieve the objectives, as well as information on the national and Union financial sources to be mobilised. Section 5 (Impact Assessment) was not completed The Impact Assessment, including section 5.3 on an overview of investment needs and expenditures was conducted during the course of the therefore features in the Final NECP. Section 5.3 includes an overview of the projected costs borne by the Government until 2030 as well as the expected costs borne by the citizens as a result of the implementaand measures.  8. List all energy subsidies, including in particular for fossil fuels, and actions undertaken as well as plans to phase them out. plans to phase out any energy subsidies at this particular juncture, while remaining committed to, inter alia, encourage the adoption of technologies that can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.    More Information can be found in Sections 3.1.3.iv and 4.6.iv.  9. Complement the analysis of the interactions with air quality and air emissions policy, presenting and quantifying the impacts on air pollution for the various scenarios, providing A quantification of the impacts of implementing the WPM scenario on air pollution is provided in Section 5.1.i. of the NECP. A link is made between  25  underpinning information, and considering synergies and trade-off effects. Control Programme.  10. Integrate just and fair transition aspects better, notably by providing more details on social, employment and skills impacts of planned objectives, policies and measures. An impact assessment conducted for the purpose of completing Section 5.2 focuses on several criteria, such as the economic impact, technical constraints, social acceptability, legal and regulatory barriers and quality of life with respect to the implementation of policies under the WPM scenario. This assessment  shall ensure that policies and measures are well balanced and conductive of a just and fair transition.  1.4  REGIONAL COOPERATION IN PREPARING THE PLAN  Elements subject to joint or coordinated planning with other Member States joint and coordinated planning with other Member States within the framework for the development of the NECP. Nevertheless, Malta considers regional cooperation as a key element of its NECP. Regional cooperation focuses primarily in the Energy Security dimension of the plan, with the gas pipeline interconnection to the European Gas network being the predominant cross-border cooperation project in the foreseeable future. Cooperation on this project at government level, in technical and environmental studies and in permitting procedures is explained in more detail throughout the relevant sections of the Energy Security dimension and specifically under Section 3.3.ii. Regional cooperation is also considered within the area of contingency planning under the Energy Security dimension, such as the efforts made in the Gas Coordination Group. Malta is also open to future regional cooperation in the area of RES projects were these provides tangible benefits to all parties involved.  Explanation of how regional cooperation is considered in the plan Aspects related to regional cooperation are considered in more detail within each individual dimension under Section 3. As referred to in the point (i) above, regional cooperation is considered primarily within the framework of the ongoing cooperation on the Malta-Sicily gas pipeline.
