3.4 Internal energy market dimension 3.4.1 Electricity infrastructure i. Policy and measures to achieve the targeted level of interconnection established in Article 4(d) The 15% interconnection target has already been achieved. Interconnection with Germany, Belgium and Denmark will be expanded between now and 2030. We do not consider a higher, generic interconnection target to be of use. The added value of additional interconnection differs per border. Levels of price differences between regions are the most significant indicator of the expected added value of new investments in interconnection. Efforts to make more efficient use of existing interconnection or the achievement of better cross-border agreements are valid alternatives to new, physical interconnection. In this context, the Netherlands, as a participating country in the Pentalateral, has actively contributed to the implementation of the flow-based market coupling system. In principle, the Netherlands is in favour of new interconnectors, on the condition that the socio-economic and ecological cost-benefit analyses indicate positive outcomes. ii. Regional cooperation in this field Regional cooperation with neighbouring countries is based on the optimisation of flows and capacity through so-called flow-based market coupling. This cooperation takes place between the countries of the Pentalateral Energy Forum. In addition, grid operators collaborate by sharing information through RSCs (Regional Security Coordinators). Grid operators work closely when planning infrastructure projects (through ten-year development plans), including through the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E). In the context of the new market design, there are proposals to expand the role and tasks of the RSCs. iii. If applicable, financing measures in this area at the national level, including European Union support and the use of EU funds. Infrastructure projects of common interest may, under certain conditions, be eligible for funds from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). In addition, the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) is available through the European Investment Bank (EIB). Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030     3.4.2 Infrastructure for energy transmission i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.2, including any specific measures to enable the delivery of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and other key infrastructure projects In the field of electricity, investments are being made to increase the domestic capacity of the national grid. The Randstad 380 kV Noordring grid project will be completed in 2019. Various related sub-projects have already been completed. Furthermore, expansion of the grid capacity in the north-west of the Netherlands is being prepared (the Noord-West 380 kV project), given that the Eemshaven region is an important production location and has also become a major switch point in the international electricity network. In addition, the Zuid-West 380 kV grid project aims to resolve existing bottlenecks in this part of the country. With regard to the connection of the offshore wind farms, TenneT's approach includes standard platforms whereby 700 MW of wind energy capacity can be connected per platform. The Dutch electricity market is linked to five neighbouring countries. In the next ten years, interconnection capacity is expected to double from 5.55 GW in 2016 to 10.8 GW in 2025. Key projects in this regard include laying the COBRA cable to Denmark, for 0.7 GW (fully operational by the end of 2020) and an increase in the interconnection capacity with Belgium from 2 GW to 3.4 GW. A new, large-scale nitrogen plant will be constructed to improve Dutch gas transmission and distribution infrastructure, which will allow five to seven billion mÂ³ of high-calorific gas to be converted into low-calorific gas each year. The government took the decision to construct the nitrogen plant at the end of March 2018, to allow the decrease in production from the Groningen field to be compensated by importing high-calorific gas. The plan is for the plant to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2022 (Gasunie, 2018). The energy transition legislative agenda includes the following laws: The Electricity Act 1998 (Elektriciteitswet 1998), the Gas Act (Gaswet), the Heat Act (Warmtewet), the Offshore Wind Energy Act (Wet windenergie op zee) and the Mining Act (Mijnbouwwet). The purpose of this legislative agenda is to prepare these acts for the transition to a low CO2 energy supply through a series of clear and coherent steps, in which reliability, affordability and security are guaranteed. The Coalition Agreement indicates that the main points of the agreements in the field of climate and energy policy will be embedded in a Climate Agreement. ii. Regional cooperation in this field Continuation of existing cooperation through the Pentalateral Energy Forum and the Pentalateral Gas Platform. See Chapter 1.4 iii. If applicable, financing measures in this area at a national level, including European Union support and the use of EU funds Not applicable.  3.4.3 Market integration i. Policy and measures related to the elements in point 2.4.3 We recognise the need for greater flexibility in relation to a further increase of intermittent sources in the electricity system. The Netherlands will organise market regulation in the coming years via the legislative agenda, so that flexibility (also for small consumers) can be increased even further and small consumers get better access to the market and are rewarded in accordance with the market. To this end small consumers could be supplied with an aggregator. The Netherlands will focus on rolling out smart meters (target: 80% by 2020) to allow consumers to respond to real-time prices    more effectively.95 Dynamic tariffs are becoming increasingly popular on the retail market as well. There is already a high degree of flexibility in the system, thanks, for example, to large-scale consumers, which are flexible and can respond to real-time prices by connecting, calibrating or disconnecting, and parties with storage assets that offer them on the different markets. With the Top Sector Energy (TSE), systems integration and flexibility are increasingly coming under the spotlight and attracting financial support for research (innovation). What's more, the TSO is running diverse pilots using bundled/aggregated storage of small-scale storage equipment, such as home batteries and electric cars. The Independent Grid Management Act (Wet Onafhankelijk Netbeheer) guarantees the independence of grid operation, to facilitate fair competition on supply and wholesale markets and to enhance the systems' reliability. Competition between various providers on the energy market benefits the degree of affordability. In addition, the system of "programme responsibility" or balance responsibility ensures that suppliers and consumers themselves maintain the balance of supply and demand on the energy market. They receive an economic incentive to implement the deliveries and purchases agreed. This system, combined with an effective and efficient market-based imbalance market, guarantees the balance of the system. As such, this system will continue to form the basis of the Dutch market design. Moreover, the Dutch market system has no regulated price ceilings and the technical price limits for the imbalance market are so high that they ensure market parties are optimally encouraged to remain in balance. External studies recognise that this leaves the Netherlands with a highly effective and efficient market system for electricity.96 ii. Measures to increase the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy generation A number of areas of improvement have been identified in this area, but the obstacles to the measures referred to here are generally minor. The most significant measure to make the energy system more flexible involves amending the regulatory framework in the proposed legislative agenda. We recognise the need for greater flexibility in relation to a further increase of intermittent sources in the electricity system. We will organise market regulation in the coming years via our legislative agenda, so that flexibility (also for small consumers) can be increased further and small consumers get better access to the market and are rewarded in accordance with the market. To this end, small consumers get better access to the short-term electricity market and are supplied with an aggregator. This is pursuant to the new Electricity Directive. The possibility of two meters for a single connection currently already exists and allows multiple suppliers to provide a variety of services.97 Dynamic tariffs are expected to become increasingly popular on the retail market; the relevant legislation is not an obstacle in this regard. The system already offers a high degree of flexibility, but this is not earmarked as such (bulk users that are flexible already respond to real-time prices and use their assets to bid on the various markets, but this is not measured separately; this is inherent to the market). Within the Top Sector Energy (TSE), system integration and flexibility are increasingly coming under the spotlight and attracting financial support for research (innovation), as in the case of seasonal storage and conversion. iii. Measures to ensure non-discriminatory participation of energy from renewable sources, demand response and storage, in all energy markets There is no discrimination regarding the participation of energy from renewable sources. Priority access and dispatching/redispatching of these sources is determined by law, in accordance with European obligations.                                                  95 Stimulating Renewable Energy Production - Parliamentary document 31 239, no. 263. 96 Frontier Economics (2015) Scenarios for the Dutch electricity supply system; IEA (2014) Energy policies of IEA. 97 Legislative agenda, Parliamentary document II, 2017-2018, 30 196, no. 566. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030     iv. Policy and measures to protect consumers and to improve the competitiveness and competitive pressure of the energy market In general, the Dutch government strives to establish frameworks for the electricity market that encourage fair competition between market parties and do not discriminate against any one party, including parties that offer renewable energy, demand response and storage, including through aggregation. The regulatory authority monitors developments on the small consumer market on an annual basis. The Dutch retail market is highly competitive with relatively high switch percentages (16%). Last year, some 1.3 million households switched to a new supplier. A supply licence must be requested to supply small consumers. The NRA monitors these licences. The licence obligations are regulated, for example, by Chapter 8 of the Electricity Act 1998 and include an assessment of how reasonable the tariffs are. Since mid-2018, 59 providers operate on the Dutch retail market with a licence to supply electricity and/or gas to small consumers. Dutch consumers are also protected against disconnection in the winter months and in the event a supplier goes bankrupt. As described above, the Netherlands has a licence system for supplying energy to small consumers. If a supply licence is revoked, for example, due to bankruptcy, the customers of the supplier concerned would theoretically have to be disconnected immediately if they had not taken any action themselves. After all, these customers would no longer have a valid supply contract because they may only be supplied by a licence holder. In practice, these types of quick disconnections are socially undesirable. Therefore, first and foremost, rules and regulations on this matter include the possibility for the licence holder to sell part or the entire customer base to one or more other licence holders prior to the actual withdrawal of the supply licence. If the licence holder is unsuccessful, in part or otherwise, the remaining small consumers who stand to lose their provider upon the withdrawal of the supply licence will be divided between the other licensed providers. As such, all providers who supply small consumers on the market collectively function as an emergency supplier. This scheme applies both to electricity98 and to gas99. The national grid operators for electricity (TenneT) and gas (GTS) respectively play a major and coordinating role in this regard. v. Description of measures to enable and develop demand response, including those that support dynamic pricing We recognise the need for greater flexibility, including through demand response, in relation to a further increase of intermittent sources in the electricity system. The Netherlands will organise market regulation in the coming years via the legislative agenda, so that demand response (also for small consumers) can be increased even further and small consumers get better access to the market and are rewarded in accordance with the market. To this end small consumers could be supplied with an aggregator. The Netherlands will continue rolling out smart meters, to allow consumers to respond more effectively to real-time prices. Dynamic tariffs are expected to become increasingly popular on the retail market; the legislation is not an obstacle in this regard.100  3.4.4 Energy poverty A fair sharing of the burden Citizens and companies are confronted in various ways with the burdens and benefits that come from energy and climate policy. Citizens can observe the effects if they take measures in their house or when purchasing a car. They notice the effects of increased or reduced energy and car taxes or, if they make use of subsidies. Indirectly, they notice the effects through charges passed on in product prices of the costs that companies incur and the required tax revenue for the purpose of paying out subsidies. For many companies, the emission of CO2, due to pricing both nationally and via the ETS, becomes more expensive. On the other hand, the option of clean technology, encouraged by subsidies, is made more appealing. Climate policy is accompanied by burdens for citizens and businesses. The government wants the transition to be feasible and affordable for everyone. This begins with keeping the total costs of the transition as low as possible. The national costs do not provide insight into which costs are borne by whom or demonstrate the ultimate burden implications.                                                  98 Security of Supply for Electricity Decree, Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 2006, 104. 99 Security of Supply for Gas Act Decree, Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 2004, 170. 100Stimulating Renewable Energy Production - Parliamentary document 31 239, no. 263.    When analysing the draft climate agreement, the CPB provided the first comprehensive insight into the burden implications (collective and non-EMU relevant costs) and the income implications of the total climate and energy policy for households based on all the policy instruments used. This analysis revealed that the main driver of the rise in burdens (including collective) as a result of climate and energy policy is caused by the increasing ODE (Surcharge for Sustainable Energy) tax for citizens and companies, used to fund the subsidisation of CO2-reducing techniques. In order to achieve a fair distribution of burdens between citizens and businesses, the government has opted to take measures that spare households in relative terms compared to businesses. From 1 January 2020, the distribution of the Surcharge for Sustainable Energy (ODE) will be adjusted from 50/50 to one third/two thirds, in favour of households. As a result, companies will contribute more to the subsidies for sustainability than in the past. With the design of the ODE sliding-scale, companies with relatively low consumption are relatively spared. It usually concerns SMEs with an energy consumption up to the first and second brackets of the energy tax. Due to the measures, the larger business community will bear a greater share of the burden of energy and climate policy. At the same time, the government does not want business and jobs to disappear from the Netherlands without global CO2 reduction being achieved (due to "leakage" of activities and therefore of CO2 abroad). The national CO2 levy for industry is designed as a sensible levy by applying the levy to the avoidable part of the CO2 emission. This achieves a balance between reaching the target in the industry and maintaining an attractive business climate, in which industry can become the most CO2 efficient in Europe. Income implications for households The income implications for households resulting from climate policy are limited, but if policy were to remain unchanged, they would follow a negative trajectory, as the CPB analysis revealed in March 2019. In response to the CPB analysis of the budgetary effects, the burden and income implications and the burden sharing of the draft Climate Agreement, the government has taken a number of measures that relate to an adjustment in the burden sharing of energy and climate policy. As a result of the ODE sliding-scale, the burden sharing between households and companies in the ODE has been adjusted in favour of households. This provides a substantial reduction in the burden on households compared to the previous analysis by the CPB. Household burdens are further limited by a higher tax reduction on the energy bill. The government is structurally allocating funds for this purpose. The reduction in the tax component of the energy bill is designed in such a way that the lowest income groups benefit most. With the announced measures, the tax component of the energy bill for a household with average consumption101 decreases by 100 euros in 2020 compared to 2019, the tax component of the energy bill does not rise in 2021 and the increase after 2021 is limited. Measures in the mobility sphere have also been adjusted. Anyone who is currently unable or unwilling to make the transition to an electric vehicle will not end up paying for this incentive. The government examines the development of the purchasing power of households every year in August. In the event there are major policy changes, attention is paid to income implications (including partial) resulting from policy. Insofar as this concerns climate policy, this will (also) be reported in the Climate Memorandum.                                                  101 1,179 mÂ³ natural gas and 2,525 kWh electricity (in accordance with the Analysis of energy bill development (PBL), 18 March 2019).
