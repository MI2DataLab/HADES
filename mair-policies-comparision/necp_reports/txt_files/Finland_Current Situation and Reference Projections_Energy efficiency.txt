4.3 Dimension energy efficiencyi. Current primary and final energy consumption in the economy and per sector (including industry, residential, service and transport)ii. Current potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and coolingiii. Projections considering existing energy efficiency policies, measures and programmes as described in point 1.2.(ii) for primary and final energy consumption for each sector at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)142iv. Cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements resulting from national calculations, in accordance with to Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EUIn the WEM projection, the primary energy consumption in 2030 is 411 TWh and the final consumption of energy 297 TWh. A sector-specific examination of the WEM projection shows that the final energy consumption in 2030 would be about 147 TWh for industry, 59 TWh for households, 37 TWh for the service sector, 45 TWh for transport and 8 TWh for other sectors together. Final energy consumption figures exclude distribution losses and power plants™ own use. There is no estimation of primary energy consumption by sector. Figure 12 shows historical development 2005Œ2017 and projections until 2040 for total primary energy consumption and final energy consumption for each sector.05010015020025030035040045020052010201520202025203020352040TWhIndustryResidentialTransportServicesOther ˜nal consumptionPrimary energy consumptionFigure 12.    Historical development of primary energy and final energy consumption by sector between 2005 and 2017 and the projected development based on current policies until 2030 and an outlook until 2040.Finland™s cumulative energy savings target, based on this average, for the period 2021˝2030 is 105 TWhcum. The wording ﬁsupplied toﬂ in the definition of EED Article 2(3), has been taken into account by deducting house or auxiliary loads of electricity, steam and heat from Eurostat FEC2020˝2030 data. Finland intends 143to keep implementing the ongoing national energy efficiency measures. These include energy efficiency agreements, energy advice for consumers, promotion of deployment of heat pumps in detached and terraced houses, energy audit activities (in addition to the compulsory audit in the EED) and promotion of investments in heating plants. They are all together estimated to result in total cumulative savings of 153 TWhcum as explained in Table 7 in Chapter 2.2.Efficient cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling operate in open energy markets and compete with other generation, heating or cooling methods. District heating and cooling are built especially in towns, cities and densely inhabited municipalities. In these areas, a significant part of the heated building stock has been connected to district heating. Statistics indicate that 90 % of apartment blocks, 30 % of industrial buildings and more than 60 % of other buildings use district heating. The share in single-family houses is about 10 %. District heating has a total market share of 38 %. In 2017, sales of district heating were 33.2 TWh. With temperature correction, consumption equals 35.7 TWh. The consumption of district heating is projected to be 34 TWh in 2025 and just over 33 TWh in 2030.In 2017, district cooling was sold by nine companies and the sales of district cooling amounted to 220 GWh. In 2030, sales of district cooling are projected to be 490 GWh
