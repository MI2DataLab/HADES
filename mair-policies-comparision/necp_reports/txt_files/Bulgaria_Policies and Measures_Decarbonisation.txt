3.1 Decarbonisation Dimension 3.1.1 GHG emissions and removals i. Policy measures to achieve the target set under Regulation (EU) 2018/842 as referred in point 2.1.1 and policy measures to comply with Regulation (EU) 2018/841, covering all key emitting sectors and sectors for the enhancement of removals, with an outlook to the long-term vision and goal to become a low emission economy and achieving a balance between emissions and removals in accordance with the Paris Agreement  The INECP scenario envisages a limited number of decarbonisation specific measures. The existing and planned measures in the energy sector, which generates most GHG emissions, will have a major contribution to decarbonisation. Existing measures for decarbonisation will be extended until 2030 and will complement the measures supporting RES sector transformation and other dimensions of the Energy Union, notably energy efficiency, the internal market and energy security, which are described in detail 2021 will include measures which ,coupled with the main target, could have a positive impact on GHG emissions reduction targets. The strategic documents concerned include   91  the National Integrated Transport Programme with a time horizon until 2030 and the National Air Pollution Control Programme 20202030. Additional information about planned policy measures in the transport sector is also expected to become available. The relevant sector specific policy measures are listed below.  Transport sector The main objectives of GHG emissions reduction policy in the transport sector are to:  boost the production of electric and other environmentally friendly vehicles;  boost the use of/demand for new environmentally friendly vehicles;  accelerated deployment of the infrastructure for charging electric and hybrid cars;  promote research and development in the area of environmentally friendly vehicles and toll systems;  organise awareness campaigns and build stakeholder capacity for development of resilient mobility. Integrated Transport Strategy by 2030 The Strategy outlines the main areas for development of the national transport system in the period until 2030. It defines three strategic objectives that cover 9 strategic priorities, each comprising a framework of targets (tasks). Based on this, it identifies the most appropriate measures to achieve the objectives concerned. The strategic objectives of the transport policy by 2030 are as follows:  increase the efficiency and competitiveness of the transport sector;  improve transport connectivity and accessibility (both internal and external);  reduce the adverse effects of transport sector development. The strategic priorities in transport development are as follows:  effective maintenance, modernisation and development of transport infrastructure;  improved management of the transport system;  development of intermodal transport;  improved conditions for application of the principles of transport market liberalisation;  reduced fuel consumption and increased energy efficiency in transport;  improved connectivity of the Bulgarian transport system with the single European transport area;  ensuring quality and accessible transport in all regions of the country;   92   limiting the negative impact of transport on environment and human health;  strengthening the security and safety of the transport system. A National Transport Model developed for passenger and freight transport and applicable to individual modes of transport in the country, international transport and transit transport was prepared as part of the strategy. Promoting sustainable urban mobility The measures in the transport sector with immediate effect are as follows:  rehabilitation and modernisation of the existing road infrastructure to ensure optimum speed and optimum mode of operation of car engines;  implementing smart transport systems in the national and urban road networks;  increasing the share of public electric transport: rail, trolleybus, tram, and underground;  boost the development and construction of intermodal terminals for combined transport;  increase the share of biofuels. Intelligent transport systems (ITS) cover a wide range of technical solutions intended to improve transport by improving mobility and increasing traffic safety. Telematics (a combination of telecommunications and informatics) uses state-of-the-art technologies to meet transport needs. Intelligent transport systems and telematic solutions help improve road safety, boost the efficiency of the existing infrastructure and contribute to reducing pollution by means of traffic control and traffic flow management.  Intelligent transport systems in urban conditions can include integrated management of public transport charges, advanced management of customer relations, traffic forecasts, improved traffic management, information on passengers and collection of road tolls. These systems apply modern technologies for gathering more and better data, for analysing said data and for connection through more efficient networks. The outcome is more efficient and effective traffic with a stronger focus on customers. The measures will be financed by EU funds, complemented by public co-financing from the budgets of central and local government, and in some cases the green investment scheme and private investments. The following schemes are implemented within the framework of the Climate Investment Programme: - Scheme for the improvement of energy efficiency of buildings and other sites (Energy Efficiency Scheme, EES); - Scheme promoting the use of electric vehicles (Electric Vehicles Scheme, EVS). Road toll system    93  The Road Infrastructure Agency will introduce an electronic toll system for motor vehicles in 2019. From 1 January 2019 motor vehicles up to 3.5 tonnes will have to buy an e-vignette to use road infrastructure and will be charged on a time basis. The new policy measures to be introduced and existing policy measures in the transport sector are as follows:   Upgrading the car fleet in Bulgaria by adopting legislation that allows solely the import of vehicles that comply with EURO 4 and higher emission standards in line with the National Air Pollution Control Programme 2020-2030.  Establishing Low-emission zones (LEZ) in large urban agglomerations to limit the demand for drivers of passenger vehicles that conform to the EURO and EURO 1 emissions standard (diesel vehicles) and enable access to city centres in accordance with the National Air Pollution Control Programme 2020-2030.  Promotion of the use of hybrid electric vehicles in line with the Third National Climate Change Action Plan (the measure should be promoted beyond 2030) and the strategic plans submitted by the Ministry of Transport;  Fiscal policy incentives for the economy aiming to limit the consumption of conventional fuels in n line with the Third National Climate Change Action Plan 2013-2020 (the measure should be promoted beyond 2030).  Decreasing the volume of freight transported by road at a distance of more than 300 km by diverting it to more environmentally-friendly modes of transport, such as rail transport, in line with the Third National Climate Change Action Plan 2013-2020 (the measure should be extended beyond 2030) and the strategic plans submitted by the Ministry of Transport;  Facilitating the informed choice of motor vehicles to increase the number of vehicles that conform to higher emission standards (corresponding to EURO 4, 5 or 6).  Industry sector The measures in the industry sector aim to achieve:  higher energy efficiency and lower heat losses in the industry sector;  increased use of natural gas in industry through new gas infrastructure  use of alternative fuels;  creating a technological park by introducing incentives to encourage the private sector to invest in research and development and in innovation in widely used production methods aimed at optimum resource efficiency;  promoting the exchange of good practices between enterprises in reference to efficient use of inputs in production.   94   Systems for monitoring of energy use in industry  Energy efficiency audits and implementation of the measures prescribed In addition to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, EU law on industrial emissions (integrated prevention and control of pollution), the reduction of fluorinated greenhouse gases and the control of substances that deplete the ozone layer also contribute to lowering GHG emissions and air pollutants. Agriculture sector The Agricultural Producers Support Act (ZPZP) governs State support for agricultural producers with regard to the measures included in the National Plan for Development of Agriculture and Rural Areas. Support is provided to agricultural producers operating and registered in disadvantaged areas or areas covered by the Natura 2000 network. The ZPZP specifies some of the activities through which the measures intended for the agricultural sector and those related to the production of biofuels can be implemented. It also establishes the main financial mechanism for the management of agricultural activities. Most of the proposals for restoration of damaged farm areas or for introduction of water-saving irrigation technologies, regardless of whether in relation to the introduction of best practices for rice production or the promotion of crop rotation, particularly with nitrogen-fixing crops, can be implemented through the financial mechanisms established by the ZPZP. According to the Agricultural Land Protection Act the intended use of farmland may be altered only in certain special cases. The burning of stubble and other crop residues in agricultural land is prohibited. The tenants of farmland are responsible for the burning of stubble and other crop residues in agricultural land and must participate in putting out the fires. The owners and tenants of farmland are entitled to tax and credit reliefs when they fulfil mandatory restriction of farmland use and implement projects for restoration and improvement of farmland fertility. The legal framework established by the Act covers some of the activities intended for the agriculture sector, such as tackling the burning of stubble and crop residues and promotion of agricultural practices aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The measures set out in the Third National Climate Change Action Plan 2013-2020 aim to lower emissions from all main sources of emissions in the sector. The measures are in line with the situation in the sector and the top CAP priorities for the period from 2014 to 2020. One of the major challenges facing the CAP is to find a solution to the increasingly deteriorating production conditions in agriculture due to climate change and the need for the farmers to reduce their share of greenhouse gases and play an active role in climate change mitigation, and to supply energy from renewable sources. Based on the analysis of the main sources of emissions in agriculture, the following two main objectives are set:   95   to reduce and/or optimise the emissions in the agriculture sector;  to raise the awareness of both farmers and administration regarding actions and their impact on climate change. The following priorities relate to these main objectives:  Reducing farmland emissions.  Reducing methane emissions from biological fermentation in livestock breeding.  Improving manure management.  Optimising the use of plant residues in agriculture.  Improving the management of rice fields and rice production technologies.  Improving the knowledge of farmers and the administration of the methods for emissions reduction in the agriculture sector. The measures set out in the Third National Climate Change Action Plan with an implementation horizon beyond 2030 and the National Air Quality Control Programme 2020-2030 include:  Incentives for the use of crop rotation with a focus on nitrogen-fixing crops;  Management of degraded agricultural land through: o biological re-cultivation using grasses that are indigenous to the area; and o anti-corrosion measures and soil erosion methods;  introducing irrigation and water and energy saving technologies, promoting extensive farming;  implementing measures to reduce methane emissions from biological fermentation in livestock breeding;  Improving manure use and management;  introducing low-emission livestock manure processing practices, i.e. composting and anaerobic conversion of livestock manure into biogas;  raising awareness and improving the knowledge of agricultural producers of the possible use of vegetable residues and the risks of after-crop burning;  implementing Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) rules to control the ammonia emissions released into the air from agricultural sources in accordance with the ECE Framework Advisory Code of Good Agricultural Practice for Reducing Ammonia Emissions: o good practices for manure application / use of low-emissions livestock manure and more rigorous application of the Nitrates Directive) o good practices for the management of livestock manure.  Waste management sector The following measures set out in the Third National Climate Change Action Plan 2013-2020 will continue to be implemented and will be further developed until 2030:   96    waste in municipalities;  biogas capture and burning in all new and existing regional landfills;  biogas capture in old municipal landfills scheduled for closure;  assessing the energy potential of biogas from the landfills scheduled for closure;  introducing anaerobic sludge stabilisation through biogas capture and incineration in new installations and installations undergoing reconstruction in agglomerations of more than 20 000 population equivalent;  constructing municipal biodegradable waste recovery facilities with capacity for energy generation and the production of compost;  introducing differentiated charges for generated waste. The main targets for the Waste sector are set out in detail in the National Waste Management Plan 2014-2020 and in the detailed programmes and measures put in place to ensure its implementation. The plan and the respective programmes will be updated and in the period 20212030 efforts will continue with greater intensity to ensure achieve the targets set. The main targets envisage a significant increase of the share of potential for waste management improvement and prevention of waste generation. The implementation of the following programmes of measures is expected to continue as part of the implementation of the national plan:  National Programme for the prevention of waste generation;  Programme for achievement of the targets for preparation for re-use and recycling of paper, metal, plastic and glass municipal waste;  Programme for achievement of the targets for biodegradable waste;  Programme for achievement of the targets for recycling and recovery of ordinary waste;  Programme for improvement of the hierarchy for the management of other waste flows and reducing the environmental effects of landfills. More efforts will be focused on the implementation of the programme for achieving the targets and requirements for biodegradable waste. Achievement of the quantitative targets for waste separation, recycling and recovery of municipal waste. The goal is to reduce the share of biodegradable waste and limit the quantity of biodegradable waste going to landfill and to expand and upgrade existing landfills. Energy sector  Most of the measures with an impact on decarbonisation intended for the energy sector are included in the sections on renewable sources, energy efficiency, the internal   97  market and energy security below because the changes in these dimensions lead to overall GHG emissions reduction. In addition to the measures set out in the sections below, there are a number of additional measures with an indirect positive impact on reducing GHG emissions. All of the following measures from the Third National Climate Change Action Plan 2013-2020 are assumed to have been extended until 2030:  Reconstruction of district heating cogeneration systems and boilers with natural gas turbines;  Reducing losses in distribution and transmission networks;  Reducing losses in heat transmission networks;  Transition from coal to natural gas;  Increasing high efficiency cogeneration;  Increasing the share of heating and cooling from renewable sources;  Improving the generation efficiency of the existing coal power plants. Summary of the policies and measures in the household sector and the public sector  Household gasification;  Installation of solar collectors;  Implementation of the measures of the Accelerated Gasification Programme (PAG) in Bulgaria;  Renovation up to the annual percentage set for public and State-owned buildings (with a total floor area exceeding 250 square metres) after the entry into force of the energy efficiency directive;  Introducing a binding energy efficiency scheme (reducing fuel and energy consumption in final energy consumption);  Earlier entry into force of the Eco-design Regulation (2015/1185) and introducing mandatory accelerated discontinuation of the use traditional polluting heating devices (stoves) in line with the National Air Pollution Control Programme 2020-2030;  Introducing a national standard for the quality of fuels used in heating systems, surrogate measures to lower humidity in firewood used in municipalities that do not meet air quality criteria (PM10) and, tentatively, of a standard for the maximum humidity in firewood in line with the National Air Pollution Control Programme 20202030;  [Providing support to] the households affected by the mandatory discontinuation of the use of traditional burning stoves in the transition to heating systems fired by natural gas (reconnection and building new network extensions), district heating (reconnection and building new network extensions) or heating devices that conform to eco-design requirements in line with the National Air Pollution Control Programme 20202030;    98  The use of fuels other than conventional fuels for primary energy production requires parallel implementation of the following measures:  Development and adoption of a national analysis of the potential for the sustainable biomass from all sectors (incl. but not limited to forests and agriculture) and relevant sustainability criteria, taking into account the sustainability criteria set out in Directive (EU) 2018/2001;  Alignment between strategic documents relating to the management and use of forests. When reviewing, updating and developing strategic documents, ensure that the documents concerned are consistent with each other and with the INECP. The strategic documents subject to review, updating or alignment with the INECP may include: the Forestry Sector Report, the Annex to the Action Plan to BulgNational Strategy for Development of the Forestry Sector, the National Action Plan for Energy from Forest Biomass, and the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy;  Alignment between strategic documents relating to the agricultural sector. When reviewing, updating and developing strategic documents, ensure that the relevant documents are consistent with each other and with the INECP. The strategic documents to be reviewed, updated and aligned with the INECP may also include plans for the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy in the period after 2020;  Alignment between strategic documents relating to the waste sector. When reviewing, updating and developing strategic documents, ensure that the relevant documents are consistent with each other and with the INECP. The strategic documents to come up for review, update and alignment with the INECP may include: The Waste Management Plan and the respective implementing programmes thereto, such as the Programme for achievement of biodegradable waste targets, including biological waste targets and the Programme for improvement of the hierarchy for the management of other waste flows and reducing the environmental effects of landfill for the period after 2020. The implementation of the additional measures set out above is expected to have a positive impact on primary energy production and on LULUCF sectors.  Land use, land use change and forestry sector Forestry Act  Forest activities are subject to planning. Forest planning is implemented at three levels and includes a National Strategy for Development of the Forestry Sector, a strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector and regional plans for forest development and forest plans and programmes.   99  The forest management plans and programmes define a maximum permitted level of use of forest resources to achieve the forest management objectives over a period of 10 years. The ZG prohibits any reduction in the total percentage of forest land in the country. Land use change in forest areas is possible only in a limited number of specific cases. National Strategy for Development of the Forestry Sector in the Republic of Bulgaria 20132020 The strategic document is based on EU and national policies and strategic documents relating to forests and forestry in Bulgaria, the main principles and analyses relating to the Bulgarian forestry sector conducted between 2006 and 2011, the vision, mission and objectives, the priorities and measures, and the sources of financing to achieve the objectives of the strategy and the monitoring of its implementation. Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector 20142023 (SPRGS) The plan was developed with grant assistance from the European Social Fund for project  a guarantee for effective management and Capacity.  The implementation of the operational objectives within the relevant budget, the timetable, the expected results, the performance indicators, the responsible institutions and the stakeholders are laid down in the following specific sub-activities of the SPRGS: Operational objective 1: and carbon stocks in  Operational objective 2:  Operational objective 3:  Operational objective 4: creasing the resilience and adaptability of forest ecosystems  These operational objectives and activities are expected to have a direct and sometimes indirect positive effect on the adaption of forest ecosystems to climate change and on reducing the adverse impact of climate change, including by increasing the absorption of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The existing provisions of the Agricultural Land Ownership and Use Act provide that every year municipal councils adopt a decision on the rules for the use of meadows and grasslands. These provisions cover:  a prospective pasture action plan;  parts of grasslands and pastures mainly intended for mowing;  measures to preserve, maintain and improve grasslands, including clearing bushes and other undesired plant species, anti-erosion activities, spreading of   100  fertilisers, temporary fencing;  parts of grasslands and pastures intended for artificial lawns for sowing appropriate grass mixtures;  manner of use, prohibitions and restrictions depending on the landscape, soil, climate and other environmental conditions. Regarding arable land, Article 7 of the Agricultural Land Ownership and Use Act stipulates that agricultural land which is eroded, polluted, salinated, with high acid content or with excess moisture in the surface layer shall be recovered and improved through a set of activities or technologies, acting in line with pre-designed, coordinated and approved technologies and projects approved by an Expert Council. Planes, quarries and other areas with disturbed soil profile, tailing ponds, landfills and other waste disposal sites, old riverbeds, routes of abandoned canals, roads, railways and construction sites after removal of engineering equipment, claddings and superstructures are subject to revegetation. Revegetation is to be done on the basis of an agreed and approved project which is an integral part of the design for the development of the site. The procedure for use of humus after its removal, the procedures for revegetation, land improvement and acceptance of restored areas are laid down in Regulation No 26 on land revegetation, improvement of low productivity land, humus layer removal and recovery. One of the key strategic documents, which sets out measures for land use, land use change and forestry is the Third National Climate Change Action Plan 2013-2020 (NPDIK). The following measures set out in the Plan will continue to be implemented after 2030:  -  Afforestation of abandoned agricultural lands, barren and deforested areas, areas affected by erosion and areas at risk of erosion outside forest territories;  Increasing the area for urban and suburban parks and green spaces;  Recovery and sustainable management of wetlands Protection and conservation of wetlands in forest territories, peat bogs, swamps;  Recovery and maintenance of protective woodland belts and new anti-erosion afforestation.   Increasing the density of the natural and artificial plantations listed above. ii. Where relevant, regional cooperation in this area Regional cooperation in this area is considered unfeasible. iii. Without prejudice to the applicability of State aid rules, financing measures, including Union support and the use of Union funds, in this area at national level, where applicable Not applicable   101  3.1.2 Renewable energy To achieve the national target of a 27.09 % share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption by 2030, both the existing and additional policy measures will be implemented. The policies and measures take account of the priorities and guidelines in the new European energy and climate policy and are in line with the experience gained and results achieved from hitherto pursued policies and measures in the area of generation and consumption of energy from renewable sources. The aim is to achieve a cost-effective development of renewable energy as an important part of the EU decarbonisation policy by 2030.  In the period 20212030, the development of the electricity sector will take into account of the capacity for maximum integration of the renewable energy generated in the energy market, decentralised electricity generation and the provision of renewable electricity to consumers at the lowest possible price. An enabling framework was developed to promote and facilitate the development of renewables self-consumption and establish renewable communities. To ensure wider and annually increasing penetration of renewables in the heating and cooling sector, priority will be given to the commissioning of highly efficient heating and cooling installations, the deployment of innovative technologies using geothermal, hydrothermal and solar energy and the use of waste heat and cold. The use of biomass for centralised and local heat generation will increase in compliance with the requirements laid down in Article 28(2) to (7) and (10) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.  In order to achieve a share of 14.20 % of energy from renewable sources, the transport sector will encourage the penetration of new generation biofuels, renewable liquid and gaseous fuels of non-biological origin for transport, recycled carbon fuels and renewable energy supplied to the road and rail transport. Consumption of these fuels and energy should contribute to achieving the targets of the policy of energy diversification and decarbonisation of the transport sector. To ensure the use of electricity from renewable sources in transport, the government will focus its efforts on the deployment of electric mobility, developing and promoting the use of public electric transport and accelerating the integration of modern technologies into the railway sector. i. Policy measures to achieve the national contribution to the binding 2030 Union target for renewable energy and trajectories as referred to in point (a)(2) of Article 4, and, where applicable or available, the elements referred to in point 2.1.2, including sector- and technology-specific measures (1) Support schemes In the period 20212030, support will continue to be provided in the form of preferential prices under contracts already concluded for the purchase of renewable electricity generated by power plants with a total installed capacity of less than 1 MW. During this   102  period granting preferential prices and purchasing electricity under long-term contracts is only envisaged in the case of commissioning new facilities with a total installed capacity of up to and including 30 kW intended to be installed in existing buildings in urban areas, including on the roofs and facades of such buildings and in the land plots in which they are situated. Renewable electricity generation by power plants with a total installed capacity of 1 MW and above 1 -term contracts for purchase at preferential prices have been concluded will be promoted through a premium for the quantity of electricity sold on the exchange. Support will be provided until the expiration of the time limit set in the contracts for the purchase of electricity.  The remaining budget for supporting electricity generation from renewable sources for the period 1 January 2019 until the expiry of the periods agreed in the contracts for the purchase of electricity from renewable sources at preferential prices during which premiums will continue to be paid is EUR 4 970 746 00010.  In the future, wind farms and solar and biomass plants will be constructed in line with market principles, without any investment or operational financial aid being granted to investors.  The option for holding auctions to provide capacity for renewable electricity generation and the provision of a premium to the market price of electricity sold on the electricity market are considered to be appropriate forms of support.  The above support schemes will be in line with the requirements of the applicable European state aid rules and guidelines. The annual progress towards achieving the target for a share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption will be subject to analyses in the biennial reports of the INECP; if it is found that the target is not met and a need of new energy facilities exists, a procedure for starting a support scheme through auctions may be launched. (2) Development of electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure, of smart networks, of storage facilities and interconnectors The need to support the integration of renewable electricity into the transmission and distribution networks, the need for a more extensive use of smart networks and use of energy storage systems was identified and will be among the primary and important measures in the period 20212030. In this period, the pace of building new power plants generating renewable energy is expected to slow down compared to 20102018. In turn, this entails better and timely planning and building of the infrastructure required to ensure smooth connection and transmission of the renewable electricity generated. The Electricity System Operator and the operators of distribution networks envisage                                            10State aid SA.44840 (2016/NN)  Bulgaria Support for the Production of Energy from Renewable Sources, which has been approved by the European Commission   103  measures and investments necessary to ensure a secure and reliable operation of the electricity system in Bulgaria while taking account of the increased number of power plants generating renewable energy, including wind and solar power. The measures concerned are included in their respective development plans. In order to ensure that the necessary electricity storage facilities are available, efforts will be focused on developing existing and adding new storage capacity. The implementation of the Yadenitsata project will enable the further development of electricity generation from renewable sources in line with the long-term strategies for energy sector development in Bulgaria and the European Union.  4) Requirements for the use of renewable energy in buildings The promotion of the use of renewable energy in buildings will continue over the entire time horizon of the Plan. The ZEVI contains the requirement for use of renewable energy, where this is technically feasible and economically viable, when new buildings are built or existing buildings are reconstructed, undergo major renovation, overhaul or refurbishing. It requires that at least 15 per cent of the total heating and cooling energy needed for the building be produced from renewable sources by installing:  district heating fuelled by biomass or geothermal energy;  individual facilities for burning biomass with a conversion efficiency of at least 85 per cent for residential and commercial buildings and 70 per cent for industrial buildings;  solar thermal installations;  heat pumps and near-surface geothermal systems. The Energy from Renewable Sources Act requires analyses of the possibilities of using renewable energy to be carried out for new buildings or for reconstruction, major renovation, overhaul or refurbishing of existing buildings is prepared and when the energy efficiency of existing buildings is audited. The analysis of the possibilities for using renewable energy is part of the evaluation indicators of annual energy consumption in the building. The requirement for the use of renewable energy in buildings has been further developed with the adoption of the new Energy Efficiency Act in 2015, which introduced a definition of nearly zero-energy buildings into national law. According to the definition a nearly zero-energy building is a building that simultaneously satisfies the following requirements: (a) the energy consumption of the building, defined as primary energy, complies with the requirements for Class A energy performance on the scale of energy efficiency classes for buildings of the relevant type;   104  (b) not less than 55 per cent of the energy consumed (supplied) for heating, cooling, ventilation, domestic water heating and lighting is energy from renewable sources produced on-site or near the building. Directive 2010/31/EU stipulates a requirement according to which after 31 December 2018 all new buildings occupied and owned by public authorities must be nearly zero-energy buildings and after 21 December 2020 all new buildings must be nearly zero-energy buildings. The precision of current legislative requirements for the use of renewable energy in buildings will be improved in order to achieve the goal for EU building stock decarbonisation. According to the Renewable Sources of Energy Act where projects for the upgrade of production processes in small and medium-sized enterprises are implemented, the energy efficiency measures need to be combined with the commissioning of plants for production of heat and cooling from renewable sources that is sufficient to meet the technological needs of the enterprise. 4) Strengthening the role of central and local authorities to enable a higher penetration of renewable energy The contribution of the local authorities to a higher penetration of renewable energy and to the creation of conditions for renewables self-consumption and consumption of  for the cost-effective development of renewable energy in the country. Directive 2009/28/EC and the new Directive*EU) 2018/2001 require that opportunities for the use of renewable energy be considered when planning, designing, building and renovating urban infrastructure, including industrial, commercial and residential areas, and energy infrastructure, with a special focus on the use of heating and cooling from renewable energy sources. In this regard, the ZEVI creates an obligation for central and local government authorities to take measures to ensure that, effective from 1 January 2012, the new buildings occupied by the public service, as well as the existing public service buildings undergoing reconstruction, major renovation, overhaul or refurbishment play the role of models for achieving the objectives of the Act. This obligation can be implemented by meeting the standards for housing buildings with zero consumption of energy or by ensuring the use of the roofs of such buildings or multi-purpose buildings, including public service buildings, by third parties for installing units for generation of energy from renewable sources.  Local authorities will remain actively engaged in the implementation of government policy in the area of renewable energy throughout the implementation period of the INECP, ensuring that they fulfill their obligations and responsibilities under the ZEVI by developing long-term and short-term municipal programmes for promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and biofuels within each municipality.   105  5) Introducing a simplified procedure for grid connections when installations of renewables self-consumers and demonstration projects that use renewable energy with an electrical capacity of 10.8 kW or less are to be connected to electricity distribution networks Directive (EU) 2018/2001 requires that a simplified procedure be introduced when renewable energy self-consumers and demonstration projects that use renewable energy with an electrical capacity of 10.8 kW or less are to be connected to electricity distribution networks. This requirement will be considered and the existing statutory requirements will be streamlined.  At present the ZEVI provides for a simplified procedure for connection of installations with a total installed capacity of up to and including 30 kW, envisaged to be mounted on roof and facade structures of buildings connected to the electricity distribution grid and in real estate adjacent to such buildings in urbanised areas.  6) Assessment of the potential energy from renewable sources and the potential use of waste heating and cooling in the heating and cooling sector  This assessment will be part of the second comprehensive assessment in accordance with Article 14(1) of Directive 2012/27/EU to be developed by 31 December 2020.  7) Access to and operation of grids Article 18(2) and (3) of the ZEVI provides for incentives for the development of gas generation from renewable sources and generation of renewable heating and cooling in the country. The incentives referred to above will be extended beyond 2020 and during the process of transposing Directive (EU) 2018/2001 into national law the need for amendments to legislation with a view to increasing the share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector will be discussed. 8) Creating conditions for renewables self-consumers and renewables communities The interest of Bulgarian consumers in generating renewable electricity for self-consumption is low and this method of electricity consumption is still underdeveloped. The ZEVI provides an opportunity to build small units that use renewable sources for joint electricity generation, consumption and sale.  The ZEVI currently in force provides the producer with the opportunity to declare that the generated renewable electricity will be used for self-consumption when filing an application to the operator of the electricity network for exploring the conditions and manner of connection. Also, shorter time limits for connection are envisaged and no building and use permits are required for small systems with an installed capacity of up to 30 kW (Article 24(1) of the ZEVI). Construction permits are issued on the basis of an opinion issued by a structural engineer. The quantity of electricity that is not used for self-consumption shall be purchased by the respective end supplier at a price set by the KEVR according to the conditions and the procedure laid down in the respective regulation referred to in Article 36(3) of the Energy Act.   106  In 2019, Article 147(1)(14) of the Spatial Development Act (ZUT) was amended. The issuance of building permits shall be required for the installation of units for the generation of renewable electricity and heating and/or cooling with total installed capacity of up to and including 1 kW installed in existing buildings in urban areas, including on the roofs and facades of such buildings and in the land plots in which they are situated For the purpose of undertaking the construction works referred to in Article 147(1)(14) of the ZUT, opinions from a structural engineer, electrical engineer and/or heat engineer, together with drawings, diagrams, calculations and directions for the execution of said works and an opinion stipulating the conditions for connection to the distribution network, must be presented. With a view to putting in place an enabling framework to promote and facilitate the development of renewables self-consumption, legislative changes are planned in order to streamline legislation and better regulate the rights of consumers. Support will be provided through the possibility to operate in the energy system, facilitating integration into the market, creating favourable conditions to raise public interest in the initiative and developing and putting in place optimal administrative procedures that take into account the specific needs of renewable energy communities, etc. During the period 20212030 opportunities will be sought to fund projects and measures will be undertaken to provide access to the consumption of energy from renewable sources for low-income consumers or vulnerable households through the social assistance system.   9) Promoting the use of heating and cooling energy produced from renewable sources The Renewable Energy Act promotes the production of renewable energy for heating and through: - support for and implementation of projects for construction of heat transmission networks in settlements that meet the requirements for a designated area when the economic viability of consumption of heat from renewable sources is proved and a preliminary investment design has been submitted for the heat production; - support for and implementation of projects for construction of small decentralised heating and/or cooling systems; - connecting of units for generation of renewable heat to the heat transmission network and purchase by the heat transmission company of the heat generated by another heat producer, where this is technically feasible and economically viable. The ZE further envisages incentives for high-efficiency cogeneration in the form of preferential prices for the purchase of electricity generated or the payment of premiums for the sale of electricity. An obligation has been introduced for the public supplier of electricity and retailers to purchase electricity from plants with total installed capacity of   107  less than 1 MW connected to the respective grid. The obligation extends to the entire quantity of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration. A certificate of origin for the electricity generated issued by the KEVR is required. The quantities of electricity from high-efficiency combined generation of heat and electricity are purchased up to the amount of the quantities specified by the decision of the KEVR setting the preferential price. The simplified procedure referred to in Article 147(1)(14) of the ZUT (measure described in point 8) also applies to the generation of renewable energy for heating and cooling by plants with total installed capacity of up to 1 MW, including systems installed in existing buildings in urbanised areas, including on the roofs and facades of such buildings and in the land plots in which they are situated. The above measures will be extended beyond 2020 and new possibilities will be sought for the development of high efficiency cogeneration, efficient district heating plants and installing local systems in buildings in order to achieve the annual target for the use of renewable energy for heating and cooling set in Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Possibilities will be also sought to replace conventional fuels with energy from renewable sources, if this would lead to efficient and economically feasible production and consumption of heating and cooling.  10) Promotion of the use of geothermal energy In order to make full use of the potential of this renewable energy source, the implementation of small-scale projects for heat generation by centralised and local systems will be promoted. Various studies and national strategies show that Bulgaria is rich in geothermal sites, of which 840 water sources with temperature of up to 103 oC have been explored. In addition, there are 136 mineral springs with temperatures in the range between 20 oC and 101.4 oC with various water flow characteristics. At the same time, only 18 % of geothermal energy in Bulgaria is utilised and only 6 % of mineral sources have been explored. The development of technologies for the utilisation of solutions enabling energy storage in the form of heat in ground reservoirs has been highly dynamic and requires adequate and timely solutions for their economically feasible utilisation, taking national specificities into account. 11) Providing final consumers with information about the energy performance and the share of renewable energy in heating and cooling systems When the legislation relating to the use of renewable energy is amended, requirements for the provision of information about the energy performance of the renewable source used in the generation of heating and cooling will be introduced for cogeneration plants and district heating plants.   108  12) Introducing legal requirements for issuance of guarantees of origin for energy from renewable sources The requirements laid down in Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources have been transposed in the ZEVI and in Regulation No RD-16-1117 of 14 October 2011 laying down the terms and procedure for the issuance, transfer and cancellation of guarantees of origin for energy from renewable sources. The guarantee of origin is to be issued in order to certify the origin of the electricity and the heating and cooling energy generated from renewable sources. Directive (EU) No 2018/2001 requires Member States to ensure the issuance of guarantees of origin for gas, including hydrogen. In connection with this, the provisions transposing Directive (EU) 2018/2001 in national law will be streamlined and supplemented to bring them in line with the new requirements stipulated in said Directive. A possibility will be envisaged in legislation for the transfer of guarantees of origin to consumers who wish to prove the origin of the electricity they use.  13) Streamlining the legal framework for application of the stricter requirements stipulated in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 as regards sustainability criteria and GHG emission reductions when using biofuels and liquid, gaseous and solid fuels from biomass. The provisions of national law that currently transpose the requirements laid down in Directive 2009/28/EC and Directive (EU) 2015/1513 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 September 2015 amending Directive 98/70/EC relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (Directive (EU) 2015/1513) as regards the sustainability criteria of biofuels and liquid fuels from biomass will be streamlined and brought into line with Directive (EU) 2018/2001 to ensure that the requirements for sustainability criteria and GHG emissions reduction have been transposed in full. The legislative acts to be developed for the purpose of transposing Directive (EU) 2018/2001 into national law will stipulate requirements for the sustainability criteria and the reduction of GHG emissions from gaseous fuels and solid fuels from biomass used in the cogeneration of electricity and energy for heating and cooling or in fuels. The sustainable use of existing wood and agricultural resources and the development of new production systems in forestry and agriculture are encouraged in the production and use of renewable energy, provided that the criteria for sustainability and GHG reduction are met. Biofuels, non-transport liquid fuels from biomass and gaseous and solid fuels from biomass used to achieve the national target and such biofuels benefitting support schemes must meet the criteria for sustainability and GHG emission reduction.  The introduction of requirements relating to the sustainability criteria for biofuels and for non-transport liquid fuels from biomass is essential to the achievement of the national and European energy policy objectives.   109  14) Introducing an obligation for fuel and electricity suppliers for achieving the target set for the transport sector In order to achieve the new, more ambitious targets, specific obligations will be legally imposed on fuel and energy suppliers, which release on the market conventional biofuels, new generation biofuels, liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin, renewable electricity and recycled carbon fuels.  At present, consumption of the quantities of biofuels required to achieve the national binding target for 2020 is ensured through an obligation on the persons that place on the market petroleum-derived liquid transport fuels to market petroleum-derived fuels with a bio-component the percentage of which is set forth in the ZEVI, including advanced biofuels. Such an obligation was also introduced for end distributors and for the distributors of petroleum-derived liquid fuels.  In view of the requirements laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2001, the adopted approach towards achieving the target for the transport sector could be changed by introducing quotas for each supplier of renewable energy.  16) Promoting the use of renewable energy in public transport In order to achieve the target in the transport sector, local authorities will perform their responsibilities relating to the implementation of the policy on energy from renewable sources and, in keeping with their long-term and short-term programmes, will develop and implement schemes for promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, including alternative fuels from renewable sources, new generation biofuels, recycled carbon fuels and electricity from renewable sources, and will further develop and promote the use of public electric transport, taking into account the specific conditions in each municipality.  The increase in the use of energy from renewable sources in public transport will be achieved through the implementation of the integrated policy measures envisaged, which are set out in detail in points 3.1.1 Decarbonisation dimension and 3.2 Energy Efficiency dimension 17) Creating conditions for the development and use of advanced biofuels, renewable liquid and gaseous biofuels of non-biological origin and recycled carbon fuels To ensure that the necessary quantities of advanced biofuels, renewable liquid and gaseous biofuels of non-biological origin and recycled carbon fuels for the purposes of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 are available at affordable prices, integrated measures relating to both the consumption and production of such fuels will be required. Efforts in this less developed but advanced area will focus on applied research and larger-scale demonstration activities relating to utilisation of new energy sources and implementation of technologies for their use. It is necessary to create an integrated research and innovation chain to cover elements from applied research through generation before release to market penetration of these fuels.   110  Local authorities will also develop and implement schemes promoting the use of energy from renewable sources, alternative fuels from renewable sources, new generation biofuels and recycled carbon fuels, taking into account the specific conditions in each municipality within the framework of programmes for promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and biofuels in line with the priorities set in national programmes and strategic documents promoting the use of these fuels in transport. An important factor in promoting the use of these fuels is to make them popular and overcome the initial scepticism of consumers and households. To this end, measures for organising information campaigns among the population of the respective municipalities should be implemented to encourage the use of these fuels in transport. 18) Promotion of the development and deployment of electric mobility in transport, including by building road transport infrastructure and introducing new technologies in railways To promote and deploy electric mobility, obligations will be imposed on local authorities to introduce as part of their short- and long-term programmes their own specific measures on their territory in order to increase the attractiveness of the use of such transport. The programmes should also include measures to promote the development and use by the population of urban public and rail transport. The actions undertaken by individual municipalities will be promoted as good practices in order to be widely disseminated, for instance: tax reliefs, simplified access to and provision of a minimum number of parking places, etc. when electric vehicles are used. Appropriate legislation will be adopted to ensure favourable conditions for the development of the necessary infrastructure. The ZE currently stipulates requirements for the operators of publicly accessible charging stations for electric vehicles. In order to achieve full compliance with the provisions laid down in Directive (EU) 2018/2002 and Directive (EU) 2018/844, current legislation will be amended to include a requirement for installing at least one charging station for electric vehicles within the perimeter of new non-residential buildings and non-residential buildings that have undergone complete renovation with more than ten parking spaces. At the same time, the buildings must be equipped with cabling infrastructure that enables the installation of charging stations for electrical vehicles. 19) Creating appropriate financial incentives to ensure the achievement of the target in the transport sector In line with the requirements of the Guidelines on state aid for environmental protection and energy, possibilities will be considered, where relevant, for introducing financial incentives (through tax relief, support schemes, etc.) for the consumption of alternative renewable fuels and advanced biofuels and for electric mobility deployment. Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund disbursed via different operational programmes.   111  The targets in the transport sector will be achieved through the implementation of the financial programmes mentioned below. Although, they will be discontinued after 2020, they are expected to have a long-lasting effect beyond 2021.  During the new programming period 2021-2027 Operational programme Transport and Transport Infrastructure 20142020 will be renamed to Transport Connectivity.  programme Regions in Growth 20142020 envisages activities for the development and improvement of urban transport systems, including the purchase of new rolling stock for the needs of urban public transport operators.  Operational programme Environment 20142020 provides support to the transport sector on account of its contribution to air pollution in Bulgaria with a focus on fine particulate matter (PM10) emissions and nitrogen oxides (NOx); grant assistance is provided for the implementation of measures for the reduction of emissions from public transport.  500 million was launched under the priority axis. The call aims to contribute to the  improvement of ambient air quality by reducing the levels of emissions of fine particulate (PM10) or nitrogen oxides (NOx);  Environmental protection through improved operation of public transport vehicles, and more specifically replacing old rolling stock with environmentally friendly vehicles;  Greater reliability and comfort and optimal travel times of public transport to promote a change in transport patterns and reduce personal car journeys, thereby reducing harmful gases from internal combustion engines. The procedure has two components: Component 1: Implementation of activities for the improvement of ambient air quality by the purchase and delivery of electric road vehicles  electric buses and trolleybuses. Component 2: Implementation of activities for the improvement of ambient air quality by the purchase and delivery of electric vehicles for rail transport  tramway rolling stock. The eligible applicants under the call include 11 municipalities (Burgas, Varna, Vratsa, Pernik, Pleven, Ruse, Sliven, Stara Zagora, Sofia Metropolitan Municipality and Haskovo) in partnership with the respective companies providing passenger transport services within the respective municipality under a public service agreement (municipal public transport company).  The Connecting Europe Facility finances projects that provide opportunities to fill gaps in the energy, transport and digital structure of Europe.   112  19) Production of hydrogen from renewable sources With a view to ensuring that sufficient hydrogen to meet demand is available, steps will be taken to launch hydrogen production via Power to X plant solutions. Surplus electricity generated from solar and wind power is expected to be used for hydrogen production.  ii. Where relevant, specific measures for regional cooperation, as well as, as an option, the estimated excess production of energy from renewable sources which could be transferred to other Member States in order to achieve the national contribution and trajectories referred to in point 2.1.2 The achievement of the ambitious national target for renewable energy for 2030 entails relying on the co-operation mechanisms envisaged in Directive (EU) 2018/2001. In this regard, in case of a surplus or a deficit of renewable energy Bulgaria will make use of the statistical transfer mechanism. Bulgaria will join the European Union renewable development platform (the Platform) which will provide opportunities for trading in units of renewable energy. Annual data on the national contribution of Member States to the binding Union target, including expected surpluses and deficits of renewable energy and the cost of transfer of surpluses of renewable energy from or to another Member State, will be published in the Platform. As an option to fulfil its national target for a share of renewable energy in gross final consumption, Bulgaria considers participating in initiatives for implementation of joint projects with other Member States and/or third countries. iii. Specific measures on financial support, where applicable, including Union support and the use of Union funds, for the promotion of the production and use of energy from renewable sources in electricity, heating and cooling, and transport In order to enable wider deployment of renewable energy in the sector, Union funds will be used to promote and use heating and cooling energy from renewable sources. Projects for enhancing energy efficiency and increasing the use of renewable energy will be funded under the Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency and Energy Security Programme financed through the European Economic Area Financial Mechanism with a total budget of approximately EUR 33 million. The implementation of these measures is expected to translate into projects for the production of electricity and heating and cooling from renewable sources of a total of 46 000 MWh per year and annual CO2 emissions reductions of 54 280 tCO2. In the period 20212030, Bulgaria will benefit from investment support from the Modernisation Fund and the option for funding projects related to renewable energy production, improvement of energy efficiency, energy storage and upgrade of the energy networks will be considered. The Fund will be established pursuant to Article 10d of   113  Directive (EU) 2018/410 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2018 amending Directive 2003/87/EC to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments, and Decision (EU) 2015/1814. In the period 20212030, 2 % of total EU emissions quotas will be sold by auction and the proceeds will be paid into the Modernisation Fund in accordance with Article 10(1) of Directive (EU) 2018/410 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/87/EC to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments, and Decision (EU) 2015/1814. iv. Where applicable, assessment of the support for electricity from renewable sources that Member States are to carry out pursuant to Article 6(4) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 Not applicable v. Specific measures to introduce one or more contact points, streamline administrative procedures, provide information and training, and facilitate the uptake of power purchase agreements Summary of the policy measures under the enabling framework Member States have to put in place pursuant to Articles 21(6) and 22(5) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 to promote and facilitate the development of self-consumption and renewable energy communities In view of the requirement of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, legislative initiatives will be undertaken to establish one or more contact points to support investors (applicants) in the process of issuing permits by competent authorities. The responsibilities of the contact points and the time limits for issuing permits will be consistent with the requirements set in Directive (EU) No 2018/2001. Municipal authorities have an obligation to issue some of the permits for building plants for renewable electricity generation. In addition, their role in planning and expanding the use of renewable energy in the territory of the municipality involves a greater commitment to the process of implementation of investment proposals. In this regard, it is appropriate to designate municipalities as contact points.  Securing the necessary information and adequate training are key to promoting the wider use of renewable energy. Regional measures for development in the areas that promote the exchange of best practices in the production of renewable energy between local and regional development initiatives, programmes for training to strengthen the regulatory, technical and financial expertise and for better knowledge of available financing opportunities are supported. To achieve efficient results in this area, stakeholders and potential participants in the process of dissemination of appropriate information and conducting training procedures are identified. The relevant institutions and local authorities are particularly active participants in these processes and they will carry out combined information campaign   114  initiatives, fora, awareness raising programmes and training programmes for citizens on the benefits of and opportunities for using renewable energy. Information campaigns are addressed to citizens and provide information on practical issues relating to the development and use of renewable energy.  Information on the opportunities for use of renewable energy is disseminated in the framework of the activities performed by relevant ministries and their executive agencies, including in connection with completed projects financed by international and European programmes. of equipment and systems and the competent bodies provide information regarding the net profit, costs and energy efficiency of the equipment and systems for use of renewable electricity, heating and cooling energy. The information will be provided in an efficient and easily accessible manner.  Qualification schemes for installers of small-scale biomass boilers and stoves, solar photovoltaic and solar thermal systems, shallow geothermal systems and heat pumps are provided based on the actions carried out to date in accordance with Directive 2009/28/EC in relation to the acquisition of qualification for installation and maintenance of biomass installations, solar photovoltaic installations, solar thermal installations, heat pumps and shallow geothermal installations and based on the related information. Public information regarding the persons who have acquired qualification for installation and maintenance of such facilities is made available. vi. Assessment of the necessity to build new infrastructure for districting heating and cooling energy produced from renewable sources The assessment of the potential for use of high efficiency cogeneration of heat from conventional fuels and renewable energy is based on the current annual consumption of heat. Introducing highly efficient technologies would be socially and economically viable over the next 10 years if the existing heating systems are replaced where technical and market developments allow. There are plans to upgrade public buildings and buildings used in the services sector that do not have district heating supply by building new district heating networks  either local or extensions of existing ones. This is expected to result in saving 52 000 2 per year. One possibility is to use the potential of highly efficient solutions such as gas-fuelled engines, small to large open- or closed-cycle gas turbines, biomass fuelled steam turbines, heat pumps, etc. The use of biomass with a focus on biomass from waste and industrial and household waste and the use of geothermal energy offer a potential to increase the share of renewable energy in district heating and cooling systems. The potential for energy efficiency of the central heating and cooling infrastructure can be achieved through the rehabilitation of heat transmission networks and replacing obsolete direct subscriber district heating stations with modern highly efficient automated indirect stations, which would reduce heat transmission and distributi2 emissions.   115  The best practices associated with the use of pre-insulated pipes in district heating systems help reduce losses to 3 %. A similar loss level can be achieved for high-power density systems. In the context of the national conditions in Bulgaria, it is assumed that the average power density of district heating systems will make it possible to reduce heat losses to 10 % by using the best available technology. The development of high efficiency electricity cogeneration contributes to fuel use reduction, greater efficiency of electricity generation and better environmental protection.  vii. Where applicable, specific measures on the promotion of the use of energy from biomass, especially for new biomass mobilisation, taking into account:  biomass availability, including sustainable biomass: both domestic potential and imports from third countries  other biomass uses by other sectors (agriculture and forest-based sectors); as well as measures for the sustainability of biomass production and use Solid biomass is the renewable energy source most widely used in Bulgaria, mainly in the heating and cooling sector. Consumption of other types of biomass, including waste, is still insignificant.  Firewood is the main type of biomass used in the country and the use of wood waste and plant waste has been growing. The positive trend towards an improvement in waste management practices continues and the national targets for household waste recycling, reuse and recycling of packaging waste and, last but not least, recycling of ordinary waste, have been achieved. Biogas production from anaerobic fermentation of biomass and from sewage sludge is still negligible. Biogas is used in electricity and heat generation, in the Agriculture sector and in the Other services activities sector. In this regard, use of biomass for energy purposes has wide potential for development. The efforts are focused on the wider use of waste (municipal solid waste, sludges from wastewater treatment plants, etc.) and industrial by-products, without affecting the health and quality of life of the population in the regions where the biomass fuelled energy installations are located. For biofuels generated from forest biomass, non-transport liquid fuels from biomass and gaseous and solid fuels from biomass to be taken into account for the purpose of the increase of their share in energy from renewable sources, requirements will be adopted to minimise the risk of using biomass derived from unsustainable production. Regulatory requirements will be introduced for sustainable production and consumption of gaseous and solid fuels from biomass, when said fuels are used in the generation of electricity and heat in biomass fuelled installations with a total nominal heat power equal to or higher than 20 MW for solid fuels from biomass and with a total nominal heat power equal to or higher than 2 MW for gaseous fuels from biomass.   116  This ensures the use of wood that meets specific quality criteria. In connection with this, Regulation No 6 of 7 October 2019 of the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Forests laying down the requirements for and the control of harvested wood used as firewood for residential heating SG No 81 of 15 October 2019, in force as from 15 October 2019) was developed and adopted.   3.1.3 Other elements of the dimension i. Where applicable, national policies and measures affecting the EU ETS sector and assessment of the complementarity and impacts on the EU ETS Bulgaria will avail of the option for free allocation of greenhouse gas emission allowances for power plants from 2021 to 2030 in order to modernise its energy sector in accordance with Article 10c of DIRECTIVE (EU) 2018/410 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 14 March 2018 amending Directive 2003/87/EC to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments, and Decision (EU) 2015/1814.  The following will be developed:  project selection criteria for projects involving a total amount of investment of up to EUR 12.5 million on the basis of which a List of the investments to be financed with free allocation of GHG emission allowances in the 20212030 period will be prepared;  rules for competitive bidding for the selection of projects involving a total amount of investment exceeding EUR 12.5 million which will be financed through free of charge allocation of emission allowances between 2021 and 2030;  Amendments to the Energy Act. ii. Policy measures to achieve other national targets, where applicable Not applicable iii. Policy measures to achieve low emission mobility (including electrification of transport) iv. Where applicable, national policies, timelines and measures planned to phase out energy subsidies, in particular for fossil fuels Not applicable
