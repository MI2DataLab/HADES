Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 71 of 268  2. NATIONAL TARGETS AND OBJECTIVES   2.1. Dimension 1: Decarbonisation   2.1.1. Greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration   i.  Sharing Regulation  As required by Regulation (EU) 2018/842 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions emissions in non-ETS sectors by 36% by 2030 compared to 2005. The EU Effort Sharing Regulation requires a linear target trajectory to be maintained between 2021 and 2030.    In 2017, Austrian greenhouse gas emissions in the non-ETS sector were approximately 51.7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (mt CO2eq). The target for 2030 is around 36.4 mt CO2eq, which means that Austria must reduce its emissions by around 30% when compared with 2017. Assuming economic growth (GDP) of 1.5% per yepoints to a reduction in emissions of around 47.9 mt CO2eq by 2030, which corresponds to a reduction of around 16% when compared with 2005. A sensitivity analysis carried out for the WEM scenario assuming average annual GDP growth of around 1% resulted in 46.3 mt CO2eq by 2030, which corresponds to a reduction of around 18% when compared with 2005. This means that if economic growth is around 0.5% slower, this will result in a saving of around 1.5 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in 2030, with the most significant reductions being achieved in the transport sector.  In terms of the transport sector, the results of the sensitivity analysis show that lower annual GDP growth will bring about a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 1.3 mt CO2eq in 2030, since the volume of goods transport in particular will reduce. This is because Austria is an export-driven economy with large freight companies.  The sensitivity analysis shows that emissions in the heat and electricity generation sector will only fall by around 55,000 t CO2eq more than in the WEM scenario. This also results from the assumption of lower electricity imports against a backdrop of reduced economic growth. It has been assumed that the operation of the only refinery in Austria will not be affected by economic growth, since, as at 2017, more than half of the diesel consumed in Austria is imported.  In the case of low GDP growth in 2030, emissions within the industry sector will fall by around Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 72 of 268  297,000 t CO2eq when compared with the WEM scenario.  Changes in GDP do not have any significant impact on emissions in the buildings sector. In the event of slow economic growth in 2030, greenhouse gas emissions would exceed the WEM scenario by 126,000 t CO2eq. Since less money is invested in renovation as a result of the fall in energy prices (the sensitivity scenario assumes a similar slowdown in global growth and therefore in the demand for energy sources), the fuel requirements for heating buildings ultimately increase.  No sensitivity analysis was carried out for the non-energy sectors (agriculture, waste, F-gases).    shows the model-based effects of the measures set out in Chapter 3 on greenhouse gas emissions results for this scenario are set out in detail in Chapter 5 of the Plan.  For sectors that are subject to the EU Effort Sharing Regulation, the models applied show a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 41.5 mt CO2eq by 2030. This corresponds to a reduction of 27% when compared with the base year 2005. Disregarding the possibilities for using flexibility mechanisms in accordance with the Effort Sharing Regulation, further measure-based reduction efforts will be required in order to close the shortfall of around 5 mt CO2eq in the achievement of the objectives by 2030.  Decisions as to whether and to what extent further options for measures are to be applied or flexibility mechanisms used will have to be made by a new federal government from 2020 onwards.

Cost-effective sectoral targets will be set in the Austrian Climate Protection Act for all sectors not covered by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (non-ETS). As was established within the scope of #mission2030, the focus is initially on the transport and building sectors, which have the biggest quantitative potential for reduction. The reduction in the respective non-ETS sectors is to be achieved by introducing measures in Austria that will set us well on the way towards decarbonisation in accordance with the Paris Agreement on climate change.  Transport is currently the most polluting sector, accounting for approximately 46% of overall (non-ETS) emissions. The plan is to reduce emissions by approximately 7.9 mt CO2eq to around 15.7 mt CO2eq (2017: 23.6 mt CO2strategic approach to achieving low-emission mobility in the future is to follow the principle of Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 74 of 268  Avoid (the use of unnecessary transport), Shift (to efficient modes of transport) and Improve (the goal of fossil-free mobility by 2050 and positions Austria as a leader in electromobility and the expansion of public transport.  The building sector also has huge potential for reduction, especially through thermal renovation, which will create important economic momentum for the domestic trade, by shunning fossil fuels in new buildings and by switching to renewable energy sources and high-efficiency district heating in the existing building stock. This will enable emissions to be reduced in a socially and economically sustainable manner by around 3 mt CO2eq to around 5 mt CO2eq by 2030.  In the industry sector (excluding ETS installations), the energy efficiency measures pushed through, together with as broad a switch to renewable energy sources or power-based processes as possible, should boost innovation.  In the agricultural sector, sustainably reducing emissions poses a challenge. Greenhouse gas reductions are feasible in particular through measures related to animals (fertiliser management, feeding strategies, farming systems) and tillage (humus development and stabilisation/carbon storage, erosion control) and by maintaining permanent grassland, productive arable land and wetlands. In order to achieve climate and energy targets, measures to increase the production and use of renewable energy (agricultural biogas installations, waste heat utilisation, renewable fuels, retrofitting engines) and to increase operational energy efficiency will be required. In order to successfully put reduction measures into practice, awareness-raising activities (training, information, demonstration, consultation) must also continue and be expanded.  -economy strategy makes a significant contribution towards achieving climate targets. The bio-economy has a double impact on the climate: On the one hand, carbon sequestration in renewable raw materials leads to a reduction in atmospheric CO2 levels, while on the other hand, bioenergy is one of the pillars of the decarbonisation of the energy system. Bio-based products also carry the advantage that they can be thermally recovered at the end of their life cycle, thereby also allowing for climate-friendly disposal.  In agricultural areas, land sealing and changes in land use lead to a conflict of objectives with agricultural production. The continuous and extremely high loss of soil in Austria (currently around 12 ha per day, the target being 2.5 ha per day) makes it clear that, as well as productive arable and grassland areas receiving better protection from spatial planning instruments, there is also a need for more efficient use of source streams, including biogenic residues from agriculture and forestry in particular, and regional circular models, as is supported by the bio-economy strategy. Cross-sector output from the agricultural and forestry sector arising from the increased provision of renewable raw materials must in any case provide an economic and environmental benefit for the sector. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 75 of 268   A bio-economy strategy will address all key areas of action to reduce the use of fossil raw materials. The efficient and sustainable use of biogenic raw materials opens up a diverse range of available alternatives for Austria as a location for business. Renewable raw materials from agriculture and forestry and biogenic residues from production processes in the Austrian economy can form the basis for high-quality and innovative products, innovative services and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and resource consumption. The potential offered by the bio-economy depends on the availability of biogenic raw materials and residues. The aim is to achieve a clear reduction in CO2 emissions on the basis of life cycle analyses. The bio-economy will therefore reduce dependence on non-renewable and fossil raw materials, promote innovation and economic development, create new jobs and support social changes based on sustainability.  In the waste economy and as far as fluorinated gases (F-gases) are concerned, EU law (F-Gas Regulation) and domestic measures (implementation of the Circular Economy Package) will reduce emissions and ensure international targets are met.  ossil fuels. The best way to drive down greenhouse gas emissions is to increase energy efficiency and switch to renewable energy sources. A mix of measures to reduce greenhouse gases, develop renewable energy and improve energy efficiency is vital in ensuring targets are achieved efficiently. At the same time, attention should be paid to the interaction between energy-related and non-energy-related GHG emissions.     ii.   Agriculture and forestry in Austria are an important source of renewable raw materials and energy sources (and their waste products). In this context, forests play a particularly important role in the global climate system and in achieving the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. Now that land use has been included in the EU climate targets for 2030 (LULUCF Regulation), emission and carbon storage from agriculture and forestry are now firmly embedded in the objectives of the Effort Sharing Regulation (see above). For accounting purposes, various arrangements have been put in place.  For the accounting of utilised agricultural area (arable land and grassland), but also land used for other purposes, such as settlements, infrastructure, etc., the emission balance for the period 2005-2009 is taken as a basis.  For managed forest land, a reference value based on forest management 2000-2009 is used. If, on the basis of the respective accounting rules, a positive balance is recorded for the entire land Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 76 of 268  use sector, credits for Austria amounting to 250,000 tonnes CO2 per year can be counted towards the national effort sharing target, if necessary. If, on the other hand, a negative balance is recorded, the effort sharing target is increased.  A particular challenge for the measures in this sector is to maintain productivity and above all to further increase the sustainable harvesting of timber in the forestry sector, and also to support the stability and further development of biogenic carbon pools by increasing biomass in forests and maintaining and, where possible, increasing humus-rich arable land.  In future, therefore, a stronger focus will be placed on an environment and climate policy   Measures that affect the land use sector will help to achieve the national target for Austria by 2030 in keeping with Article 4 of the LULUCF Regulation. A stronger focus on an environment and supporting influence moving forward.     iii.

A technologically open framework needs to be put in place which is tailored to the pathway, is in keeping with European targets and takes account of competition. For companies and installations that are energy intensive yet highly efficient by international standards, comprehensive carbon leakage protection during the transition to the complete decarbonisation of the energy system forms an important basis for economic competitiveness.  Further clarifications on the long-term objectives at EU level and in Austria are included in the long-term strategy, which is to be presented on 1 January 2020 in accordance with the Regulation on the governance of the Energy Union and climate action.    Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 77 of 268   2.1.2. Renewable energy   i.  by 2030 and indicative target trajectory from 2021 to 2030  to 46-50% by 2030. In 2017, the share was 32.6%, meaning that the interim target of 34% by 2020 is already in sight.  Another objective is to generate 100% of total electricity consumption (national balance) from domestic renewable energy sources by 2030. This expansion takes into account the anticipated increase in electricity consumption, as electricity from renewable sources in Austria will be used in the mobility, building and production sectors to replace imported fossil fuels. It also relies on future trends in digitalisation, decentralisation and participation.  Electricity trading on the European internal market will still have an important part to play. domestic renewable energy.  Balancing energy and control energy, the flexibility needed for grid operation and assured capacity will continue to be provided, where technically and economically feasible, in order to guarantee security of supply. Balancing energy and control energy for the purpose of stabilising grid operations are not included when calculating the 100% renewable energy supply.  For reasons of resource efficiency, privately generated electricity in the goods production sector should continue to be generated through the low-input, efficient use of by-products on company premises (e.g. in the steel or paper industry), including from non-renewable energy sources. These are generally firms that are required to participate in emissions trading and to acquire allocations for their CO2 emissions. This means that the above quantities of electricity need not be offset by additional exports.  Although renewable energy is already very important, the heat market still depends heavily on imported fossil fuels. In order to mitigate that dependency, the use of biomass, solar heat and ambient heat will be developed by 2030, both as direct heating and as district heating. In addition, the existing contribution of heat from waste management and industrial waste heat will be maintained or boosted. The details will be set out in a National Heating Strategy in liaison with the regions and in consultation with numerous other stakeholders.  A large proportion of natural gas will be replaced in future by renewable gas. Greening the gas, i.e. using biomethane from biogenic residues and waste, hydrogen and synthetic methane from renewable power sources based on a significantly improved system of proof of origin, are key components in the development of a sustainable energy system. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 78 of 268   The proportion of renewable energy in the transport sector will increase, primarily as a result of the increasing market penetration of electromobility, coupled with a high proportion of renewable energy in the electricity mix and a slight increase in the use of sustainably produced biofuels. In 2017, Austria's share of renewables in the transport sector was around 9.5%. The additional 4.5% required in order to achieve the minimum target of 14% in 2030 will come mainly from the growing share of e-mobility and the increased use of biofuels in the petrol and diesel sector. More specifically, the proportion of bioethanol in petrol, which is currently 5%, will be increased to 7-10%, and a blend of synthetic diesel fuels made using renewable sources will also be introduced at a rate of about 3%.

Estimated trajectories for the sector-specific share of renewable energy in gross final consumption of energy in the period 2021-2030 in the electricity, heating and cooling and transport sectors  According to the RED I calculation method, in 2016, renewable electricity generation was around 51.95 TWh. This corresponds to 71.75% of domestic electricity consumption in 2016, which stood at 72.4 TWh.  The objective is to generate 100% of total electricity consumption (national balance) from domestic renewable energy sources by 2030. The Austrian Climate and Energy Strategy #mission2030 sets out additional reasoned exemptions to this: Balancing energy and control Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 79 of 268  energy for the purpose of stabilising grid operations are not to be included when calculating the 100% target, and privately generated electricity from fossil energy sources in the goods production sector will continue to be possible for reasons of resource efficiency. According to calculations, in 2030 these will amount to around 6 TWh (5.75 TWh from goods production and 0.5 TWh grid-stabilising balancing and control energy).  For the year 2030, following expert consultation and taking into account the full range of current national scenarios, domestic electricity consumption is anticipated to be in the region of 80-85 TWh. Therefore, taking the exemptions into consideration, in order to achieve the objective, 74-79 TWh of electricity must be generated from renewable sources in 2030, constituting a net increase of 22-before 2030 also need to be replaced.  The estimates of the exemptions and of the gross inland energy consumption in 2030 were drawn up in accordance with the targets set out in the Austrian Climate and Energy Strategy #mission2030 by the Federal Ministry of Sustainability and Tourism in consultation with external experts (Austrian Energy Agency, E-Control, Federal Environmental Agency).  For the heating and cooling sectors, further in-depth work must be undertaken, in particular the completed in 2020.  In any event, the measures in the Federal (#mission2030) target a significant increase in e-mobility (initially in cars and light goods vehicles) and a gradual replacement of heating systems based on fossil fuels (in particular heating oil) with renewable energy sources, heating pumps and efficient district heating (see Chapter 3).  In the transport sector, the existing measures, which will be continued until 2030, will be further developed. In the case of biofuels, the most important measures are the blending of around 7% biodiesel with diesel fuel and around 5% bioethanol with petrol. In addition, a certain proportion of 100% biodiesel is still used for closed fleets. In the electricity sector, the renewable share of traction power and other overland means of transport (e.g. for cable cars) is currently the main contributor to achieving the objective. In 2017, Austria achieved a 9.6% share of renewable energy in transport.  The most important additional contributions to achieving the minimum objective of 14% renewables in transport by 2030 are above all the increase in e-mobility, which, in terms of energy consumption in transport, corresponds to an increase in the share of renewables of around 1.8%, and the planned increased use of biofuels. More specifically, in the area of biofuels, the bioethanol admixture is to be increased and synthetic diesel fuels from renewable sources are to be used in the diesel sector. This measure increases the use of renewables in transport by an additional 2.4%, thereby ensuring that the 14% target will be met by 2030.

Estimated trajectories for bioenergy demand (disaggregated between heat, electricity and transport) and bioenergy supply (by raw materials and sources, distinguishing between domestic production and imports)    Information in this regard can be found primarily in Tables 5 and 6.     v. Other national development paths and objectives, where available  Development paths related to the supply and use of renewable energy sources are largely determined by the design of the future incentive scheme. In particular, this concerns the Renewable Energy Expansion Act and the development of grid infrastructure and storage facilities. The corresponding measures are set out in detail in Chapter 3 of the Plan. Other objectives are in place which support and complement the renewable energy targets:  Education and awareness-raising for a sustainable future  The possibility of taking direct action can reduce concerns about climate change, thereby taking account of the desire of the population to play a part in climate action.  The aim is for households to play an active role in the energy transition. Digitalisation plays an important role in this area, above all by enabling consumers to make active use of new services and products.  Public sector bodies serve as a valuable model when it comes to public procurement. The best bidder principle will therefore be applied as standard in climate- and energy-relevant procurement by public sector bodies.    Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Austria 83 of 268  Nuclear-free decarbonisation Austria will consistently defend this position at all levels and will lobby for no more funding for nuclear energy. Austria will therefore continue to fight against the use of nuclear energy at European and international level and to push for continual improvements to nuclear safety.  Shift to zero- and low-emission vehicles For new registrations, Austria has a clear objective to shift the focus to zero-emission cars and light goods vehicles by 2030. For lorries and buses, specific incentives are planned to help significantly increase the number of zero-emissions vehicles by 2040
