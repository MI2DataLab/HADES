In 2018, for example, the energy sources petroleum, gases and coal accounted for around 80% of primary energy consumption (Table B15, based on the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy 2020).6 Most of the remainder was accounted for by renewables (14%), nuclear energy (6%) and other energy sources (<1%).                                                            6 Only fossil gases; biogases are included under renewable energies. 139  Net electricity exports are shown as negative figures.  The import dependency of the energy mix results primarily from high consumption of fossil fuels, most of which are imported (Table B16). Lignite represents an exception in this respect, since Germany produces all of the lignite it uses and even exports small quantities. Subsidies for sales of domestic hard coal ended in 2018. The share of hard coal which is imported will therefore rise to 100% from 2019 onwards. Given the liquid global market and international supply structures, the security of supply for imported hard coal is regarded as high. Gas consumption dropped by around 100 PJ between 2010 and 2018, but domestic gas production almost halved during the same period. The share of gas which is imported therefore rose significantly. Germany imports almost all the petroleum it uses. By way of contrast, it produces almost all its renewable energy and nuclear energy on a domestic basis.7  Table B15: Primary energy consumption by energy source, 2010 to 2018, in PJ   2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Hard coal 1 714 1 715 1 725 1 840 1 759 1 729 1 693 1 502 1 428 Lignite 1 512 1 564 1 645 1 629 1 574 1 565 1 511 1 507 1 481 Mineral oils 4 684 4 525 4 527 4 628 4 493 4 491 4 566 4 671 4 452 Gases 3 171 2 911 2 920 3 059 2 660 2 770 3 056 3 159 3 091 Nuclear energy7 1 533 1 178 1 085 1 061 1 060 1 001 923 833 829 Renewable energies 1 413 1 463 1 385 1 499 1 519 1 644 1 676 1 797 1 802 Other energy sources 254 267 244 222 237 234 247 243 222 Balance of trade for electricity*  -64  -23  -83  -116  -122  -174  -182  -189  -175 Total  14 217  13 599  13 447  13 822  13 180  13 262  13 491  13 523  13 129 * including small amounts of district heat Source: Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy 2020  There was a steady rise in the volume of hard coal imported from the former Soviet states to Germany between 2010 and 2018, with the figure reaching 41% by the end of this period. The former Soviet states and three other countries (the USA (21%), Australia (11%) and Colombia (8%)) account for over 80% of hard coal imports into Germany.  orts come from Russia (almost 32% in 2019), followed by Great Britain (approx. 12%) and Norway (approx. 11%). The contribution from Africa was approx. 20%, including Libya (approx. 10%) and Nigeria (6%). The share of OPEC member states was approx. 24%. Germany imported approx. 94% of its natural gas requirement; gas imports into Germany in 2019 came almost exclusively from three countries: Russia, Norway and the Netherlands. The Federal Network Agency records these figures as well as transit volumes as part of its monitoring report.

When examined in this way, the use of nuclear energy to generate electricity does not therefore increase dependency on imports. Only the balance of trade (net quantity) is shown for electricity.

Projections of development with existing policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)  In the baseline projection, primary energy consumption will drop by almost 1 400 PJ between 2021 and 2030. The drop in primary energy consumption for fossil fuels will mainly be driven by the increasing use of renewable energies in the buildings and electricity sectors and the drop in coal and petroleum consumption. The share of hard coal and lignite in electricity generation will see a particularly marked drop, while generation using natural gas will initially increase before falling slightly. This development will essentially be driven by long-term increases in carbon prices under the ETS. Domestic nuclear energy will no longer be used following the nuclear power phase-out from 2023 onwards8. The use of renewables will increase significantly by 2030, with the figure up by 13% compared to 2021. Consumption of renewables will only increase slightly between 2030 and 2040. This can be traced back to developments in the energy sector, where not all the existing plants which come offline will be replaced with new plants (particularly in the case of photovoltaics and biomass plants).

At the same time, however, consumption of gas remains relatively constant in the baseline scenario until 2025, particularly as a result of the increased use of natural gas to generate electricity. In view of the fact that over 95% of natural gas is imported, total imports will account for around 71% by 2023. With the slowly decreasing consumption of gas, the total import share will also decrease slightly to around 69% in 2030. The energy mix of German electricity imports will reflect the energy mix of the surrounding states 141  from which Germany obtains electricity. Depending on the market situation, this will include varying proportions of electricity from renewable energies (wind, solar, hydropower, bioenergy) and from conventional energy sources (in particular coal, natural gas and nuclear energy). The proportion of the latter may change due to reduction paths in some neighbouring states.
