INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 119   2.5 Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness   i. National objectives and funding targets for public and, where available, private research and innovation relating to the Energy Union, including, where appropriate, a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met On an international level, during the COP 21 in Paris, Italy signed up to the multilateral initiative which aims to promote an acceleration of technological innovation to support the energy transition by means of a significant increase in public funding dedicated to cleantech research. The initiative comprises a series of Innovation Challenges.  Italy took on the role of co-leadership, along with India and China, in the development of smart grids, its commitment to which has been well-in 2009, which led to the establishing of the ISGAN initiative (Implementing Agreement for a Co-operative Programme on Smart Grids) under an International Energy Agency framework. Regarding the other challenges, Italy has made the decision to be present, to potentially play an important role and to be ready, with its principal public research bodies and organisations, to contribute to the work groups that have been established on a voluntary basis, confirming an interest in participating in the work or at least in exchanging information about the activities. The national research system, other than smart grids, has shown interest in particular in alternative fuels, advanced energy materials, zero emission heating and cooling, and hydrogen.  The Italian Ministry of Economic Development, instructed by the President of the Mission Innovation Steering Committee, has created two levels of governance: the first with a task force of the ministers involved (Foreign Affairs, Environment, Education and Economy and Finance) and responsible primarily for the doubling of public funds, the second with an ented by the main public research organisations overseen by ministers: the National Agency for New Technologies, the National Research Council, and RSE S.p.A., to which were subsequently added the National Institute for Oceanography and Experimental Geophysics and the Italian Institute of Technology.  Figure 22  Leading countries and participants in the 8 Innovation Challenges of the Mission Innovation initiative  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 120   Italy views the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan as a fundamental instrument for meeting the new challenges posed by decarbonisation and agrees with the role the Commission has assigned to it in setting the objectives of the present Plan. Since the SET Plan was first introduced, Italy has progressively aligned its objectives and priorities for public investment in research and innovation in the energy sector with those of the SET Plan. As confirmation of this commitment, Italy follows all of the key actions of the SET Plan with its own experts, who have set up standing consultation groups with businesses and national research bodies, and engages in collaboration with other Member States that has often translated into joint participation in Horizon projects.    In addition, the conception and construction of the Innovation Challenges envisaged by Mission Innovation to a large extent reflect the SET Plan methodology and there are significant synergies between the two. Italy therefore considers the systematic and integrated management of research in the energy sector to be necessary, both for the SET Plan and for Mission Innovation, in order to improve efficiency and the effectiveness of the allocated resources.  In the course of drawing up this plan, we would like to take the opportunity to determine a long-term strategy (at least until 2030 and possibly to 2050) that indicates the objectives and priorities, and defines the essential measures for achieving the objectives identified, as well as reviewing priorities, guidelines and evaluations of competitiveness in the energy technology sector. The objective is to create the conditions for a system where the participation of industry and public and private Italian research centres in future research programmes provided either by the SET Plan/Horizon Europe or Mission Innovation is broader and less fragmented, effectively offers the opportunity to play a more decisive role and which has better success than has been achieved in the past. The principal objectives aim to: 1. monitor and develop product and process technologies vital to the energy transition; 2. promote the introduction of technologies, organisational and operational models and systems used for the energy transition and for safety. In particular, the research subjects concern: Goal 1) monitor and develop product and process technologies vital to the energy transition: - development of components and systems for highly efficient photovoltaics, which allows better exploitation of occupied areas and provides opportunities for new entrepreneurship; - development of storage systems, including thermal, electrochemical and power-to-gas, and related interfaces with the networks, in order to guarantee high levels of penetration for non-programmable renewables; - development of power-to-gas storage systems, particularly for the purpose of storage of excess production of non-programmable renewables by means of secure and reliable storage of hydrogen in liquid and gaseous energy carriers; - investigation of new options and advanced materials used for different applications in the energy cycle; - development of components and materials to improve the security and resilience of electricity networks; INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 121   - development and optimisation of technologies, components and materials to increase energy and environmental performance of buildings; - improvements to the energy efficiency of industrial products and processes, in particular with the development of techniques and plant solutions for boosting efficiency of industrial processes at high and low temperature; - in accordance with Key Action 3.2 of the SET Plan, which provides for the creation of Positive Energy Districts, the research and development of second-generation smart buildings, entirely based on electricity consumption and characterised by energy autonomy, increased flexibility, blockchain dialogue systems and smart contracts with the network, supported by integral monitoring methods; - study and implementation of methodologies for development of energy communities and definition of enabling technologies for the promotion of energy efficiency through consumer awareness; - in terms of mobility, the trialling and testing of various storage systems, as well as the development of innovative thermal electronic and battery controls for electric vehicles; - monitoring for purposes of safety and second-life use, devices for V2H (Vehicle To Home); - study and trialling of infrastructures for high-power electric recharging for local public transport, including through use of charging solutions incorporated along the route; - development of technologies for effective penetration of electricity carriers into end-use: in particular, research activities will be concentrated on complex heat pump systems or linked to non-conventional storage systems; study will also be made of the use of heat pumps at high temperatures in industrial processes in order to recover residual heat; - as regards renewable energy from the sea, the development of diverse solutions is planned for floating platforms capable of supporting complex sea conditions and the study of innovative materials for new kinds of high resistance anchoring and for coupling these to the floating platforms. Goal 2) promote the introduction of technologies, organisational and operational models and systems used for the energy transition and for safety: - development of architectural and operational models for the system and for electricity networks which promote the integration of renewable, non-programmable energy production, self-production, storage, energy communities and aggregators, and which take into account electrical penetration; - application of advanced information technologies, the internet of things, peer to peer electricity trading, to improve the safety and resilience of networks; - development of models and instruments to increase penetration of electricity carriers in the transport sector and to improve corresponding integration and interaction with the electricity system; - creation of demonstrators on a local-community level in order to establish innovative methods of management and control of the electricity network by means of a distributed approach, with the aim of increasing energy efficiency in the cycle of production, transport and distribution of electricity; - continue with the task of modernising electricity networks, including in the short-term, with a view to smart grids. The increase in distributed generation in fact requires real transformation of the distribution networks and of the related operational modes, with modernisation both of the hardware component (e.g. to also make INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 122   distribution networks also bi-directional) and of the software component (e.g. to enable demand response management initiatives). As regards financial resources in the context of Mission Innovation, Italy has undertaken to double the value of the resources portfolio for public research in the field of clean energy, from around 222 million in 2013 (the year taken as the baseline) to around 444 million from 2021, which represents for all intents and purposes the minimum commitment necessary to guarantee that the indicated targets will be reached.  As a guideline, the graphic below shows the evolution of expenditure for research and development (R&D) in Italy from 1963 to 2013, with a projection for the years to come up to 2020. In the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, Italy has adopted an expenditure target up to 2020 equal to 1.53% of GDP.  For measures to make electricity networks smart, in addition to the higher remuneration provided by the ARERA, other resources are also used where possible, in particular those from the European Structural Funds Programme.  Figure 23  Trend in R&S spending   ii. Where available, national 2050 objectives related to the promotion of clean energy technologies and, where appropriate, national objectives, including long-term targets (2050) for deployment of low-carbon technologies, including for decarbonising energy and carbon-intensive industrial sectors and, where applicable, for related carbon transport and storage infrastructure Looking ahead to 2050, it becomes imperative to rationalise and improve research and innovation in the energy sector, indicating national and funding objectives for research and innovation, both public and private. These objectives will have to be consistent with the priorities of the EU energy strategy and the SET Plan. These forecasts, although not consolidated, may however be a useful point of reference, on the basis of which we can reflect to better identify the technological options to prioritise, taking into account the strengths of the national system and the system requirements. In that regard, national instruments, European and national programmes will be used in a coordinated manner. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 123    Following the intense work carried out by the Italian Delegation as part of the working groups set up by the SET Plan for the implementation of the Key Actions, it is considered that renewable sources  among them solar PV and CSP in particular, and, in the longer term, sea energy (wave, tidal and current energy), storage systems (including hydrogen and power-to-gas and, more generally, the integration between the electricity system and other systems), system devices for safety of the electricity system, electric mobility, biorefineries, materials, processes and systems for energy efficiency of the industry and of buildings represent the subjects that have, concurrently, sufficient focus among research bodies, a considerable industrial basis and are of significant interest to the system, not only for the 2030 objectives but also and especially in the longer term view, looking ahead to 2050.  In particular regarding advanced energy materials (developed in particular as part of the IC6 of Mission Innovation and of the Electricity System Research Fund), the small and medium-sized businesses that make up a large part of the Italian industrial framework active in the sector have emphasised that is essential to initiate standardisation of the format of data, define the methods of collection, use and sharing of information and how correct management of intellectual property is an indispensable element to support the creation of this platform to accelerate the discovery of materials.  Italian participation in Mission Innovation therefore constitutes an opportunity in the coming decades for Italian industry operating in the sector of energy materials to participate in highly innovative research projects at a pre-competitive level, adopting a revolutionary and innovative approach to the discovery and development of new materials, which will form the basis for significant reinforcement of national companies in the sector on an international level. The increased potential for growth of clean energy technologies, the relevant role of the production of advanced materials, the skills of Italian researchers and the manufacturing tradition of our companies, especially small and medium-sized businesses, together with national energy strategies which focus decisively on decarbonisation, create conditions very favourable for public investment in research into energy materials to be transformed into a potent engine for industrial growth and qualified employment.  A lot can be done in Europe in the future, including in terms of development of infrastructure and digitalisation, and the margins for growth and improvement seem large, for Italy at least. This improvement must surely also take into account energy storage systems, which will certainly play a leading role in the future. It will be difficult to move towards decarbonisation in the energy sector without substantial progress in energy storage technologies. In particular, obstacles of a technical nature persist: beyond the specific technology, it is necessary to develop power, capacity, speed of reaction, efficiency and to reduce costs.  To achieve these results, given the need for substantial investment, it is of fundamental importance to create broad alliances on a European level and beyond, which bring together all of the parties involved (institutions, universities and research centres, companies) to support R&D activities in the sector and facilitate the introduction of new technologies onto the market, also developing measures that relate to the legislative and regulatory framework, with the aim of removing the barriers to entering the market and maintaining the attraction of financing and return on investments. In this respect, synergies in the university, research long-term public research and the innovative industrial research that most closely meets the national industry policy requirements, which are characterised by different technology readiness levels.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 124   In this light, Italian participation in the ETIP BatteRIes Europe initiative recently launched by the Commission, and in the European Batteries Alliance (EBA), is a very positive development, looking to 2050, despite   On the demand side, innovation in the energy sector, again looking ahead to 2050, will also pass through the use of blockchain and artificial intelligence. The creation of energy trading platforms based on blockchain will allow small energy producers and prosumers to sell excess electricity directly to other network users without the intervention of intermediaries thanks to so-called smart contracts.  In Italy, the development of smart grids will also be a dominant theme over the coming decades. It will benefit not only small producers but also large companies, insofar as the availability of a network in which all devices communicate among themselves will channel a quantity of information able to appropriately predict energy demand to software equipped with artificial intelligence. The increasingly widespread use of these technologies raises, in any case, a series of legal questions which will be an obstacle to full and complete exploitation of the relative potential.  With the growth of digitalisation, the risks connected to this will increase anyway. The field of cybersecurity is one where large spaces and opportunities are opening up for new or innovative players, but the vulnerabilities are also new. Therefore, the cyber research plan in the electricity sector in Italy will also have to address, in the next few years, the issue of innovation of energy infrastructure from a long-term perspective, by means of modelling and simulation activities, experimental activities for verifying preventative and reactive safety measures used in communication systems in the electricity sector.  In this same context, it must be considered that the evolution of the energy mix and of the set-up of the markets will increasingly involve, in an active role, new parties and new resources, at several voltage levels. This creates requirements for research and innovation in technologies to make the system more readable and the networks smarter, and to maintain development of the necessary instruments for safely managing the networks and the energy system.  Lastly it is considered to be of interest to encourage research into the potential benefits of integration of the electricity and gas systems through the development of pilot power-to-gas, power-to-hydrogen and gas-to-power projects; an integration that sees the gas network as a useful tool for development of an ever greater quantity of intermittent renewables, itself a carrier of renewable gases, and  through conversions of electrical energy carriers into gas and vice versa  a pillar of an integrated energy infrastructure, which enables the full potential of renewable sources to be exploited, also guaranteeing the storage of energy in the medium to long-term.  The evolution and development of the technologies previously cited would allow the storage of excess energy produced by non-programmable renewable energy sources (RES) into renewable energy carriers (biomethane, hydrogen, heat) increasing the overall efficiency of the energy system and initiating a synergic course between the two systems towards a possible fusion of the gas and electricity sectors into a single energy sector.   In future, it will be necessary to lay the groundwork for the integration of hydrogen into networks. Especially as produced using electricity from renewables, hydrogen can be obtained using technologies already available on the market and enables the development of innovative storage solutions such as power-to-gas. In addition, the injection of hydrogen INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 125   to the network without a specific designated use could help increase the sustainability of the existing networks and exploit the natural gas infrastructure. In the coming years research will need to focus on improving the performance and costs of electrolysers and on the controlled injection of growing amounts of hydrogen to the gas networks. Solutions envisaging two separate infrastructures (one 100% hydrogen and the other mixed), depending on market maturity levels, are also under study.  As regards the development of a hydrogen supply chain in the road transport sector, the primary need is to invest in research and development and in supply infrastructure. In the rail sector, hydrogen is a valid alternative when there is no electrified infrastructure, to replace diesel locomotives. In the marine sector too, studies and research on the use of hydrogen are under way with the involvement of the main Italian shipbuilding companies, but the development times and amounts of investment required are high.  It will become fundamental to establish a clear and definite legal and regulatory framework for the purpose of promoting the introduction of hydrogen into the current gas infrastructures, as a further source of energy in a mixture with natural gas (including by applying selective hydrogen separation systems, such as membranes). It will also be important to investigate the implications of its introduction into the storage system and in end uses, and provide potential incentives for different technological storage options aimed at developing the production of hydrogen from renewable sources in synergy with the electricity sector and the bioenergy sector, or from zero emissions like methane cracking. Potential investors in power-to-gas plants must have clear and reliable rules regarding the method for calculating the renewable component of the hydrogen produced.  From a research perspective, it will also be important to investigate syngas and sector coupling to achieve greater integration between electricity and gas, and to optimise existing synergies in generation, transport and distribution in the two sectors, with the ultimate aim of creating a hybrid, decarbonised European energy system.   The Ministry of Economic Development has set up a specific working group on hydrogen, which brings together over 70 national stakeholders interested in the development of and applications for this form of energy, in the production, storage and power-to-gas sectors, and in final uses in industry and transport.  iii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to competitiveness Italian production of renewable energy systems has decreased significantly in the last few years due to the European crisis and the subsequent period of economic stagnation, aggravated by growing competition from developing countries. Considering the investments that will be made in the coming years to comply with environmental targets, in Italy as in the rest of the world, it is important to define active policies for promoting the technology on offer and research in the energy sector, so as to support manufacturing in Italy.  Current mapping of the technological supply chain for production of systems and components for the systems and their potential in relation to the necessary investments for reaching the new 2030 climate targets solely in a national context offers us an up-to-date picture of the situation.  The renewable energy sector in Italy has experienced a slowdown, due mainly to the adoption of incentivising policies that concentrated growth in the period 2007-2012. This development INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 126   represented a boost for component producers located abroad, and not for Italian industry, which has suffered from competition from more competitive markets.  Italy succeeded instead in better grasping the opportunity in relation to manufacturing production of systems for increasing energy efficiency. A possible repeat of the growth trend could have a positive impact on the Italian production of components, provided that opportunities are taken to renew supply and make it more competitive, with a positive effect on the whole supply chain, from producers of raw materials to fitters and to companies for O&M services.  R&D activities in Italy are focused particularly on research into new technological solutions to promote integration of RES into the energy system. The strategic objective is to contribute to the creation of a true renewable energy industrial sector in Italy, which can have a positive impact in economic and occupational terms. From this point of view, it is necessary to improve cooperation with the research system and to establish technological transfer processes and know-how in order to develop technologies in line with company requirements to withstand the challenge of competition from international manufacturers.  The competitiveness challenge that Italy must meet is the development of an integrated industrial research system, with better contact and coordination between research and production, so as to accelerate the introduction of new technologies and products onto the market. The appropriate tools must therefore be implemented to promote Italian production of clean energy plants and investments in R&D must be increased.  Research and development in the technological sector have a global dimension and are not limited to national confines. The increase of funding in research and development provided through participation in Mission Innovation and the refinancing of the Electricity System Research Fund and for interventions and measures for technological and industrial development will certainly have a significant impact on the country, in that it will allow the level of technological innovation in manufacturing system to increase, with a subsequent increase in the level of qualified employment and competitiveness, also thanks to a further reduction in terms of costs for producing energy from renewable sources.  These factors will be able to help with reaching the 2030 and 2050 community targets, and those set out in the Paris Agreement on climate change, at a small overall cost to the system and to public finances. In addition, these investments will allow the use of advanced technologies, able to effectively contribute to the fight against and the adaptation to climate change, and at the same time to increase the competitiveness of the national production   In order to fully seize the opportunities to reinforce the national production structure provided by the investments programme, it will be necessary not only to promote R&D in the field of renewables but also to support the production chain for storage systems and digital architecture and automation linked to network services, given the ever closer links with the renewables supply chain, reinforcing cooperation at a Community level with initiatives such storage systems.  In fact, an element which is innovative in relation to the past and which will develop increasingly in the coming decades is represented by the digitalisation of the energy sector. The generation of data by the energy system (for example with improvement of technologies and measurement infrastructures, and the demand side management), increase in capacity INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 127   for data transmission by telecommunications networks (broadband) and accessibility of an enormous amount of data generated outside the energy system (for example the IoT, the Internet of Things) but also relevant to the sector, means that operators must be able to calculate and analyse (big data) both to improve their own functionality and to offer new services.   While it does not represent energy research in the strict sense, the phenomenon is an indicator of digitalisation, a subject addressed in a systematic manner way in the National Plan for Industry 4.0, which offers a series of support instruments based on company size. National competitiveness objectives could also be pursued by means of this instrument.  The entire circular economy, with geothermal energy, LNG and methane installations, the bioethanol supply chain, the production of electrochemical storage and batteries (not just lithium but also ion and sodium) and of course photovoltaic technologies are therefore the main segments on which to focus, including from the perspective of development in foreign markets.   The measures that Italy intends to adopt with the aim of fostering competitiveness in its industrial supply chains by exploiting the opportunities opened up by the energy transition, especially in terms of research into and the development of new technologies, will be closely monitored periodically and subjected to cost-benefit analyses. In this way, and after discussions with the main production supply chains involved in the transition, with citizens and with the Regions affected, the measures will be updated to take full advantage of the opportunities provided by the energy transition as a driver of sustainable growth following the Green New Deal approach.
