        169  4.6. Research, innovation and competitiveness  (i) Current situation of the low-carbon-technologies sector and, to the extent possible, its position on the global market (that analysis is to be carried out at Union or global level)  The low-carbon technology sector in Denmark in this chapter includes all carbon neutral technologies (wind, solar, hydro power, bio mass etc.) as well as technologies that support necessary means for the transition to a low-carbon energy system (smart grids, storage etc.). The sector employs around 31.200 full-time workers, which corresponds to 43% of the total employees in the energy sector.63 The low-carbon industry is more active within research and innovation, with an average of 9 out of 100 employees working in the field of research and innovation compared to on average 5 out of 100 employees in traditional Danish companies.64 Denmark has in the years 2010-17 seen an increase in the export of energy technology of 31,5%, compared to an on average increase in EU15 of 9,9% (Energistyrelsen, 2017).  Denmark mainly exports to other EU countries, but export of energy technology to the US and China are on the rise.   Figure 45 shows the competitiveness of onshore wind, offshore wind and solar PV by their levelized cost of electricity (LCoE). In 2017 the cost of producing electricity by wind and solar was lower than by a coal-fired power plant and their competitiveness is still increasing rapidly.                                                             63 Damvad Analytics 2018 64 Danmarks Statistik         170  Figure 45. Levelized cost of electricity generation with years of final investment decision 2015-2040 [EUR/MWh] for utility scale wind and solar and a coal-fired power plant.    For detailed information on the gross final energy consumption and the RES by technology see section 4.2.2.  (ii) Current level of public and, where available, private research and innovation spending on low-carbon-technologies, current number of patents, and current number of researchers The public spending for research and innovation programmes65 in renewable technologies in 2017 is listed in Table 15 (ref. Energiforskning.dk). The numbers in Table 15 include spending from three public funding programmes (Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program, Innovation Fund Denmark and ELFORSK).                                                                 65 In addition to the specific programs for new renewable technologies, the public research institutions perform R&D within renewable energy technologies funded through unspecified funds such as the general university funds.         171  Table 15.

EUR Biomass and waste 0,8 Energy efficiency 17,4 Hydrogen and fuel cells 5,1 Smart grids and systems 24,6 Solar energy 1,3 Wave energy 0,2 Wind energy 7,3 Other 1,4 Total 58,0  Not all categories in the table directly supports low-carbon technologies. But they support necessary means for the transition to a low-carbon energy system. In 2015, private companies spent approximately 536 Mill. EUR on research and development in energy research (Damvad Analytics, 2018).  Denmark has appr. 42 patents pr. mill. inhabitants in technologies related to minimizing climate changes. (iii) Breakdown of current price elements that make up the main three price components (energy, network, taxes/levies)   The following tables show a breakdown of electricity and gas prices on energy, network and taxes/levies for businesses and households.   Table 16 and Table 17 show price components for businesses and households:  for businesses, the energy price accounts for approximately 20-50% of the total price   for households, the energy price only accounts for 10-20% of the total price  Table 16. Price components for businesses in 2017[EUR cent/kwh]         172  Table 17. Price components for households in 2017[EUR cent/kwh]  Table 18 and Table 19 show gas price components for businesses and for households:  for businesses, the energy accounts for approximately 30% of the total price before refundable taxes. However, some business consumers are eligible for a tax refund, after that, the energy price on average constitute up to approximately 60-70% of the total price for business with high gas consumption.   for households, the energy price accounts for approximately 30-35% of the total price.

(iv) Description of energy subsidies, including for fossil fuels Denmark provides subsidies for renewable energy technologies, e.g. onshore wind, offshore wind, solar PV, biomass and biogas. Subsidies are given as production subsidy per kWh, normally for a limited number of years. The costs of renewable technologies is steadily declining, and becoming competitive with fossil fuel sources.           173  It is a strong political objective to promote future electricity production from renewable energy on market conditions free of subsidies.   The current energy subsidies are described below. For fossil fuel subsidies, see section 3.1.3 (iv).  Energy subsidies for utility scale plants   Biomass fired power plants receive a fixed premium of 2 EUR cent/kWh electricity for non-depreciated plants. Electricity generated from biomass is closely related to generation of heat. Hence, the tax exemption on heat generated from biomass has a huge impact on how much electricity is generated from biomass. Depreciated plants will receive a subsidy covering only operational costs (subject to approval from the EU commission). (Energistyrelsen, 2019b)  Subsidies for offshore windfarms are set through tenders. Kriegers Flak is the latest settled Danish offshore tender. It resulted in a feed in tariff of 5 EUR cent/kWh for the first 30 TWh for the 605 MW windfarm, which is set to be commissioned in 2021 (Energistyrelsen, 2019e)  As of 2018 the subsidies for future offshore wind and solar PV will be offered through a tendering procedure, allowing these technologies to compete against each other and provide a downward pressure on the subsidy level. Later more technologies will be included in the tenders and allow these to compete for support. The latest tender in 2018 resulted in a total of approximately 260 MW onshore wind turbines and approx. 280 MW solar PV installations, with a weighted average price premium of the winning bids of approximately 0.31 EUR cent/kWh (Energistyrelsen, 2019f)  Heat produced from biomass receives an indirect subsidy by being exempted from CO2 and energy tax (Energistyrelsen, 2019d)  In Denmark, the use of biogas is supported through various aid schemes, and different types of end-use are eligible for support. The subsidy is paid to the end-user of biogas, i.e. where biogas is used to produce heat/electricity, or upgraded and injected into the gas grid. There are currently 5 recognized uses of biogas (electricity production, upgrading to biomethane and injected to grid, transport, heat production, industrial processes). The current subsidy schemes are however coming to an end and will not be granted to new producers after january 1st 2020.  Electricity producers using biogas are eligible for a feed-in tariff which can be received in two forms. Either as a CfD where the electricity spot price is included (0,114 EUR/kWh in 2019), or a price premium (0,060 EUR/kWh) paid in addition to the electricity spot price. In addition to the tariff, the support scheme includes a variable rate which is regulated by the market price of natural gas (~0,031 EUR/kWh in 2019). If the market price of natural gas drops below a certain floor price, the subsidy increases and vice versa.   Biogas that is upgraded to biomethane and injected into the gas grid is also eligible for aid. Biomethane producers are paid a feed in tariff (0,110 EUR/GJ in 2019) plus a variable rate which is regulated by the market price of natural gas (~0,031 EUR/GJ in 2019).         174   Biogas used in industrial processes/for transportation is subsidized through a CfD (5,23 EUR/GJ) plus the variable rate tied to the market price of natural gas.  Biogas used for heating purposes is eligible for the variable rate only.  Energy subsidies for residential scale plants:  Residential wind turbines and solar PV systems receive an indirect subsidy by being exempted from electricity tax, public service obligation (PSO) and grid tariffs of the part of the produced electricity that is used for self-consumption behind the meter. This means that the prosumer on instant settlement has to pay tax on all electricity supplied from the collective grid  just like any other consumer of electricity. The excess production (the production that is not self-consumed) is sold to the collective grid at the SPOT price.  Furthermore, the Danish government has agreed to lower the tax on heat produced from electricity. The tax is reduced from 4,12 Euro/kWh electricity to 2,08 Euro/kWh electricity from 2021. This is believed to increase the use of heat pumps, both in residential and collective heating. It is thereby a means to support the electrification of the heat sector and the green transition.
