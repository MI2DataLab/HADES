4 IMPACT ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MEASURES 208 4 IMPACT ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MEASURES 4.1 Introduction This section includes the main results obtained in the evaluation of the economic, employment, social and public health impact of the measures and actions envisaged in this Plan.  The study, following the Governance Regulation, differentiates between a Baseline Scenario (with no additional measures) and a Target Scenario (with additional measures). In the Baseline Scenario, by 2030 the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Spain increase by 5.6% compared to 1990, while they decrease by 23% in the Target scenario.  The impact analysed in this study is the effect of the policies and measures established in the INECP that make it possible to achieve this decarbonisation objective, together with the other measures associated with the other dimensions of the INECP.  4.2 Methodology The analysis of the economic impact of the INECP has been carried out using the DENIO economic model, which uniformly integrates the information from the policies introduced in the TIMES-SINERGIA energy model. The main results of this analysis are presented in this section. However, there is a more complete and exhaustive study that includes all the information related to the economic impact and that is available to the public56. DENIO is a Dynamic Econometric Input-Output model of the Spanish economy, which has its origin in the FIDELIO model frdeveloped by the Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3) in collaboration with the Centre of Economic Scenario Analysis and Research (CESAR). This model makes it possible to simulate the effect of a wide range of economic, fiscal, energy or environmental policies.  DENIO is characterised by a detailed description of the Spanish economy in terms of sectors (74 sectors), households (22,000 households representative of the national population) and 16 consumption categories. The model also includes detailed public sector accounts, including the income and expenditure of the public administrations, as well as the deficit and public debt. This model was estimated econometrically using the latest data available from the National Statistical Institute, the Bank of Spain and EUROSTAT.  In addition, the information about the changes in air pollutant emissions (obtained by the Inventory Unit of MITEC]), was entered in the TM5-FASST air quality model. The TM5-FASST model is a global model developed by the JRC that makes it possible to analyse the effects, in terms of health, resulting from different emissions scenarios or paths. Using meteorological and atmospheric chemistry information, the model analyses how the atmospheric emissions from a certain source generate concentrations of pollutants, exposure in the population and, consequently, damage to health and premature deaths.                                                              56 The full study is available on the MITECO website: https://www.miteco.gob.es/es/ 4 IMPACT ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MEASURES 209 The model has previously been used by BC3 to conduct studies on co-benefits of mitigation for health together with the World Health Organization (WHO). Moreover, inter alia, it has been used by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to project the economic costs associated with air pollution. In this work, and to be consistent, the model has been calibrated with the harm to health reported by the WHO in Spain.  A brief technical description of the DENIO (together with the integration of the microeconomic information into the model) and TM5-FASST models can be found in Annex B of the INECP.  Finally, as in any prospective study, it has been necessary to make different assumptions and projections for 2030. For example, the evolution of GDP and population up to 2030 has been taken directly from the macroeconomic scenario prepared by MINECO. Moreover, the projections for 2030 regarding investment costs for renewables, the prices of energy goods and CO2 allowances are those recommended by the European Commission for all Member States for the preparation of their respective INECPs. The variation in the cost of electricity has been estimated by REE, based on data provided by the State Secretariat for Energy.  4.3 ESTIMATED INVESTMENTS FROM THE INECP, 2021-2030 A very significant part of the economic impacts results from the (additional) investments associated with the INECP. These investments have been quantified using different sources. The investments associated with energy-saving measures and energy efficiency come from the IDAE. The investments associated with renewables and heat pumps come from estimates made by the State Secretariat for Energy using the TIMES-SINERGIA model. The information on investments in transmission and distribution networks and interconnections comes from different sources, including REE. The information regarding the investment of the non-energy non-ETS sectors comes from the Spanish Office for Climate Change (Oficina Española de Cambio Climático). BC3 has made the appropriate estimations for any matters regarding which there was no information, as is the case of the investments in recharging points or investments associated with the electrification of transport.  Once this information is added, it is estimated that the total investments needed to achieve the INECP targets will amount to EUR 241  bn) between 2021 and 2030. These investments can be grouped by measures or core levers of the energy transition, and would be distributed as follows (see Figure 4.1):    bn)  Renewable energy: 38%  bn)   bn)   bn)  bn can be considered as additional investments compared to the Baseline. These additional investments are those that can be imputed to the INECP and those that will therefore generate the economic impact. The total and additional investments differ because in the Baseline Scenario there are also investments such as in the case of renewables in the electricity sector, for example, where an installation with new 4 IMPACT ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MEASURES 210 renewable capacity is being considered to meet the increase in demand and also the investments in associated networks.   bn)  Source: Basque Centre for Climate Change, 2019 Taking the source of the investments into account, a very substantial part of the total investment would be made by the private sector (80% of the total), mainly linked to the deployment of renewables, distribution and transmission networks, and a large part of the saving and efficiency measures. The rest would be made by the public sector (20% of the total), in energy saving and energy efficiency measures, and in actions associated with promoting sustainable mobility and modal shift. In the case of public sector investments, a portion is expected to come from European funds.  4.4 RESULTS The results obtained come from adding the flow of additional investments, the energy mix and the energy prices from the TIMES-SINERGIA model to the DENIO model. Before explaining the main results, it is important to make three preliminary considerations:   The investments made using public funds (except investment from European sources) must be financed using other budget lines so that they make it possible to maintain the budgetary equilibrium. The analysis done has been included in the deficit-reduction path agreed in the Stability and Growth Pact, which entails reducing the deficit to zero in 2022 and then maintaining the budgetary equilibrium to also reduce the public debt on the path set out to 2032. Likewise, in the case of households, it is assumed that the total amount of indebtedness remains constant and that, therefore, the additional investments made by households are financed through savings or by reducing spending.   4 IMPACT ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MEASURES 211  It is considered that there are no restrictions on investment for companies and that investment will take place at the usual cost of capital. This is compatible with medium- and long-term regulation and planning that provides security and certainty to investors. investments from the private sector. This is consistent with the current situation in Spain, which has a high idle capacity and unemployment rate, and, in general, with the situation in the euro area, which has historically low interest rates.   The study assumes that the degree of external competitiveness does not change. In other words, companies maintain a capacity to respond to market conditions that is similar to the current one, not higher or lower, in a context where other neighbouring countries are also introducing policies geared towards complying with the Paris Agreement.  4.4.1 Macroeconomic impacts  The macroeconomic impacts are determined by two main effects. The fieffect, which generates an economic boost throughout all the sectoral supply chains. The second energy saving (including the reduction in the price of electricity), which makes it possible to increase spending on other products and services, and from the shift in the energy mix, which replaces imported fossil fuels with renewables that generate greater added value within the country.   The  effect produces a very notable impact, especially in the initial years of the Plan. It is important to note that not every investment turns into added value and job creation, since one part (around 20% and depending on the sectors) requires goods that are imported, something the model allows for capturing in detail and that is included in the results. Moreover, the impact of the investments is not permanent; it will only take place during the years in which the investments are implemented.   The  also creates a result that is more pronounced towards 2030, when the policies are encouraging the reduction of energy consumption and energy prices are higher. In fact, fossil fuel imports are reduced by EUR 67 billion between 2021 and 2030 compared to the Baseline Scenario. These impacts, unlike those associated with the investments, do remain over time.  Figure 4.2 shows the effect on GDP disaggregated by measure type; the impact associated with the INECP is the difference between the GDP in the Target scenario compared to the Baseline. The INECP will generate an increase in GDP between EUR 16.5 and 25.7 bn per year (1.8% of GDP in 2030). The positive impact comes mainly from the economic boost generated by new investments in renewables, savings and efficiency, and networks, and from the effects of the    4 IMPACT ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MEASURES 212   m)   Source: Basque Centre for Climate Change, 2019  Figures 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 show the impacts on GDP from the demand side, supply side and income side.  The GDP from the demand side (Figure 4.3) shows that the increase in GDP is mainly channelled towards gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), as could be expected given the investments considered in the Plan. Household final consumption also increases steadily since the increase in GDP resulting from the investments generates an increase in compensation of employees and in the gross operating surplus, which, in turn, has a positive impact on household disposable income and household consumption.  There is also a positive impact on public administration consumption as the increase in tax revenue makes it possible to increase spending, keeping the deficit constant.  Finally, the negative external balance simply reflects the closing hypothesis of the chosen model in which exports remain constant, while imports grow thanks to the increase in economic activity. The exception is energy imports, which decrease due to lower domestic consumption of coal and oil. 4 IMPACT ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MEASURES 213  m)   Source: Basque Centre for Climate Change, 2019  Figure 4.4 shows the change in GDP based on the supply side, which makes it possible to see the sectors where this increase in added value originates.  Firstly, a net increase should be noted in all major sectors, with the sole exception of mining. The added value of the industrial sector grows substantially (between EUR 2.8 bn in 2021 and EUR 5.1 bn in 2030), mainly boosted by the deployment in renewables, networks and electrification of transport and renewal of the vehicle fleet. The energy sector also increases its activity due to replacing imported energy with indigenous renewable energy (between EUR 345 m and EUR 1.4 bn). The value added of the construction sector also increases notably (between EUR 1.9 bn in 2021 and EUR 3 bn in 2030) as a result of the investments in housing upgrades and the development of all the infrastructure needed to develop renewables or electric vehicles.  Finally, the service sector takes up a significant part of the increase in the added value given its weight in the Spanish economy (it represents 65% of the GDP). This increase in activity is explained by the increase in the services directly associated with the Plan, and also by the indirect and knock-on effect resulting from the increased economic growth. 4 IMPACT ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MEASURES 214  m)   Source: Basque Centre for Climate Change, 2019  Finally, the impact on GDP based on the income side (Figure 4.5) makes it possible to see the distribution of income generated between capital and labour.  Gross operating surplus increases notably (between EUR 7.6 bn and EUR 13.8 bn) since part of the impact comes from investments channelled towards capital-intensive industries (industry, construction, energy).  Employee remuneration also increases very significantly (between EUR 7.4 bn and EUR 11.5 bn) mainly as a result of job creation. Finally, it should be noted that the gross operating surplus also includes mixed incomes that include the income from small or individual enterprises and also from self-employed persons.   m)  Source: Basque Centre for Climate Change, 2019 4 IMPACT ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MEASURES 215 4.4.2 Employment impacts  Figure 4.6 shows the effect on employment between the Target Scenario and the Baseline disaggregated by measure type. The INECP generates a net increase in employment of 253,000 and 348,000 people per year (a 1.7% increase in employment in 2030). The unemployment rate would decrease compared to the Baseline Scenario, by between 1.1% and 1.6%. As in the case of the impact on GDP, the employment comes from the new investments in renewables, saving and efficiency, and networks and, from 2025, the effect resulting from the energy shift.  Investments in renewables would generate between 107,000 and 135,000 jobs/year, while investments in energy saving and efficiency would generate between 56,000 and 100,000 jobs/year. Investments in networks and electrification of the economy would generate 46,000 jobs/year by 2030. The energy shift would indirectly generate up to 118,000 jobs/year in 2030. Finally, the negative impact associated with disinvestments is also shown, considered in nuclear power plants and coal from 2025 in relation to the Baseline.  Figure 4.6. Impact on employment by measure type (thousands of people/year)  Source: Basque Centre for Climate Change, 2019  Figure 4.7 shows the net jobs generated by major sectors. As in the case of GDP, net employment is positive, except in the case of the mining sector. Employment in the industrial sector increases by 38,000 to 61,000 people/year, while in construction it increases by 33,000 to 48,000 people/year. Finally, in the service sector it increases in a more notable way, by 175,000 to 228,000 people/year, as a result of the services associated with the new investments and due to the shift in consumption structure. 4 IMPACT ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MEASURES 216 Figure 4.7. Impact on employment by sector (thousands of people/year)  Source: Basque Centre for Climate Change, 2019  Figure 4.8. Impact on employment by industry (thousands of people/year)   Source: Basque Centre for Climate Change, 2019    4 IMPACT ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MEASURES 217 Finally, Figure 4.8 shows the impact on employment in 2030 for the industries in the national accounts (National Classification of Economic Activities). The industries that would generate most employment would be trade and repair (62,300 jobs), manufacturing industry (57,800 jobs) and construction (48,100 jobs).  The electricity sector would have net job creation (1,700 jobs), including the loss of employment associated with the decrease in activity and disinvestment in coal and nuclear plants. The only industry, according to this aggregation, that obtains a net loss of employment is mining and quarrying (-700 jobs), resulting from the decrease in coal mining activity.  4.4.3 Impacts on public administrations  This section shows the economic impact on the public administration accounts. Figure 4.9 shows how, as a result of the increase in economic activity, government revenues increase significantly (between EUR 7.6 and EUR 19.8 bn at current prices) and all without altering the tax rates. In particular, taxes on income, wealth and capital would increase by between EUR 3.4 bn and EUR 11.6 bn, and contributions to Social Security between EUR 2.4 bn and EUR 6.1 bn. Although the revenue would decrease for some taxes, such as taxes on energy and hydrocarbons, this would be offset by an increase in revenue through other channels.  Similarly, this increase in revenue would allow a similar increase in public expenditure, as shown in Figure 4.10. In fact, the increase in revenue would make it possible to cover all the expenses linked to the public financing of the INECP itself, between EUR 2.9 bn and EUR 6.9 bn, and to free up a significant amount of resources for other expenses and transfers. In total, an additional EUR 4.7 bn to EUR 12.8 bn would be available to the public sector for other expenses, investments or transfers not associated with the INECP.

Impact on public administration (PA)   Source: Basque Centre for Climate Change, 2019  Finally, it is important to note that the increase in public spending is exclusively due to the knock-on economic impact of the INECP and not from generating more deficit and debt, as one of the constraints that have been introduced is compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. In fact, compliance with the deficit path combined with the higher level of economic activity allows the ratio between debt and GDP to decrease by 2.4% in 2030 compared to the Baseline Scenario (Figure 4.11).  Figure 4.11. Debt/GDP ratio (% compared to Baseline)  Source: Basque Centre for Climate Change, 2019   4 IMPACT ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MEASURES 219 4.4.4 Social impacts  In the case of the social impacts, the results obtained for a whole set of indicators make it possible to conclude that the measures57 in the INECP favour households with a lower income and, especially, vulnerable groups.  Figure 4.12 shows the effect on household disposable income by income quintile ratio, where quintile 1 groups the 20% of households with the lowest income and quintile 5 the 20% of households with the highest. The figure shows that the measures in the INECP have a progressive effect. Disposable income increases in all quintiles, resulting from the increased economic growth, but it increases to a greater extent in the quintiles with lower income, due in part to the effects of the aid received by these groups. Quintiles 1 and 2 see their disposable incomes increase by 3.8% and 2.8%, while quintiles 4 and 5 increase their income by 1.8% and 1%, respectively.  Figure 4.12. Variation in disposable income in 2030 by income quintiles (%)  Source: Basque Centre for Climate Change, 2019  Figure 4.13 shows the effect of the INECP on the spending of vulnerable households, as defined in Royal Decree-Law 15/2018 of 5 October 2018. The figure shows an increase in spending of both vulnerable households and non-vulnerable households, with the effect on vulnerable households being more positive as they benefit in a more significant way, not only from the energy saving and reduction of the energy bill, but also due to the aid associated with the Plan towards lower-income households. Vulnerable households increase their spending in 2030 by 2.1% and non-vulnerable households increase it by 1.1%.                                                                 57 The policies analysed in the INECP have included the design of some measures with redistributive impact such as aid related to housing upgrades, the promotion of own consumption for vulnerable households and extending the current  4 IMPACT ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MEASURES 220 Figure 4.13. Variation in final consumption between vulnerable and non-vulnerable households (%) Variation in consumption with respect to the Baseline (%)  Source: Basque Centre for Climate Change, 2019   4.4.5 Impacts on pollution and public health  According to the WHO, in 2010 there were a total of 14,042 premature deaths caused by air pollution in Spain. The pollutants that caused the most effects on health are fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3).  PM2.5 emissions are the leading cause of premature death resulting from pollution, causing problems in the respiratory (lung cancer), cardiovascular or brain (ischaemic attacks) systems. As regards ozone (O3), although it is usually associated with damage to farming systems, it also produces significant effects on health, related to respiratory diseases.  The measures set out in the INECP manage to reduce both GHG emissions and those of the leading primary pollutants that generate final concentrations of PM2.5 and O3. Figure 4.14a shows the decrease in emissions calculated by the MITECO Inventory Unit based on the new energy mix.  Primary emissions of PM2.5, the most harmful to health, decrease by 33% as a result of using cleaner technologies. Moreover, sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrous oxides (NOx), the main pollutants for the formation of secondary PM2.5, decrease by 38% and 35%, respectively. The reduction of SO2 is mainly due to the decrease in coal consumption in the electricity sector, and in the case of NOx due to the improvement in the efficiency of internal combustion engines and the electrification of transport. 4 IMPACT ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MEASURES 221 Figure 4.14. a) Change in emissions in 2030 compared to the Baseline Scenario b) Premature deaths in Spain due to air pollution in 2030  a) Variation in emissions (%) b) Premature deaths (persons)  Source: Basque Centre for Climate Change, 2019  These reductions in the emission levels of air pollutants are associated with significant improvements in terms of environmental quality, which translate into a reduction of damage to health in the form of fewer premature deaths. As Figure 4.14b shows, premature deaths from air pollution in 2030 are reduced by about 2,400 people, going from 8,913 in the Baseline Scenario to 6,521 in the Target Scenario, a reduction in percentage terms of 27%.  4.4.6 Sensitivity analysis  This section includes a sensitivity analysis on fossil fuel prices58 as at 2030 that have been used to carry out this study. The sensitivity analysis has only been done on the DENIO model.  In this exercise, the central scenario of the European Commission is compared with two other alternative scenarios with a range of +/-25% in all fossil fuel prices. For example, in the case of oil, and according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), a scenario complying with the Paris Agreement would mean a 20% overall reduction in oil consumption as at 2030 compared to current levels, a drop in demand that should contain the rise in prices. However, other organisations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) indicate that there could currently be upply and push up prices. This sensitivity analysis makes it possible to evaluate a greater range of future solutions regarding which there is high uncertainty.  Table 4.1 sets out the results of the sensitivity analysis regarding GDP and the macroeconomic picture. It is observed that a lower increase in fossil fuel prices means a reduction of the impact in terms of GDP, and vice versa. A 25% reduction in prices compared to those in the central scenario  terms, while a 25% increase entails an increase of 9%.                                                               58 These prices have been recommended by the European Commission. 4 IMPACT ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MEASURES 222 The change in fossil fuel price ultimately affects the reduction of energy bills resulting from the saving and efficiency measures. Thus, in an environment of high energy prices, the expected energy bill savings will be greater, which will lead to a greater expansionary effect of the INECP. The opposite would occur in a low price environment.  Table 4.1. Analysis of energy price sensitivity on GDP in 2030.

Net job creation would go from 348,000 people/year in the central scenario in 2030 to a range between 318,000 and 366,000 people/year. A 25% reduction in fossil fuel price generates a 10% reduction in job creation, while a 25% increase entails an increase of 5%. The reasons behind this higher/lower increase are the same as those mentioned with regard to GDP.  Table 4.2. Analysis of energy price sensitivity on net employment in 2030.

These effects are beyond the scope of this sensitivity analysis, which has been limited to changes in the DENIO economic model.   4 IMPACT ANALYSIS OF POLICIES AND MEASURES 223 4.4.7 Conclusions  The results of this impact analysis lead to the conclusion that the effect of the INECP is an economic opportunity with significant economic, employment, social and public health benefits. Below are some conclusions with the main figures that support this conclusion:   The INECP will mobilise EUR 241 billion of investment in Spain between 2021 and 2030, which will generate a significant expansionary effect on the economy.  The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will increase by between EUR 16.5 and 25.7 billion between 2021 and 2030, an increase of 1.8% in 2030 with respect to the Baseline, both because of the investments planned and because of the greater energy savings and efficiency and the lower importation of fossil fuels.  The measures to be implemented will generate between 253,000 and 348,000 new jobs between 2021 and 2030 (non-cumulative annual employment), an increase of 1.7% in 2030 over the Baseline Scenario. Investments in renewables alone will generate between 107,000 and 135,000 jobs over the decade, benefiting manufacturing, construction, and services associated with the renewable sector.  The INECP will allow savings of EUR 67 billion up to 2030 compared to the Baseline Scenario, due to the reduction in demand for imported fossil fuels, which will also improve energy security as this source is replaced by indigenous energies.  The INECP will favour lower income households and vulnerable groups, which will see their income and consumption increase by a greater proportion than other households.  Finally, the measures will have a very positive impact in terms of health. The improvement in air quality with the measures foreseen in the Plan will prevent the premature death of around 2,400 people in Spain in 2030, a reduction of 27% compared to the Baseline Scenario.
