3.1. Decarbonisation  3.1.1. GHG emissions and CO2 sequestration Since Latvia is a member of the EU and the UN, its climate objectives are in line with EU climate policy objectives, as well as the international climate policy  the Convention, Kyoto Protocol, and Paris Agreement123. At EU level, there is a common GHG emission reduction target that is divided into two parts: activities covered by the ETS and activities not covered by the ETS (non-ETS activities). Common EU targets for the period from 2021 to 2030:  ETS operators have to reduce the total GHG emissions in the EU by 43 % in the given period (compared to the GHG emissions of these operators in 2005).   the total non-ETS GHG emissions have to be reduced by 30 % in the given period (compared to GHG emissions from non-ETS activities in 2005). Enforcement of the target is the responsibility of the EC. In order to meet this target, conditions for the operation of ETS and the responsibilities of ETS operators have been approved by EU legislation. GHG emission reduction measures for ETS operators have been established in a coordinated way in Directive 2003/87/EC and the development and implementation of these measures is ensured by the EC together with the EU Member States by complying with the requirements and conditions laid down by Directive 2003/87/EC. Latvian economic operators also participate in the ETS. The GHG emission reduction target from non-ETS activities (hereinafter  non-ETS target) is redistributed among all EU Member States, including Latvia. The target for each EU Member State and conditions for its fulfilment for the period from 2021 to 2030 are laid down by Regulation 2018/842. Latvia has to ensure a GHG emission reduction from non-ETS activities by 6 % in the period from 2021 to 2030 compared to the GHG emissions from non-ETS activities in 2005. The target for the entire period is divided into binding annual targets. The commitments for GHG emission reduction and CO2 removals from LULUCF activities have been set for each EU Member State, including Latvia. The target and conditions for its fulfilment for the period from 2021 to 2030 are laid down by Regulation 2018/841. The transport energy life-cycle GHG emission intensity reduction target is set in Article 7a of Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Council Directive 93/12/EEC , which lays down that, as from 31 December 2020,each Member State must ensure that its fuel suppliers reduce the intensity of energy life-cycle GHG emissions for supplied for final consumption in transport by at least 6 % compared to the baseline standard of 2010. Sustainable biofuel  biofuels and biomass fuels produced from food and animal feed crops (first generation biofuels) and advanced biofuels, alternative fuels, electricity  should be used to meet this target.                                                       123https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/english_paris_agreement.pdf; https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/10a01.pdf; https://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=288575 79  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 Table 132 removals and their performance indicators Policy outcome in the sub-dimension of GHG reduction and CO2 removals of the decarbonisation dimension Actual value Target value 2017124 2020 2030125 total reduction of GHG emissions  % to 1990 -57 - -65126 Mt CO2 eq. 11.3 12.13 9.2 GHG emissions from non-ETS activities127 % to 2005 +8.4 +17 -6 Mt CO2 eq. 9.3 10 8 GHG emissions from ETS activities % to 2005 -28.2 -21 - Mt CO2 eq. 2.0 2.3 - LULUCF accounting categories128 (million units)129 - - 3.1130 Transport energy life-cycle GHG emission intensity reduction (%) 0.8 6  3.1.1.1. -ETS activities for 2030 and annual objectives for 20212030 Annual non-ETS targets for Latvia for the period from 2021 to 2030 will be set only in 2020-2021 by using the latest available verified GHG inventory data for 2005, 2016, 2017, and 2018 by adopting the EC implementing act referred to in Article 4 of Regulation 2018/842. The annual GHG emission reduction specified in the Plan is therefore indicative. However, considering the EC recommendations and Article 4(a)(1) of Regulation 2018/1999, Latvia has to calculate the binding annual emission allocations for 2021 to 2030 according to the formula provided for in Regulation 2018/842.

Accounting of GHG emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector from 2020 to 2030  Commitments and GHG emission and CO2 accounting rules in the LULUCF sector for EU Member States for the period after 2020 are laid down by Regulation 2018/841. According to Article 4 of Regulation 2018/841, Latvia, making use of the provided flexibilities, shall ensure that the amount of GHG emissions accounted according to the accounting rules laid down in the Regulation does not exceed the amount of CO2 removals accounted in the land accounting categories specified in Article 2 of Regulation 2018/841: afforested land, deforested land, managed cropland, managed grassland, managed forest land, managed wetland (accounted from 2026). The accounting of GHG emissions and CO2 removals is performed according to Regulation 2018/841 by calculating changes in the amount of GHG emissions and/or CO2 removals measured against the reference levels laid down by Regulation 2018/841, except afforested lands and deforested lands, as these land -set and the accounting includes GHG emissions and CO2 removals over the entire period. The LULUFC target is expected to be reached within the following LULUFC land use categories  cropland, grasslands and afforested forest. At the same time, there are plans to study and implement solutions focusing on the reduction of emissions affected by organic soils in the LULUFC sectors.     Table 15.

Other binding objectives in this category and other national objectives and targets  NDPL2020 lays down the target for the intensity of GHG emissions (tonnes of CO2 eq. per LVL 1,000 of GDP) for 2020 and 2030, which is 1,13 and 1,07 t CO2 eq./LVL 1,000 of GDP.  LPACC2030135 sets as the main overarching goal  economy, infrastructure, buildings, and nature to the effects of climate change and promote the use of opportunities created by climate change. LPACC2030 does not include quantified targets with regard to the aspects of ensuring adaptation to climate change. 3.1.2. Renewable energy  At EU level, a common binding 2030 target for all Member States for RE in the total final energy consumption is established in Directive 2018/2001136,  a 32 % share of RE in the total final energy consumption in the EU (including electricity, heating, and transport) with national targets for 2020 as the baseline (as of 2021, the share of RE in the final energy consumption cannot be lower than national targets for 2020). All EU Member States have to determine their national contributions to the common EU target.

The values will be recalculated in 2021, taking into account the indicative share of RES in production of thermal energy and cooling energy in 2020, because the value of 2020 should be used as a reference value in the calculation in accordance with Article 23(1) of Directive 2018/2001 140 Minimum target value defined in Article 25 of Directive 2018/2001  141 from modern biofuels and biogas obtained the amount of energy obtained may be counted twice, if they were obtained from raw materials specified in Parts A and B of Annex IX of Directive 2018/2001, where the scope of use of the raw materials specified in Part B is limited to 1.7 % (without double counting) from the final energy consumption in transport (by energy amount)   82  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00  Latvia has to ensure permanent capacity to provide energy security and balancing of systems, and because of its geographic location may require a significant amount of additional capacities during the colder months of the year for production of thermal energy.  Latvia has to ensure the interconnection capacity of Latvia and take into consideration the demand for more electricity of the neighbouring countries with which the interconnections are established. The law developed by the Lithuanian Ministry of Energy and approved in October 2018, by which, when the Astravets Nuclear Power Plant starts operating, which is planned for the beginning of 2020, trading of electricity by the Baltic States with third countries will be limited, means the reduction of capacity in all Baltic States and very probably will increase the need for higher production of electricity.  Latvia should consider the growing local demand for electricity promoted by the electrification measures included in the plan, and by improving energy security Latvia should be able to improve self-sufficiency of electricity produced by it.  There was already a share of RE in energy production in Latvia in 2016-2017 (third highest in the EU) and a substantial further increase will be difficult to reach. The share of RES in electricity, heating and cooling in Latvia exceeds 50 %.  3.1.2.1. Sectoral share of RE in 20212030  Latvia has set the minimum permissible annual share of RES in the final energy consumption for the period from 2021 to 2030 as at least 40 %. A separate target in the electricity sector has not been set in the EU legislation. For the period until 2030 Latvia is planning to increase the share of RES in electricity to reach at least 60 %. In the heating and cooling sector, Latvia is planning to ensure the annual average increase defined in Article 23(2)(c) of Directive 2018/2001 until 2030  to increase the share of RES in heating and cooling by at least 0.55 % per year.  In the transport sector, Latvia is planning an increase in the share of RES by at least 7 % in 2030 securing this by the use of advanced biofuels and biogas and by promoting the use of electricity in transport. At the same time, Latvia is planning to ensure that the share of advanced biofuels in 2022 constitutes 0.2 % of the total share of RES in the transport sector, increasing this to 3.5 % in 2030.     3.1.2.2. Trajectories of the use of RES technologies Latvia is planning to increase the share of RES in production of electricity by increasing installed capacity of wind generators and solar photovoltaic components, taking into account the capacity of Latvian electricity transmission networks, which currently allows an increase in the volume of electricity transferred to networks by 800MW. Latvia is not planning to increase biomass and biogas capacities for production of electricity. Latvia is planning to increase the share of RES in heating and cooling by modernising the installed capacities of biomass use equipment, increasing the capacity of installed heat pumps and cold pumps, as well as increasing the use of solar energy in production of thermal energy. Latvia is planning to increase the share of RES in transport by making it obligatory for fuel suppliers to sell energy obtained from RES, whilst simultaneously promoting the production 83  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 of biomethane and its consumption in public transport, as well as continuing to develop the opportunities to use other zero-emission fuel types. In addition to railway electrification, Latvia is planning to continue more rapid development of electrical mobility as a solution for mobility, energy efficiency and RES targets.
