3.3. Dimension: energy security32  i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.333 Diversification of sources and transport routes is necessary to ensure stability in terms of securing primary energy sources. Thanks to economy measures and industrial restructuring in Slovakia, energy consumption has been growing at a slower pace despite relatively strong economic growth. Such developments help increase energy security and independence on energy imports. ii. Regional cooperation in this area Energy security is an important part of the EUs position in the debate in regional fora. Slovakia is a member of the Visegrad Group. In addition, energy security, infrastructure development and market integration are being discussed by the CESEC (Central and South Eastern Europe Energy Connectivity) group. In terms of energy security, the maintenance of the gas transit corridor through Ukraine remains an absolute priority for the Slovak Republic. We consider this crucial for ensuring energy security not only for the Central European region, but also for economic development, political stability and security in Ukraine, which is an EU priority. It is important for the Slovak Republic to find a solution for gas transit through Ukraine after 2019, when the agreements on gas transit, respectively supply, signed in January 2009 will expire. Slovak-Hungarian interconnection The pipeline connection between Slovakia and Hungary connects high-pressure transmission systems municipality of Vecsés in the suburbs of Budapest. The bi-directional pipeline with an annual capacity of 4.38 billion m3 will be 110.7 kilometres long (of which 92.1 kilometres in Hungary and 18.6 in Slovakia). The Slovak-Hungarian gas pipeline will provide new business opportunities while being of strategic importance for the whole region. It will provide Slovakia with access to the planned southern gas corridors or to the LNG terminal in Croatia. Hungary will gain new access to Western European gas networks. The project, part of the planned European North-South Corridor, will contribute towards European energy security and diversification of transport routes. The interconnection of the transmission systems of the Slovak Republic and Hungary is a priority not only for eustream and its Hungarian partner, but also for national governments and the European Commission. Slovak-Ukrainian interconnection point at Budince The Memorandum of Understanding signed on 28 April 2014 between Ukrtransgaz and eustream related to the operation of a gas pipeline to allow reverse gas supply to Ukraine. The implemented                                                  32 Policies and measures shall reflect the energy efficiency first principle. 33 Consistency shall be ensured with the preventive action and emergency plans under Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2017 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and repealing Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 (OJ L 280, 28.10.2017, p. 1) as well as the risk preparedness plans under Regulation (EU) 2018/.... [as proposed by COM(2016)0862 on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector and repealing Directive 2005/89/EC]  solution consisted in the quick commissioning of the unused Vojany-Uzhgorod (Budince border point; the so-called small reverse) gas pipeline. It was put into commercial operation on 2 September 2014 in the presence of the Prime Ministers of Slovakia and Ukraine as well as the High Representative of the European Commission. This solution is optimal from the point of view of security of gas supply for Slovakia and the EU, and also in terms of technical, legal, temporal and full compatibility with the EU legislative framework. The pipeline can provide transport capacity of 40 million m3 per day (of which 27 million m3 is provided on a fixed basis), while in annual terms there is the possibility to transport 14.6 billion m3 of natural gas to Ukraine. From 1 April 2016, the Budince border point became a two-way point, with entry capacity to the eustream transmission network from Ukraine, with a maximum fixed entry transmission capacity of 17 million m3/day. The Ukrainian Ukrtransgaz expects that the launch of bi-directional transit will increase interest in the use of underground gas storage facilities in Ukraine. Slovak-Polish gas interconnection The project to interconnect the transmission networks of Slovakia and Poland proceeded according to the mutual agreements between the transmission system operators eustream, a.s. and GAZ-SYSTEM S.A. The list of projects was approved through Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1391/2013, amending Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 October 2013 on the Trans-European Energy Infrastructure Guidelines on the list of projects of common interest for the Union (PCI). The Slovak-Polish interconnection project was also included under point 6 Priority corridor North - South gas pipeline interconnections in Central and South-East Europe (NSI Gas East). The project was also included in the second list of PCIs as defined by Commission Delegated Decision (EU) 2016/89 of 18 November 2015 amending Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (Commission Decision 2016/89). PCI status was awarded to the project for the third time when it was included in the list of projects of common interest issued by Commission Delegated Regulation No 2018/540 of 23 November 2017 amending Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council. On 22 November 2013, an Agreement was signed in Bratislava between the Government of the Slovak Republic and the Government of the Republic of Poland on cooperation in the implementation of a gas pipeline project connecting the Polish transmission network and the Slovak transmission network. The working group set up under this intergovernmental agreement (involving the relevant ministries and regulatory authorities, as well as the operators) will hold consultations when necessary to address issues related to the project. On 18 September 2018, the ceremonial launch of construction took place at signature of the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, Minister of Economy, Polish Government Plenipotentiary for Strategic Energy Infrastructure, the Chairman of the Board of GAZ-SYSTEM, the CEO of eustream and a representative of INEA. The pipeline is expected to be put into operation in 2021. Eastring In August 2017, Eustream, a.s. concluded a contract to carry out a feasibility study for the planned Eastring gas pipeline linking the countries of Central and South-eastern Europe with the Hungarian consulting and design company Euroil. The feasibility study was intended to define the necessary  technical, economic, financial and environmental aspects of the future pipeline, including its optimal routing, as well extensive market research. On 20 September 2018, the feasibility study was presented in Bratislava in the presence of EC Vice- A new pipeline route of 1 208 km between Velke Zlievce (SR/HU border) and Malkoçlar (BG/TR border) was proposed as a result of the study. The European importance of this project has been confirmed through its multiple inclusion in the PCI list. Nuclear energy Under Article 2d of the Euratom Treaty, nuclear fuel diversification falls within the competence of the Community. For the purpose of implementing this Article, the Euratom Supply Agency has been established to ensure that Member States are not unduly dependent on a single third-country supplier and that regular and fair supplies of nuclear fuel are ensured. In 2018, Slovenské elektrárne, a.s., under the supervision of the Euratom Supply Agency, conducted an international tender for the supply of nuclear fuel, to which all relevant suppliers around the world signed up. Based on the results of the international tender, Slovenské elektrárne, a.s., TVEL and Euratom Supply Agency signed a contract for the supply of nuclear fuel for nuclear power plants in Slovakia in 2019. The fuel will be used in blocks in the Mochovce and Bohunice power plants, including two recently completed blocks in Mochovce. The contract is valid for the 2022-2026 period, with the option extension to 2030, and allows programmes for the introduction of nuclear fuel from alternative suppliers. iii. Where appropriate, national funding measures in this area, including support from Union resources and use of Union funds Slovak-Hungarian interconnection Financial support under the European Energy Programme for Reconstruction (EEPR) was EUR 30 million. The total investment costs amount to about EUR 170 million (of which about EUR 21 million on the Slovak side). Slovak-Polish interconnection The operator of the Slovak transmission network, eustream, a.s., and the operator of the Polish transport network, GAZ-SYSTEM S.A., signed a trilateral agreement with the European Commission Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA) in 2015 on EU financial assistance for the project Elaboration of project documentation and execution of engineering activities for Polish-Slovak gas interconnection. Under this agreement, the project received financial support from the European Union of EUR 4.6 million from the fund entitled Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). On 18 December 2017, INEA, GAZ-SYSTEM S.A. and eustream, a.s. signed a grant agreement for construction work for the Poland-Slovakia Interconnector. In 2019, an amendment to the grant agreement for the construction of the interconnector in question entered into effect, based on which the grant agreement enabled both the Polish and transmission system of the SR operators to obtain financial support from the European Union from CEF funds totalling EUR 104.5 million. Eastring  The EU Innovation and Network Executive Agency and eustream, a.s. signed a grant agreement in May 2017 under which eustream can draw a subsidy for a feasibility study on the planned pan-European Eastring pipeline. Based on this, the European Union supported up to 50% of the eligible costs of the study (up to a maximum of EUR 1 million) from CEF funds. The results of the study were presented on 20 September 2018
