4.4 Dimension Energy security  Table 4.4.1 shows the projected energy mix in Lithuania in 2020, 2030 and 2040. Final consumption of energy types was estimated by subtracting the energy transformed in other plants and energy consumed for non-energy purposes from gross domestic consumption. This means that only the part of energy that is not used as a feedstock for processing was evaluated. The energy mix (final energy) covers more than 80% of all fuels used in Lithuania.  Table 4.1.1.

CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 216    Peat for fuel 35.2 33.7 32.0  Nearly all primary energy production in Lithuania comes from RES.  In 2018, the main imported energy sources in the energy mix were crude oil and other primary products for oil refineries (69.7%), natural gas (13.4%), petroleum products (petroleum gas and other petroleum products) (6.6%) and electricity ( 7.5 percent).  Almost all imports of crude oil and about half of the natural gas imported each year are used for the production of mineral fuels and fertilisers. A sudden increase in the price of crude petroleum and natural gas would have a direct impact on the largest mineral fuel and fertiliser companies, but would not have a significant impact on the Lithuanian energy sector. Due to the LNG terminal and the LitPol Link and NordBalt interconnections, Lithuania's access to energy resources from several different suppliers provides additional opportunities and flexibility to respond to fluctuations in energy prices and reliability of supply.  Energy security coefficient The energy security analysis uses a methodology to identify and assess energy security in relation to the consequences of disturbance. Resistance to energy system disturbances is expressed by the energy security coefficient. This integral characteristic allows the energy security coefficient of energy systems to be determined both at the moment and over time. The energy security coefficient allows the consequences of disturbance scenarios in energy systems to be assessed from the point of view of energy security. The energy security coefficient depends on the amount of energy not delivered, the increase in energy costs and how long that lasts in each disturbance scenario.  The energy security ratio reflects the level of resilience of energy systems to disturbance. The energy security coefficient is calculated based on the consequences of disturbance (non-delivery of energy and increased energy costs), which indicate system vulnerability. The value of the energy security coefficient varies between 0 and 1. The energy security factor SC is equal to one (maximum ) if the energy systems are resistant to disturbances and there is no cost increase or undelivered energy. The energy security coefficient is equal to zero when the energy systems are completely non-resilient to disruption and energy costs increase by more than 100% or 100% of energy is not delivered.109                                                                        109 For more detail see the study on energy securihttp://www.lei.lt/_img/_up/File/atvir/2016/NES/4-Energetinio_saugumo_dalis-2015.11.16.pdf 4. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 217    Key Energy security coefficient LNG terminal NordBalt LitPolLink GIPL Harmony Link Synchronisation  Fig. 4.4.1. Energy security factor  The LNG terminal has had a positive impact on energy security since the start of operations in 2015, with the emergence of an alternative supply of natural gas to the imports of natural gas from a single supplier, a decrease in the price of natural gas and the possibility of ensuring supply of this resource in the event of disruption of imports from Russia. It should be noted that the diversification of energy sources and their supply has a significant impact on energy security, especially if the supply is from a single potential supplier.  2016 saw an improvement in energy security due to the launch of connections with Sweden (NordBalt) and Poland. This is not as big a leap as could be expected from two additional sources of electricity imports, but the same year was marked by loss of installed capacity, namely units 5 and 6 of the Lithuanian Power Plant and temporary shut-down of the Vilnius Third Cogeneration Plant and the Kaunas Cogeneration Plant. Thus, on the one hand, the emergence of electricity interconnections with Sweden and Poland has increased energy security due to electricity imports and the diversification of markets by enabling electricity purchase on a competitive market and import at an affordable price, yet the loss of important generation and reserve capacities has reduced energy security, so that the combination of all these events at an integrated level in the same year has led to a smaller improvement than, for example, the launch of the LNG terminal, because energy security is affected not by one specific component but by a whole range of them.  The gas interconnector Poland-Lithuania (GIPL) is expected to be operational in 2021 (see section 2.4.2 for details on the project). This project has a positive impact on energy security by diversifying gas supply sources and routes and integrating isolated markets of the Baltic States into the single EU gas market. However, there has been no particular improvement in energy security, because from a supply diversification point of view, emergence of a third supplier when two supply alternatives already exist cannot produce the same effect as emergence of a second supply alternative to a single supplier, as was the case in 2015, when the LNG terminal appeared. The GIPL could be considered as a tool for gas export by 4. CURRENT SITUATION AND PROJECTIONS WITH EXISTING POLICIES AND MEASURES SECTION B 218   exploiting the LNG terminal's potential.  There are plans to transfer the Lithuanian electricity system to synchronous operating mode with the mainland European electricity system from 2025. From the point of view of energy security, for the Baltic States working in synchronous mode with ENTSO-E has a positive effect, as it would completely eliminate certain geopolitical threats, resulting in a quite significant increase in the energy security coefficient, which would be much higher than in previous periods. Since the frequency of the Baltic States' electricity systems is centrally managed and coordinated by a control-room in Moscow, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have so far been isolated in the context of energy integration into Europe. The synchronous operation of the Lithuanian electricity system on the Continental European Network (CEN) eliminates a series of threats such as the electricity for various reasons (for example, aggressive policies of national electricity suppliers against national electricity consumers may even create a risk of military conflict). Disappearance of these threats thanks to synchronisation with CENs in 2025 will have a significant positive impact on the country's energy security. It is noteworthy that in the same year 2025, under all scenarios, a second connection with Poland, Harmony Link, will appear in connection with the synchronous link to CENs. Therefore, it also affects energy security due to increased capacity between Lithuania and Poland.  In the country's energy sector, major projects will have emerged by 2025 raising energy security to an acceptable level (LNG terminal, electricity interconnections with Poland and Sweden, the gas interconnection Poland-Lithuania (GIPL), synchronisation with CENs, development of RES, etc.). From 2025 on, no significant changes are expected in terms energy security because all the strategic projects will have been implemented, as mentioned above. Fluctuations could be expected due to domestic generation110.                                                                          110 tinio  Lithuanian Energy Institute.
