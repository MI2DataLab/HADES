INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 56   2 NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS   2.2 Dimension decarbonisation   2.1.1 Greenhouse gas emissions and removals2 i. Elements set out in the first paragraph of Article 4(a)  (1) With respect to greenhouse gas emissions and removals and with a view to contributing to the achievement of the greenhouse gas emission reduction target throughout the Union:  i) the Member State's binding national target for greenhouse gas emissions and the annual binding national limits pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/842;  ii) the Member State's commitments pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/841;  iii) where applicable to meet the objectives and targets of the Energy Union and the long-term Union greenhouse gas emissions commitments consistent with the Paris Agreement, other objectives and targets, including sector targets and adaptation The target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% at European level by 2030 compared with 1990 is shared amongst the ETS sectors (energy industries, energy-intensive industrial sectors and aviation) and non-ETS sectors (transport, residential, tertiary, industry not included in the ETS sector, agriculture and waste), which will need to record a -43% and -30% decrease, respectively, compared with 2005.  Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from energy uses represent 81% of the national total, which equalled approximately 428 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent [MTCO2eq] in 2016 (national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, excluding the balance of forestry emissions/removals). The remaining share of emissions derives from non-energy sources, which are mainly associated with industrial processes, fluorinated gases, agriculture and waste.  The following table gives an overview of the weighting of each sector in terms of GHG emissions (MTCO2eq) in the period 2005-2016.                                                               2 Consistency to be ensured with long-term strategies pursuant to Article 15.

Regulation (EU) 2018/842 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement (the Effort Sharing Regulation, ESR) sets Italy a reduction target of -33% compared with 2005 levels for non-ETS sectors. This target must be achieved by following a linear reduction trajectory that will identify an emissions limit for each year. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 58    In order to attain the ESR target, the Member States may, within certain limits, use flexibilities that allow them to manage the reduction trajectory (intra-period banking and borrowing transactions) and carry out transfers of its emission allocation with other Member States. In addition to this, Member States are also given a further degree of flexibility associated with the accounting of net removal of CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) by the forestry sector (Regulation (EU) 2018/841  Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation). This operation is allowed on the condition that the commitments undertaken pursuant to the LULUCF Regulation are upheld, namely that the neutrality between emissions and removals the cumulative quantity taken into account for Italy for all the years of the period from 2021 to 2030 may not exceed the maximum amount of total net removals, namely 11.5 MTCO2 eq.  The following table gives a quantitative indication of the national situation with respect to the targets agreed at European level for 2020, and the target for 2030. Table 6  ETS and ESR emissions targets  Target for 2020 Scenario for 2020: Target for 2030 Scenario for 2030: ETS emissions -21% -42% -43% -55.9%* ESR emissions -13% -21% -33% -34.6%* * Possible reductions if the expected benefits of the implementation of all of the policies and measures listed in Chapter 3 below of the present plan materialise With reference to 2020, the projections show that Italy has substantially exceeded the level of reduction expected for emissions in both the ETS and non-ETS sector. In particular, the most recent data available from the 2016 national inventory, greenhouse gas emissions for the non-ETS sector, show a reduction of approximately 18% compared to 2005, which should increase to approximately -21% -246 MTCO2eq cumulative for the overall period 2013-2020.  With regard to the 2030 target, the decrease in emissions compared with the aggregated European target for the ETS sector, which benefited from the phase-out of coal in thermoelectric production and the ever increasing use of renewables in the electricity sector, is confirmed.  With reference to the non-ETS sector, in order to comply with the emissions trajectory for the period 2021-2030, which should lead to a 33% reduction compared with 2005 levels, a minimum cumulative reduction of emissions of approximately 142 MTCO2eq compared with the reduction achievable with existing policies will be needed, which reduction will primarily be achieved in the transport, civil and industrial sectors.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 59   The following figure shows the projected emissions trend for non-ETS sectors if the expected benefits of the implementation of all of the policies and measures listed in Chapter 3 below of the present Plan materialise. The following table provides details by individual sector. Figure 5  Historical emissions trend in non-ETS sectors and future scenarios on the basis of current policies and the INECP (MTCO2eq) [Source: ISPRA]     INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 60    Table 7 Historical emissions trend in non-ETS sectors and future scenarios on the basis of current policies and the INECP (MTCO2eq) Year 2005 2015 2020  2025  2030    scenario scenario scenario Sector   Baseline INECP Baseline INECP Baseline INECP Industry  (including process and fluorinated gases) 55 42 42 41 39 37 36 34 Civil 87 73 72 72 67 61 65 52 Agriculture  (energy consumption) 9 8 8 8 7 7 7 7 Transport 125 103 100 95 101 92 93 79 Agriculture (livestock/crops)  32 29 31 31 31 31 31 31 Waste 22 19 16 16 14 14 13 13 Total 330 274 268 263 258 242 245 216 Target -33% by 2030   291 291 243 243 221 221  Looking at the details provided for the individual sectors, the most significant contribution comes from the transport and civil sectors (residential and tertiary).  In the civil sector, the reduction in emissions for 2030 compared with 2005 in the scenario for the INECP totals approximately 35 MTCO2eq and reflects the expected acceleration in the process for increasing the efficiency of pre-existing buildings, enhanced by the increase in complete renovation measures and the application of particularly high-performing technologies.  For the transport sector, the impact on emissions (with a reduction of approximately 46 MTCO2eq in the INECP scenario compared with 2005) can be mainly attributed to developments in shared/public mobility and the gradual roll-out of vehicles characterised by a reduced energy consumption and very low or zero CO2 emissions, as well as the gradual and natural renewal of the vehicle fleet. Emissions from energy uses of fossil fuels are compounded by emissions from non-energy sources which, however, will make a relatively modest contribution to the decarbonisation process.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 61    Emissions from industrial processes are essentially attributed to cement, lime and steel productions and fluorinated gases. Although the former emissions are not easily reduced, as they are directly proportional to the quantities produced, they are, however, already quite low following a prolonged period of economic downturn. By contrast, a limiting effect will be exerted on fluorinated gases following the full transposition of Regulation (EU) 517/2014, which establishes, amongst other things, a ban on the use of some gases with a high global warming potential and their replacement with products that have a smaller climate impact.  In the waste sector, emissions are primarily linked to the total quality produced, the portion of biodegradable substances sent to landfill and the percentage recovery of methane from landfill gas. A relatively significant reduction in emissions is expected here, equal to approximately 9 MTCO2eq, which should be achieved through the gradual implementation of pre-approved waste management plans and objectives. National legislation has set a very ambitious target of achieving 60% sorted waste collection by 2030, which represents the main driving force behind waste management policies in Italy. Thanks to this target, which has not yet been reached consistently throughout the country, it has been possible to achieve high percentages for the recycling of urban waste that are perfectly in line with the 2020 EU recycling target of 50%.  In the agricultural sector, emissions mirror trends in factors such as the number and type of livestock animals, changes in cultivated areas, and types of crops, as well as the use of fertilisers containing nitrogen. These variables are sensitive to changes in agricultural practices, as outlined in the common agricultural policy and rural development plans. Over the last ten years, this sector has nevertheless shown a relatively stable trend in terms of emissions, which has only been marginally influenced by biogas production and reductions in/changes to the use of fertilisers. The sector is expected to record an overall reduction of approximately 2 MTCO2eq.  With reference to the forestry sector, the contribution is limited by the provisions on LULUCF flexibility contained in the ESR Regulation (11.5 MTCO2eq for the entire 2021-2030 period) 2018/841). Over the last 25 years, changes in soil use in Italy have led to an increase in forest areas (+23%), wetland (+2%) and settled areas (+42%), with a reduction in grazing areas (-5%) and cropland (-18%) compared with 1990 also being observed. Italy has a rich biological and forestry heritage with various different types of landscapes (ranging from continental to approximately 7 590 kha in 1990, 8 369 kha in 2000, 9 032 kha in 2010, and 9 305 kha in 2015, equivalent to 31% of the total national surface area.  The following table shows greenhouse gas removals and emissions from the LULUCF sector in KTCO2eq, estimated using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology, as reported to the European Commission within the framework of the monitoring mechanism (MMR) for greenhouse gas emissions (Regulation (EU) 525/2013).   INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 62   Table 8  Projections for LULUCF categories (KTCO2eq) [Source: ISPRA]  2005 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 LULUCF (Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry) -28,383 -39,379 -25,980 -22,767 -23,429 -26,228 Forest areas -34,477 -39,922 -27,519 -23,075 -22,749 -24,382 Cropland 1,459 2,160 1,059 975 891 806 Grazing areas -2,643 -6,926 -4,341 -4,478 -4,785 -5,096 Wetland 8 130 167 230 292 355 Settled areas 7,801 4,956 4,561 3,902 3,244 2,585 Other areas 0 0 0 0 0 0 Products of forest management -531 223 93 -321 -321 -497  Viewed over a longer timescale, these emissions/removals figures give an idea of the road that will need to be followed after 2030 to complete the transition to climate neutrality. In line with the framework outlined, those sectors where emissions are hardest to reduce will need to be tackled, especially those with non-energy sources (starting with industrial processes and agriculture). At the same time, it will also be necessary to make a push to complete the decarbonisation of energy uses (including the most widespread, such as transport). This outlook is consistent with the long-term strategy, which envisages the application of new technologies, the gradual upgrading of energy infrastructure and changes  ii. Where applicable, other national objectives and targets consistent with the Paris Agreement and the existing long-term strategies. Where applicable for the contribution to the overall Union commitment of reducing the GHG emissions, other objectives and targets, including sector targets and adaptation goals, if available The National Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change, adopted by  Decree No 86 of 16 June 2015, outlined a national framework for the impacts of climate change on environmental processes and resources and the socio-economical systems of Italy, and drew up a national vision of the pathways to follow in order to address those impacts.  The implementation of the strategy triggered the process for drafting the National Plan on Adaptation to Climate Change (PNACC). Within the scope of the plan, a contextual analysis of the current and future climate condition and a description of the degree of risk to the national INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 63   territory and the expected impacts on the sectors defined in accordance with the strategy were developed. Possible actions for adaptation at a national level and instruments for monitoring and evaluating their effectiveness were also identified.  A process for auditing and revising the plan, which involved sharing its content with the ministries, Regions and research bodies, preparing a scientific review, and holding two public consultations, was launched in 2017. The National Plan on Adaptation presents itself as an instrument for supporting national, regional and local institutions in defining their adaptation pathways, including in relation to the specific characteristics of the territories. It represents a shared basis for analysis methodologies, information and data. On the basis of  Decree No 86, the content of the plan must be agreed upon during the State-Regions Conference.  Following the example of the European Climate-ADAPT platform and in collaboration with the Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA), work also commenced on the creation of an adaptation web platform, with the aim of disclosing, raising awareness of and making available the data contained in the PNACC and other operational instruments to all citizens, and in particular in order to support the decision-making process of local authorities. The platform includes a document section containing information and data from various statistical and scientific sources, and in particular climate data monitored by the national system for environmental protection. The platform will also provide users with a geoprocessing module with additional processing and analysis functions and will contain information on best practices at national and international level.  On the basis of the data and analyses contained in the PNACC, the climate impacts on the energy system can be grouped into the following aspects. - Physical vulnerability: risks associated with the increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, namely the climate changes currently being experienced: drought, floods, landslides, overflowing rivers, etc. These risks are also directly linked to energy infrastructure, in terms of both installations and transmission and distribution networks. - Operational vulnerability: the impact that quantitative changes in hydrological cycles, their seasonal variations, the increases in average temperatures and changes to wind conditions have on energy delivered and on the energy balance of installations (EROEI  energy returned on energy invested) and on the technical characteristics of wind turbines. - Impacts on demand: changes in energy demand for cooling buildings as a result of climate changes, as highlighted in the various evolution scenarios taken into consideration in the PNACC. Changes in the demand of crop cycles and cultivation methods must also be taken into consideration in the agricultural sector. Consequently, in order to create a resilient energy system that remains reliable through short- and mid-term climate scenarios and is able to continuously evolve, even in long-term scenarios, account must be taken of the above impacts, by means of: - promoting the development of micro grids and smart grids to encourage high-efficiency self-generation in urban communities and industrial districts, with due regard for the security of the system and preferably using the existing network; - implementing programmes and instruments for managing and guiding demand (demand-side management); INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 64   - promoting the application, across all sectors, of best available technologies (BAT) for managing energy efficiency; - improving interconnections with European networks to offset the use of discontinuous renewable sources; - using an energy mix that guarantees the ability to adapt to extreme climate situations in order to maintain the continuity of energy supply; - evaluating, monitoring and verifying the resilience of the energy system following the execution and implementation of the INECP. In any event, pending the establishment of the new energy structure to reduce the risk posed to continuity of supply, plans on the resilience of the electricity networks have already been introduced in Italy, to be periodically drafted and implemented by distribution system operators, with a similar obligation also being placed on transmission system operators. The risks and magnitude of negative events will be reduced in this way, starting with the most vulnerable regions.  2.1.2 Renewable energy i. The elements set out in the second paragraph of Article 4(a)  (2) With respect to renewable energy: With a view to achieving the Union's binding target of at least 32% renewable energy in 2030, as referred to in Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, a contribution in terms of the Member State's share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy in 2030, with an indicative trajectory for that contribution from 2021 onwards. By 2022, the indicative trajectory shall reach a reference point of at least 18% of the total increase in the share of energy from renewable sources between that Member State's binding national target for 2020 and its contribution to the 2030 target. By 2025, the indicative trajectory shall reach a reference point of at least 43% of the total increase in the share of energy from renewable sources between that Member State's binding national target for 2020 and its contribution to the 2030 target. By 2027, the indicative trajectory shall reach a reference point of at least 65 % of the total increase in the share of energy from renewable sources between that Member State's binding national target for 2020 and its contribution to the 2030 target. By 2030, the indicative trajectory shall reach at least the Member State's planned contribution. If a Member State expects to surpass its binding national target 2020, its indicative trajectory may start at the level it is projected to achieve. The Member States' indicative trajectories, taken together, shall add up to the Union reference points in 2022, 2025 and 2027 and to the Union's binding target of at least 32% renewable energy in 2030. Separately from its contribution to the Union target and its indicative trajectory for the purposes of this Regulation, a Member State shall be free to indicate more ambitious targets for national policy purposes; Italy plans to pursue the target of obtaining 30% of gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources in 2030 by defining a pathway of sustainable growth for renewable sources and the full integration thereof into the system. In particular, the target for 2030 projects a gross final consumption of energy of 111 Mtoe, with approximately 33 Mtoe of that coming from renewable sources. The evolution of the share of renewable sources follows the minimum indicative trajectory identified in the second paragraph of Article 4(a) of the Governance Regulation. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 65   Figure 6  Trajectory of overall RES share [Source: GSE and RSE]   Table 9  Overall RES target for 2030 (ktoe)  2016 2017 2025 2030 Numerator 21,081 22,000 27,168 33,428 Gross production of electricity from RES 9,504 9,729 12,281 16,060 Final consumption of RES for heating and cooling 10,538 11,211 12,907 15,031 Final consumption of RES in the transport sector 1,039 1,060 1,980 2,337 Denominator  Overall final gross consumption 121,153 120,435 116,064 111,359 Overall share of RES (%) 17.4% 18.3% 23.4% 30.0%  The allocation of the numerator between the sectors shown in the table is indicative and may be revised during the drafting of the final plan. That figure of 29.7% emerging from the scenario involving targets is not to be regarded as conflicting with the 30% contribution made by Italy towards achieving the EU target. ii. Estimated trajectories for the sectoral share of renewable energy in final energy consumption from 2021 to 2030 in the electricity, heating and cooling, and transport sector INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 66   Without prejudice to the statement made at the end of section i. above (which applies to all of the following information, including section iii.), the contribution of renewables to meet total gross final consumption by 2030 (30%) is expected to have the following distribution between the different sectors:  55.0% renewables share in the electricity sector;  33.9% renewables share in the heating sector (for heating and cooling);  22.0% with regard to the incorporation of renewables in the transport sector (calculated using the target accounting criteria established by RED II).

Estimated trajectories by renewable energy technology that the Member State projects to use to achieve the overall and sectoral trajectories for renewable energy from 2021 to 2030, including expected total gross final energy consumption per technology and sector in Mtoe and total planned installed capacity (divided by new capacity and repowering) per technology and sector in MW Electricity sector According to the objectives of the present plan, electricity production facilities are undergoing a major transformation thanks to the target of phasing out coal-fired generation by as early as 2025 and the promotion of the widespread use of renewable energy sources.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 68   The greatest contribution to the growth of renewables will come from the electricity sector itself, which will achieve 16 Mtoe generation from RES, equal to 187 TWh, by 2030. The significant penetration of technologies for renewable electricity production, primarily photovoltaics and wind power technology, will enable the sector to cover 55.0% of gross final electricity consumption with renewable energy, compared with 34.1% in 2017. The significant technically and economically feasible growth potential of photovoltaic installations and wind parks, thanks also to the reduction in costs associated therewith, points to a major development of these technologies, the production of which should triple and more than double, respectively, by 2030.  In order to attain the targets on renewables identified for 2030, it will not only be necessary to stimulate new production, but also to preserve existing production and, if possible, actually increase it, by promoting the revamping and repowering of installations. In particular, the opportunity to promote investments in the revamping and repowering of existing wind power plants with more developed and efficient machines, by exploiting the excellent wind conditions at well-known sites that are already being used, will also help to limit the impact on soil consumption.  A similar approach, based on a reduction in soil consumption, will be followed in order to guide the expansion of the significant growth capacity of photovoltaics that is projected for 2030, by promoting their installation primarily on buildings, roofs, car parks, service areas, etc. In order to attain the 2030 targets, it is nevertheless still vital to promote large ground-mounted photovoltaic installations, with priority being given, however, to unproductive areas that are not earmarked for other uses, such as areas not usable for agriculture. In this light, installations in former artificial areas (with reference to the National System for the Protection of the Environment (Italian initials SNPA) classification), preference should be given to contaminated sites, waste disposal sites and areas along the infrastructure system.   With regard to other sources, consideration is given to a limited growth scenario for extra geothermal power and hydropower and a slight decrease in bioenergy, net of bioliquids, in respect of which, by contrast, a gradual decrease is expected until the end of the incentive period.  In the case of large hydropower plants, there is no doubt that these represent a resource that is already largely being exploited, albeit predominantly strategically, in policies for 2030 and in the long-term for 2050, the production of which needs to be safeguarded and increased.

For bioliquids (included under bioenergy, together with solid biomass and biogas), only the contribution from sustainable bioliquids is given.  Heating sector The heating sector plays a very important role in attaining renewables targets; in fact, what is needed is a decisive shift in technology towards solutions that facilitate the penetration of renewable sources. In absolute terms, consumption from renewables is expected to surpass 15 Mtoe in the heating and cooling sector, an increase which is primarily linked to the increase in renewable energy provided by heat pumps.  The development of the heating RES sector is influenced by environmental issues associated with the impacts of emissions from pre-existing solid biomass-fired heating systems. Therefore, the installation of new biomass-fired heating systems must be targeted towards promoting high-efficiency systems meeting high environmental quality standards, with consideration also being given to the possibility of introducing restrictions on new systems in areas characterised by critical air quality conditions. In order to stimulate the renewal of old systems using efficient, low-emission technologies, more stringent performance requirements on accessing incentives for biomass-fired heat generators will be introduced in the short term.   In this respect, the replacement of domestic wood-fired systems with more efficient, lower-emission systems that meet the highest environmental classification standards (Ministerial Decree No 186/2017) will be encouraged. The possibility of developing measures to finance technological innovation and research for this type of system is also being examined, with a view to further improving energy and environmental performance. It is recommended that a meeting be arranged with the Commission to discuss whether, on the basis of current statistical rules, the greater efficiency of the new systems, which reduce the quantity of biomass used, will, paradoxically, make it more difficult to attain the targets.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 72   Another aim is to encourage, from a circular economy perspective, the use of agricultural waste, not least to prevent it from being burnt in the fields, as is at present common practice and, with due regard for the European rules, promote the use of local biomass. A short traceability supply chain would be adopted that meets criteria of sustainability and produces an environmental and social balance that is on the whole favourable.   Considering the high efficiency of heat pumps, these will gain an increasing weight in the thermal renewables mix, additionally supported by the technological progress in the sector, in which the different performance levels and characteristics of electric and gas pumps will be compared.  An increase in the thermal RES share will also be achieved thanks to extensive renovation of the existing building stock, which will result in a significant decrease in consumption.  Thermal solar energy may play a growing role in integrated systems for efficient and renewable heat production, such as, for example, hybrid systems and the integration of district heating systems.  Provision is made for a development margin for district heating; in order to exploit this potential, it will be vitally important to take advantage of the synergies between the use of renewable energy sources and HEC, in consideration of the specific climate and technical and economic conditions.

Figure 12  Growth trajectories for energy from renewable sources for 2030 in the heating sector [Source: GSE and RSE]   INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 74   Transport sector The recast Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) identifies a specific target for the transport sector of 14% for 2030 (obligation for suppliers of fuels and electricity). In order to contribute to the challenging general target of 30% total gross final consumption met by RES, it is expected that the transport sector will surpass the value of 14% by increasing the obligation imposed on suppliers of fuels and electricity for the transport sector up to a renewables share of 22.0%. The role of RES in the transport sector is of significance when calculating the overall renewables target, insofar as, with a view to optimising system costs, the use of biofuels appears to be very cost effective. The optimum mix for attaining the renewable fuels target appears to be the recommended contributions for the different types of renewable sources listed below. - First generation biofuels: in accordance with the Directive, a decrease for this category of biofuel is projected, in order to reach a contribution of approximately 0.7 Mtoe, equal to 3%, by 2030; the possibility of introducing lower limits for some types of fuel, especially those that could lead to an indirect change of end-use for the land, will be assessed. - Advanced biofuels: the specific target identified by the Directive, equal to 3.5% by 2030, is expected to be surpassed through the incentivisation mechanism established for biomethane and other advanced biofuels (by Ministerial Decree of 2 March 2018, and subsequent decrees) in order to attain a target of around 8%. - As a guideline, 75% of the target for advanced biofuels will be attained through the use of advanced biomethane (0.8 Mtoe) and 25% through the use of other advanced biofuels (0.26 Mtoe), without prejudice to any changes to the allocation caused by the actual availability and affordability of the different types of advanced biofuel and by reaching the maximum share of biomethane that can be used in the transport sector. For advanced biomethane originating from agricultural waste and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), the target of at least 1.1 billion m3 by 2030 is confirmed. - Biofuels listed in Part B of Annex IX (waste vegetable oils and animal fats): the Directive imposes an upper limit of 1.7%, with Member States being allowed to increase that value if fully justified. An increased upper limit of 2.5% is proposed, with a final contribution of up to 5% (using double counting). This goal must be achieved using waste vegetable oils (used cooking oils  UCOs), and with priority being given to UCOs collected in Italy, with due regard for the circular economy principle and in line with the new objectives of the waste package. The possibility of increasing the ceiling of 1.7% for biofuels, as referred to in Annex IX, part B, will be assessed, also taking into consideration animal fats classified as category 1 or 2 under Regulation (EC) 1069/2009, in cases where the entire production, collection and treatment chain is Italian.  - electricity from RES consumed in the road sector: e-cars will account for approximately 0.404 Mtoe, which, multiplied by 4 (multiplication factor), will cover approximately 6% of the target RES for the transport sector; - a significant contribution from electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), which appear to be a solution for private urban mobility capable, just like e-cars, of contributing to improved integration of production from electric renewables, is also expected for 2030. Investments in this kind of vehicle are expected to be particularly effective in 5-7 years, with almost 6 million electrically powered vehicles in overall circulation by 2030, approximately 4 million of which will be all-electric vehicles. The aim is to introduce compulsory quotas of electric vehicles specifically for public transport. - electricity from RES consumed in the rail and other transport sector: this consumption will account for approximately 0.313 Mtoe, which, multiplied by 1.5 (multiplication INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 75   factor), represents approximately 2% of the target RES for transport. Initiatives in this segment, which is the most energy-efficient mode of transport for people and goods, along with transport by sea, will be a priority. - non-biological renewable fuels: a contribution is projected for hydrogen, of around 1% of the target RES for the transport sector, through its direct use in cars, buses, heavy goods vehicles and trains (non-electrified for certain routes) and eventually sea transport, or through the in-put into the network of methane, including for transport uses. An indication of differentiated use might be 0.8% input, mixed with natural gas, into the gas network, as is, and/or converted back into methane, and 0.2% for direct use in cars, buses and trains. The plan is also to promote  starting with research, development and demonstration activities  the production and use of hydrogen produced by renewable electricity. This offers the double advantage of reducing emissions from fuel and other refining products, while at the same time making it possible to store excess renewable electricity generated when supply exceeds demand. This is also important from the long-term perspective of the climate neutrality objective. Again with a view to developing the use of hydrogen in the transport sector, integrated multi-fuel distribution solutions using fuel cells could play an important role.  - aviation and maritime biofuels: a contribution, also from renewable gas, which, however, currently appears difficult to quantify, is projected; - recycled fossil fuels (for example plastic from sorted waste collection or fuel obtained through CO2 recovery from steelworks): the contribution to the RES target for the the European Commission (expected by 2021 by the Directive) after the minimum sustainability requirements for these fuels have been identified.

INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 77   Figure 13  Growth trajectories for energy from renewable sources by 2030 in the transport sector [Source: GSE and RSE]  With regard to the place of production for biofuels, it is worth mentioning that 27.5% of sustainable biofuels in-put for consumption in 2017 was produced in Italy; the sharp reduction compared with the same share recorded in 2016 (30.4%) is primarily to be attributed to reduced levels of biodiesel in domestic production (-28,000 tonnes).  Figure 14  Place of production of biofuels consumed in Italy in 2016 and 2017 (thousands of tonnes) [Source: GSE]  By way of information, the following figure shows the main raw materials used to produce sustainable biofuels in-put for consumption in Italy in 2016 and 2017.

For forest biomass, assessment of the origin and impact on the LULUCF sink  Figure 16  Growth trajectory for the contribution of bioenergies in the different sectors in order to achieve the RES target for 2030 [Source: GSE and RSE]    Derived from the processing of vegetable oils   Animal oils  and fats  Palm oil Used cooking oil (UCO)  Rape seed Wheat Corn Soybean ktep 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 79   With regard to biomass supply and the origin thereof, approximately 80% (in energy content) of biomass is domestic in origin. In light of the stabilisation of consumption, this percentage should remain steady, or else slightly decrease, as a result of the projected increased degree of penetration of more highly efficient technologies, with the possibility of increasing the share of pre-processed fuels, such as pellets.  In the electricity sector, by contrast, a significant decrease in imports of bioliquids is expected in light of the objective to gradually phase out this supply, which should be offset by a greater domestic contribution, in particular by residues and by-products, in compliance with the criteria of a circular economy.  The estimates for the transport sector, where the growing role played by renewable electricity and advanced biofuels and of renewable gas should, however, increase the share of raw materials from domestic and European sources, are more complex.  v. Where applicable, other national trajectories and objectives, including those that are long term or sectoral (share of renewable energy in district heating, renewable energy use in buildings, renewable energy produced by cities, renewable energy communities and renewables self-consumers, energy recovered from the sludge acquired through the treatment of wastewater) Italy is highly invested in the development of self-generation systems, in particular in buildings (it is recalled that, for new buildings and buildings undergoing significant renovations, there is already an obligation to integrate a minimum renewables share), and in Reform Support Service (SRSS), is currently under way that will contribute towards a better definition of the most appropriate policies, and therefore specific and achievable targets.
