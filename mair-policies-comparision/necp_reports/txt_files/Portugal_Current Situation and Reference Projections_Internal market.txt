4.5. Dimension Internal Energy Market  4.5.1. Electricity interconnections  i. Current interconnection level and main interconnections The National Transmission Network (RNT) currently has six 400 kV lines and three 220 kV lines connecting Portugal and Spain.  Electricity interconnection between Portugal and Spain has evolved favourably in recent years so as to satisfy requests from the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL) and there is now greater interconnection capacity available for commercial purposes. In 2017, the average commercial interconnection  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4.

(Source REE) With regard to interconnection to comply with EU targets, which requires 10% of electricity interconnection by 2020 and 15% by 2030, Portugal has recorded favourable evolution. However, although Portugal has seen favourable evolution with regard to the level of interconnection with Spain, this has not been the case in relation to interconnection between the Iberian Peninsula and France, which is still far from achieving 10% by 2020, as is shown in the following table. The ambition of Portugal and Spain to ensure an effective and robust connection to the European energy market is compromised due to the bottleneck which continues to be seen at the interconnection between Spain and France through the Pyrenees. This situation means that the Iberian -scale penetration of renewable power and, as a result, to the ultimate aims of NECP.

However, the network necessary in Portugal and Spain have not as yet been identified so as to achieve such capacity.   4.5.2. Energy transmission infrastructure  i. Key characteristics of the existing electricity and gas transmission infrastructure i.1. Electricity The National Electricity Transmission Network (RNT) includes installations in mainland national territory which ensure the transmission of power from high-voltage electricity production centres to high-density consumption areas, as well as to neighbouring countries (only Spain), through very high voltage lines and facilities which step down voltage levels and allow the control of power flow. Currently, the RNT has a total of 8 907 km of network, transformation power of 37 382 MVA, 66 substations, 12 step-down stations, 2 branching stations and 1 transition station. Evolution in the RNT can be seen in the following table and figure.

Natural gas The National Transmission, Storage Infrastructure and Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal Network (RNTIAT) consists of all the infrastructure for receiving and transmitting natural gas (NG) by gas pipeline, underground storage and reception, storage and regasification of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). RNTIAT consists of the National Natural Gas Transmission Network (RNTGN), the Sines Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal (TGNL) and the Carriço Underground Storage facility (AS) in Pombal. The RNTGN is the infrastructure used for the reception, transmission and delivery of high-pressure NG in Portugal, from input to output points. It is formed by two main axes: a South-North axis which connects the Sines LNG Terminal to the Valença do Minho interconnection, supplying NG to the Portuguese coastline, where the most densely populated cities are located. There is also a take-off line to Mangualde; and an East-West axis between the Campo Maior interconnection and the Carriço US facility, with a take-off line to Guarda. In 2013, the connection was concluded between the take-off lines of both axes, connecting Mangualde to Guarda, which NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4. Current Policy Situation and Existing Measures and Projections 145   allowed a reinforcement of capability to satisfy demand in central and northern Portugal. All RNTGN delivery points (GRMS - Gas Regulation and Metering Stations) have total output capacity of 666 GWh/day, equivalent to 2 330 km3(n)/h. The following facilities form part of the RNTGN: 1 375 Km of main gas pipeline and high-pressure branch lines for the transmission of natural gas; 85 gas regulation and metering stations at the delivery points (GRMS); 66 Junction stations (JCT); 45 Block valve stations (BV); 5 Interconnection junctions (ICJCT); 2 Custody Transfer Stations (CTS). NG may be delivered directly to high-pressure connected clients, distribution networks which make up the national NG distribution network, the network interconnected to the Spanish gas system and to the Carriço underground storage caverns. The most recent developments in the RNTGN have focused on connecting new delivery points and remodelling a number of pressure reduction and metering stations so as to adapt them to new operating conditions and gas flows to be supplied. There are two interconnections between the RNTGN and the Spanish transmission network: Campo Maior - Badajoz and Valença do Minho - Tuy. Both interconnection points have input and output capacity, and total VIP capacity (Campo Maior + Valença do Minho) is 144 GWh/day.  Table 30- NG interconnection capacities between Portugal and Spain. [Source: REN] Interconnection Daily Capacity  Campo Maior link Input Capacity: 134 GWh/day, equivalent to 470 km3(n)/h Output Capacity: 35 GWh/day, equivalent to 123 km3(n)/h  Valença do Minho Input Capacity: 10 GWh/day, equivalent to 35 km3(n)/h Output Capacity: 25 GWh/day, equivalent to 88 km3(n)/h  The Sines Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal (LNGT) is strategically located on the European Atlantic coast and includes all of the infrastructures for receiving and dispatching methane carrier vessels, storage and regasification of LNG to the transmission network. It also loads tanker trucks with LNG. The main characteristics of the Sines LNG Terminal include:  Reception and unloading of methane carrier vessels: The port facility includes a mooring quay, articulated unloading arms and unloading lines and LNG vapour recirculation and return lines. Unloading capacity is 10 000 m3/h of LNG for methane carrier vessels with volumes from 40 000 to 216 000 m3 of LNG.  LNG storage: After unloading, the LNG is stored in tanks. Storage capacity is 2 569 GWh, corresponding to two 120 000 m3 tanks of LNG and one tank of 150 000 m3 of LNG.  Regasification to the RNTGN: Regasification is a physical process to vaporise LNG which uses heat exchange of the gas with sea water in atmospheric vaporisers. To carry out this process, the infrastructure has seven atmospheric vaporisers with a unit capacity of 64 GWh/day (equivalent to 225 000 m3(n)/h). Nominal emission capacity is 321 GWh/day (equivalent to 1 125 000 m3(n)/h), with peak time capacity of 1 350 000 m3(n)/h).  LNG filling bays: The Sines LNG terminal allows LNG tanker trucks to be loaded, which transport gas to autonomous regasification units (UAG) in areas of Portugal which cannot be supplied by the high-pressure natural gas network. The LNGT has three filling bays with a total capacity of 175 m3/h of LNG.  Loading of methane carrier vessels: The Sines LNG terminal is also capable of carrying out the total or partial loading of methane carrier vessels using the same port facility and vessel unloading equipment. Capacity for this activity is 1 500 m3/h of LNG. The expansion of the Sines LNG Terminal, which was concluded in July 2012, provided an increase in useful storage capacity of 62.5%, to 390 000 m3 de GNL, an increase in gas issue capacity of 50%, to 1 350 000 m3/h, adaptation of the jetty to receive large-capacity methane tankers, and the implementation of a series of procedural reinforcements to maximise infrastructure availability and provide a high level of operating safety.  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4. Current Policy Situation and Existing Measures and Projections 146   As a result, the Sines Terminal now has favourable access conditions for a greater number of agents, providing greater flexibility in the management of imported volumes and creating unique conditions to receive tankers of LNG from more remote and diversified sources. This has contributed to increasing the competitiveness of the sector in Portugal and to the supply security of the SNGN. With regard to the underground storage (US) at Carriço, NG is stored under high-pressure in caverns created in a saline mass, at depths of over one thousand metres. There are currently six caverns with total storage capacity of 3 839 GWh (322.6 Mm3), which use the same surface gas station providing bidirectional flow. In other words, injection of gas from the transmission network to the caverns and the withdrawal of gas from the caverns to the transmission network. The Carriço US facility injection capacity is 24 GWh/day (83 000 m3(n)/h) and withdrawal capacity is 129 GWh/day (450 000 m3(n)/h). This infrastructure is vital for constituting the security reserves necessary to ensure supplies to the country in the event of a supply crisis. It also provides conditions to optimise logistics for commercial agents working in Portugal and in the Iberian Peninsula. The following figure shows the RNTIAT map.

Current Policy Situation and Existing Measures and Projections 147    ii. Projections of network expansion requirements at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) ii.1. Electricity In order to meet Community requirements on interconnections, as well as the need to reinforce internal networks, a wide-ranging series of actions and projects exists which include (as indicated in point 2.4. of this plan):  In 2021-2022, with the entry into service of the 400-kV interconnection line between Minho (PT) and Galicia (ES) (as previously mentioned, identified under the Madrid Declaration, and also a European Commission Project of Common Interest), it will be possible to overcome the existing network restrictions and achieve, in both directions, minimum commercial interconnection capacity of 3 000 MW;  By 2025, a slight increase is estimated in interconnection capacity, particularly in the Spain - Portugal direction. This estimate is based on forecast evolution for demand in both systems. In the Portuguese case, the entry into service of the new 400-kV Pedralva-Sobrado line is planned, which, in addition to avoiding a reduction in interconnection capacity, will also allow the flow of renewable origin electricity, essentially hydro;  For the 2030 horizon, very long-term analyses have already been conducted by the PT and ES transmission system operators (REN and REE) under the Ten-Year Network Development Plan 2016 (TYNDP), which led to estimated interconnection capacity values which were slightly higher than those forecast for 2023-2025;  From a longer perspective up to 2040, commercial capacities are based on analyses conducted (with the sce) under the TYNDP 2018 by REN and REE. Possible reinforcement of the network or new interconnections required to achieve these interconnection capacity figures have not yet been identified. Also of note in the electricity sector are the projects to reinforce internal networks (transmission and distribution) to connect and accept renewable power production (to achieve national potential in this type of electrical power production) and other projects to satisfy large consumer needs, more specifically the following.  400-kV Fundão-Falagueira connection, to accommodate renewable energy from this region;  Double 400-kV line between Vieira do Minho - Ribeira da Pena; Ribeira da Pena substation; 400-kV Ribeira da Pena  Feira connection to link the Tâmega hydro power plants.  400-kV passage of the Falagueira-Estremoz-Divor-Pegões axis, which is vital for meeting the technical feed specificities to the railway line between Évora-Elvas/Caia. With respect to the 2040 horizon, depending on the evolution seen in the Portuguese and Spanish electricity systems, more specifically with regard to renewable power generation, it will be necessary to assess, in addition to possible network reinforcement, the need for new interconnections. ii.2. Natural gas In order to meet commitments made on a European level and based on national energy policy, more specifically with respect to internal market integration and supply security, and with a view to creating a more robust, efficient and interconnected national natural gas system, Portugal intends to develop the respective transmission and distribution network, and currently has in hand projects which will contribute to this aim.  In order to meet such requirements, a wide-ranging series of actions and projects exists which include (as indicated in point 2.4.2 of this plan):  The 3rd Interconnection Project between Portugal and Spain (with recognised benefits in relation to supply security and integration of the European Market) which is dependent on the completion of the STEP/MIDCAT project for the new interconnection between Spain and France, both projects are expected to be completed by 2030; NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4. Current Policy Situation and Existing Measures and Projections 148    Also planned for the gas sector are projects which could increase the use of LNG and improve LNG into the internal market/European gas system.  4.5.3. Electricity and gas markets, energy prices  i. Current situation of electricity and gas markets, including energy prices i.1. Electricity Market Since September 2006, all electricity customers in mainland Portugal have been able to choose their supplier. In a total of around 6.2 million customers in the electricity market in Portugal at the end of 2018, the Free Market (FM) now represents around 5.0 million customers, corresponding to around 81% of all market customers. Remaining customers belong to the Regulated Market (RM) which are supplied by the Supplier of Last Resort (SoLR). Most customers which remain in the RM are domestic users. The vast majority migrated to the FM.

It can be expected that the benefits of more competition through the greater choice available, better prices and more competition between agents will be enjoyed by industrial and retail consumers. With the publication of Law No 42/2016 of 28 December 2016 and in accordance with the respective Article 171(1)(a), the Portuguese Government extended the deadline for abolishing transitional tariffs for the supply of electricity to normal low-voltage final consumers.

Natural Gas Market In Portugal, since the beginning of 2010, all consumers have had the right to choose their NG supplier. This liberalisation process in the NG market has meant that all large consumers (annual consumption greater than 1 million m3 of NG) are now in the free market. Similarly, the vast majority of industrial consumers (annual consumption of between 10 000 m3 and 1 million m3 of NG), also opted for the more favourable conditions offered by suppliers. Moreover, significant numbers of residential consumers have also chosen free market suppliers. In a total retail market of around 1.5 million customers, the free market accounted for approximately 1.2 million consumers at the end of 2018, representing 81% of all NG market customers in Portugal.

Social Tariff on Energy In 2010, the social tariff was created for the supply of electrical power to be applied to economically vulnerable final customers, approved by Decree-Law No 138-A/2010 of 28 December 2010. As part of the liberalisation process for the energy sector and to protect consumers, the aim of this law was to ensure access by all consumers to the essential service of the supply of electrical power, regardless of which supplier was used. This guarantee led to the need to ensure supply to economically vulnerable consumers. The growing prices and volatility of energy costs internationally and the intention to further standardise the electricity market also justified the need to establish specific measures to protect such consumers in line with European guidelines on the internal electricity and natural gas markets. A social tariff protects the interests of families and other groups of economically vulnerable consumers through a tariff model providing them with stability through discounts.                                                            42 20 GJ < Consumption < 200 GJ 43 10 000 GJ < Consumption < 100 000 GJ 44 Road Service Contribution and Value of CO2 45 Road Service Contribution and Value of CO2  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4. Current Policy Situation and Existing Measures and Projections 150   In 2014, the concern was to ensure access by consumers considered to be more disadvantaged in the universe of final low-voltage electrical power consumers. The aim was to extend the number of beneficiaries of the social tariff to around 500 000 consumers with electrical power supply contracts and create conditions so that the discount applied to these beneficiaries was greater than that being applied at the time. With a view to increasing the number of social tariff beneficiaries, the social discounts for access to the essential service of electrical power and natural gas supply, implemented through Decree-Law No 138-A/2010 of 28 December 2010, amended by Decree-Law No 172/2014 of 14 November 2014, for electrical power, and Decree-Law No 101/2011 of 30 September 2011, for natural gas, are now automatically granted to more economically vulnerable end customers after applicable legislation was redesigned through Law No 7-A/201646 of 30 March 2016. According to data provided by ERSE, this procedure contributed to the number of beneficiaries increasing from 154 648 in March 2016 to 820 527 in September 2017. This measure, was initially launched on 28 December 2010 via Decree-Law No 138-A/2010, and as of 1 July 2016, automatically assigned the required status to customers meeting economic and/or social vulnerability criteria, confirmed by the Tax and Customs Authority and/or the Social Security Institute, in accordance with Law No 7-A/2016 of 30 March 2016. The automatic recognition system to assign the social tariff for energy removes the requirement from the customer to request recognition of such status. In truth, the creation of this automatic system allows economically vulnerable customers to access the social tariff and avoid unnecessary bureaucracy and costs, and provides a procedure with greater social fairness. It should also be noted that this discount provides savings of dozens of euros per year for many families. Automatic recognition is carried out by the I.T. System at the DGEG, which cross-references data in accordance with the protocols governing access and transmission of information among different agents in the energy sector and Public Administration bodies holding the required data, more specifically the Tax and Customs Authority and the Social Security Institute. The discount applied to access tariffs to electricity networks, applicable as of 1 January 2018, as provided for in Article 3(2) of Decree-Law No 138-A/2010 of 28 December 2010, in the wording given by Decree-Law No 172/2014 of 14 November 2014 and Law No 7-A/2016 of 30 March 2016, is required to correspond to a value allowing a discount of 33.8 % on the transitional sale tariffs to end electricity customers, excluding VAT, other taxes, contributions, levies and late-payment interest which apply in accordance with Official order No 9081-C/2017 of 11 October 2017. The discount applied to access tariffs to natural gas networks, applicable as of 1 July 2017, as provided for in Article 3(2) of Decree-Law No 101/2011 of 30 September 2011, in the wording given by Law No 7-A/2016 of 30 March 2016, is required to correspond to a value allowing a discount of 31.2% on the transitional sale tariffs to final natural gas customers, excluding VAT, other taxes, contributions, levies and late-payment interest which apply, and such application shall not be considered for purposes of other supports currently in effect, in accordance with Official order No 3229/2017 of 11 April 2017.
