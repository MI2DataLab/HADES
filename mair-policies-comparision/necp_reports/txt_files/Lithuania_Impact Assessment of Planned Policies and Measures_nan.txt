239   5.1  Impacts of planned policies and measures on the energy system and GHG emissions  This Chapter describes the scenario for the implementation of the planned policies and measures (PPM): the impact of the planned policies and measures on the achievement of the GHG emission reduction targets, the increased use of RES and energy efficiency. It also describes the financing needs and possible sources of financing required for the implementation of the planned policies and the impact on macroeconomics, social dimension and regional cooperation.  GHG emissions and removals In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council131, obligations are laid down for Member States with respect to their minimum contributions for the period from 2021 to 2030 to fulfilling the target for the non-ETS sectors. Lithuania will have to reduce GHG emissions in sectors outside the EU ETS (energy, transport, industry, agriculture, waste) by 9% compared to 2005. In order to achieve this target, Lithuania has foreseen a number of additional measures, which are described in detail in section 3.1.1.  16000  14000  12000  10000  000  6000  4000  2000  0  PPM GHG savings 2021-2030 quota  Fig. 5.1.1.1. Projected GHG savings in non-ETS sectors (PPM)   Additional policies and measures in sectors outside the EU ETS will reduce GHG emissions by 25% in 2030, compared to the EPM scenario. GHG emissions will be reduced by 13% in the 2021-2030 period and by 29% in the 2031-2040 period, compared to the EPM scenario. In the transport sector, the planned policies and measures will have the greatest impact on GHG reductions compared to other sectors. The transport sector will reduce GHG emissions by 21% in the 2021-2030 period and by 47% in the 2031-2040 period, compared to the EPM scenario. In other sectors, GHG reductions will be more moderate: 4% to 8% in 2021-2030 and 12% to 29% in 20312040.                                                              131 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/LT/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32018R0842 240   Table 5.1.1.1.

Based on the projections of GHG emissions in non-ETS sectors, GHG emissions will be higher than the projected annual emission allocations in the 2021-2024 period and GHG emissions are forecast to be lower than provided allocations as from 2025.  The sectors of the Lithuanian economy and factors determining changes in GHG emissions are described below.   Energy (without transport) The planned policies and measures in the energy sector will focus on the development of RES and the improvement of energy efficiency and of the energy market. Under this scenario, electrification processes in transport accelerate the growth of electricity consumption. 254   6000  5000  4000  3000  2000  1000  0  ETS Non-ETS  Fig.5.1.1.3.

The effect of the planned additional measures will increase gradually, so by 2024, GHG emissions will be higher than their allocations, but in the subsequent years, when the effect increases in the transport sector as well, the set target is planned to be met.  7000  6000  5000  4000  3000  2000  1000  0  PPM GHG savings kt CO2 eq kt CO2 eq 255   Fig. 5.1.1.6.

Projected GHG emissions in the agricultural sector with additional measures  Compared to 2005, the total GHG emissions from the agricultural sector are projected to decrease by 11% in 2030 and by 12% in 2040 due to the planned additional measures.   Land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) The planned policies and measures in the LULUCF sector will focus on increasing GHG absorption by perennial crop biomass through afforestation, shrub restructuring, reforestation (replanting rather than leaving for spontaneous regeneration), and promoting perennial crop production on agricultural land. Also, major attention will be paid to the preservation of permanent grasslands and restoration of wetlands.  The list of measures and the cumulative GHG reduction effect for the 2021-2030 period with the planned policies   The projected GHG emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector with additional measures were prepared on the basis of the projected GHG emissions and removals with the existing policies and measures, as kt CO2 eq 258   assessed impact of planned policies and measures.

Compared to 2005, a significant increase in GHG absorption is projected in 2030 and 2040 with the planned policies and measures: 6% and 18%, respectively.  In accordance with the commitment under Regulation (EU) No 2018/841, the annual difference in GHG emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector (by applying the special accounting rules provided for in this Regulation) has to be negative, i.e. the sector has to generate more removals than emissions or at least the cumulative quantity of GHG removals and emissions has to be equal to zero. The cumulative quantity of GHG emissions and removals is accounted for by deducting the fixed reference levels from GHG removals or emissions calculated in the categories of annually managed forest land, managed cropland and managed grassland in the period from 2021 to 2030 and adding the quantity of GHG removals or emissions from afforested and deforested land. The reference level for managed forest land is the projected GHG removals or emissions from forests, based on forest use tendencies between 2000 and 2009 and the structure of stand age classes for that period. The established indicative reference level of managed forest land (GHG removals of 2,722 kt CO2 eq / year) will be updated following the review by the European Commission according to the comments received. Reference levels for managed cropland and managed grassland and pastures are the average of GHG emissions/removals between 2005 and 2009. The indicative calculated reference level for managed cropland reaches 3,768 kt of GHG emissions of CO2 eq/year, and the reference level for managed grassland and pastures is 970 kt of GHG removals of CO2 eq/year.  The quantity of GHG removals and emissions from the LULUCF sector by individual land use category, applying the accounting rules provided for in Regulation (EU) No 2018/841, is presented in Figure 5.1.1.8. kt CO2 eq 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 2035 2036 2037 2038 2039 2040 258             2000 1000 0 -1000 -2000 -3000 -4000 -5000 -6000 -7000 -8000  Managed forest land Afforested land  Deforested land Managed cropland Managed grassland Fig. 5.1.1.11. Projected quantity of GHG emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector by accounting category under Regulation (EC) No 2018/841   Taking account of the accounting rules under Regulation (EU) No 2018/841, to calculate GHG removals and emissions -6,263 kt CO2 eq of GHG removals each year in the period from 2021 to 2025, part of which can be used to meet the GHG emission reduction commitments by the sectors outside the EU emission trading scheme. From 2026 to 2030 (during the second commitment period under Regulation (EU) No sector is projected to generate a total of -5,548 kt CO2 eq of GHG removals each year, part of which can be used to meet the GHG emission reduction commitments by part of the sectors outside the EU emission trading scheme. As Figure 5.1.1.8 shows, notwithstanding the application of the reference level, after deducting the reference level from the total annual GHG removals from forest land, this category still generates the highest GHG removal that can be used to meet the GHG emission reduction commitments of sectors outside the EU emission trading scheme.  Waste The planned policies and measures will focus on the prevention of food waste generation and the promotion of waste sorting and reuse. The planned measures focus on educating and informing the public about the problem of food waste and how to prevent it, improving waste sorting skills, creating information websites, applications and interactive maps. All planned measures will reduce the amounts of landfill waste, which will gradually reduce GHG emissions.

The planned policies and measures are projected to result in a significant reduction in GHG emissions in 2030 and 2040, compared to 2005, 64% and 78%, respectively.   EU ETS sectors In EU ETS sectors, operators from EU Member States (combustion plants above 20 MW , chemical and mineral industries) have been subject to progressively declining allocations with a view to reducing their total GHG emissions by 43% compared to 2005. To achieve this target, additional measures are planned, i.e. the development of renewable energy sources and the replacement of polluting technologies with cleaner ones. The additional policies and measures will reduce GHG emissions from EU ETS sectors by 42% in 2030 compared to 2005. 264   7000  6000  5000  4000  3000  2000  1000  0  PPM GHG savings  Fig. 5.1.13. Projected GHG emissions from EU ETS sectors (PPM)  The planned policies and measures for EU ETS sectors will reduce GHG emissions by 3% in the period from 2021 to 2030 and by 5% from 2031 to 2040. It should be noted that the projection does not take into account the impact of the price of allowances. In district electricity and heat production, the planned policies and measures will have the greatest impact on GHG reductions compared to other sectors. In the district electricity and heat production subsector, GHG emissions will decrease by 16% in the period from 2021 to 2030 and by 29% between 2031 and 2040. In other sectors, GHG emissions will decline more moderately up to 3% between 2021 and 2030 and up to 5% from 2031 to 2040.   Interactions between existing policies and measures and planned policies and measures  Transport. Existing measure T2 (Electrification of railways) has an impact on planned measure T9 (Introducing incentives for combined freight transport), since the increase in rail freight transport due to measure T9 does not directly increase GHG emissions in rail transport (due to T2 most railways will use electricity rather than fossil fuels). Measure T2 (Renewal of the transport fleet through green procurement and ensuring minimum procurement objectives in the field of transport) is intended to achieve the targets of Directive (EU) 2019/1161 of the European Parliament and of the Council, but the targets of the measure are more ambitious than those of the aforementioned Directive.  Measures T20, T21, T13, T10, T11, T32, T12, T7, T22 and T28 together contribute to a growth in the number of electric vehicles and cover aspects such as car pollution taxes, subsidising their purchase, infrastructure development and social dissemination. The absence of any of these aspects would significantly reduce the planned number of electric vehicles, for example, in the absence of pollution taxes, it would impossible to subsidise the purchase of electric vehicles; with poor infrastructure, electric vehicles would not be attractive. These planned measures contribute to the exiting incentives in relation to electric vehicles: the availability of specially designated lanes for fixed-route transport in Vilnius,as well as the reduction of parking and entry fees in Lithuanian cities. Of the additional measures listed, only T13 and T28 are specifically designed to increase the number of electric vehicles, and all other measures reduce GHG emissions in other ways. Measures related to car pollution taxes (T20 and T21) will have the greatest impact on the reduction of GHG emissions. Without implementing these measures, not only the reduction target will not be met but also a kt CO2 eq 265   number of other measures requiring financing from the Sustainable Mobility Fund will not be implemented. All funds from targeted pollution taxes should get into the Fund and be designed to promote the use of cleaner transport.  Industrial processes and product use. The planned measure for reducing the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases in businesses (P8) is a complement to existing policies and measures that are expected to achieve the targets of the Fluorinated Greenhouse Gas Regulation132 and the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.  Planned measure P9 promoting the replacement of polluting technologies with cleaner ones will have an impact on GHG emissions not only from the industry sector but also from energy. GHG savings resulting from the planned measures (P1, P6 and P7) related to fuel combustion in industry and construction are counted towards the energy sector.  Agriculture. Three measures are planned in relation to the use of mineral N fertilizers in the agricultural sector (A2, A5 and A8), which impact each other. The interactions between these measures have been taken into account in the evaluation of these measures. Measures A8 and A5 will have the greatest impact on GHG emissions. Planned measure A4 related to biogas production will have an impact on GHG emissions not only from the agricultural sector but also from the energy sector. GHG savings from the planned measures (A13, A14, A15 and A16) related to fuel consumption by agricultural machinery are included in the sectors or energy and transport. However, without reducing concessions for gas oils for agricultural activities and allocation reductions, there is a risk of failure to achieve the intended effect in other measures, such as the promotion of no-till technology.  Land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector. Measures L3, L5, L8 and L14 will have the greatest impact on GHG removals in the LULUCF sector. Under measure L3 related to the increase of forest area, in the 2021-2030 period, new areas will be afforested and non-forest land of spontaneous afforestation will be conserved (inventoried as forest land) at a rate of 8 ha per year. This measure contributes to the increase of GHG removals from forest land due to the increasing accumulation of organic carbon in tree biomass, soil and forest floor. Measure L5 concerns the restoration of wetland hydrological regime and natural vegetation as well as avoided emissions due to the drainage and intensive use of organic soils. Measure L8 is also aimed at protecting organic soils by encouraging the conversion of heavily used arable peatlands to permanent grasslands. Measure L14 is aimed at increasing GHG removals from soil by promoting the development of non-till technology in agriculture. The difference between projected GHG emissions and removals with the existing measures and the additional measures in the LULUCF sector is due to the large number of planned measures, which are currently not covered by decisions and are not being implemented. Currently, only the afforestation measure has been approved and implemented under the National Forest Sector Development Programme 2012-2020 that foresees to increase the country's forest -mentioned measure increasing forest cover is included in both projection scenarios, while the measures described in Chapter 3 are included in the projections with additional measures leading to an overall projected increase in GHG absorption (2021-2025) and decrease in GHG emissions in the LULUCF sector in 2026-2040, compared to projections without additional measures. Waste. The planned policies and measures in the waste sector are complementary to the existing policies and measures that are expected to achieve the objectives of EU legislation (Waste Directive133, Packaging                                                            132 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/LT/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0517&from=EN 133 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/LT/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018L0851&from=LT 266   Waste Directive134, Landfill Directive135).  The main objective of the planned policies and measures is to promote waste prevention, reuse and recycling.   Energy Sector: energy from renewable sources and dimension of energy efficiency  Dimension of energy efficiency When evaluating the energy sector and its transformation in the PPM scenario, it is useful to start with an overview of the projections of changes in energy needs. Below is information on projected changes in energy demand for 2020, 2025, 2030, 2035 and 2040.  The key measures planned to improve energy efficiency (EE) that will reduce energy consumption in the period from 2020 to 2040 are: the use of more efficient products and equipment as technology evolves, transition to low-temperature DH, modernisation of inlet heating substations, improvement of EE in non-industrial sector, implementation of smart metering and use of waste heat. The planned measures and their impact are detailed below.   EE7: To replace inefficient boilers with other RES technologies or connect them to the district heating system. Under this measure it is planned that by 2030 households will replace 10% of boilers (of 500,000 in total; about 50,000 boilers) with efficient biofuel boilers or heat pumps, or consumer equipment will be connected to DH, and other heat energy efficiency improvement measures will be applied, leading the savings of at least 400 GWh per year.   EE8: To promote the improvement of the efficiency of the heat transmission network by adapting to low-temperature operation, including the modernisation of heating substations and/or heating and hot water systems. Under this measure, in the period from 2019 to 2030, about 250 inlet heating substations will be modernised and 10 GWh of heat energy will saved each year.   AEI27: To promote the use of waste heat generated by industry, the waste sector or from cooling energy in the DH sector. When the measure is launched in 2021, the use of waste heat in DH will amount to 0.45 TWh annually by 2030.   EE10: Renovation of private houses. Under this measure, by 2030 it is planned to renovate 1,000 private houses, saving 0.0135 TWh of energy each year.   EE12: Modernisation of street lighting systems. This measure will promote the modernisation of street lighting systems in order to upgrade 25% of all street luminaires in Lithuania. It is planned to upgrade 6,500 street luminaires and save 1.67 GWh each year.  Table 5.1.2.1.

Energy consumption projection, PPM  The data presented show that in the case of PPM, a final energy saving of 18.6% is achieved by 2030, and a 23.6% reduction in energy consumption is planned for 2040 respectively. Compared to the EPM scenario, 268   savings in the same periods are 3.8% and 5.9%.  Renewable energy  Electricity production. When assessing the impact of planned policies and measures on the energy sector, it is necessary to emphasise the main projected significant surge in installed capacity in RES production installations: in the period from 2025 to 2035 offshore wind turbines with an installed capacity of 700 MW  will be built in the Baltic Sea by 2040, producing about 20.1 TWh of electricity, and significantly increase the share of RES in the electricity production mix. Without this additional RES capacity, Lithuania would not meet its RES target for electricity generation.  The planned measures which will contribute most to the promotion of RES use in the 2020-2040 period are continued support to prosumers, the construction of new cogeneration plants, financial support for small-scale power plants, the RES for industry LT+ programme, and the development of offshore wind turbines in the Baltic Sea.  AEI2: Financial support to prosumers. The measure was approved in 2018 and is planned to continue until 2030. The supported activity is the installation of small-scale solar power plants. This support will provide 696 MW  of installed capacity as from 2024.  AEI4: Financial support for investments in small-scale power plants. Support in the period from 2022 to 2025 is planned to ensure the production of at least 0.03 TWh of electricity from RES. It is planned to install a 5 MW  cogeneration plant using biofuels. At the same time, an additional 15 MW  RES heat production flow in DH systems is planned.  AEI5: RES development in the Baltic Sea. Under this measure, wind turbines of 700 MW  will be built in the Baltic Sea. The planned capacity is projected to be achieved in two stages: 350 MW  in 2028 and 350 MW  in 2031.  AEI6: The use of renewable energy sources in industry. Under this measure, industrial companies will install about 60 MW  of new RES production installations, of which 70% will be for electricity generation and 30% for heat production. Capacities are scheduled to be built and fully operational for 2023.  AEI7: RES use in public and residential buildings. This measure will encourage public building administrators and home-owners to build RES production installations. It is projected that this measure will add about 50 MW  of RES capacity.  Taking into account the EE improvement and RES promotion measures to be introduced by 2040, a significant shift is projected from the use of fossil fuels to RES for energy production. The table below presents a comparison of the EPM and PPM scenarios for assessing the penetration of electricity produced from RES (the RES-E indicator).          269                                Fig. 5.1.2.2. Penetration of electricity from RES with EPM and PPM  The PPM scenario foresees a relatively high penetration of RES production capacity. It should be noted that in the PPM scenario, electricity generation from RES without the introduction of new capacity tends to decrease. This is because PPM are expected to have a relatively large electrification effect in the transport sector, resulting in a steady increase in electricity demand and, accordingly, when RES capacity does not increase, the total RES amount relatively decreases.  Table 5.1.2.2. shows the new RES capacity with PPM projected in the assessment. The development will include the installation of solar and wind power plants.  Table 5.1.2.2.

It is additionally important to mention that Vilnius and Kaunas waste incineration plants, whose commissioning is planned for 2020-2021, have a significant impact on the sector of electricity from RES. The total electricity generation capacity of the power plants is 43 MW  and heat output is 130 MW . In  MW  biofuel cogeneration unit will be launched in 2020.  The emergence of new electricity generation capacities in the Lithuanian electricity system will improve the local generation rates, and accordingly contribute to the system reliability and security (by developing system balancing measures in parallel). The chart below shows the situation of the local generation in Lithuania under EPM and PPM scenarios.   KEY Electricity generation in Lithuania ElGen LT EPM ElGen PPM  Fig. 5.1.2.3. Electricity generation scenarios in Lithuania  As the chart shows, under the PPM scenario, the local generation will reach 67% in 2030, while the current local generation level accounts for a mere 30%. The chart does not estimate the potential emerging capacity for balancing the electrical system. At present, it is difficult to determine what specific technologies will be used to balance the system, but it can be assumed that in the short and medium term this function should be performed by gas burning installations and in the long term more innovative energy storage systems can be expected to enter the balancing market.  The heat sector will also change significantly: the share of RES in the district heating balance will grow by almost 30% and already by 2027 should account for slightly more than 91%. This will be largely determined by the VCP and KCP projects, the impact of which will be further strengthened by continued support for small-scale cogeneration plants, and use of waste heat in DH.  Such a share of RES could not be achieved without further implementation of EE measures: the renovation of apartment buildings, public buildings and private houses, replacement of boilers with more efficient or RES technologies, improvement of EE in industrial enterprises and modernisation of street lighting systems.   KEY  RES-DH RES-DH, EPM    RES-DH, PPM   Fig. 5.1.2.4. Heat sector scenarios for RES  In the case of EEE, the share of RES in the district heating fuel mix increases due to faster energy efficiency 271   measures and the inclusion of waste heat in the volume of RES. As the Figure shows, the level of RES in DH is slanting at 90%, i.e. 10% of the structure is composed of fossil fuels, of which the main are: the minimum amount of natural gas required for system balancing and covering peaks, non-renewable part of household waste, etc.  The fuel mix for district heating systems in the EEE scenario is presented in Figure 5.1.2.5.

DH mix  It can be seen from the DH fuel mix that, unlike in the case of EPM, the PPM scenario shows a much steeper decrease in fuel demands (respectively the heat demand) during the period under review. Compared to the 2018 facts, fuel demand in 2030 and 2040 will shrink by 19.1% and 25.0% respectively. Such a sharp decrease in heat demand is related to the continued building renovation processes in the PPM scenario, the increase in heat pump usage observed in the market and other energy efficiency improvement measures being implemented.  It is worth mentioning that during modelling, natural gas consumption was reduced to the minimum needed to meet peak demand and balance systems. Upon accepting this assumption and following the further decrease in heat demand, biofuels become the balancing line in the fuel mix. This can be observed from 2027, when the minimum amount of natural gas is recorded and the further balancing of production and demand is implemented by reducing the use of biofuels.  Taking into account not only district heat production, but also total heat production in Lithuania (adding volumes of decentralised heat production), the RES indicator for heat is obtained, which shows the proportion of RES in the total mix of fuel used for heating. Changes in this indicator in the cases of EPM and PPM scenarios are presented below. 269                                Fig. 5.2.2.6. EPM and PPM scenarios for the RES heat and cooling sector  As mentioned above, the assumption regarding the inclusion of waste heat as RES in the estimation of RES in the EPM and PPM scenarios had the greatest impact. In addition, it is worth noting that the share of RES starts declining steadily in both scenarios in 2007. This is related to the decrease of energy demand for heating and consequently the failure to introduce new RES capacity.  The following assumptions have been evaluated when projecting changes in the share of RES in the transport sector:  AEI10: To increase the mandatory blending of 1st-generation biodiesel to mineral fuels by 5% by volume for a transitional period. The total amount of 1st-generation biodiesel is projected to increase by 30.47 ktoe between 2020 and 2030.   AEI13: Support for 2nd-generation biofuels: to cover biodiesel operating costs and to finance bioethanol production facilities through mandatory blending. It is projected that by 2030 this measure will produce the following share of biofuels placed on the market: 12.8 ktoe of 2nd-generation biodiesel and 6.45 ktoe of 2nd-generation bioethanol.   AEI14: Support for the production of biomethane gas: to install plants, to cover operating costs for manufacturers and to purchase of CNG vehicles adapted to run on biomethane gas. It is planned that in the period from 2020 to 2030 new generation capacity would be installed to produce 85.1 ktoe of biomethane gas for use in the transport sector.

Fuel mix of the transport sector, PPM  Unlike the EPM scenario, PPM have the ambitious goal of both reducing actual fuel consumption and implementing fuel-switch measures.  As can be seen in the Figure, a rather rapid reduction in diesel consumption is planned, which is to be partially replaced by the use of natural gas and electrification. The projections for the use of RES fuels, distinguishing them from other fuels, are shown in Figure 5.1.2.8.

RES share in gross final energy consumption and in relevant sectors  The data presented show that with PPM the RES targets would be met for heating and cooling, electricity generation and transport. Given the time needed to implement some measures (for example, winning the auction and building wind parks), interim targets for RES-E and RES-T in 2025 may not be achieved. Nevertheless, the PPM effect will offset this effect and the 2030 targets will be achieved (as shown by the modelling results). The total fuel consumption (including RES) for the EEE scenario is given below.                           Fig. 5.1.2.11. Total fuel consumption in the PPM scenario  The presented Figure shows that fuel consumption in individual sectors of the economy and the amount of fuel used for electricity and heat production in Lithuania are decreasing in the case of the PPM scenario. Comparing the existing fact, i.e. the fact of 2018, with 2030 and 2040, a decrease of 14.4% and 21.5% is projected, respectively. This is related to the ambitious targets in the transport sector, which plans significant electrification, covering both light-duty and heavy-duty road transport and railway electrification. In addition, ambitious measures for energy efficiency improvement are planned, which, if successfully implemented, would aim to implement decoupling of economic growth from energy consumption. In the event of success, this would mean that a consistent GDP growth in the country would not lead to automatic growth of energy resources.

Two scenarios were modelled in the evaluation: the baseline scenario (using the existing policy and measure package (the EPM scenario)) and the planned policy and measure scenario (the PPM scenario), the impact of which on national energy and climate targets is described in previous sections of Chapter 5. The results of the evaluation reveal the impact of the measures on two different periods: during the implementation of the Plan (2020-2030) and after the implementation of the Plan (2031-2040).  According to a preliminary estimate of funding needs from ministry experts, the implementation of the PPM scenario will cost about EUR 14 billion. The modelling has assumed that about 50% of these funds, or about EUR 7 billion, will be sought from the EU Structural Funds and other external sources, 21% or EUR 3 billion should be allocated from the national budget, while private funds will contribute 29%, or EUR 4 billion. It should be noted that the stated need for external funds significantly exceeds the total amount from EU Structural Funds allocated to Lithuania in the previous financing period, therefore, when modelling the PPM scenario, it was assumed that the remaining funds (about EUR 3.5 billion) would be borrowed on the international financial markets. It should be noted that in such a case, the implementation of the PPM scenario would increase the public debt.  According to the results of macroeconomic modelling, implementation of the planned policies and measures Plan (2020-2030) LiPlan (2031-2040) would be on average 0.23% higher than without the planned policies. The greatest impact  measures would result in a GDP increase of 2.25% compared to the baseline scenario (see Fig. 5.2.1). Investments in the PPM scenario would be 8.66% higher than in the baseline scenario.   53.000   48.000   43.000   38.000   33.000    Baseline  Fig. 5.2.1.

This results from increased demand for imported capital goods and related services due to the growth of investment activities funded under the Plan, where the full positive effects of PPM scenario interventions have not yet materialised. After the implementation of the Plan (2031-import-export balance would be 0.36 percentage points higher than it would have been had the Plan measures not been implemented. The longer-term increase in the import-export balance would be due to a lower demand for energy imports compared to the baseline scenario.  Macroeconomic modelling reveals the different response of different sectors to the cost of the Plan for the economy (Figure 5.2.2). For example, the construction sector would have a significant positive impact during the implementation of the Plan (2020-2030), as a growth in investment activities funded by the Plan would increase demand for construction services. The manufacturing sector would feel a small negative impact during the implementation of the Plan, in part due to a slight decrease in international competitiveness,   25   20   15   10   5   0   -5 Agricultural sector Manufacturing sector Construction sector Energy sector Market service sector Transport sector  Fig. 5.2.1. Impact on added value of individual sectors, %  The energy sector would feel a significant positive impact, both during the implementation of the Plan and in the subsequent period, due to the physical infrastructure created by the measures of the Plan, contributing directly and indirectly to increasing energy production capacity and output of the energy sector. The added value of the Lithuanian energy sector would be 7.19% higher during the implementation of the Plan (2020-2030) and 15.1% higher in the period after the implementation of the Plan (2031-2040) than without the implementation of the PPM scenario.

Nevertheless, the planned investments could mitigate these negative trends, at least temporarily. The implementation of the planned policy in 2020-2030 would increase the employment rate in Lithuania by 1.56% compared to the baseline scenario. This is a short-term additional services that require additional employment from the private sector. In the period after the implementation of the PPM (2031-% 277   2040), the number of the employed in Lithuania is likely to be on average 0.14% higher than in the absence of the planned policies.  would contribute to the reduction of energy poverty and the share of persons at risk of poverty and experiencing social exclusion in Lithuania. During the implementation of the Plan (2020-2030), the average percentage of disposable income of Lithuanian households for maintaining dwelling would be 0.33 percentage points lower, and in the period after the implementation of the Plan (2031-2040) 0.27 percentage points lower, than without the implementation of the PPM package.  Implementation of the planned policies would contribute to the growth of household income: during the implementation of the National Plan, the average monthly disposable income in cash and in kind per household in all income groups would be about 2.1% higher compared to the baseline scenario and 0.3% higher in the post-plan period than without the implementation of the Plan. During the Plan implementation period, the percentage of persons at risk of poverty or social exclusion in Lithuania would be 0.37 percentage points lower, and in the period following the implementation of the Plan, 0.28 percentage points lower than    Impact of planned policy measures on air pollution to a lesser extent reduce the combustion of fuels in electricity and heat production, industry, the services sector, agriculture, and households. Landfilling and the use of inorganic nitrogen fertilisers should also be significantly reduced. However, the development of railways and inland waterway shipping is foreseen, which will increase fuel consumption in these sectors. A slight growth in natural gas use at pipeline compressor stations is also expected.  Table 5.2.2.1.

For GHG emission reduction measures alone, the total funding need would amount to EUR 10.8 billion, of which the need for public funding would account for EUR 6.5 billion (see Table 5.3.1.).  Table 5.3.1.

In order to increase the share of private capital to 50% during the implementation phase of the National Plan, priority will be given to measures that ensure a greater contribution from the private sector. Planned and alternative policy measures set out in the Plan will be assessed in terms of their financial, economic, social and environmental benefits, choosing the most efficient set of measures and the means of their implementation. It should be noted that the costs of implementing the National Plan can be significantly reduced by bringing forward and reinforcing economic signals to reduce GHG emissions to operators in sectoral markets, including, but not limited to, the earlier phase-out innovative green finance solutions increasing the contribution of the private sector.  The transport sector is most in need of funding in the PPM package as it accounts for almost 1/3 of total GHG emissions. Reducing GHG emissions requires substantial investment across the sector. The largest amounts of funds are planned for the implementation of measures under the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP), as well as for the promotion electric vehicles and alternative fuels and the development of their infrastructure, electrification of railways, promotion of low-emission vehicles and other measures for transport sector policy measures.  In the energy sector, future investments focus mainly on improving energy efficiency, increasing the use of RES in different sectors of the country and the necessary improvement of the intelligence, reliability and security of energy networks, taking into account the recommendations of the European Commission set out in 136. The European Commission recommends Lithuania to: 1. Promote energy efficiency improvement measures.                                                            136 https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/2019-european-semester-country-report-lithuania_lt.pdf 280   2. Promote energy from renewable sources. 3. Deploy smart electricity systems and grids, as well as solutions for energy storage at local level. 4. Develop a sustainable, climate-resilient, intelligent, secure and intermodal Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T). 6. Develop sustainable, climate resilient, advanced and intermodal national, regional and local mobility. 7. Promote sustainable mobility and intermodal urban mobility. 7. Promote climate change adaptation, risk prevention and disaster resilience. 8. Promote biodiversity and green infrastructure in the urban environment and reduce pollution.  Towards achieving the 2030 climate change and energy targets, the main sources of public funds for 2021-2030 will be the 2021-2027 investments of EU funds (the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund), electricity and heat tariffs, national budget (the Climate Change Programme and the Waste Management Programme, etc.) and municipal budgets, the Modernisation Fund, the Innovation Fund, the Connecting Europe Facility, the Life Programme, and others.  To a lesser extent, but sources of public funds will also be attracted, such as funds received for public-interest services (SPI funds), funds for statistical transfers, and the Norwegian Financial Mechanism.  The new EU Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 aims to mobilise at least 25% of EU Structural and Investment Funds for climate change targets. The European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund should contribute to climate change at least 30% and 37% respectively. On this basis, the planned energy policy measures to improve energy efficiency in buildings, enterprises and public infrastructure would be financed by the European Regional Development Fund. The Cohesion Fund would invest more in the development of energy production capacities using RES both in the electricity and heat areas with a view to increasing the intelligence, flexibility and reliability of energy networks, i.e. in order to adequately prepare networks for the ambitious development of RES and its management and balancing, as well as support measures to adapt to climate change. Measures in the agricultural and LULUCF sectors are planned to be financed from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. The electrification of railways is planned to be co-financed by the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).  Electricity, gas and heat tariffs would be the second most important source of public funding through projects for the modernisation, smartness and development of public energy infrastructure in electricity and natural gas transmission, distribution and district heating networks. Lithuania, where possible, simultaneously combines the use of this funding source with other funding sources in order to protect consumers from a high financial burden.  The funds allocated to Lithuania under the Modernisation Fund would be used to modernise energy systems, to deploy energy storage solutions in both district heating and electricity transmission and distribution networks, in order to integrate the planned ambitious amounts of RES; and to improve energy efficiency in the sectors of transport, buildings, agriculture and waste (with the exception of energy efficiency related to the production of energy from solid fossil fuels). As from 2021, 2% of all allowances to be auctioned at EU level in the period from 2021 to 2030 will be allocated to this Fund. This would account for EUR 7.75 billion (at a CO2 price of EUR/t 25), while Lithuania would receive about 2.57% of the Modernisation Fund, which would amount to about EUR 232 million (at a CO2 price of EUR/t 25) for the period from 2021 to 2030.  In 2009, the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on Financial Instruments for Climate Change Management 281   established a Climate Change Programme to finance in Lithuania and in third countries climate change mitigation and adaptation projects in order to achieve the goals and objectives of the National Climate Change Management Policy. amount units and auctioned allowances, as well as voluntary funds and economic fines of natural and legal persons are administered by the Ministry of the Environment.  In the period from 2021 to 2030, the Climate Change Programme is also planned to be an effective source of national budget investments for financing projects for energy efficiency improvement in multi-apartment buildings, enterprises and the district heating sector, also for promoting the use of RES in the transport sector, implementing development cooperation projects in developing countries, public information and education, research studies, advising and training operators and other persons, as well as for afforestation and reforestation; for the implementation of measures to adapt to and mitigate climate change and other measures to effectively manage climate change policy.  The Waste Management Programme will finance measures in the waste sector to reduce GHG emissions.  It is planned that in 2021-2030 national and municipal budget funds will be needed for the projects to renovate public buildings, implement sustainable urban mobility plans, modernise the street lighting system by improving energy efficiency, and to increase the use of renewable energy sources in the transport sector.  In October 2017, after Lithuania has signed an agreement on statistical transfers with Luxembourg, an additional source of funding opened up for the country to invest EUR 10.5 million resulting from these transfers in areas related to RES and energy efficiency improvement. It is planned to use these funds for the development of RES capacity in the field of electricity and for RES-related research.  Funds from the LIFE Programme and Life IP would be used to finance studies in the energy sector, transition to production from clean sources or to innovative measures in the energy sector, and GHG reduction measures, applied research and innovation in various sectors of the economy.  The creation of a Sustainable Mobility Fund is planned as a measure. The Fund is the primary and necessary measure for the implementation of other measures. The Fund should receive all funds from targeted pollution taxes and be aimed at promoting cleaner transport (incentives for the installation of recharging points for electric vehicles, purchase of zero-emission vehicles, social dissemination and building sustainable mobility habits). 282   5.4 Impact of planned policies and measures on other Member States and regional cooperation  Projects and initiatives in the field of energy, which have or will have a regional impact:  Synchronisation with the continental European networks The aim is the development of infrastructure for deeper integration of the electricity market and the  network  The importance of synchronisation with CEN for the Baltic States:  The Baltic States will finally solve the geopolitical risks to the electricity system.  Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia will take over from Moscow the essential rights and obligations for frequency management of the electricity system.  Electricity systems in the Baltic States will be governed by uniform and transparent European rules.  Switching from centralised to decentralised management of the electricity transmission system (diversification of system security risks).  Baltic and regional cooperation in implementing the synchronisation with CEN:  The June 2007 Communication of the Prime Ministers of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia recognised the synchronisation with CEN as a common strategic goal for the Baltic States.  A feasibility study on the integration of the Baltic States into the European Union internal electricity market by 2020 was carried out in autumn 2013 by the Baltic electricity transmission system operators and the Swedish consultancy Gothia Power AB.  On 5 December 2014, at the meeting of the Baltic Council of Ministers, the Prime Ministers of the Baltic States stressed the importance of synchronising the Baltic States with CEN through the links between Lithuania and Poland and instructed the responsible ministers in the Baltic States to take the necessary steps to ensure the implementation of the project as a matter of urgency.  Accordingly, on 14 January 2015, the Baltic Ministers responsible for energy signed a Joint Declaration on Security of Energy Supply in which they agreed, inter alia, to work towards a harmonious and timely implementation of the synchronisation with CEN project (with a realistic deadline of 2025).  The conclusions of the European Council of 20 March 2015 acknowledged that the Baltic States' political agreement to implement synchronisation with continental European networks will contribute to the strengthening of energy security.  An updated BEMIP plan was signed on 8 June 2015, which included a synchronisation project and the creation of a special High Level Group (BEMIP HLG) and a regional working group on synchronisation.  On 18 November 2015, the European Commission approved the second list of projects of common interest (PCI), which includes infrastructure projects of importance for synchronisation in the Baltic States (project group for the strengthening of internal networks in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and has separate point dedicated to the joint synchronisation project.  On 15 December 2015, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the implementation of the European Commission communication on the 10% electricity interconnection target in the European Union. This resolution recognises that the synchronous operation of the Baltic States with the Russian electricity system will not ensure the efficient functioning of the European electricity market. In this context, the European Parliament calls for further work on Baltic synchronisation with CEN as a matter of urgency and urges stakeholders and ENTSO-E to initiate 283   the necessary procedures for the extension of the European continental network synchronisation area to the Baltic States.  On 23 November 2017, the EU third list of projects of common interest was approved, which includes a common synchronisation project and a certain number of projects related to the implementation of synchronisation in the Baltic States for the development of internal electricity system infrastructure.  On 28 June 2018, a Roadmap was signed at the highest political level between the Baltic States, networks with the continental European electricity network via Poland by 2025. The approved the continental European network by 2025 and identify the specific method (synchronisation via the existing LitPol Link connection, additionally laying an underwater high-voltage direct current (HVDC) cable between Poland and Lithuania and installing synchronous condensers).  On 23 January 2019, the European Commission provided funding for the synchronisation of the  continental European networks. The Connecting Europe Facility allocated EUR 324 million to the Baltic States.  On 20 June 2019, at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels, President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker, President of LithuMateusz Morawiecki signed a political roadmap implementing the synchronisation of the Baltic States' electricity systems with the European networks. It establishes a concrete action plan and the necessary key projects to be implemented by 2025, when the Baltic States will join a secure and reliable European energy system. The political roadmap stipulates that: (1) the BEMIP High Level Group will supervise the practical implementation of the project and ensure that the agreed timetable for works is respected; (2) the Baltic and Polish transmission system operators, in close cooperation with ENTSO-E, must implement the key infrastructure projects; (3) discussions must be continued at technical level with Russia and Belarus on the disconnection (desynchronisation) of the Baltic States from the IPS/UPS system without leaving the infrastructure for trade with third countries.  Natural gas market Cooperation with the Baltic regulatory authorities and transmission system operators will aim to integrate with the gas markets of other countries in the region (in particular, Latvia, Estonia and Finland) by harmonising the legal and regulatory environment in the gas sector, abolishing cross-border transmission tariffs, connecting markets to a common balancing zone, trading gas at one virtual point of sale and ensuring that sufficient gas infrastructure is in place to operate in a single gas market. This would create better access to alternative sources of gas for other countries in the region, facilitate gas trade in the region and allow for greater cross-border gas flows and more efficient use of gas infrastructure, as well as increased competition.  whole region and created conditions for competition on the Lithuanian natural gas market by importing natural gas from all over the world. Natural gas may be supplied to customers from different suppliers at market prices.  In addition, the implementation of the gas pipeline interconnection project between Poland and Lithuania (GIPL) (2021) will integrate the gas markets of the Baltic States and Finland into the single EU gas market, create access to alternative sources and routes of gas supply and increase the competitiveness of the gas market, increase security and reliability of gas supply in the region by creating both additional gas 284   transmission capacities and the possibility of applying EU solidarity mechanisms in the event of an regional role and facilitate the integration of energy produced from RES.  The Latvian-Lithuanian capacity enhancement project (ELLI) (2023) will ensure sufficient capacity between the Baltic States and other European countries, increase security of gas supply in the region, improve integration of the Baltic States' gas markets and the functioning of the regional gas market.   Promoting the use of LNG fuels We promote the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a clean fuel for heavy-duty transport and transport by ship in Lithuania and throughout the region.  1. Use of LNG in heavy-duty transport (synergies between RES and LNG) The use of LNG as a fuel is the only clean technology currently available in heavy-duty transport. Compared to light-duty transport, there are no alternative technologies for heavy-duty transport, and pollution reduction decisions have to be taken today. It should be noted that the use of LNG in transport contributes significantly to the reduction of emissions into ambient air. Compared to conventional diesel used in transport, LNG can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20% (note: with biomethane CO2 emissions can be reduced by even more than 85%). It is important to recall that CO2 accounts for the major share in the composition of greenhouse gases. The use of LNG in transport can reduce other environmental emissions, such as SOx, or NOx, by 99% and 80% respectively, and halve noise pollution.  We note that synergies between renewable energy sources and LNG are some of the prospective areas. Improving energy efficiency in public infrastructure and reducing the intensity of polluting energy in transport through the synergies between RES and LNG would ensure a significant reduction in GHG emissions.  2. Use of LNG in transport by ship The development and importance of the LNG market in the region are evident. LNG fuel used for ships -  The issue of reducing air pollution is currently highly relevant at global level. Ambient air pollution is one of the most serious health and environmental issues and, therefore, major attention has to be paid to the reduction of ambient air pollution. In order to reduce the amount of pollutants released into the enviro When evaluating the adverse effects of pollutants, certain preventive measures with the highest added value and targeted reduction of air pollution must be considered and envisaged. Particular attention must inevitably be paid to the reduction of emissions from the maritime transport sector.  It is noteworthy that the reduction of air pollution from ships is particularly relevant at present due to the 0.1% SOx limit on fuel, effective of January 2015, in the zones of the Emission Control Area (ECA), including the Baltic Sea region.  Currently, this limit applies only to ships operating in ECA zones, but as of 2020, it will also apply globally at a concentration of 0.5% SOx in fuels. Stricter requirements have influenced the development of new technologies contributing to the reduction of emissions and the choice of these technologies in the maritime sector. It should be noted that one of the most promising ways of reducing the toxicity of emissions from 285   ships is to use liquefied natural gas as a less polluting alternative to conventional fuels. The use of LNG ensures that the ship complies with both the SOx requirements and the more stringent NOx requirements.  The use of LNG as a less polluting alternative contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas and other pollutant emissions into the environment.  It should be noted that the use of LNG as a fuel throughout a ship's life cycle contributes to a significant reduction in GHG emissions. Compared to conventional marine fuels, the use of LNG can reduce GHG, including CO2, emissions by more than 20%. It should be stressed that the use of LNG also contributes to the reduction of other emissions into the environment. Compared to fuel oil, environmental emissions, e.g. SO2 or NOx, are close to zero, i.e. SO2 and NOx emissions decrease by 99% and 90% respectively. The use of LNG also reduces air pollution by 50%.  It is important to note that one typical Baltic cargo LNG-fuelled ship emits around 50 tonnes less of SOx, over 150 tonnes less of NOx and around 2000 tonnes less of CO2 per year.  Renewable energy In implementing policies and measures aimed at increasing the share of energy produced from RES in the energy and transport sectors, the Lithuanian designated body (natural gas transmission system operator) authorised to issue, transfer and cancel guarantees of origin for gas produced from RES will, in cooperation with designated bodies in other Member States and organisations in the gas sector in RES, create a favourable regulatory environment for trade in guarantees of origin for RES with other Member States: by harmonising national requirements for guarantees of origin (including sustainability certification) for RES with those of other countries, establishing a European guarantee of origin register scheme, providing methodological support for the development of RES gas production projects in partner countries and establishing other national biomethane registers in EU countries where they are not established.  In the context of the intensive development of RES generation and the significant increase in the share of RES in the overall energy mix, integration into the electricity transport system and balancing of the electricity grid (both at national and regional level) will be addressed through the use of the Power to Gas technologies, the transformation of excess electricity into a gaseous form of energy (hydrogen and methane) and the transport of gas via the transmission/distribution networks to energy storage and consumption sites in cooperation with gas and electricity transmission system operators in neighbouring countries.  Lithuania is also interested in cooperation in developing offshore wind energy projects and harmonising biofuel blends in transport fuels in the region.  Biofuel exchange Establishing a biofuel exchange platform in Member States across the region:  will establish a regional platform for an unlimited number of biofuel suppliers;  standardised biofuel products will facilitate trade between Member States;  active trade between Member States will help to make the entire EU biofuels market more liquid and accessible;  will establish a virtual biofuel supply system with the most economically advantageous transactions with the nearest buyer of biofuels as an alternative to a gas or oil pipeline;  will ensure security of supply by all biofuel suppliers in the region;  low barriers for new market entrants and a more attractive market for new investors;  will ensure the sharing and dissemination of information on the biofuels market; 286    will ensure the sustainability and CO2 neutrality of the biofuels supplied.  All these elements will contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the RES Directive and to providing competitive alternative of sustainable and CO2 neutral supply of biofuels to the existing fossil fuel transmission networks (gas or oil).  The biofuel exchange platform will standardise biofuel fuel products and the processes of their delivery. Such product standardisation in the region will not only make it easier and quicker to conclude transactions between Member States, but will also ensure the security of the energy supply chain by diversifying the risk of supply disruptions for all members of the platform without paying additional fees to the platform operator, thus ensuring security of supply without increasing the price of biofuels.  The system of the biofuel exchange platform is programmed in such a way that GPS determines the distance to each buyer based on the location of the supplier (the seller of biofuels may even limit the geography of the activity). Therefore, once the exact transport costs of 1 km have been determined by the biofuel suppliers, the system itself will accurately calculate the biofuel transport costs for each transaction (e.g. biofuels from the same supplier will be offered to different customers at different prices due to different customer locations) and will conclude the most economically advantageous transaction between the nearest biofuel suppliers and customers. This will reduce the CO2 footprint of the transport of biofuels and ensure their sustainability.  The biofuel exchange platform increased the transparency and efficiency of the market in Lithuania, which in turn almost eliminated the price differences for biofuels between neighbouring municipalities. Establishing a common biofuel exchange platform in the region, with biofuel prices not differing by more than 15% between neighbouring Member States in the region, would reduce the transport of biofuels from one Member State to another, thus ensuring the sustainability of biofuels by further reducing the carbon footprint in biomass transport.  By standardising biofuel products, the biofuel exchange platform will also ensure their specifications and compliance and it is expected, therefore, to increase trade in certified biofuel products. By 2030, the aim is to achieve that all biofuels sold in the region are certified, thus ensuring that they are CO2 neutral, i.e. sustainable.  Standardisation of biofuel products also contributes to ensuring the sustainability of biofuels, as the worst biofuel product sold will encourage the use of all biomass generated (logging residues, industrial by-products, etc.).  Impact on energy prices The biofuel exchange platform will ensure competition between biofuel producers, as well as clear conditions and trade facilitation, thus not only reducing administrative costs for existing biofuel producers, but also facilitating market entry for new entrants throughout the region. The biofuel exchange platform will also help to determine the true market price of biofuels, which will help market participants to identify the current market situation. All these conditions will lead to decreasing margins for biofuel producers or resellers, i.e. decreasing prices of energy resources, and increasing attractiveness of biofuels as a renewable energy source.  Standardised biofuel products from the biofuel exchange platform will contribute to the vertical integration of individual sectors of the biofuel industry in the region, as the production of the biofuel product traded on the lowest quality platform allows the use of all residues from the wood industry (logging residues, industrial by-products, etc.). Such integration will contribute to the promotion of the wood industry itself throughout 287   the region.  In many cases, due to a natural monopoly in the district heating sector, heat prices are regulated by the national regulator and are not based on market competition. As a result, buyers of biofuels that produce heat do not have a strong interest in seeking the optimal price for their energy sources. For Member States, the biofuel exchange platform will help to ensure reasonable heat prices for district heating customers, who are usually the lowest income earners.  Regional cooperation The full functioning of the biofuel exchange platform requires compliance with the legislation of individual Member States, timely exchange of information and rapid resolution of emerging problems in individual Member States (e. g. better projection and resolution of existing ash removal problems), and, accordingly, looking are needed. Cooperation is currently maintained with Latvia, Estonia, Denmark and Finland, with planned enlargement to Poland and Germany. By 2030, it is planned to have a partner in all the countries of the Baltic Sea region.
