INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 295   5 IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF PLANNED POLICIES AND MEASURES45   5.1 Impact of planned policies and measures described in section 3 on energy system and GHG emissions and removals, including comparison with projections with current policies and measures (as described in section 4).   i. Projections of the development of the energy system and GHG emissions and removals as well as, where relevant, of emissions of air pollutants in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/2284 under the planned policies and measures at least until ten years after the period covered by the plan (including the last year of the period covered by the plan), including relevant Union policies and measures.   The combined action of policies, actions and investments provided for by the Energy and Climate Plan results not only in a reduction in demand due to energy efficiency, but also affects the way in which energy is produced and used, which differs from the trends in the past or developments in the system with current policies and measures. The drive towards net-zero emissions by 2050, in line with the long-term strategy, will trigger a complete transformation of the energy system and require new authorisation measures and policies after 2030.  The climate challenge presents complex problems both in terms of supply, dependence and security, and in terms of energy costs and, in particular, the issue of decarbonising the entire energy system, not only in the immediate future but also in the long term.  As shown in Chapter 2, the Energy and Climate plan provides efficiency, which transforms the energy system and aims to replace fossil fuels with renewables, thereby decarbonising the national production system. The graph and table below show the results of the INECP scenario projections up to 2040 and a comparison with the base scenario projections.

The decrease in gross inland consumption is not a result of the reduction in GDP or the levels of sectoral activity, but is mainly the result of technological changes and a fuel switch on the demand and supply sides. The replacement of fossil fuels with renewable sources will continue, accelerating after 2030 towards full decarbonisation.  The increase in energy efficiency, resulting from the combined effect of all policies, is one of the main factors leading to the reduction of emission intensity in the long term, as is evident from the continuously declining energy intensity in economic activity up to 2040.  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 297   Figure 65  Developments in energy intensity in 2040  The base scenario is already characterised by energy efficiency improvements that offset the increase in consumption driven by the economic growth up to 2040; these improvements are not, however, capable of maintaining the same rate of reduction in primary consumption in the period 2010-2020. The policies and measures in the Energy and Climate Plan do, however, trigger an even more rapid reduction in energy intensity, with average annual reduction of 2.3% in the period 2020-2040, so as to allow the downward trends in primary consumption to continue.  Figure 66  Mix of primary demand in 2030  Renewable sources are increasingly replacing consumption of fossil fuels, with primary demand increasing from 16.7% in 2016 to around 28% by 2030 in the INECP scenario.  After 2030, petroleum products will continue to be used in long-distance passenger and goods transport, but the use of these products will be significantly less by 2040 (around 17% of primary mix); this goes hand in hand with the energy sector transformation towards zero emissions by 2050. The decline in these products is most significant in the latter years of the scenario presented, when petroleum in transport is noticeably replaced by biofuels, hydrogen and electrically powered vehicles, both for passenger and goods transport.   million 65.3 56.8 110.9 INECP Baseline Solids Petroleum Products Gases Renewables Net electric import BASELINE  2030 INECP- 2030 21% 39% 32% 6% 2% 37% 28% 31% 2% 2% INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 298   In the base scenario, consumption of natural gas is fairly stable until 2030, contributing 39% to the primary energy demand. In the INECP long-term scenario, competition with RES and increasing process and building efficiency leads to a reduction in use of the fossil fuel natural gas (decreasing from 37% in 2030 to just over 30% in 2040).  Projections for energy security in 2040 indicate a sharp reduction in energy dependence, as a result of the combined effect of the increase in national renewable resources and the reduction in imports, particularly of fossil fuels.

In the base scenario, the EU-ETS mechanism encourages RES, which, in 2030, will provide 187 TWh of electricity.  The need to electrify end-use sectors to accompany the transition to decarbonisation by 2050 with increasingly carbon-free electricity supports the development of renewable electricity sources. The RES contribution will continue to grow up to 2040, reaching production of around 280 TWh. This is thanks in part to the effects of the learning curve that envisages, over time, increasingly low investment costs and renders these technologies competitive. Non-programmable renewable sources, mainly solar and wind, are expected to undergo significant growth; the expansion of these sources is set to continue even after 2030, and will also be managed through the use of significant quantities of storage systems, both on networks (electrochemical and pumping storage) and associated with the generation plants themselves (electrochemical storage). The strong presence of non-programmable renewable INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 299   sources from 2040 will lead to a high increase in overgeneration hours. This overproduction will not only be accumulated, but will have to be used in the production of alternative and zero-emission forms of energy such as hydrogen, biomethane, and e-fuels in general, which can be used to promote decarbonisation in sectors that are more difficult to electrify such as industry and transport.  Figure 67  Development of electrical generation46 in 2040 [Source: RSE]  Electrification plays a central role along with energy efficiency, above all in the long term, for decarbonisation in end-use consumption. Demand for the grid reaches 331.4 TWh in 2030 (gross internal electricity consumption of 339.5 TWh), while by 2040 it is close to 390 TWh. While electricity demand is destined to rise, energy efficiency will impact upon the development of other energy carriers. In fact, after 2030, the policies identified in the Plan will continue to encourage a significant improvement in energy efficiency in key end uses (buildings, lighting, cooling and heating, domestic appliances and industry), as well as replacing fossil fuels with electricity and renewables. After 2030, however, further policies will need to be drawn up to accompany the transformation of the energy system towards the 2050 zero emission target.   The following are important looking ahead to 2040: - improvements in end-use technologies and processes (vehicles, residential, heat recovery in industry, etc.); - continuing measures to renovate and insulate buildings (given the high potential), with average annual rates that could exceed 2% and the replacement of heat-generation systems with other more efficient and renewable systems (heat pumps); - an increase in electrification of end uses (particularly in the transport sector); - maintaining the increase in demand for private transport, with measures and investments in private collective transport; - the reduced heating requirements in new buildings; - the use of power to X (P2X) forms of energy delivery such as hydrogen, biomethane and liquid e-fuels - possible primary CO2 capture and sequestration plants, both in the electricity and industrial                                                             46 Excludes electrical production from pumps INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 300   sectors, to bring the energy system into line with the pathway to complete decarbonisation by 2050.

In this sector, emissions are directly linked to electricity production from fossil fuels. The significant growth in electricity production from renewable sources that is needed to achieve the targets is the determining factor; - in the transport sector, a 36% reduction in emissions due to the substantial electrification of car transport and, to a lesser extent, to the infiltration of biofuels; - in the residential sector, a 39% reduction in emissions due to the significant building renovation rate, the continued efficiency and increasing electrification of the sector, mainly with regard to heating; - a significant decline (-41%) in emissions from industry, both as regards energy consumption and as regards processes, concentrated mainly in the period 2005-2015, in part due to the economic crisis and in part to the structural variation in activities and the increase in efficiency of production processes, the impact of which is also evident in the reduction in emissions in the projection years (-7% from 2015 to 2030), despite the assumption of a significant upswing in production; - emissions from waste substantially unchanged compared with the base scenario due to the absence of further targets and measures; - as regards agriculture, the measures identified are currently still at the evaluation stage; emissions equal to those in the base scenario have therefore been conservatively cited.

Assessment of policy interactions (between current policies and measures and planned policies and measures within a policy dimension and between current policies and measures and planned policies and measures of different sizes) at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, in particular to establish a robust understanding of the impact of energy efficiency/energy savings policies on the sizing of the energy system and to reduce the risk of stranded investment in energy supply  iii. Assessment of interactions between current policies and measures and planned policies and measures, and between those policies and measures and Union climate and energy policy measures   INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 304   5.2 Macroeconomic impact and, to the extent feasible, the health, environmental, employment and education, skills and social impacts, including fair transition aspects (in terms of costs and benefits as well as cost-effectiveness) of the planned policies and measures described in section 3 at least until the last year of the period covered by the plan, including comparison with projections with current policies and measures   The INECP scenario can be analysed from the point of view of its macroeconomic impact compared with the scenario with the current policies (or baseline). The analysis was conducted using three different approaches: - a standard input/output model based on the sectoral interdependence matrices published by the National Institute for Statistics (based on GSE data); - the social accounting matrices (SAM) to examined the impact generated by new investments both in the business sector and the household sector (based on ENEA data); - a General economic equilibrium model (GTAP-GDyn-E) to assess the impact of the new targets on economic growth in Italy and on its competitive position in international trade (based on ENEA data). Analysis according to the standard Input/Output model The model is based on the sectoral interdependence matrices (Input/Output tables). These timeframe, highlighting the interdependencies between the various sectors of which the economy is made up in a concise and immediate manner. The matrices, having been properly converted using specific procedures, allow estimates to be made of the macroeconomic impact (value added, employment) due to variations in end demand in a particular sector in a given year. The matrices are established based on the input-output tables and the uses published on an annual basis by the National Institute for Statistics (Istat). The most recent tables available at the time of writing refer to the year 2014 and are broken down into 63 economic sectors.  One of the methodological obstacles presented by this type of analysis is that, in certain cases, the measures evaluated in the scenarios in the current Plan cannot be associated in any way with the 63 economic sectors in the matrix (with the current policies and INECP). This is the case, for example, with energy production plants that use renewable sources. In order to overcome this problem, the costs of implementing the measures (and the operating and maintenance costs  O&M  in the case of plants producing electricity and heat) have been broken down so as to be able to trace them back to the 63 economic sectors taken into account in the matrix. For example, the investment costs in new photovoltaic plants have been distributed and ascribed partly to the electrical appliance manufacturing sector (inverters, cables, etc.), and partly to that of the manufacture of metal products (support structures), thereby assigning to each cost item a variable price depending on the specific percentage of the total cost. By doing so, it has been possible to simulate the impact on the national economic system of the demand for new actions, associated with renewable sources or energy efficiency, including in the Plan scenarios.  Another element warranting attention is the sometimes substantial share of imports of products needed to implement the evaluated measures in the Plan scenarios. The matrices already include values and coefficients that take into account the share of imports in the INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 305   various sectors; however, it cannot be ruled out that, in particular sectors of economic activity (for example those which, when combined, redevelop the photovoltaic sector), this share, despite having already been taken into account, may be underestimated. In order to overcome this problem, the data reported by Istat in the context of the PRODCOM survey on international trade has been used.  The results obtained using the input/output model relate to economic impact, in terms of value added, and direct and indirect employment, both temporary and permanent. The permanent impact relates to employment associated with the use and maintenance of the assets for their entire life cycle, while the temporary impact relates to employment that is limited in terms of time to the design, development, installation and asset creation stages. The effects on employment are grouped into direct effects, relating to employment that is directly attributable to the sector in question, and indirect effects, relating to the sectors supplying the activity in question, either downstream or upstream. Estimated employment is not intended to be understood in terms of workers actually employed in the various sectors, but in terms of AWUs (annual work units), which indicate the amount of work performed in the year by a full-time employee. It is therefore important to bear in mind that the apparent variations that may occur between one year and the next do not necessarily result in an the investments or to perform the specific operating and maintenance activities in a given year.  The input/output model has been used to evaluate the gross economic and employment impact (i.e. without taking into account any negative effects in sectors that could be considered to be competitors) of investments in the measures provided for in the INECP scenario. The impact from investments in these measures have been subtracted from this, but in accordance with the current measures scenario; it is possible in this way to recognise the impact of greater investments undertaken in the INECP scenario, equivalent to around  billion in the period 2017-203047. In summary:  the average additional annual contribution in the period 2017-2030 to the creation of Added Value compared with that in the current policies scenario is estimated at over 7 billion;  it is estimated that there will be around an additional 117,000 temporary jobs each year (direct and indirect AWU) compared with that calculated for the current policies scenario in the period 2017-2030.                                                               47 The results obtained using the input/output model cannot be compared immediately with those obtained using the SAM. In the case of the input/output model, the effects are calculated as the difference between the impact of the INECP scenario and that of the current policies scenario. In the SAM, on the other hand, the evaluations of the impact have been carried out net of a counterfactual scenario that takes into account the possible alternative uses of the resources available to the additional investments required by the e spending decision.

The columns in the matrix indicate the uses of the income from each productive or institutional sector; the rows show the sources of income for each sector. The structure of the SAM includes the input-output (I/O) matrix of intermediate trade between productive sectors. To this, however, are added the accounts opened in the name of the institutions (households, companies, government); the production factors (labour and capital); capital formation and the rest of the world. In this way, the SAM allows all the relationships that characterise an economic system at the various stages of the production, distribution, utilisation and accumulation of income process to be gathered. The SAM is a tool that can show the adjustment that the economic system has to make in order to support a change to one of the equilibrium vectors. The tool is able to evaluate the effects at system level of a tax incentive measure, an additional investment, or a change in spending by one of the institutions involved. In order to analyse the impact of a behavioural change on the economic system as a whole, it is necessary, first of all, to identify the exogenous count (capital formation or households) and to establish the corresponding influencing vector. The establishment of influencing vectors is based on simplified assumptions relating to the directly activated sectors, such as suppliers of goods and services needed for investment or for the additional expenditure needed to implement the INECP scenario. The impact analysis takes into account two multiplication loops: the production loop and the income distribution loop. In the first loop, the increase in end demand (for example the costs of renovating buildings, investments in new technologies, etc.) results in an increase in production in the sector directly affected and, through the supply chain for intermediate goods, also in all the other sectors that supply intermediate goods. The transmission mechanism spreads in the second loop: the increase in production, in fact, results in an increase in remuneration of the production factors; income from the factors is redistributed between the institutions, which in turn increase the end demand for goods and services. It is this multiplication loop that differentiates the SAM from the Leontief matrix and that explains the larger multipliers in the SAM compared with the input  output matrix.  To evaluate the INECP scenario, in which overall investment in new energy technologies is greater than in the scenario with current policies, the impact assessments are carried out net of a counterfactual scenario that takes into account the possible alternative uses for 31 917 9 956 348 21 346 1 251  21 613 18 619 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 309   resources for additional investment required by the INECP scenario. The counterfactual spending ratios of the economic agents that make the spending decision. In this way, the various economic effects identified are due not to the scale of the investment but to those economic sectors that are activated in the two situations.   The analysis focuses on the impact of investments in new energy technologies, overlooking the impact of the changes in consumption distribution resulting from the savings made on the side of energy bills of companies and households and from the different use of the disposable income.   The estimated SAM for 2010 from CEISTor Vergata was used for these impact analyses; the breakdown was as follows:  58 productive sectors (25 services, 29 industry, 1 construction, 3 agricultural),  2 production factors (labour and capital),  4 institutions (households, companies, government, capital formation)  rest of the world. The table below shows a brief overview of the impact estimates performed with SAM. The table only looks at the impact of investments (non-discounted)48.   The first column reports the additional investments envisaged in the INECP scenario. The investments are calculated for the period 2017-2030, grouped by similar categories of technologies/measures and expressed in  billion/year. For some types, the INECP scenario envisages lower levels of investment than the current policies scenario. In these situations, the investment shows a negative performance and also an effect on macroeconomic aggregates and on employment. The other columns represent the impact of additional investment net of the counterfactual scenario.                                                                   48 Only the temporary effects relating to temporary employment limited to the design, development, installation and asset creation phases are examined INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 310   Table 75  Net impact of the additional investments envisaged in the Target scenario.

The table above shows how the impact of additional investment envisaged in the INECP scenario is greater than the impact of the counterfactual scenario in terms of employment, increase in value added and increase in direct tax revenue. In some cases, for example the measures in the residential sector or the purchasing of cars, net indirect taxation is slightly negative (since, in the intervention scenario, the sectors that are mostly activated are those that receive support or that have lower VAT rates than those in the counterfactual scenario).   billion/year of investment) could have a positive  billion/year extra value added, an increase in employment levels of almost 75,000 work units/year in the course of the period in question, and an increase in revenue of  billion/year49.                                                              49 Indirect taxation (VAT net of production levies) is calculated by applying the SAM; direct taxation, on the other hand, is obtained by applying an average personal income tax rate to revenue from induced employment income and an average corporate income tax rate to revenue from capital/company income. The variation in revenue is the result of the higher tax revenue from the productive sectors activated in the INECP scenario compared with the counterfactual scenario.   INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 311    Analysis according to the GTAP-GDynE model Having seen the impact of the measures envisaged in the INECP scenario within the national borders, the macroeconomic impact in a transnational competitive context must be analysed for the same period; this impact is calculated as the difference between the INECP scenario and the current policies scenario.  For this purpose, recourse was made to a general economic equilibrium model and a modified version of the GDyn-E (Golub 2013) computational model was used; this is a dynamic and recursive variant of the GTAP (Hertel 2017) model, including the electricity produced by renewable sources (Peters, 2016).  The model represents the global economy on a multi-regional and multi-sectoral scale thanks to the GTAP v.9 database. Companies and households are included as representative agents, and the sectoral goods and those from productive factors are modelled. The main assumptions made in the model are: assumption of perfect competition, constant economies of scale and full employment.  In total, the model includes 31 sectors, of which 16 are energy sectors, including fossil fuels and energy produced by fossil and renewable sources, distinguishing the baseline and peak demand. As regards the productive sectors, the model includes the sectors: agriculture, services, industry (subdivided into new manufacturing branches and construction), and transport, subdivided into air, maritime and land. 17 countries and macroregions are represented, including seven EU countries in addition to Italy, three OECD member countries and eight countries from the rest of the world. This version of the GDyn-E model enabled an evaluation to be performed of the macroeconomic impact of the INECP scenario on Italy, with the focus on GDP, sectoral value added and international competitiveness. Although decarbonisation may lead to carbon leakage phenomena, no adjustments to the tariffs or support measures aimed at safeguarding competitiveness in the national industrial sectors have been introduced into the model.  Harmonising the GDyn-E model with the TIMES model, which is used to produce the energy scenarios for the INECP, firstly involved introducing uniform assumptions into the current policies scenario: the growth rates assumed for CO2 emissions, GDP, population, workforce and international prices of fossil sources are similar to those introduced in the TIMES model, base scenario (EUref2016). Given that GDyn-E is a global model, the results obtained from the application thereof are greatly dependent upon the assumptions made in the other Countries and Regions taken into account in the analysis. The assumptions contained in the EUref2016 scenario have been used for GDP, population, workforce and emissions from EU Countries, while reference was made to projections by World Bank, International Labour Organization and IEA (ETP 2017 Reference Scenario) for all the other Countries.  The joint use of the GDyn-E with the TIMES Italia model predicts alignment of the emissive part: the energy scenario is therefore used as input provider for GDyn-E both in the current policies scenario and in the INECP scenario. The emissions pathway in the INECP scenario was therefore replicated in GDyn-E. For the other EU countries, emission reduction pathways like the ones in the EUCO30+35 (E3MLab & IIASA, 2016) scenario have been assumed, while pathways like the ones in the IEA ETP 2017 New Policy Scenario (2SD) have been assumed for the rest of the world. Attempts have therefore been made to simulate an international INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 312   framework in which each Country contributes to decarbonisation in its own energy system. consumption as control variables, seeking to align the results of the GDyn-E with the values provided by TIMES to the greatest extent possible. As regards specific measures, the phase-out of coal in electricity generation, an increase in LNG and electrification in the transport sector and the retention of manufacturability in the hydroelectric sector was also simulated in GDyn-E.  The results from the GDyn-E model show a modest impact on GDP induced by the INECP scenario. Up until 2025, average annual growth rates in the five-year period simulated are, in fact, in line in the two scenarios, while in the five-year period between 2025 and 2030, there would be a lesser increase in GDP in the INECP scenario than in the current policies scenario (1.3% vs 1.48%). It should be noted that the energy intensity of the GDP, calculated as primary consumption/GDP, would halve in the INECP scenario in 2030 compared with 2011, reducing by 18% compared with the current policies scenario in the same year, and encouraging a decoupling of economic growth from energy consumption and emissions.  The INECP scenario does not show a great impact on the sectoral added value, which would continue to grow compared with 2011 in more than half the sectors in question, with rates only slightly lower than the current policies scenario. In particular, an expansion is evident in the chemical and petrochemical, engineering and non-ferrous metals sectors compared with a decline in the steel and non-metallic mineral sector (construction materials). In 2030, both scenarios show a decline can be seen in the industrial sector, with its total contribution reducing from 25% in 2011 to a value of 22%, and an increase in the services sector (from 71% in 2011 to 74%). The same phenomenon can be seen when it comes to redistribution of sectoral employment. Similarly to that observed for GDP, the INECP scenario would mean a general reduction compared with the current policies scenario as regards sectoral energy intensity too (calculated as final/consumption/value added), as well as a reduction in the share of energy expenditure in sectoral production expenditure.  In terms of international trade, in the first instance a reduction in energy imports can be seen, particularly in the INECP scenario, where, in 2030, imports decline by 14% in physical terms and by 13% in value compared with the current policies scenario. Energy dependence therefore also sees a reduction compared with the 2011 value and compared with the current policies scenario, in line with the INECP energy scenario. Imports reduce in almost all the industrial sectors in question, with the exception of steel and non-metallic minerals. These two sectors also see a decline in exports, in line with what has been observed in terms of sectoral value added. Exports, however, are increasing in all the industrial sectors analysed,   The trends described up to this point show an overall improvement in international competitiveness in the manufacturing sector, as demonstrated by the trade balance of payments in the sector, which is expanding in the papermaking, food, engineering and textile any impact comcompared with its main trading partners. As regards the bilateral trade balance, a general n imports (-1% from China, -9% from Russia and -9% from OPEC countries) and an increase in primary exports to other European countries. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 313   Social impacts of coal phase-out The evaluations previously described, carried out using the standard input/output model (GSE data), show that in 2017 there were an estimated 3,800 plus direct and indirect working units (full-time equivalent) employed for electricity generation from coal-fired power plants. There are currently 8 coal-fired thermal power plants in Italy, generally located in major industrial areas: - Fiumesanto (SS) power plant: two 320 MW coal sections. - Monfalcone (GO) power plant: two 165 and 171 MW coal-fired sections. - Torrevaldaliga nord (RM) power plant: three 660 MW sections converted to coal. - Brescia power plant: one 70 MW coal-fired section. - Brindisi sud power plant: four 660 MW coal-fired units. - Sulcis (CA) power plant: one 340 MW coal-fired unit. - Fusina (VE) power plant: four 320 MW coal-fired units. - La Spezia power plant: one 600 MW coal-fired unit. Figure 72  National coal-fired thermal power generation plants [Source: Assocarboni]  With a view to ensuring a fair energy transition, the coal phase-out will be accompanied by employee protection measures ensuring their employment development and retraining, and measures to combat poverty and inequality and to safeguard their local areas. To address these challenges, action is being taken on several fronts: - regulatory, through laws to protect workers affected by the coal phase-out; - institutional, by strengthening dialogue between national and local institutions and between institutions and workers' representatives; - business-related, through the involvement of employers and workers in retraining projects, including those supported by public policies. In regulatory terms, Decree-Law No 101 of 3 September 2019 established that from 2020 to 2024 the amount  million of the proceeds from the auctions for the allocation  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 314    million per year, will be channelled vocational retraining in areas in which coal-fired power plants up at the Ministry of Economic Development. From an institutional perspective, the assessment of any infrastructural changes necessary for the concrete implementation of the phase-out of coal-fired electricity production will be based on a comparison in specific sectoral working groups organised by the Ministry of Economic Development (for electricity market zones and with a specific one for Sardinia). These will include operators, local authorities, Terna and the social partners. The purpose of the working groups is to assess the technical and regulatory conditions, the necessary infrastructure and how best to safeguard jobs. With a view to a fair energy transition, with the coordination of GSE and in collaboration with the above-mentioned working groups, the following will be monitored: the socio-economic effects, and employment and income distribution in particular; and the INECP measures, with the focus on industrial and carbon-intensive Regions particularly affected by decarbonisation policies. Lastly, an interesting project integrating private and public policies and dialogue between employers and the other social partners has been implemented by Enel S.p.A. (former sole national operator for electricity generation, transformation, transmission and distribution  thermoelectric power plants that are no longer economically viable or environmentally sustainable and have a capacity of 13 GW, including some coal-fired plants. The project involves: - the retraining and redeployment of surplus workers through agreements and negotiations, after discussions between the company, workers and their representatives and the integration of company and public policies; - the conversion and redevelopment of disused sites with a due regard for safeguarding ancillary industries. 12 of the 23 thermal power plants involved in the project have a conversion plan in place so far, with ideas ranging from the reuse of facilities for tourism/accommodation, biotechnology hubs, multipurpose centres, promotion of local food and wine, logistics centres, etc. Possible impacts on employment, education and skills including fair transition aspects The National Institute for Public Policy Analysis (INAPP) on behalf of the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy has created an information system on professions, employment and professional needs that links the productive/economic system and the professional education and training system. This information tool is designed to read the data over two time frames: short-term employment forecasts and currently required occupational skills; medium-term employment forecasts and five-year anticipation of required occupational skills. Using this, in 2019 INAPP analysed future needs50 in the electricity, gas, water and steam supply sector (ATECO 35), in the light of today's institutional and regulatory approaches, with particular reference to the INECP. The aim of the analysis, carried out with the help of a specially formed expert group51 is to: - identify the occupations that will be most affected and undergo the greatest transformation over the next five years; - identify new and innovative skills and competences; - update and implement the occupational database managed by the INAPP; - produce suggestions on innovations/insertions to curricula to enable workers to adapt to change.                                                              50 This is a study to anticipate required occupational skills using scenario methodologies as part of the National Operational Plan for Active Employment Policy Systems (PON SPAO), ESF Programming Period 2013-2020 51 The following were invited to participate in the expert group: Ministry of Economic Development, GSE, trade unions, companies and trade associations in the sector. INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 315   The following steps were necessary for the above analysis: - statistical definition of the sector and mapping of products/services and production processes for the current scenario and analysis of the main economic and employment trends; - identification of important trends and drivers in the near future and their combination with the key factors of change; - in relation to these changes, identification of changes in occupational roles and tasks; - recognition and assessment of emerging occupational skills in relation to changes in roles and tasks; - analysis of the impact and implications of these changes for workers in the sector; - outline and illustration of the changes in job profiles.  The sector studied comes under Section of the ATECO 2007 classification. It is fully encompassed by division 35, which includes all activities ranging from the generation to the supply, transmission and marketing of electricity, natural gas, steam and air conditioning (hot or cold). An analysis of the latest ISTAT data available when the study was made (2017) shows that this is a capital intensive sector, where a  billion is achieved with a workforce of around 88,000. Companies with over 250 employees account for 69% of the workforce, compared with 23% of the industry as a whole.  There is a marked diversity in the electricity sector between a small core of very large companies (1.4% of the total, alone employing 70.1% of the workforce) and a large number of small operators active mainly in the renewable energy field (95.5% of companies with fewer than 49 employees accounting for just under 20% of employment). The gas sector, on the other hand, is much less polarised, with 2.2% of the companies with more than 250 employees employing 50% of the workforce. The remaining workforce is distributed between smaller companies of up to 49 employees (24.5% of the workforce and 88% of companies) and medium-sized companies of between 50 and 249 employees (25% of workers and 10% of companies). Other interesting features of the sector include: - the prevalent -time work of open-ended duration; - specialisation, on average, at a higher qualification level than in industry as a whole; - strong imbalance towards male workers (almost 81% in electricity and 76% in gas); - limited presence of foreign workers, with 3.4% in the electricity sector and 2.6% in the gas sector, compared with 12% in the Italian industrial system as a whole; - generational composition of the workforce, where there is a very high proportion of workers over 50 years of age: 45% in the electricity sector and 49% in the gas sector.  Factors of change potentially having a significant impact in terms of demand for skills and occupations were then identified: - climate change and increasingly extreme weather events; - energy transition: decarbonisation, renewables and energy efficiency; - switch from a multi-vector supply system to a predominantly single-vector one based on electricity; - ongoing research and new digital technologies; - liberalisation and growing competitiveness not only for the energy produced but also for a series of secondary services and quality factors such as traceability, eco-sustainability, respect for the land and local area, and corporate social responsibility; - growing importance of marketing and development of online sales activities; - redistribution of energy production and increasing importance of each local area as a place where local authorities and communities work together; INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 316   - global population growth and resulting growth in consumption. On the basis of the factors listed above, the most significant changes in the typical occupations in the sector have been assumed and the skills associated with them identified. Key among these are the ability to: 1. develop approaches based on self-diagnosis, self-correction and continuous improvement; 2. take decisions for tasks that are autonomy; 3. promote and participate effectively in interactions between different links in the chain of responsibility and collaborate vertically and horizontally; 4. manage change processes in company's organisational structure with a view to increasingly enhancing and building on human capital; 5. understand  6. oversee the distribution strategy for purchasing and selling products and services; 7. effectively communicate relevant information about processes, products, services and solutions; 8. identify and oversee logistical processes, both internally and externally, for distribution of the product/service from the production location to the end customer; 9. positively interact within intercultural and multidisciplinary contexts; 10. make decisions regarding workerby acquiring relevant information in a timely manner; 11. promote risk analysis within business processes; 12. constantly transfer innovative know-how within production, organisational and research processes; 13. interpret and apply general and specific regulations in relation to the local, national (and international) business/organisational system; 14. select the most appropriate technologies in the management and development of company production processes; 15. use information systems and web-based communication tools in the ordinary management of business processes The competences listed above have been cross-referenced with the workers and occupations most closely involved in the energy transition scenario. The occupations are set out below.    INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 317   In addition, the study shows that the energy transition will lead to the increasing involvement to the creation of new tasks and duties in the energy sector, in which the development and application of Industry 4.0 enabling technologies (Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, big data, robotics, etc.) will be relevant and significant than in other sectors. This requires professionals who are able to analyse the huge amounts of relevant data needed for activities and production processes.

The identification of future needs for clusters of skills highlights how the greatest demand, as was to be expected, is for technological and digital as well as transversal skills. These are followed by skills related to marketing, various specialisations, management, and plant operation and maintenance. The current VET options do not yet seem to adequately include these new skill sets in education and training programmes. The survey of VET providers highlighted the poor training offering for the most important occupations for the future, underlining the gap between what is already available and what is necessary for a balanced development of the sector.

Existing investment flows and forward investment assumptions with regard to planned policies and measures  Achievement of the Energy and requires significant commitment in terms of additional investment compared with the current policies scenario.  As regards the national energy system as a whole, it is estimated that, between 2017 and  billion in cumulative additional investment will be needed compared with the current policies scenario (equivalent to an 18% increase in the period in question). These investments would be directed towards special technology solutions and innovation, which are expected to have an impact both on processing and energy supply and on end use. Significant additional investment is needed for the development of renewable sources: it is estimated that in the photovoltaic sector alone additi billion will be needed in the period 2017  2030 in order to achieve the INECP scenario targets compared with that envisaged in the current policies scenario.

Impact on the energy system in neighbouring and other Member States in the region to the extent possible  Regional cooperation will help identify areas of collaboration in both technological areas and the exchange of best practices that will lead to the creation of important new synergies in the different areas of collaboration with other Member States.  In terms of infrastructure, the launch of the electricity interconnection between Italy and Montenegro will lead to a greater integration of their respective markets, with impacts on the security and sustainability of energy supplies.  In addition, the topics identified as providing potential for regional collaborations could in effect give rise to joint projects.  ii. Impact on energy prices, utilities and energy market integration  The impact of regional cooperation initiatives on energy prices is expected to lead to an initial stabilisation of prices, which should subsequently fall and align more closely with European levels. As far as utilities are concerned, the consequences of increased cooperation should mainly take the form of an improvement in the environmental quality of transport, and consequently of the air. Energy market integration will benefit significantly from new interconnections and the improvement of existing ones, and from increased market coupling with neighbouring countries, leading towards a convergence of energy mixes.  iii.
