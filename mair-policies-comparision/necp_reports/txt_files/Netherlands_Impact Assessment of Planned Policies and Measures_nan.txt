Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   5 Impact assessment of planned policies and measures This chapter examines the effects of planned policies and measures as referred to in Chapter 3. A differentiation is made between proposed policies as taken into account in the KEV 2019 and the announced policies and actions in the Climate Agreement. 5.1 The consequences of planned policies and measures on the energy system and greenhouse gas emissions and removal 5.1.1 Effects of proposed policies according to the KEV In the "proposed policy" variant, in addition to adopted measures the KEV takes into account proposed policies made public and officially published on 1 May 2019, which have been worked out in sufficient detail. The package of proposed policies only varies to a limited extent compared with adopted policies. The main changes in this policy variant since the NEV 2017 are:  Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (NZEBs): new construction requirements for buildings after 2020;  Ecodesign wood-burning stoves, emission requirements enter into force as of 2020 instead of 2022;  OCAP expansion: additional supply of industrial CO2 from 0.1 to 0.2 Mton to promote crop growth in greenhouse horticulture.  Kilometre tax for freight traffic as of 2022;  As of 1-1-2021 a flight tax of 7 euros per departing passenger and 1.93-3.85 euros per tonne of freight for freight carriers (tariff depends on aircraft type noise emissions). The effects of these differences on greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption/mix are discussed below. Detailed greenhouse gas emission figures and of this policy variant (with additional measures) can be found in Appendix 6. Greenhouse gas emissions The differences in greenhouse gas emissions During the period up to and including 2020, emissions with proposed policies are almost at the same level as with adopted policies. By 2020, emissions with proposed policies will amount to circa 11 ktons of CO2 equivalents lower, mainly as a result of the closure of the Hemweg power plant at the end of 2019. Between 2020 and 2030, the KEV policy variants with adopted and proposed policies also give roughly the same picture: by 2030, the national total will be 144 Mton of CO2 equivalents with proposed policies (excluding emissions from land use); with adopted policies this is 145 Mton of CO2 equivalents. Half the difference is due to the electricity sector (0.4 Mton of CO2  equivalents), the other half is due to lower emissions (approximately 0.2 Mton of CO2 equivalents) in the built-up environment and mobility. The 2030 emission reduction with proposed policies amounts to 35 [28-39] percent compared with 1990, 14 [10-21] percentage points lower than the 49 percent target cited in the Climate Act. The estimated absolute emissions in 2030 are 31 [22- 46] megatons of CO2 equivalents above the target of 113 megatons of CO2 equivalents arising from the Climate Act. This does not include policies announced in the Climate Agreement. The maximum permitted cumulative emissions for the Netherlands for the 2021-2030 period amount to 891 megatons of CO2 equivalents. On the basis of proposed policies, the cumulative estimated N-ETS emissions for 2021-2030 amount to 925 megatons of CO2 equivalents, which is approximately 6 Mton lower than with adopted policies. For this period this amounts to a deficit and therefore a policy challenge of 34 megatons of CO2 equivalents.  Renewable energy The expected share of renewable energy hardly differs between the policy variants with adopted and proposed policies. In Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   2023, a share of 16.1% (14.4-17.0%) is expected in both policy variants, which means that the target of 16% in the Energy Agreement will just be achieved in 2023. The expectation for 2030 with proposed policies - without implementation of the Climate Agreement, but with an assumed continuation of the SDE+ - is 25.0 percent (20.7-26.4%). With adopted policies, the share is slightly lower than with proposed policies at 24.7%. This minor difference is partly due to greater use of renewable energy in the built-up environment. This is largely due to the application of the nearly zero-energy standard for the construction of new buildings after 2020. One of the requirements is that a building's energy demand should be satisfied as much as possible with renewable energy. The ambition of a share of 27-35% of renewable energy by 2030 will not be achieved with the adopted and proposed policy. Energy consumption and mix By 2030, primary energy consumption with only adopted policies will be 2,374 petajoules and with proposed policies at 2,397 [2,267-2,585] petajoules. In 2030, with adopted policies alone, final energy consumption is expected to amount to 1,997 petajoules; and 2,025 [1,908-2,166] petajoules with proposed policies. With proposed policies both final and primary energy consumption are a little higher than with adopted policies alone, without the policies in the Climate Agreement, because the proposed policies assume that Schiphol Airport will be permitted expansion (possibly limited). The resulting growth in fuel consumption and bunkers is greater than the mitigating effect of the proposed flight tax. The energy mix in the variant with proposed policies does not differ significantly compared with adopted policies alone. Only the consumption of oil products will be 2.7% higher by 2030 due to the reason mentioned above. Coal consumption will be slightly lower too as of 2020 due to the closure of the Hemweg power plant. By 2030, coal consumption will be the same once more, as the ban on coal combustion from 2030 has also been included in the policy variant with only adopted policies. 5.1.2 Effects of the Climate Plan The Climate Plan outlines the main points of the climate policy to be implemented over the next ten years. The contents are largely determined by the Climate Agreement, established in June 2019 involving over a hundred social (public and private) parties. The agreement contains a package of measures, which are actively supported by as many contributing parties as possible and with which the political CO reduction target of 49% will be achieved by 2030. However, the Climate Agreement came too late to be included in the PBL's Climate and Energy Outlook (KEV) 2019. That is why the PBL performed a separate analysis for the final Climate Agreement (PBL, 2019b). The announced policies and actions have not been analysed in full. This means that the findings are indicative and may differ as soon as they are taken into account in full in the next KEV (2020). The analysis also focuses on the expected reduction of greenhouse gases and the effects have not been analysed for all indicators needed for the NECP. The effects are determined in relation to the KEV with adopted and proposed policies PBL concludes that the package of policy instruments in the Climate Agreement will lead to an emission reduction of 43-48% compared to 1990. The Netherlands' climate target for 2030 (-49%) is outside this bandwidth, and according to the PBL, is not expected to be achieved with the Climate Agreement. It should be noted that current insights on expected developments as described in the KEV 2019, are more unfavourable with regard to the greenhouse gas reduction projection than the NEV 2017 forecast that served as a reference to the draft Climate agreement. In 2030, as a result of the Climate Agreement, emissions could amount to between 116 and 126 Mton of CO2 equivalents. The emissions related to land use could decrease to 3-4 Mton by 2030 as a result of the Climate Agreement. The policy package can lead to a total emission reduction of circa 18-28 Mton compared to the KEV 2019 (including proposed policies). In addition to the above, approximately 2 Mton of emissions related to land use can also be reduced when implementing the Climate Agreement. These emissions, which do not count towards achieving the Netherlands' target of 49%, could decrease to 3-4 Mton by 2030 as a result of the Climate Agreement. Table 5.1 shows the expected effects per climate platform. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   Table 5.1 Greenhouse gas emissions per sector in 2018 and 2030 with the current base path (KEV 2019) and with the expected impact of the Climate Agreement (PBL, 2019b)   5.2 Effects of planned policies and measures on the economy This section examines the effects of climate and energy policy on the macroeconomy, income and employment. The effects of (also proposed) climate and energy policies on safety, health and nature are discussed in paragraph 5.3. Effects largely determined on the basis of the draft Climate Agreement In 2019, the CPB analysed the Climate Agreement for effects on public finances, income distribution and burden sharing (CPB, 2019). The overall macroeconomic effects of all climate and energy policies have been examined. Overall climate and energy policy leads to a lower GDP of around -0.5% On the one hand the series of adopted policies and the draft Climate Agreement involve an extra burden that reduces growth, as well as higher expenditure that partially compensates for this (CPB, 2019a). As a result, GDP will be about 0.5% lower by 2030. The main additional burden concerns the ODE to finance the SDE++, the increased burden of the energy tax and the abolition of the net-metering scheme for small-scale solar PV. These taxes, together with all other  by 2030 than in 2018 (CPB, 2019) Due to the policy effect of consumption and production decisions made by citizens and businesses, with the aim of reducing CO2 emissions, citizens and businesses will adapt their behaviour and production process and ultimately labour productivity will be structurally reduced. The benefits and damage avoided with less severe climate change and other environmental quality effects (such as cleaner air quality) have not been included.   2018a Estimate 2030 [Mton] Major factors related to uncertainty Sector [Mton] Emissions KEV 2019 Reductions Climate Agreement Residual emission Climate Agreement  Built-up environment 24.4 19 1.3-3.8 15.2 - 17.7 Achievement of cost reductions Focus on natural gas consumption in the services sector target Mobility 35.6 32.9 1.3-3.6 29.3 - 31.7 Scope of the use of biofuels Scope and criteria of zero-emission zones Post-2025 car tax structure Industry 57.2 54.2 14.3b 39.9b Methodology for determining the process for the tax-free emission allocation at company level, rate of CO2 levy and SDE++ admission criteria Guaranteeing the development of the necessary infrastructure Electricity 45.2 13.7 -0.3 - 2.5 11.2 - 14 CCUS project Tata Steel Yes or No?

Emissions from land use are not yet known for 2018.  Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   Climate and energy policy leads to limited lower income The series of climate and energy policies up to and including 2030 will lead to a (cumulative) negative income effect of, on average, -0.4% compared with 2018 and a worsening income level (CPB, 2019). Lower incomes will decline more than higher incomes by 2030. The decline for the lowest income group is -0.5%, while the highest income group will fall -0.3% as a result of overall climate and energy policy between 2018 and 2030. Climate and energy policy already adopted is almost two-thirds responsible for this scenario. The package of measures in the Climate Agreement leads to a positive effect on income of 0.3% in 2030 (compared to 2018) and is least advantageous for higher incomes. Higher incomes will generally improve by 0.2%, while lower incomes will improve by 0.7% as a result of the package of measures in the Climate Agreement. The energy tax sliding scale between electricity and gas has a worsening effect, while increasing the tax reduction in the energy tax exerts a positive effect. This burden relief outweighs the additional burden, which levels out the overall impact of the Climate Agreement. However, the low income group shows more negative and positive peaks, which partly depend on the ownership and type of car, and differences in energy consumption. Longer-term employment effects are marginal Overall climate and energy policy has a very limited effect on labour supply or total demand for workers (CPB, 2019). The incentive for cleaner production does not create additional demand for workers, as this happens (at least partly) at the expense of spending on other, alternative technological developments. Although there is little or no reduction in employment in the long term, there will be friction in the labour market, as employment shifts to a limited extent to companies that engage in cleaner production. Employment is shifting from coal-fired power plants, agriculture, metal, and consumer and food products to the construction of wind turbines and the services sector. Economic effects of the CO2 tax on industry are modest The risk of industrial activities moving abroad is expected to be limited (CPB, 2019 and PBL, 2019c). The measures leading to additional burden for companies relate to sectors that mainly produce for the domestic market (heavy industry is not taxed very much). The part of the package that may lead to relocation concerns industry measures. However, that part has been designed in such a way that companies reduce their CO2 emissions in the longer term and can thereby avoid the levy. Therefore it is not expected to lead to a significant additional burden on industry or the relocation of their activities. 5.3 Effects of planned policies and measures on safety, health and nature The measures in the Climate Agreement can, by the eradication of fossil sources, generate gains for health, safety and nature. The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) examined the expected effects of the Climate Agreement (RIVM, 2019). This study assumes that the ambitions for reducing greenhouse gases per climate platform will be achieved. This is a rough estimate and is not based on consideration of the announced policies. Safety With regard to safety, it mainly concerns the elimination of carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of natural gas installations in the home. If all homes are gas-free by 2050, 10-50 deaths a year will be prevented. In addition, risk sources disappear, eliminating the chance of a disaster involving ten or more deaths caused by these sources. The end of fuel transport in particular is a major improvement. Health For health, the gains are mainly delivered by replacing combustion engines (petrol, diesel, gas) with electric motors. As a result, lower levels of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter enter the air. It is estimated that these emissions could fall by 10% by 2030 compared to 2016. As a result, the burden of disease from air pollution will decrease by one to several percent. A further decrease in nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from climate measures is expected by 2050, which could double the reduction in the burden of disease. Exposure to diesel smoke in the workplace can cause lung cancer and other conditions. The eradication of diesel smoke can reduce work-related disease by one to several percent. Electric cars make less noise at low speeds, reducing noise pollution within the built-up area. This could lead to a noise reduction of one decibel by 2030 and 3-4 decibels by 2050. If we succeed in achieving a reduction of 3-4 decibels, the disease burden caused by noise will decrease by 15-25%. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   Nature As far as nature is concerned, the Climate Agreement provides gains by a further reduction in nitrogen deposition. An additional reduction of circa 10% is possible by 2050. If this decrease is achieved, the natural surface area for which the nitrogen load is below the critical value will increase. This has beneficial effects on nature and biodiversity. Air polluting emissions In order to assess the effects on health and nature, the expected CO2 emission reductions have been translated into emission reductions of NOx, SO2 and particulate matter (PM10). These substances are decisive with regard to health effects. Table 5.2 shows the expected residual emissions from NOx, SO2 and PM10. The impact of climate policy on emissions from  NOx, SO2 and PM10 is relatively low. The rough estimate shows that if the Climate Agreement targets are achieved in full, emissions of NOx will decrease by circa 45 ktons, 13% of emissions in 2016. For SO2, the reduction amounts to 9 ktons, 30% of emissions in 2016. For PM10 the reduction is 3 ktons, 13% of emissions in 2016.

The historical and expected investments in this section are based on the KEV (PBL, 2019a), on adopted and proposed policy. It does not include policies announced in the Climate Agreement. As a result, the expected investments do not yet provide a complete picture of what can be expected with the implementation of the Climate Agreement. An indication of the investments needed to achieve the national climate target of a 49% reduction is based on the analysis of the draft Climate Agreement (PBL, 2019d). There are a number of major differences between the draft Climate Agreement and the announced Climate Agreement. For example, the draft Climate Agreement assumes a bonus/malus scheme for industry, while the government decided to introduce a CO2 tax for industry instead. The Energy tax (EB) and Surcharge for Sustainable Energy (ODE) will also be adjusted, which will, on balance, make companies pay more and citizens less. The promotion of fully electric passenger cars has also been cut back in relation to the draft Climate Agreement. The differences with regard to the CO2 levy and the sliding-scale in the EB and ODE, were analysed separately as a government variant for the draft Climate Agreement by the PBL (2019c). The results of both studies have been incorporated in this section. i. Existing investment flows and future planned investments related to planned policies and measures Existing investment flows and expected investments have already been discussed in section 4.6.1. No specific analysis is available for investments needed to meet the targets by 2030 and the way in which these investments could be mobilised. However, the analysis of the draft Climate Agreement by PBL (2019d) and the government variant (2019c) provide insight into the expected national costs and investments. The expected effects are expressed in a bandwidth (lower and upper limit), due to major uncertainties (at the time) about the structure of proposals and the expected reaction to them from the actors concerned. In the optimistic scenario (the upper limit), greenhouse gas emissions will be sufficiently reduced to meet the climate target of a 49% reduction by 2030 (PBL, 2019d). The corresponding investments also provide an indication of the necessary investments. Capital costs, energy costs and operating costs collectively determine national costs. National costs in 2030 amount to between 1.6 billion and 1.9 billion euros (PBL, 2019d) (see Figure 5.1). The capital costs herein are annual depreciation on investments over the lifetime of the installations in which investments have been made. Cumulative investments between 2019 and 2030 inclusive amount to 56 billion to 75 billion euros. The above figures relate to the increase in national costs and investments in 2030 compared to the NEV 2017.132 The extra investments cannot simply be compared with the expected investments based on the KEV; and national costs are not included in the KEV. The difference between the lower and upper limit is the result of uncertainty in the structure of the policy instruments proposed in the draft Climate Agreement and the reaction of actors to it. In principle, environmental uncertainties are not included in the bandwidths presented.133 However, the uncertainty in other external developments (such as developments in energy prices) is high, which means that the overall uncertainty bandwidth related to costs is greater than the bandwidth that covers structural and behavioural uncertainty.                                                   132 The base path adopted by the PBL in assessing the draft Climate Agreement is based on the NEV 2017 according to the policy variant with "adopted and proposed policies with no new rounds of the SDE+ grant scheme after 2019", as described in Chapter 4 of the draft NECP. 133 One exception is that in the lower and upper margins of EU standards for passenger cars and promoting electric vehicles, in addition to the behavioural uncertainty of consumers and car manufacturers, other assumptions have been made about the decrease in battery costs for electric cars. The built-up environment at the bottom of the bandwidth also assumes that there will be no cost reduction, and at the top of the bandwidth it is assumed that demand bundling and other policies will considerably reduce costs for sustainability. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   Per sector Capital costs    Operating costs     Energy costs    Total     -5.0 -2.5 0.0 2.5 5.0 billions of euros per year related to the base path  Figure 5.1 National costs in the implementation of the draft Climate Agreement in 2030 (PBL, 2019d) Per type of cost  Built-up environment Mobility Agriculture and land use Industry Electricity Total -1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 billions of euros per year related to the base path   Expected effect with implementation of the draft Climate Agreement Of which: Bandwidth given structural and behavioural uncertainty, without environmental uncertainty National costs are dominated by the cost of measures in the electricity sector. This mainly concerns the cost associated with the increase in renewable electricity generation and strengthening electricity grids. In the built-up environment, the bandwidth in the national cost is modest (Table 5.3). Part of the bandwidth is linked to the structure of the standard for existing non-residential buildings. If this were to primarily lead to electricity savings, the costs are relatively low, but the direct emission reduction will also be low. If this primarily resulted in savings on natural gas consumption (e.g. due to more insulation), then the costs are relatively high. Costs of expanding and increasing the sustainability of heat grids are closely linked to measures in the built-up environment. In this regard costs range between 50 and 350 million by 2030. This difference is due to differences in numbers of new connections and differences in the assumed available SDE+ budget for sustainable heat sources. As far as mobility is concerned, the additional blending of advanced biofuels leads to additional costs, while the other measures, including boosting electric transport, will hardly lead to any additional costs or, on the contrary, to net benefits in 2030. In the case of many measures in this sector, lower energy and maintenance costs can offset the additional costs of more expensive vehicles and charging points. In agriculture, national costs are dominated by methane reduction (housing modifications, feed measures, manure fermentation installations) and increasing the sustainability of greenhouse horticulture (in particular for CO2 supply). In industry, the additional costs are 90 to 430 million per year. In addition to income from energy savings, this also takes into account benefits resulting from avoided purchases of emission allowances in the EU ETS (100 to 200 mln). The analysis of the government variant134 includes the national costs associated with measures in industry between 40 and 650 million euros (additional costs compared to the reference) (PBL, 2019c). The costs depend heavily on the extent to which cheap reduction potential is unlocked, and future energy prices and CO2 emission allowances in the EU ETS. Cumulative (possibly additional) investments in industry amount to circa 5.5 to 6.5 billion euros in the 2020-2030 period.                                                   134 The PBL (2019c) has examined four variants of a CO2 levy. This is based on variant 1 (the "tonnage levy"), because it is in line with the intentions in the Climate Agreement. Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030    National costs can also be broken down into capital costs (interest and depreciation on investments), energy costs and other operating costs. It illustrates that the energy transition leads to a more capital-intensive energy system with lower costs for the purchase of energy carriers (especially coal, oil and gas). Capital costs increase by 4.0 to 4.9 billion euros per year. Energy costs decrease by 3.0 to 3.4 billion euros per year. Other operating costs increase by 0.6 billion to 1.4 billion euros per year. National costs are the balance of these large items in absolute terms, and therefore, they are relatively sensitive to other assumptions about exogenous developments that affect capital costs and energy prices. Cumulative additional investments between 2019 and 2030 (additional compared to investments in the reference) amount to circa 56 to 75 billion euros (Figure 5.2) (PBL, 2019d). Investments in the electricity sector account for around half of this. In the electricity sector, the uncertainties caused by structural and behavioural uncertainty are minor, but those resulting from environmental factors (such as the cost development of renewable electricity generation and grid costs) are significant.

Risk factors of the sector or market concerned or obstacles at the national or regional level Diverse factors have a significant impact on emission reductions and investments that can be expected from the Climate Agreement. Therefore, the expected investments in the analysis of the draft Climate Agreement are expressed as a bandwidth: the lower and upper limits. This bandwidth is determined by uncertainties in the structure of policy instruments and the behaviour of actors. In addition, environmental factors are also uncertain.  Structural uncertainty. The structure of the policy instrument in the draft Climate Agreement leaves scope for interpretation. In the case of the final Climate Agreement many proposals still need to be elaborated in terms of the structure of policy instruments and actions. This can lead to different outcomes. The choices that still have to be made in the detailed structure determine whether more or fewer emission reductions can be achieved.  Behavioural uncertainty. The extent to which policy instruments will change the behaviour of actors is uncertain. Households, for example, could quickly respond to tax incentives through agreements in their district, but they may also wait for options to become cheaper. In many cases, it is not possible to identify the structural uncertainty and behavioural uncertainty separately, partly because the behavioural uncertainty is linked to a certain extent to the structure of the instruments.  Environmental uncertainty. Exogenous developments are uncertain, such as the development of international energy markets, European emissions trading or policy in neighbouring countries. Technological developments are also uncertain. These uncertain environmental factors cause uncertainty through prices, markets and technology. The effects of many policy instruments depend heavily on how prices will develop. These uncertainties are included in the bandwidth of the KEV, but are not part of the lower and upper limits in the assessment of the draft Climate Agreement. Further elaboration of the agreements in the Climate Agreement decreases structural uncertainty and thus indirectly reduces behavioural uncertainty. Environmental uncertainty concerns the dynamic context in which Dutch climate policy is developed. Dutch policy only has a limited impact in this regard. iii. Analysis of additional financial government aid or public funds to remedy the shortcomings identified in point iii The additional investments needed to achieve the climate target of a 49% reduction by 2030 is mobilised by the use of policy instruments and actions by stakeholders as agreed in the Climate Agreement (see Chapter 3). Most emission reductions and investments in the draft Climate Agreement are achieved through standardisation and subsidisation (PBL, 2019d). The ban on using coal to generate electricity is by far the most important in terms of scale. As far as mobility is concerned, the compulsory blending of biofuels and the introduction of emission-free zones together potentially provide a Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030   relatively large contribution to sectoral emission reductions. The standardisation of non-residential buildings can make a substantial contribution in the built-up environment. In the district-oriented approach, the perseverance of municipalities to end the consumption of natural gas in designated districts is an important element in the package to ensure emission reductions and investments for housing. Subsidies and tax benefits play a major role in achieving emission reductions in all sectors (PBL, 2019d). The SDE+(+) is important in the aforementioned integration of renewable electricity and plays a dominant role in the expected reductions and investments by industry. The SDE+(+) also contributes to reductions and investments in agriculture and the built-up environment. In addition, grants for owner-occupiers play an important role in the built-up environment in combination with prices and the above-mentioned district-oriented approach. With regard to mobility, the package of tax incentives and subsidies makes the most important contribution to the growth of electric passenger cars. The agricultural sector is adapting existing environmental subsidies so that a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can help elevate it. Pricing also plays a role in reducing emissions and boosting investment, but has a predominantly supportive role. In industry, prices are an important incentive by means of a CO2 tax, depending on the CO2 price in the EU ETS. The shift (or additional shift) in energy taxes from electricity to natural gas and the increase in ODE tariffs makes a limited direct contribution to the expected reduction, but does support other policies. The increase in excise duty on petrol and diesel is linked to a package of subsidies and tax incentives for electric vehicles. A minimum CO2 price will be introduced in the electricity sector, which, in addition to the ban on using coal to generate electricity, has a limited but above all supportive effect. The Climate Agreement also includes a number of voluntary agreements, such as the proposals on "Anders Reizen" (Alternative Travel) aimed at reducing CO2 emissions in work-related traffic, drawing up road maps for social real estate or creating a website to inform citizens about opportunities to make their homes more sustainable. In a few cases an agreement has been reached, such as that related to natural gas-free new constructions. These agreements often support other policies. 5.5 Effects of planned policies and measures on other Member States and regional cooperation Higher electricity demand due to CO2 industry levy The introduction of a levy on CO2 emissions, under the assumption that industrial production does not change as a result of the introduction of the levy, will lead to greater electricity demand from 7 to 12 TWh from industry than estimated in the assessment of the draft Climate Agreement (PBL, 2019c). In order to satisfy this extra demand, more electricity can be imported (or less exported) or more can be generated in the Netherlands. Extra imports from abroad often lead to additional emissions there. Additional production within the Netherlands will, if the established renewable capacity is the same, come from gas-fired power plants and thus lead to additional emissions. However, it is also possible that, in the case of increasing demand, additional investments will also be made in electricity generated from renewable sources.
