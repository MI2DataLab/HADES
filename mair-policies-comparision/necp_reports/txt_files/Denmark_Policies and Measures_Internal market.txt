        116  3.4 Dimension Internal energy market 3.4.1 Electricity infrastructure (i) Policies and measures to achieve the targeted level of interconnectivity as set out in point (d) of Article 4  Denmark has no specific target regarding interconnectivity, but analysis of new feasible interconnectors remains to be a priority. In Denmark new interconnectors are approved based on their socio economic value, see section 2.3.1. It is the Danish TSO, Eneresponsibility to propose new interconnectors to the relevant ministry.  (ii) Regional cooperation in this area  Denmark cooperates with the other North Seas Energy Cooperation countries on the possibilities for concrete cooperation projects. Besides joint offshore wind projects that would be connected to and supported by several Member States, this includes the work on possible 'hybrid' solutions that would use cross-border solutions for connecting offshore wind farms to the grid and seek synergies with interconnection capacity between countries, and on the corresponding market arrangements (see section 1.4 for more information).  Furthermore, Nordic TSOs work closely together on Nordic grid development and have developed a Nordic Grid Development plan 2017. The report is intended to be updated every two years. The Nordic Council of Ministers and the underlying Committee of Senior Officials for Energy and the Electricity Market Group also coordinate on energy issues and monitor for example the TSO cooperation (also on grid development).  (iii) Where applicable, financing measures in this area at the national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds According to the act on Energinet, the Minister of Finance  to the extent that it is considered as appropriate  loans through the central bank of Denmark. It should be noted that in situations where such loans will be further transferred to subsidiaries of Energinet it follows from the act of to be on market terms. Where applicable, projects apply for relevant EU funds e.g. for development of PCI projects.           117  3.4.2 Energy transmission infrastructure (i) Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.2, including, where applicable, specific measures to enable the delivery of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and other key infrastructure projects  Infrastructure projects are developed by the Danish TSO and approved by the Danish Energy Agency and the Ministry for Climate, Energy and Utilities. No specific measures have been implemented relating to the elements set out in 2.3.2. The Danish TSO, Energinet, is the sole developer of electricity and gas transmission projects and these projects are assessed in terms of the need for the project. The need is assessed in terms of whether it complies with any of the following topics - Well-functioning energy markets - Security of supply - Risk preparedness - Integration of renewable energy sources  In addition interconnectors are also assessed in terms of their socio-economic benefit. No specific measures in addition to the TEN-E regulation have been implemented. (ii) Regional cooperation in this area  Denmark participates in the relevant fora that are established under the TEN-E regulation, such as the North Seas Energy Cooperation and the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (see section 1.4.1).  In June 2019 the Nordic Energy ministers adopted a new vision for the Nordic electricity market, also emphasizing the need of the grid infrastructure to be smartly operated, cost-efficient, robust and without undue constraints, being optimised from a regional perspective. In the corresponding roadmap to reach the 2030 vision, the Nordic TSOs strengthen the Nordic grid planning process by taking into account Nordic welfare.  (iii) Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds In general infrastructure projects are financed through tariffs. The Danish TSO, Energinet, has made use of the Connecting Europe Facility for feasibility studies and pre-lay investigation of cable routes etc. and the Baltic Pipe project.            118  3.4.3 Market integration (i) Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.4.3 To increase market integration further the Nordic TSOs are currently working on a project to procure fast frequency reserves in order to ensure a sufficient level of inertia in the Nordic synchronous area. The procurement is expected to start in 2020 or 2021. With regards to improving real-time price signals, Denmark has updated a national law49 in 2018, specifying that the Danish TSO shall, as far as possible, procure all energy and non-energy services that are necessary for security of supply through market-based mechanisms. The demand for all services has to be published annually. In cases with limited competition, the TSO shall analyse whether changes to the product definitions and procurement process could increase competition. The law aims at increasing transparency, creating price signals for all services, including non-frequency ancillary services, and thus enabling more market participants, including DER, to participate in the delivery of these services. As a result of this, Energinet is currently working on a pilot project where voltage control is procured locally in a technology-neutral manner. The aim is to develop a product definition which gives new market actors and technologies the possibility to participate in a potential market as well as gaining overall experiences with market based procurement of voltage control.  With regard to system adequacy and the level of security of supply, new legislation implemented in 2018 prescribes how the Danish TSO is responsible for the system adequacy and that the Minister of Climate, Energy and Utilities shall determine a planning target for the level of electricity supply security by January. For more details see section 3.3 Dimension Energy security.  (ii) Measures to increase the flexibility of the energy system with regard to renewable energy production, such as smart grids, aggregation, demand response, storage, distributed generation, mechanisms for dispatching, re-dispatching and curtailment, real-time price signals, including the roll-out of intraday market coupling and cross-border balancing markets  Implicit Intra-day market coupling in the Nordic Market and between East Denmark and Germany via Kontek-interconnector has been in place for many years and from June 2018 the former explicit allocation of capacity on the interconnector between West Denmark and Germany has been replaced by implicit intra-day market coupling (also known as XBID).  Cross-border markets and products are developed in line with the electricity balancing and Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management guidelines and the corresponding timeframe.                                                            49 LOV nr 704 af 08/06/2018          119  In Denmark, new renewable energy production cannot receive subsidies in hours with negative market prices. This is one measure to ensure the right incentives for market participants and reaction to price signals.  When planning network expansion at the distribution level, DSOs are obliged to consider whether energy efficiency measures through demand response or decentralised production may reduce or replace the need to expand capacity. Demand response is generally encouraged by the roll-out of smart meters and the establishment of an hourly settlement model in the retail market. As mentioned under (v) these measure enable the use of dynamic prices and potentially near real-time price signals to a wide range of customers.  Increased flexibility in energy system is crucial for the green transition and storage can contribute to that flexibility. The Danish Government established a fund supporting n DKK and it was in December 2019 granted to two Power-to-X-projects. The projects will establish big scale production and storage of green hydrogen. Both projects have an ambition to demonstrate production and consumption of green hydrogen on near market based conditions. (iii) Where applicable, measures to ensure the non-discriminatory participation of renewable energy, demand response and storage, including via aggregation, in all energy markets As part of the project for a new market model for the electricity market, the Danish Energy Agency is currently analysing different setups for aggregators in order to find the best suitable model in a Danish context. This will be concluded and implemented in 2020. A further task is to identify barriers for new market participants and technologies (such as storage) to participate in the market. Concrete recommendations for measures are expected in the first half of 2021. (iv) Policies and measures to protect consumers, especially vulnerable and, where applicable, energy poor consumers, and to improve the competitiveness and contestability of the retail energy market  Denmark has phased out suppliers of last resort and replaced them with a general obligation to supply. Electricity suppliers are thus obliged to supply any household not allowed to enter into time-limited supply agreements with household customers. If there is particular reason to expect a lack of payment ability or willingness to pay, that is if the customer is or has been in arrears with payments, the supplier can request a guarantee from the customer. Only if the request for a guarantee is not fulfilled, the supplier is allowed to cancel the agreement. At the same time retail price formation is fully competitive. Market development is closely monitored in order to ensure an appropriate price level for all consumers.  A supplier centric model has been implemented in 2016 with the aim of ensuring that suppliers have the primary customer contact, and all costs related to electricity are         120  summed up in one bill sent to the customer by their supplier. In addition, a regulation on electricity companies' invoicing of costs to electricity consumers50 has been passed to ensure that electricity bills are more easily understandable. The regulation sets a minimum standard on the content of electricity bills.  Denmark has also introduced a datahub that enables all transactions related to the retail and wholesale market to be managed through one central system operated and owned by the TSO. This also creates more transparency and ensures a level playing field regarding access to data.  Denmark has established an online price comparison tool, elpris.dk, operated by the Danish Utility Regulator that facilitates easier comparison between different suppliers and a trustworthy source of information on the quality and terms of different products offered in the market.   market the Danish competition and consumer authority has launched a project aiming at an improvement of the electricity bill and the price comparison tool. The project takes into account latest findings on behavioural research and puts the consumer perspective into focus. On more general terms, the competition and consumer authority has published behavioural principles in consumer-oriented regulation that shall be applied on the electricity market as well: 1. Consumer-oriented regulation should support as simple and action-oriented consumer information as possible. 2. Consumer-oriented regulation should support that consumer-oriented information is presented at the right time in consumer decision-making. 3. Consumer-oriented regulation should be based on the best available knowledge of consumer behaviour. A recent change in Danish law51 requires stricter rules regarding the separated identity of monopoly and commercial activities in vertically integrated companies. Monopoly companies have to clearly distinguish themselves (name and logo) in public appearance, including all sorts of customer contact. The new rules are effective as of 1 July 2018. Denmark generally addresses energy poverty through social policy, which is not specifically targeted towards energy.  The social policy guarantees all citizens fundamental rights in case they encounter social problems such as unemployment, sickness or dependency. Denmark does not have specific subsidies targeted at energy poverty, however some of the general social policy measures provide financial support to energy related purposes. Moreover, the income transfer                                                            50 BEK nr 1400 af 03/12/2015 51 LOV nr 662 af 08/06/2017         121  system is in general structured around costs of living, among these energy costs including taxes. Some of the social policy measures are listed below.   Heating supplement Old age pensioners and persons who have taken early retirement (based on rules from before 2003) can apply for heating supplement. The supplement is given to the weakest part of the pensioners. The pensioners have to pay a part of the heating bill themselves. The heat supplement is calculated based on an average of three years documented heating costs, if it exists. The calculation of the heating supplement includes costs to the actual heating of the housing and hot water.   Special supplementary housing benefit  Persons who meet the requirements to receive social assistance (but who does not necessarily receive the support) and who has particular high housing costs or high costs to support large families can receive a special supplementary housing benefit. The conditions for receiving the special supplementary housing benefit are that the applicant has experienced a social incident, for instance sickness, unemployment or discontinuance of cohabitation. The incident moreover has to entail that the citizen does not have the means to fulfil the basic needs for its own support or for the support of the family. Moreover, a condition is that the need for support cannot be covered by other social benefits. Before the municipality provides special supplementary housing benefit, it has to be assessed whether a fair and cheaper housing can be found. Special supplementary housing benefit is based on the difference between what the applicant is assumed to be able to pay in housing costs and net housing costs including water, heat, gas and electricity.   Additional cash support Based on a concrete assessment the municipality can provide support to reasonable expenses if a person has experienced changes in conditions (e.g. unemployment or sickness), and if the expense to a significant degree will make it difficult for the person to take care of himself in the future. The support can usually only be granted if the expense is a result of a need that has not been possible to foresee. Based on a concrete assessment the municipality can, however, make an exception even though it has been possible to  of life. The support can for instance be given to the payment of a particularly high heating bill.  Other measures that are relevant in regard to energy poverty are the specific subsidies targeting energy efficiency, particularly in buildings. For more information on these subsidies see section 3.2.  Finally, a green check was introduced in 2010 with the aim to compensate people with a relative low income for the higher green taxes. (v) Description of measures to enable and develop demand response including those addressing tariffs to support dynamic pricing By 2020 all Danish customers will have smart meters installed. Simultaneously, the TSO and distribution grid operators implement a new hourly settlement model, named         122   (<10ii)0.000 kWh/year). This is the basic precondition for the access to dynamic pricing products that make it possible to benefit from demand response activities. Besides the dynamic electricity price, DSOs can choose to apply a time-differentiated tariff model, and several DSOs have chosen that model to date. Currently, the tariff is based on a static time-of-use model consisting of two different tariff levels for small consumers. DSOs and TSO are further developing their tariff models including coordination between transmission and distribution levels. The 2018 Energy Agreement also includes an initiative to address potential regulatory barriers in relation to tariffs, in particular how they affect demand response. An interdepartmental working group has been established for that purpose. A large share of the electricity price for Danish household consumers is made up of levies and taxes. Measures have been put into force that over several years remove the levy for public service obligations from the electricity bill. Moreover, the 2018 Energy Agreement contains a substantial reduction of the electricity tax. As a result wholesale prices may be reflected onto consumers more directly and with less distortions in the future.  Just as reducing the general electricity tax rate, it is also planned to cut the tax on electricity used for heating further by almost half over the coming years. Primarily, this aims at a further electrification of the heating sector. At the same time, the new pricing- and tariff regimes shall ensure the flexible operation of such units. The Energy Agreement also includes an initiative to explore the possibilities of a dynamic electricity tax. A dynamic electricity tax can for example increase demand in periods with low electricity prices where production of renewable electricity is high.       There are no specific barriers in Danish law that inhibit independent service providers to enter into a contract with a customer, or aggregators from offering demand flexibility. No difference is made between bids in the market coming from a single source or an aggregated source. Nonetheless, Denmark seeks to further develop its market model to facilitate demand response, including through aggregation, and support the utilisation of flexibility at the distribution level. Therefore, market models are being revised to define and accommodate aggregators as a stand-alone role in its own right.
