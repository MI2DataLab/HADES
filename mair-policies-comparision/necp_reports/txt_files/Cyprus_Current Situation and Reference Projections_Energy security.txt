4.4. Dimension energy security 4.4.1. i. Current energy mix, domestic energy resources, import dependency, including relevant risks The following table shows Cyprus energy mix for 2018. Table 4.15: Cyprus Energy Mix for 2018 per sector in ktoe  RES ktoe Oil products ktoe Other (Industrial waste) ktoe Coal ktoe Domestic Sources 187,3 0 0.3 0 Imports 46,5 2.312,8 19,2 13,6 Energy consumption 233,8 2.312,8 22,9 13,6 Almost all domestic energy resources are renewables (see Figure 4.10) and an amount of 0.3 ktoe (0.2%) is from industrial waste. The share of oil products is more than 92% of the country energy mix. The oil products of retail market are imported from neighbouring countries, Greece and Israel. For 2018, oil products for the production of electricity were mainly from Spain and Italy.  Oil Companies conclude and sign an annual contract with a refinery for the supply of oil products. Electricity Authority Cyprus supplies heavy fuel oil and gas oil after tender and the relevant contract includes strict conditions regarding delays in supply. In the case of oil companies, the relevant risk in supply is considered high as they depend on one import source, but in the case of EAC, the risk is low as according to the contract, the trader is obliged to deliver the product.  4.4.2. ii. Projections of development with existing policies and measures at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) For projections of development of energy mix with existing policies and measures at least until 2040, see Impact Assessment, Primary Energy Supply evolution till 2050 (ktoe)  WEM scenario.
