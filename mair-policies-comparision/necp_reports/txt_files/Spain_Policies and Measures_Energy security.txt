3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 161 3.3 ENERGY SECURITY DIMENSION The reduction of energy dependency with regard to the importation of fossil fuels will be based, uniquely, on two vectors. On the one hand, through the implementation of energy use efficiency measures (corresponding to Section 3.2. of this Plan: Energy efficiency policies and measures. See also Annex F for more detail). On the other hand, through the development of national renewable energy sources, with all the implications of this in terms of control over primary resources, for which Spain has a high potential, given our geographic and climatic features, particularly for solar and wind power. The measures relating to this aspect can, therefore, mostly be found in Section 3.1. (Decarbonisation policies and measures).  As a result of that set of efficiency measures on efficiency in energy use and a strong push for indigenous renewable technologies, the importing of fossil fuels in physical units goes from 98,648 (thousands of tonnes of oil equivalent, ktoe) in 2017 to 65,084 ktoe in 2030, a decrease of 34%. This will significantly reduce the energy dependency ratio, which goes from 74% in 2017 to 61% in 2030, increasing national energy security.  Figure 3.6. Mix of primary energy in Spain in 2017 and 2030 (ktoe)  Source: Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, 2019   This increase in the contribution from indigenous sources is enhanced by the availability of national technology, which is in a position to take advantage of the opportunity that this Plan represents in economic terms and as regards employment generation. The measures set out in Section 3.5 will also contribute to this objective. (Policies and measures for research, innovation and competitiveness). Furthermore, we must not forget the diversification of supply sources, to ensure the availability of a wide range of geographical origins, so that geopolitical instability in producer countries or maritime transport routes does not have a significant impact on supply.  Thus, a considerable number of the energy security dimension policies and measures fall within the scope of the Special Committee on Energy Security (created by Agreement of the National Security Council (Order PRA/30/2018 of 22 January 2018)). This Committee is a support body to the National Security Council as provided for in Article 20(3) of Law 36/2015 of 28 September 2015 on National Security, which is responsible for exercising the functions assigned by the 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 162 Council in the area of energy security and within the framework of the National Security System.  Among the tasks entrusted are the assessment of risks and threats, the analysis of possible crisis scenarios, especially those likely to lead to a situation of National Security interest in the field of energy security, as well as the evaluation of the results of their implementation, all in coordination with the directly competent bodies and authorities and with the Specialist Situation Committee.  Objective 2 of the National Energy Security Strategy states the need to mix, which accurately reflects all the specificities of Spain and enables it to reach a certain guarantee of supply, at competitive prices,   Specifically, with regard to hydrocarbons, the reference standard is Royal Decree 1716/2004 of 23 July 2004, which regulates the obligation to maintain the existing minimum security requirements, the diversification of natural gas supply and the Corporation of Strategic Reserves of Petroleum Products (Corporación de Reservas Estratégicas de Productos Petrolíferos  the obligation set out in Council Directive 2009/119/EC to maintain a minimum level of reserves of crude oil or petroleum product. This Royal Decree also established the obligation to maintain minimum security stocks of natural gas.  With regard to their geographical location, in 2017 the strategic reserves of petroleum products were distributed throughout the national territory as shown in the figure below.  Figure 3.7. Location of strategic reserves in Spain in 2017  Source: CORES  Other emerging risks: cybersecurity 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 163 The cybersecurity objective in the Annual 2018 National Security Report is defined as follows:  ensure the secure use of information and communication networks and systems by strengthening capacities to prevent, detect and respond to cyberattacks by enhancing and   An area of strategic relevance for National Security is Critical Infrastructure. In the 2013-2018 period, a clear trend has been observed in the increase in the number of incidents recorded in this area, mainly malware and exploitation of system vulnerabilities, with more than 2,300 incidents in critical operators, with the financial, energy and transport sectors being the most affected, accounting for more than 50% of incidents.  Council Directive 2008/114 of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection is implemented by Law 8/2011 of 28 April 2011 establishing measures for the protection of critical infrastructure and by Royal Decree 704/2011 of 20 May 2011 approving the Regulation on the protection of critical infrastructure. Pursuant to this Royal Decree, the designated critical operators in the field of energy and nuclear industry have also presented their respective Operator Security Plans (OSP), checking their adjustment to the current situation of threats and challenges to which critical infrastructure in the energy sector and nuclear industry are subject, and updating the information contained in these plans. An important step in the field of cybersecurity in Spain was the reform of the Criminal Code in 2015, which included important amendments on the crimes related to computer sabotage, in compliance with Directive 2013/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 August 2013 on attacks against information systems and replacing Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA.  The existence of regulations for the Protection of Critical Infrastructure in Spain since 2011 has also made it possible to transpose Directive 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union (the NIS Directive), in a quick and simple manner due to having used the same procedures and accumulated knowledge to carry out this implementation. The entry into force of Royal Decree-Law 12/2018 of 7 September 2018 on network and information system security has transposed the aforementioned NIS Directive into Spanish law, giving a significant boost to the cybersecurity of essential services in the energy field.  In addition to this regulatory update, in April 2019, Spain approved its National Cybersecurity Strategy, the function of which is to develop the provisions of the 2017 National Security Strategy in the field of cybersecurity. This replaced the previous one, approved in 2013. It should also be noted that since 2015, Spain has had a National Energy Security Strategy, which, in view of the significant regulatory, technological and energy policy changes that have taken place in recent years, will probably be updated shortly. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 164 Public-private collaboration has also been strengthened and reinforced with the various energy operators, a task that has been coordinated by the Cybersecurity Coordination Office (Oficina de Coordinación Cibernética  OCC) of the National Centre for the Protection of Critical Infrastructure and Cybersecurity (Centro Nacional de Protección de Infraestructuras Críticas y Ciberseguridad  CNPIC), concerning the communication of cyber incidents. Also of note is the work done in this area by the National Institute for Cybersecurity (Instituto Nacional de Ciberseguridad  INCIBE), an agency attached to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation (Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos y Transformación Digital  MINECO).  Finally, Commission Recommendation (EU) 2019/553 of 3 April 2019 on cybersecurity in the energy sector should also be noted. This Recommendation sets out the key issues in this area, calling on Member States to include them in national legislation and to report regularly to the European Commission on their implementation status. Spain is preparing to systematically implement the recommendations on real time requirements for energy infrastructure, on what are referred to as cascade effects and on the appropriate combination of legacy and state-of-the-art technology.  In particular, the following actions are planned to address potential cybersecurity risks:   incorporating cybersecurity risk analysis into national regulations on security of hydrocarbon supply, with special attention to operators of essential services;   incorporating this same analysis into the Preventive Action Plans, Emergency Plans and the National Risk Assessment of the Spanish Gas System, established in accordance with Regulation 2017/1938;   conducting emergency simulation exercises related to cyber attacks.  To improve the efficiency of minimum security stock maintenance, the following measure is formulated:   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 165 Measure 3.1. Maintenance of minimum security stocks of petroleum products and gas  a) Description. Oil The obligation to maintain minimum security stocks of petroleum products in Spain currently amounts days, the Corporation of Strategic Reserves of Oil Products (Corporación de Reservas Estratégicas de Productos Petrolíferos  CORES), maintains 42 days (strategic stocks), while the industry maintains the remaining 50 days (industry reserves). Minimum stocks of oil products in April 2019 were 16.429 million tonnes held in the form of:  Crude and raw materials: 34.3% of the total.  Oil products (gasoline, kerosene, diesel and fuel oil): 65.7% of the total. These reserves represented 102.2 days of net imports, according to the calculation methodology set out in Directive 2009/119/EC, exceeding the European obligation of 90 days. The reserves were kept exclusively on national territory.  b) Liable parties. Oil The parties liable for maintenance of minimum security stocks of petroleum products are:  Wholesale petroleum product operators.  Retail distribution companies (for the part not supplied by wholesale operators, or other retail distributors).  Consumers (for the part not supplied by wholesale operators or retail distributors).  The maintenance obligation for petroleum products comprises three product groups: o Gasolines: automotive and aviation gasoline. o Middle distillates: automotive gas oils, other gas oils, aviation kerosene and other kerosene. o Fuel oils. The obligation for each product must be maintained in that product or another product belonging to the same group, but there is also the possibility of maintaining stocks in the form of raw materials, albeit with a ceiling for each group. Spanish and Community legislation provides for the possibility of maintaining reserves in other Member States.  c) Description. Gas The obligation to maintain minimum security stocks of natural gas in Spain currently amounts to 20 days of firm sales or consumption in the previous calendar year, which must be maintained in full by the obligated parties and in underground storage. CORES is the agency in charge of controlling the maintenance of minimum security stocks; however, it does not maintain strategic stocks of natural gas. The mobilisation of minimum security stocks of petroleum products and natural gas, if necessary, is the responsibility of the Government. The natural gas reserves in April 2019, which include the minimum obligatory maintenance stocks and commercial stocks, were 28,113 GWh, distributed among the following facilities:   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 166   regasification plants: 8,803 GWh (31.3% of the total);  underground storage: 19,310 GWh (68.7% of the total). All these stocks are held on national territory. d) Liable parties. Gas In terms of the minimum security stocks of natural gas, under the abovementioned Article 98 of Law 34/1998 of 7 October 1998, the parties liable to maintain such stocks are the following:  natural gas traders, for their firm sales in national territory;  direct consumers on the market, for the part of their consumption that is firm and not supplied by authorised traders.  e) Mechanisms  A public consultation process was launched in February 2019 to amend the current regulations on maintaining minimum security stocks of oil and gas products. The main objective is to establish minimum security stock obligations to ensure a sufficient level of security of supply and to comply with international obligations in the most efficient way. Efficiency is determined by location, cost, liable parties and products subject to obligation, among other aspects.   Special attention should be paid to the energy dependency of non-mainland regions. In particular, the Canary Islands, with a current dependency on petroleum as a primary energy source of 98 % and with an isolated electricity system, requires a major effort for interconnection between the islands, as well as greater development of technologies to support decarbonisation (both of these aspects are included in other dimensions of this Plan).  Measure 3.2. Reducing dependency on petroleum and carbon in the islands  a) Description As explained in the decarbonisation dimension, the design and implementation of sustainable energy strategies in the islands will be promoted. In addition, the contribution to the electricity mix of fossil fuel power stations located in the Canary Islands by 2030 will be reduced by at least 50% compared to the current situation, 2019, and therefore a specific plan will be prepared after the final approval of the INECP. In the case of the Balearic Islands, the existing coal-fired power station will close two of its four generator sets by 2020, leaving the remaining two as a reserve until the effective integration of the Balearic electricity system into the mainland system.  b) Responsible bodies The public authorities responsible for implementing and monitoring the measure will be MITECO, together with the respective autonomous communities.  c) Mechanisms The current planning for the electricity transmission network, with a 2015-2020 horizon, proposes ambitious investments in the electricity transmission network in non-mainland territories with various objectives, including interconnections between systems that allow for increased security of supply and reduced generation costs, as well as greater integration of renewable electricity generation.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 167 The current planning envisages an interconnection of the non-mainland territory of the autonomous city of Ceuta with the Iberian Peninsula, with an updated commissioning date after 2020. Similarly, a second electricity interconnection between the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands is planned for a period after 2020.  Projects that have not been put into service will be re-examined and taken into consideration for the new planning of the transmission network with the horizon of 2021-2026. There will also be a need for mechanisms to promote renewable generation that take into account the specific features of these territories and make it possible to take advantage of the savings in system costs that the introduction of renewable energies entails, in line with the provisions of Measure 1.12 of this Plan.  d) Financial requirements and public support At present, MITECO and REE are jointly carrying out the planning for the transmission network up to 2026. No detailed information is therefore available in this respect beyond that contained in the impact analysis chapter.  With regard to enhancing the diversification of national energy sources, this will be carried out while monitoring technical progress, and includes the following measure.  Measure 3.3. Alternative fuel recharging points a) Description We will continue to promote the installation of alternative fuel recharging points.  b) Impact of the measure In conjunction with other measures in the field of transport, the aim is to achieve greater electrification of this sector and increase the use of alternative, carbon-free fuels as a guideline for achieving emission reductions in the transport sector.  c) Responsible bodies The public authorities responsible for implementing and monitoring the measure are MITECO, MINCOTUR, together with the autonomous communities and, especially, local authorities. The electricity distribution companies also have a fundamental role in the deployment of electric vehicle recharging infrastructures.  d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at the electricity, transport and renewable fuel production sectors.  e) Mechanisms Directive 2014/94/EU of 22 October 2014 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure and Royal Decree 639/2016 of 9 December 2016 establishing a framework of measures for the implementation of alternative fuel infrastructure, which transposes it. The specific case of electric vehicles is addressed in Measure 2.4 of this Plan.  f) Financial requirements and public support The impact analysis chapter analyses these costs.  In the preparation plan to address limitations or interruptions to energy source supply, the following measures will contribute to achieving the stated objectives:   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 168 Measure 3.4. Promoting regional cooperation  a) Description The increase in the physical electricity interconnections with neighbouring energy systems contributes to reducing the possible impact of limitations or interruptions in the national supply of energy sources. In addition, it encourages optimising the use of existing capacity by reducing barriers to energy exchange. In this respect, we note that the regulatory authorities maintain continuous contact with their regional counterparts for the appropriate implementation of European regulations through the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and other working groups. On the other hand, the market operators work together to facilitate the integration of the markets as s participation in the continuous intra-day market. In addition, the system operators maintain regular contact at regional level to analyse and ensure the security of supply, implement European regulations and ensure the effective use of international interconnections through the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and other working groups. In addition, although this question is considered in greater detail in the internal energy market dimension, we note that the increase in capacity of electricity interconnections with France significantly contributes to reducing the isolation of the Iberian peninsula from the rest of Europe.  b) Impact of the measure Improved coordination between neighbouring countries in the field of energy.  c) Responsible bodies MITECO.  d) Target sectors The entire energy sector.  e) Mechanisms Regular meetings with France and Portugal to address energy security, as well as the most important issues in the field of energy that have occurred in each period.   3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 169 Measure 3.5. Extension of contingency plans a) Description Internally, the Spanish energy system is now in an advanced position with regard to its preparation for contingencies. In this respect, we note the role of Law 8/2011 of 28 April 2011, establishing measures for the protection of critical infrastructure, and the Implementing Regulation for this, based on European standards. However, it is necessary to extend this preparation, in the context of the different international domains to which Spain is committed: the International Energy Agency (IEA) and various EU directives and regulations for the electricity and gas sector. In the electricity sector, the objective of preventive and emergency plans is to prevent the unfolding of incidents that may have significant repercussions on supply or generating units, minimise the scope and the scale of incidents once they occur, as well as to return the electricity system to normal operating status after severe incidents that have caused power cuts. With this goal, a general and zonal security analysis will be conducted to evaluate the risk of supply failure that could arise from our own production resources, taking into account the availability of fuels, hydro-electric reserves in reservoirs and water availability, with several assumptions about both demand and availability of the generating units. At European level, we note the recent approval of the Regulation establishing a network code for emergencies and restoration of supply51, which gives details of a series of requirements to safeguard the security of supply, conditions to be met by the agents, listing of responsible persons and priority users, rules for suspension and restoration, settlements and testing plans. This Regulation, together with the proposal of the European Parliament for risk preparedness in the electricity sector, included in the preparedness at European level and improvement in its general security. With regard to the gas sector, the Preventive Action Plan and Emergency Plan will be updated in application of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply. Both documents were sent to the European Commission in March 2019. The Preventive Action Plan minimises the risks identified in order to guarantee gas supply to all gas market customers, especially protected customers. On the other hand, the Emergency Plan contains the actions to be carried out in the event of an emergency in the gas system to guarantee supply to all customers in the gas market and especially to protected customers. These plans are drawn up on the basis of the National Risk Assessment, which must ensure compliance with the rules on infrastructure and supplies imposed by Regulation (EU) 2017/1938. The main conclusions of the current Risk Assessment of the Spanish gas system are as follows:  None of the risks identified and analysed poses a gas supply problem for protected customers.  The N-1 principle and input capacity are incorporated as design criteria in the Mandatory Planning for the gas sector in Spain. Therefore, given the infrastructure anticipated within the timeframe analysed, the value of the N-1 formula laid down in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 for the Spanish gas system is greater than 100%, and it is thus not necessary to apply measures other than those used in normal operation.  The greatest potential risk identified for the Spanish gas system would be the total failure of the main supplier (Algeria). It should be noted that up to now this failure has not occurred. Imports from this source were even maintained during the period of instability in the country in the 1990s, and therefore this event is considered improbable.  The Spanish gas system Risk Assessment, Preventive Action Plan and Emergency Plan must be updated every four years. The following modifications are also planned in order to establish objectives and measures for natural gas supply security at regional level, so that:                                                              51 COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) 2017/2196 of 24 November 2017, establishing a network code on electricity emergency and restoration 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 170  The infrastructure standard (N-1) of Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 must be complied with at regional level, taking the existing level of interconnection into account.  The supply standard of Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 must be followed at regional level, taking into account the imposition of different national demands and the existence of different national measures taken to meet them.  The Preventive Action and Emergency Plans will be developed at regional level. To comply with the foregoing, regions must be established that are distinct from the risk groups created in Annex I to the abovementioned regulation. b) Impact of the measure  c) Responsible bodies The public authority responsible for implementing and monitoring the measures is MITECO.  d) Target sectors This measure is aimed at the energy sector as a whole. e) Mechanisms The main actions will be aimed at: 1) developing the National Security Strategy, through the Special Committee on Energy Security; 2) adapting to the new European regulation on preparation for risks in the electricity sector; 3) improving the various preventive and emergency plans with regard to the supply of electricity, gas and petroleum derivatives. In the petroleum products sector, the following actions are considered necessary:  Updating the Contingency plan for crisis situations in the petroleum markets: confidential document, prepared by CORES and regularly updated according to the criteria established by the IEA, which have established four action phases, from major to minor severity with regard to potential difficulties of supply of crude oil and petroleum products.  Updating the Plan for demand restriction measures in the event of a crisis in the petroleum market: confidential document, prepared in 2015 by the MERCOP (Measures to Restrict the Consumption of Petroleum) group, specifically created for this purpose, including various ministerial departments and bodies of the General State Administration.  Participating in emergency exercises regularly conducted by the European Commission and the conducted in 2018, can be cited as an example. In addition, with the aim of reaching a certain level of energy security at regional level within the EU framework, it is necessary to establish objectives and measures for supply security of petroleum products at regional level, so that:  the obligation to store and petroleum products can be met at regional or EU level;  the proportionality of the level of obligation and the methodology for accounting for existing supplies are reviewed, tailoring both to the reality of the global oil market and the state of the art;  the form of compliance with the obligation is reviewed, so that the methodology for accounting for existing stocks encourages them to be composed of finished products;  the form of compliance with the obligation is reviewed, so that the methodology for accounting for existing stocks encourages them to be located near to consumption centres, taking transport times into account;  general standards for the process of authorisation of an obligations by using storage reserves located in other Member States are established. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 171 While these general standards are introduced, Spain plans to approve a Ministerial Order to implement Article 11(2) of Royal Decree 1716/2004, in order to establish a unique procedure for authorising the storage of countable reserves for other Member States within national boundaries, avoiding the need for new bilateral agreements. However, various procedures for the bilateral agreements already signed (with France, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Malta) will continue to exist and be necessary so that their national liable parties meet their obligations through storage reserves in other Member States.    3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 172 Measure 3.6 Planning for safe operation of a decarbonised energy system  a) Description Although the forecasts in this Plan allow the guarantee of supply to be fulfilled by 2030, consistency with a decarbonised economy and a 100% renewable electricity sector by 2050 makes it necessary to anticipate and identify the barriers, requirements and opportunities for operation with full guarantees of supply to the electricity system under these conditions. It should be noted that a transformation of the Spanish energy system as thorough and ambitious as that presented in this Plan brings a series of challenges that cannot only be addressed from the supply side. In particular, the decisive commitment to renewable energies in the electricity generation sector entails a greater variety of generating profiles. This variety of supply can be compensated for by the development of various large-scale energy storage solutions, still on the supply side (hydraulic pumps or batteries or other), as well as increased firmness and manageability of specific renewable generation technologies, and also on the demand side through the promotion of different solutions to give the  In the same area, technological advances have enabled the existence of a series of technological solutions that have still not been fully explored in the electricity sector regulations, but they are required to play an important role in ensuring the continuity of electricity supplies: in particular, any the optimisations that enable the intensive use of information and communication technologies in the energy system. Thus, also contributing to the internal energy market dimension, we will adapt the regulations on:  Distributed generation and storage of electricity. This measure includes all the developments in relation to own consumption (see Measure 1.4 of this Plan).  Further progress in the elimination of barriers related to electric vehicles, such as the recent elimination of the role of charge managers (see Measure 2.4).  Boosting forms of aggregated generation, demand responsiveness (including interruptibility) and storage (virtual power plants).  Participation of renewable technologies in more services of the electricity system: deviation management, regulation services, etc. (see Measure 4.4). The real and gradual integration of the service of interruptibility demand management in the adjustment service markets results in the more frequent use of this service, and therefore in a reduction of electricity consumption at prices increasingly comparable to those observed today by the generating undertakings that participate in the adjustment services. Along these lines, Royal Decree-Law 20/2018 of 7 December 2018, on urgent measures to promote economic competitiveness in the sector of industry and commerce in Spain, lays down the mandate to -industrial electricity consumers with high use of electricity, high use at times of low electricity demand and a stable and predictable consumption curve. This statute will also meet economic criteria, acting on situations in which the application of the service implies a lower cost than the adjustment services of the system. Thus, for the application of the interruptibility service by economic criteria, it will be checked that the implementation of the capacity reduction option, taking all the associated settlement into account, will result in a reduction of the total cost of the energy to be managed at that time. In addition, certain measures have been adopted to make the criteria allowing implementation of the capacity reduction options more flexible when their settlement is less costly than the activation of other market mechanisms. 3. POLICIES AND MEASURES 173 In compliance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1938, we plan to establish and regularly update the list of critical electric power stations supplied by gas and their volumes of consumption, so that these volumes can be taken into account if another Member State requests the application of solidarity measures. With this goal, a working group will be created together with the electricity System Operator, the System Technical Manager and the Competent Authority in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1938. With regard to the participation of renewables in electricity system services, Spain is one of the pioneering countries for including renewable energies in the various adjustment services. Since February 2016, these facilities can participate in the adjustment service markets of the system, after passing the authorisation tests. From the start of 2018, almost half of wind power generation has been authorised for participation in deviation management services and tertiary regulation: this demonstrates that sufficient progress has been made in the integration of renewables into these services. In that regard, it is worth highlighting the role played by the system operator, whose control centre currently enables the observation and control of power generating stations of more than 1 MW and 10 MW, respectively.  b) Target sectors This measure is aimed at the energy sector as a whole.  c) Mechanisms Following the principle of technology neutrality, MITECO, the CNMC and the System Operator will identify the technologies, procedures and mechanisms that will make it possible to guarantee the supply without greenhouse gas emissions, with sufficient anticipation that makes it possible to guarantee the supply while following the path towards climate neutrality in 2050 and avoiding the need for new investments in fossil technologies to guarantee the supply.  d) Responsible bodies The public authorities responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the measure are: MITECO, the System Operator and the CNMC.  In conclusion, it should be noted that there is a close connection between the energy security dimension and the other dimensions addressed in this Plan:   The internal market dimension, with which it shares instruments such as electric and gas interconnections, or demand management.  Research, Innovation and Competitiveness (RIC), as developments in batteries or power-to-gas depend on the more economical implementation of these technologies, which will be key in the future of supply security.  With regard to the decarbonisation dimension, the high use of renewables in the system creates challenges for managing them, as well as integrating them into transmission and distribution networks.  The energy efficiency dimension, since various solutions in this domain, such as local energy networks, also lead to system resiliency.
