Projections of the development of the energy system, GHG emissions, CO2 removals, and air pollutant emissions under the planned policies and measures  5.1.1. Energy system development projections The implementation of the planned policies and measures (hereinafter referred to as the target scenario) meets the mandatory energy efficiency improvement target  cumulative energy savings for 2030 and the share of RES in total final energy consumption reaching 50 %. However, a substantial increase in the share of RES in final energy consumption has an impact on primary energy consumption and on final energy consumption and affects the possibility of reducing this consumption, since the modelling based on developed additional policies and measures proposes as the most cost-effective measures ensuring a significant increase in the consumption of solid biomass in industry and low capacity energy (mainly in the commercial and public sectors), where, while respecting the principles of eco-design, the efficiency of combustion plants is lower than that of large capacity combustion plants. Projected final energy consumption, excluding energy consumption for non-energy needs, is forecast to be around 14.9 % lower in 2030 than in 2018. The calculated final energy consumption projections predict that the largest reduction in energy consumption in 2030 against 2018 is in the transport sector, households and industry. According to the projections, the main energy consumption sectors in 2030 will be transport and households with 27.1 % and 28.6 % of the total final energy consumption respectively. Industry will consume 21.2 % the commercial and public sector will consume 17.2 %, while the rest will be consumed on meeting agricultural and forestry needs.

Final energy consumption projections in the target scenario broken down by sectors until 2030226 (PJ) In the target scenario for 2030, the share of electricity increases by around 3.7 percentage points in total final energy consumption compared to 2018, while taking into account increased car efficiency, wider use of EVs, wider use of RES in transport, a reduced share of oil consumption by around 5 % points. The share of consumption of all types of biomass increases by about 2.2 % points compared to 2018. The planned energy efficiency measures save 9 PJ in 2030.

Final energy consumption projections in the target scenario broken down by energy types until 2030227 (PJ) Taking into account the measures included in Annex 4 to the Plan on improving energy efficiency at final consumers, as well as measures in the energy transformation sector and energy transport, the total primary energy consumption, excluding consumption for non-energy needs, according to the results of the modelling of the target scenario, is 166.2 PJ in 2030. It is 15.8 % lower than in 2018 and provides an average annual decline of around 1.2 % of energy consumption by 2030.  All fossil fuels in total primary energy consumption show a downward trend until 2030 compared to 2018. By contrast, the trend of all types of RES is upward. The share of wind and solar energy in total consumption of primary sources is growing at the fastest rate.  Key as in previous figure. Figure 44. Primary energy consumption projections in the target scenario broken down by energy types until 2030228 (PJ) The results of the modelled target scenario show that planned energy efficiency measures in respect of final energy consumers and in energy transformation and transportation sectors save 12.3 PJ in 2030. This means that primary energy consumption would be 12.3 PJ higher without these measures.  The intensity of primary energy consumption and final energy consumption in the target scenario improves compared to the baseline scenario (it also improves in the baseline scenario), taking into account the planned energy efficiency measures and assumptions about the modernisation of the energy system. In the target scenario, which uses more RES and implements additional energy efficiency measures to reduce GHG emissions, energy intensity improves further still. The calculated final energy consumption intensity is 49 % lower in 2030 than in 2017. The average decrease over the period is 3.8 % per year. Table 23.

Since a flexible demand approach is used in the modelling of scenarios, the increase in electricity prices in the target scenario, in addition to the deployment of RES capacities, has the effect of reducing electricity consumption in individual sectors compared to the baseline scenario, including the scenario where energy efficiency measures are implemented in respect of the final consumer. Electricity consumption in the target scenario is projected to be around 11.7 % higher in 2030 than in 2017.   Cf. Key to fig. 42 above Figure 45. Electricity consumption projections in the target scenario broken down by sectors (GWh)229 The results of the target scenario projections show the greatest percentage increase in electricity consumption to be in transport and industry by 2030 compared to 2017. The expected increase in the number of EVs in this scenario provides for this increase in consumption in the transport sector against the baseline scenario of around 40 %.  Total CSA consumption in the target scenario is approximately 4.7 % lower in 2030 than in 2017. The target scenario provides for the continued replacement of natural gas with solid biomass in DH boiler houses and therefore RES in thermal energy also increases by 2030 and reaches around 58 %. Compared to the baseline scenario, the amount of thermal energy produced from RES increases only slightly in the target scenario.                                                       229 MoE 152  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00  Key reads, left to right: Agriculture and forestr, Commercial and public sector, Industry and construction, Households Figure 46.

Projections for achievement of energy efficiency targets The mandatory energy efficiency target for Latvia is defined in Article 7 of Directive -2030 is the -use savings for that period, which is 73.72 PJ (1.76 Mtoe). This cumulative energy end-use savings target means that new and additional energy savings of 1.34 PJ should be achieved every year. In order to meet this target, it is necessary to implement additional energy efficiency policies and measures set out in Annex 4 to the Plan. The largest contribution is expected from fuel and electricity savings in industry. The measures include the already defined involvement of large enterprises both in the system of voluntary agreements and in the performance of their energy audit duties. In addition, greater involvement of enterprises in the implementation of energy efficiency measures through the EEOS is envisaged. The second major contribution is expected to be achieved in the transport sector. The measures include switching from internal combustion engines to EV (plug-in hybrid vehicles and EVs) in road transport, electrification of railways and information and training measures on energy efficiency improvements. Measures are planned for households and commercial and public sector to improve the energy performance of buildings (residential buildings, public buildings, including State buildings, and commercial sector buildings), improvement of energy efficiency for appliances and lighting using electricity, as well as information measures.

Energy security and internal energy market Latvia is expected to implement target scenarios by hitting energy security and dependency reduction targets mainly thanks to:  measures for the deployment of various RES technologies, wind energy and solar energy, promotion of the use of RES and RES diversification measures being implemented;  energy efficiency measures implemented reducing the need for both domestic and imported energy;                                                       237 https://em.gov.lv/lv/nozares_politika/nacionalais_energetikas_un_klimata_plans/ 158  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00  electricity synchronisation measures, the implementation of which has already been started;  start of functioning of the regional natural gas (Finland-Latvia-Estonia) on 1 January 2020;  measures taken to open up the electricity and natural gas market, ensuring free competition on the market and enabling users to choose the most suitable energy supplier. 5.1.5. Projections for GHG emissions and CO2 removals  It is estimated in the target scenario that the amount of GHG emissions from non-ETS activities will decrease to 13 % in 2030 compared to non-ETS emissions in 2005. The target scenario projects non-ETS of 79 % of the total amount in 2030. In 2030, most of the non-ETS emissions come from the agricultural sector, which accounts for 40 % of total non-ETS emissions, then from the transport sector, which accounts for 29 % of non-ETS emissions, while non-ETS energy generates 23 % of emissions. The rest of the non-ETS emissions come from waste management (4 %) and the non-ETS industrial process and product use sector (3 %).  Key reads: Waste management Agriculture Non-ETS industrial processes and product use Transport Non-ETS energy Figure 54. -ETS GHG for 2030 (kt CO2 eq) -ETS sector will be 7 462 kt CO2 eq.

Actual non-ETS GHG emissions (up to 2017) and target scenario projection for GHG emissions For the calculation of projections of GHG emissions of energy, in addition to the policies included in the baseline scenario, the target scenario provides for a wider use of RES, reaching 50 % of total final energy consumption in 2030. In the target scenario, additional measures are also designed to improve energy efficiency in all sectors of energy consumption (households, commercial and public sectors, industry). In the target scenario, non-ETS emissions decrease by approximately 1 758 kt 2 eq. or 31.2 % by 2030238. Projections for GHG emissions of the non-ETS sector for the target scenario are approximately 9 % lower than for the baseline scenario. The implementation of energy efficiency measures and the transition from the use of fossil fuels to biomass reduce GHG emissions in industry by around 148 kt CO2 eq. by 2030. On the other hand, the implementation of energy efficiency measures in households and the commercial and public sector and the wider use of RES in the commercial and public sector reduce emissions by approximately 310 kt CO2 eq. by 2030. Wider use of biogas (advanced biofuels) and biofuels (1st generation and advanced biofuels) is planned for the transport sector, in addition to the railway electrification project implemented in the baseline scenario. GHG emissions in the transport sector decrease by approximately 1 140 kt CO2 eq. by 2030. In the target scenario, the results of projections for agricultural emissions indicate that emissions in the agricultural sector could rise by 8.2 % by 2030 (227 kt CO2 eq.) compared to 2017 and by 26.2 % (625 kt CO2 eq.) compared to 2005. The target scenario shows a reduction in emissions against the baseline scenario as emissions from agricultural soils reduce by 5.5 %. Agricultural land has the biggest impact in 2030  57.3 % of total agricultural emissions. The second largest sector is enteric fermentation accounting for 33.7 % in 2030.  In the waste management sector, non-ETS GHG emissions gradually fall from 565 kt CO2 eq. (in 2017) to 316 kt CO2 eq. in 2030.  Disposal of solid waste is the largest source of GHG emission in the waste management sector in 2030 at 42.6 %. The second largest sector in the waste management sector in 2030 is the wastewater treatment sector with 38.4 %.                                                       238 here and below compared to 2017 160  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 According to the target scenario, in the waste management sector, GHG emissions in 2020 are the same as in the baseline scenario, but they are by 3.1 % in 2030 in the baseline scenario. The target scenario takes account of the fact that just 10 % of the waste generated will be disposed of in landfills in 2035. Therefore, a reduction in emissions is observed in the target scenario.    Key reads: Base scenario Base scenario (higher GDP, higher population) 2030 target Figure 56. Changes in non-ETS GHG emissions under the influence of macroeconomic indicators (Baseline scenario) The calculation of GHG emission projections is linked to the uncertainties established by the assumptions made. The most important parameters influencing GHG emission projections include assumptions about macroeconomic development trends, changes in population and fuel price development trends. In order to assess the impact of some of the listed parameters on GHG emission projections, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out using an alternative scenario. Macroeconomic indicators (GDP, population, added value) of the produced by the Ministry of Economics were used in the alternative scenario. In 2030, the calculated non-ETS GHG emissions are 9.7 % higher than in the baseline scenario and are therefore 8.5 % higher than the target for GHG emissions of the non-ETS sector for 2030. This points to the need for additional GHG reduction measures to provide more certainty regarding the achievement of the target in 2030, which were included in the target scenario. Detailed information on GHG emission projections in the baseline scenario and target scenario prepared in the reporting format developed by the EC can be found on the website of the Ministry of Economics239. 5.1.6. Interaction with emissions of air pollutants Poor air quality adversely affects quality of life and can lead to health problems such as asthma and cardiovascular diseases, reducing life expectancy. This in turn results in absence                                                       239 https://em.gov.lv/lv/nozares_politika/nacionalais_energetikas_un_klimata_plans/ 161  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 from work due to illness and increases the cost of health services, particularly for children and the elderly. The European Environment Agency240 has estimated that in 2015 PM2,5 particulate pollution caused 1 600 premature deaths and PM2,5 pollution has the greatest impact on this indicator compared to other types of pollution (nitrogen dioxide pollution and ozone pollution).  Existing policies and measures under the plan, together with additional policies and measures directly interact with policies and measures to reduce emissions of air pollutants in Latvia in respect of particulate matter (dust) emissions, since both the plan and the assessment carried out under APRAP2030 have come to the conclusion that emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon oxide, non-methane volatile substances or sulphur dioxide are not significantly affected by the policies and measures planned to help mitigate climate change.  The plan and APRAP2030 were developed in a harmonised manner in Latvia without including in either policy planning document any policies and measures that might have a significant negative impact on the mitigation of climate change, the fulfilment of energy or air pollution reduction targets, particular care going into the development and planning of measures that affect emissions of particulate matter (dust) in Latvia . The main sources of emissions of particulate matter (dust) in Latvia are low capacity energy  solid biomass stationary combustion plants in households and in the commercial and public sector, as well as transport. In the target scenario, emissions of particulate matter (PM2,5) in the energy sector decrease by around 7.5 % in 2030 compared to 2016, mainly due to the energy efficiency measures implemented. The use of wind energy in electricity generation in the target scenario allows for a 3 % reduction in emissions in 2030 against a scenario in which wind energy is not used. As a result of the planned additional policies and measures, only the energy sector can provide a nearly 34 % reduction in particulate matter (PM2,5) emissions compared to 2005.241 In order to assess the impact of the policies implemented in the target scenario on air quality, PM2,5 emissions were assessed in the target scenario compared with the results of the alternative scenarios generated when these policies are not implemented. In the target scenario, in order to increase the share of RES in total final energy consumption by 2030 to 50 %, the amount of electricity generated from wind energy is significantly increased by installing wind generators with a capacity of 1100 MW. If the same target (50% of RES in 2030) is achieved by another strategy (alternative scenario), it increases PM2,5 emissions in the energy transformation sector in 2030 by 13.5 % compared to the target scenario.                                                         240 Report of the Euro--8449, https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/air-quality-in-europe-2018  241 IPE 162  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00  Key reads: Target scenario, Target scenaria excluding wind energy Figure 57. PM2,5 emissions in the processing sector in target and alternative scenarios The target scenario aims at facilitating the faster introduction of EVs (PHEV and BEV).

Macroeconomic impact of planned policies and measures and investments On the basis of the modelling results, the additional costs necessary to implement the target scenario compared to the baseline scenario have been calculated, taking into account the necessary investments for the deployment of new technologies (RES capacities for electricity and heat generation, electrification of the transport sector, etc.), for the implementation of energy efficiency measures, comparing these additional costs with a reduction in fuel costs. These costs can be covered by both public and municipal budget funding and EU finances or other funding and private capital. A 163  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 allow an assessment of the impact of one or other energy and environmental policies on the overall costs of the system, on the one hand, allowing an assessment of how these costs are related to the estimated GDP, on the other hand.

Additional costs in the target scenario against the baseline scenario per year to GDP243 Energy efficiency and wider use of RES reduce costs for imported energy sources, thus energy efficiency and wider use of RES reduce costs of imported energy sources, but on the other hand, additional investment in technology is needed. The investment needed to achieve the energy efficiency targets for 2030 calculated in the model is estimated at around EUR 4 billion at constant 2010 prices.                                                       242 IPE 243 IPE 164  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00  Key reads: Cost of importing fuel     Investment costs Figure 61. Reduced expenditure on imported energy sources (green bar) and increase in expenditure on investment in technology (red bar) for the target scenario244 The benefits of reducing the costs of heating / motor fuel imports, taking into account future prices currently projected in the model are largely offset by additional investment (the difference is not high). The positive impacts of additional jobs and the multiplier effects of additional investment have yet to be taken into account when calculating the overall GDP impact. If this condition is assumed, the overall benefits are expected to offset the additional costs incurred for the implementation of the scenario. Therefore, the overall impact on GDP is expected to be positive.      5.2.2. Impact assessment of planned policies and measures on jobs Measures designed to replace fossil fuel imports with RES and measures to improve energy efficiency contribute not only to the improvement of diversification and safety of energy supply and to reducing costs on imported energy sources, but also provide social and economic benefits. They are related to the development, production and installation of technologies using RES and their operation, maintenance and fuel preparation. Moreover, the use of RES and the implementation of energy efficiency measures is closely linked to business promotion, innovation and the use of modern technologies. Increasing energy efficiency by renovating buildings in the household and services sector will generate energy savings and stimulate economic growth by prompting the development of the construction sector. The planned implementation of energy efficiency measures for building renovation will stimulate local and regional development by creating jobs.  On the basis of the modelling results on the amount of energy savings by achieving the 2030 target and the necessary investments, the number of new jobs from the implementation of energy efficiency measures in buildings as well as in the service sector and industry was                                                       244 IPE 165  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 assessed245. Depending on the scale of the implementation of energy efficiency measures, they might provide up to 2 100 direct new jobs on average (2020-2030), leading to the creation of an additional 3 150 indirect jobs. The target scenario provides for installation of additional RES capacities until 2030, including for electricity generation and heat generation. There are significant differences between different RES technologies, so employment in bio-energy projects differs significantly from wind and solar projects. For the latter, jobs in Latvia are mainly created in installation, as well as operation of equipment, while for bioenergy projects  in production of biomass and its supply. The deployment of additional RES capacities by 2030 may generate up to 2 500 new direct jobs and up to 5 500 direct and indirect jobs. Overall, the implementation of energy efficiency and RES policies may create up to  4 600 new jobs during the period covered by the plan and around 6 100 indirect jobs during the period of the plan. 5.2.3. Ensuring equitable and fair transition In general, the planned policies and measures included in the plan do not have a significant impact on the aspects of equitable and fair transition during the period covered by the plan, since no measures are foreseen for the implementation of significant changes in any economic sector. A number of measures proposed in the plan contribute to employment in activities such as energy efficiency improvement measures, the production of advanced biofuels, the installation and operation of zero-emission technologies, the reconstruction and maintenance of land improvement systems, etc. Agriculture and other land use are emission-intensive activities and a large part of GHG emissions come from activities where it is very difficult to implement measures to reduce GHG emissions. Similarly, the agricultural, land-use and forestry sector in Latvia employs about 7 % of all employees, w the vast majority being in the regions. However, this employment is higher when we take into account related sectors, such as the food industry, the timber industry, which will be affected by changes in the agricultural and LULUCF sectors. It is therefore necessary to plan and take measures to encourage changes in population employment without a significant impact on the social situation and well-being of the population when planning changes in any sector or promoting measures to switch from GHG-intensive agricultural, land-use and forestry techniques and technologies to less intensive techniques and technologies. These measures include both the training and reorientation of careers and help with finding a job in another sector, including help with changing residence, if necessary. Although the Latvian energy sector (excluding transport) is not significantly emission-intensive with prevailing use of natural gas and various types of biomass fuels, the long-term shift towards decarbonisation of the energy sector and a significant improvement in energy efficiency in the periods until 2050 might also make it necessary to reorient employees in the energy sector to other areas and sectors. Also, some of the largest industrial companies in Latvia are currently emission-intensive, where part of the emissions comes from production processes rather than fuel use activities, and if these companies decide to change their production methods, volumes or change the operating sector in order to safeguard 2050 climate neutrality                                                       245 The number of jobs was calculated using the information available from international literature on the number of jobs on invested investments (jobs/MEUR) or the amount of energy savings (jobs/GWh). The assessment is given as the average of the two methods applied. 166  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 target, then employees in these companies would also need assistance and measures would need to be implemented  with regard to these employees to ensure that their social situation is not adversely affected by assistance with the changing employment environment . ensure equitable and fair transition, use should also be made of EU structural funds that are linked to the transition to a climate neutral economy, since these funds would to be financed that support upskilling, the development of employee skills or mitigation of the impact of higher energy prices on the financial capacity of households. 5.3. Impact of policies and measures of the plan on other EU Member States and regional cooperation  The policies, objectives and measures scheduled to be implemented in Latvia will not have a major negative impact on the other two Baltic States. On the contrary, for example, the development of offshore wind parks in Latvia will have a positive impact on the energy supply within the region. Based on existing wind park monitoring programmes, in the North Sea for example, it is possible to take appropriate planning and mitigation measures to build offshore wind parks without causing significant damage to the environment. It should be borne in mind that coastlines are technically suited to the development of wind energy, but these habitats are also attractive to many benthic communities246. Policy support has helped the EU reach nearly 20 GW of offshore wind capacity by the end of 2018. Offshore wind energy is earmarked for strong growth in the EU and the current policy aims to increase offshore wind capacities fourfold over the next ten years. The power factor for new offshore wind projects is 40 %-50 %, where larger turbines and other technology improvements help maximise the available wind resources. Offshore WPPs match the capacity factors of efficient gas-fired and coal-fired power plants in some regions, and exceeds those of onshore WPP, being around double those of solar PV247. In 2017, the level of interconnection between the Baltic States was >60 %, which will increase with the synchronisation of the Baltic and European power grids. In Estonia, the plan is to increase electricity connectivity capacity between Estonia and Latvia, this being the third Latvia-Estonia interconnection project (330 kV high-voltage line between substations Kilingi-Numme in Estonia and Riga CHPP-2 in Latvia). This measure is also included in the Latvian plan, as the project is already under construction and by 2025 will increase Latvia-Estonia maximum cross-cutting capacity by 700MW in the direction of Estonia and by 500MW in the direction of Latvia. After 2025, interconnection capacity between Estonia and Latvia will double. The Baltic States have coordinated the measures proposed in their plans and have assessed the potential impact of the measures on neighbouring countries, and most of the measures do not adversely affect other countries. Direct transboundary impacts are expected from measures related to electricity and gas infrastructure development projects. These impacts will generally be positive in terms of energy prices and energy market integration. In leading producers of wooden pellets248, and are looking to make up for the lack of RES in other European countries. This is being bolstered by sectoral cooperation on wood supply (including chips, pellets) for the wood                                                       246 https://www.wwf.no/assets/attachments/84-wwf_a4_report___havvindrapport.pdf  247 https://www.iea.org/offshorewind2019/  248 https://www.graanulinvest.com/eng/frontpage 167  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 industry and the energy sector, such as Baltpool249, which was proposed by the Lithuanian operator. In addition, future technologies (energy storage, CCU, hydrogen, etc.) will be sought in cooperation with the Nordic countries and the Baltic States.                                                         249 https://www.baltpool.eu/lv/
