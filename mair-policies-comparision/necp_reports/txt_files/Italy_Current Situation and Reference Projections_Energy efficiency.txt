3.8 Dimension energy efficiency    i. Current primary and final energy consumption in the economy and per sector (including industry, residential, service and transport)  The last few decades have seen profound changes being made to the Italian energy system, in which natural gas first of all established itself, followed by (from 2005 onwards) a marked rise in renewable energy sources, in particular in the electricity sector, and a steady reduction, on the other hand, of petroleum products. These developments have been imposed both by policies aimed at significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and thus combating the risks associated with climate change, and by the need to guarantee greater security and diversification in energy supplies. In 2016, gross inland consumption stood at around 155 Mtoe33, down by one percentage point with respect to the previous year. This figure stems from a constant reduction, with respect to the previous year, in the consumption of solid fuels (down 10.7%), petroleum products (down 3.3%) and RES, which have seen a reversal in their growth (down 0.1%), together with an increase in gas consumption (up 5%). Net electricity imports dropped to around 20%. Gross inland consumption and final consumption levels fell dramatically in the 2005-2014 period, save for an upturn in 2010, followed by a slight drop in recent years. The falls in the consumption of petroleum products, natural gas and (albeit at an inconsistent rate) coal have been particularly marked. Over the last few decades, renewable energy sources, also thanks to a generous incentivisation scheme, have played a leading role in a period of significant development in Italy; this period ended in 2013, after which progress has been rather stagnant, with a fall, as mentioned above, being recorded in 2016.                                                             33 Including non-energy uses  Source: Eurostat INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 245   Figure 43  Changes in gross inland consumption per source (Mtoe) [Source: Eurostat]  Primary energy demand (excluding non-energy uses) in the period 2005-2016 decreased by 18% from 181.5 Mtoe in 2005 to 148.4 Mtoe in 2016.  In 2016, final energy consumption levels recorded a slight drop in relation to the previous year, falling 0.3% to 116 Mtoe. The following can be seen: - a less marked but still significant fall in consumption by the transport sector (down 1.1%); - broadly stable consumption levels for the civil sector (down 0.5%), but linked to climate variability; - increased consumption by the industrial sector (up 1.4%).

As can be seen, gas and electricity sources are predominant in the industrial sector (around 70% of total consumption) and the civil sector (85%), while oil covers virtually all the requirements of the transport sector, although it is worth pointing out an increase in RES in relation to the use of biofuels.  The following figure details the final sectoral consumption levels in 2016, by source.

Final energy intensity is following similar trends. The following figure shows how the average European intensity has fallen sharply, approaching levels that Italy has had since 1990. other countries of Europe, which has required a major effort to achieve significant energy savings with respect to other economies in which specific consumption levels are historically higher and more compressible. Consumption levels first started falling in 2005, before the financial crisis, whereas they had constantly been on the rise between 1990 and 2005, by an average annual rate of +1.4%. In addition, the share of natural gas has constantly been on the rise since 1990, offsetting the corresponding drop in petroleum products. The increasingly important role played by renewable energies has become clear in recent years. Figure 46  Final consumption and gross inland consumption per unit of GDP, historical data  Gross inland consumption for Italy  Gross inland consumption for the EU28  Final consumption for Italy  Final consumption for the EU28 The ratio between final energy consumption and primary energy consumption is an indicator of the overall efficiency of converting energy from primary sources. This ratio has always been very high for Italy, and greater than the European average. The increase in efficiency, which is also due to the increase in gross electricity production from cogeneration plants (since 1999), is partially offset by the growing importance of secondary energy sources (electricity, petroleum derivatives) in final energy consumption; this explains why the indicator was relatively stable up to 2011. The ratio has increased in recent years, owing not only to the increase in the share of final electricity consumption, but also to the greater efficiency in transforming fossil fuels. Since 1990, the average ratio between final energy consumption and primary energy consumption in Italy has fluctuated between 0.7 and 0.75, with the average figure for the EU28 standing at around 0.65.

The figures show that the the contribution made by the cogeneration power plants, which have greater electrical efficiency than non-cogeneration power plants. In 2016, the electrical efficiency of the latter plants was 43%, whereas the former plants recorded a figure of 55.6%. In addition, the electrical efficiency of cogeneration power plants is constantly increasing, while that of non-cogeneration plants has not significantly risen since 2005. In 2016, cogeneration power plants recorded an efficiency level of 64.5% (taking heat production into account as well). The overall efficiency of Italy thermoelectric power plants is 54.6%, and has followed an upward trend in recent years (up to 2016).   0.800 0.750 0.700 0.650 Italy EU28 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 250   Table 50     The following figure shows how (broken down into cogeneration and non-cogeneration power plants) have progressed over the years. The increase in efficiency recorded for the cogeneration power plants between 2012 and 2013 is particularly striking; this was down to the predominant operation of combined-cycle and condensation cogeneration units that were substantial in size and more efficient.     2005 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016  Specific consumption levels  non-cogeneration power plants (Mcal/electric kWh) 2.048 1.997 1.993 2.028 2.085 2.131 2.060 2.001  Specific consumption levels  cogeneration power plants (Mcal/electric kWh) 1.703 1.667 1.643 1.664 1.561 1.598 1.553 1.546  Energy consumption  thermoelectric power plants (ktoe) 53 468 47 764 47 671 45 666 41 099 38 300 40 343 40 886  - cogeneration power plants 21 206 23 999 22 521 22 147 20 052 19 045 20 654 22 164  - for electricity production 16 078 18 577 16 678 16 780 14 251 13 607 14 889 16 256  - for heat production 5 127 5 422 5 843 5 367 5 801 5 438 5 765 5 908  - non-cogeneration power plants 32 262 23 765 25 150 23 519 21 046 19 256 19 688 18 722  Energy consumed for electricity production [ktoe] 48 339 42 342 41 830 40 300 35 295 32 856 34 578 34 978            Electrical efficiency of thermoelectric power plants 0.448 0.468 0.468 0.463 0.468 0.459 0.476 0.488  Overall efficiency of cogeneration power plants 0.600 0.601 0.616 0.611 0.645 0.638 0.646 0.645  Electrical efficiency of cogeneration power plants 0.505 0.516 0.523 0.517 0.551 0.538 0.554 0.556  Electrical efficiency of non-cogeneration power plants 0.420 0.431 0.431 0.424 0.412 0.403 0.417 0.430            Overall efficiency of thermoelectric power plants 0.491 0.516 0.519 0.515 0.526 0.520 0.534 0.546  INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 251    Figure 48  2016   Electrical efficiency of thermoelectric power plants  Overall efficiency of cogeneration power plants  Electrical efficiency of cogeneration power plants  Electrical efficiency of non-cogeneration power plants The data show that the conversion efficiency levels recorded in 2016 are greater than those recorded in 2005. The increased efficiency is particularly pronounced for cogeneration power plants; indeed, between 2005 and 2016, the average increase in electrical efficiency recorded for all thermoelectric power plants was 4%, but when the figures are broken down, it emerges that cogeneration power plants achieved an increase in efficiency of 5.1%, compared with just 1% for non-cogeneration power plants over the same period. As regards overall efficiency, cogeneration power plants saw their performance levels go up by 4.4%, with a particularly significant role being played by combined-cycle power plants, which managed to increase their overall efficiency by 7.3%.  Efficiency in sectors making final use of energy  The final energy intensity (final energy consumption divided by added value produced) of the Italian industrial sector from 1995 to 2016 was always below the European average. In energy intensity (-2.9%) was second only to that of Poland (-6.1%), which nevertheless recorded values that were particularly high compared with other European countries. For the services sector, there has been little variation since 2005. The average annual rate of increase for Italy has been low  around 0.1%. In 2015, Italy recorded the 8th highest energy intensity in relation to services, out of the 27 countries making up the European Union. The agriculture sector has achieved the highest levels of energy intensity out of the three economic sectors, and has shown a certain degree of stability at a national level, while a gradual reduction has been observed at a European level (down 2.3% on average each year from 2005 to 2015 for the EU28).  70.0% 65.0% 50.0% 55.0% 60.0% 45.0% 40.0% 35.0% % INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 252   ii. Current potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling34 -efficiency cogeneration (HEC) and efficient district heating and cooling, as required by Article 14 of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), the economic potential of HEC, based on current regulatory and market conditions, is equal to 49.1 TWh (4 224 ktoe) of useful heat. With respect to the total amount of useful heat produced via HEC in 2013 (the benchmark year for the assessment of potential increase carried out in accordance with the EED), which stood at 31.3 TWh (2 694 ktoe), the potential increase is estimated to be 17.8 TWh (1 529 ktoe). Of this increase in useful heat from HEC, 61% is linked to self-producing HEC power plants in the industrial sector (10.8 TWh), 32% from HEC power plants in the services sector (5.8 TWh), and 6% (1.2 TWh) from HEC power plants operated by energy utilities involved in district heating. The residential sector has no economic potential under the current market conditions and cost of the technologies.  A review of this potential is expected in the near future as part of the update under Directive 2012/27/EC (EED).

Projections considering existing energy efficiency policies, measures and programmes as described under point 1.2(ii) for primary and final energy consumption for each sector at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030)35  The following table gives the projections for Gross Inland Consumption (GIC)36and primary and final energy consumptions during the 2020-2040 period, under current policies. The energy consumptions are broken down by sector and by source. The table also gives the projections for consumptions for non-energy uses. The consumption projections show that, also under current policies, significant increases in energy efficiency will be achieved, highlighting a decoupling between the gross inland consumption (GIC) of primary energy and increases in GDP. The levels of energy consumption, which reached a peak in 2005, are characterised by a marked downturn that had already begun when the financial crisis hit. The drop in energy intensity (GIC/GDP) has continued, also thanks to the measures for promoting efficiency up to 2020: thereafter, this trend will no longer be guided by new policies or targets (apart from the ETS), but by market trends and inevitable technological improvements.                                                               35 This reference business as usual projection shall be the basis for the 2030 final and primary energy consumption target which is described in point 2.3 and conversion factors. 36 Non-energy uses fall under Gross Inland Consumption.

In terms of primary energy mix, natural gas will remain the main source in 2030. Conversely, the consumption of solid fuels and petroleum products will fall, with renewable sources being favoured instead. The year 2030 has been compared with the most recent year for which statistics are available, namely 2016, the values for which are given in the figure below. Figure 52  Comparison of the 2016 and 2030 primary energy mixes (base scenario)  At a sectoral level, conversely, the mix of final energy consumptions for 2030 is expected to remain practically the same as that of the most recent year for which statistics are available (2016).

Cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements resulting from national calculations, in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2010/31/EU   2002/91/EC), and the recast EPBD (Directive 2010/31/EU) introduced the principles for improving the energy performance of buildings. The recast EPBD required the Member States to define the minimum energy performance requirement for buildings on the basis of cost-optimal levels. To this end, the Directive introduced a method of comparative analysis for determining the reference requirements for national standards. The Delegated Regulation (EU) No 244/2012 and the subsequent Commission Guidelines of 19 April 2012 set out a methodology framework for calculating the optimal energy requirements of buildings, from both a technical and an economic point of view. The application in Italy of the method proposed by the Commission has made it possible to identify minimum energy performance requirements based on cost-optimal levels for new buildings and for existing buildings undergoing major or minor renovation of structures and installations. -optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements (Article 5 of Directive in August 2013 presented the results of these calculations and compared them with the requirements in force. Those assessments were then updated in 2018 by way of a new report that Italy submitted to the European Commission. From analysing the results obtained, it is possible to make general observations that principally relate to building envelopes, technical installations and the costs of the optimal configurations. The most extensive work on building envelopes (e.g. exterior insulation, replacing windows) is optimal only for new buildings and only in very few cases for existing ones, which were generally constructed between 1946 and 1976. In the other cases, the high costs arising mainly from the civil engineering work associated with construction have led to other interventions (installations) being favoured, or only those on horizontal components. The introduction of the scenario for not carrying out work on building envelopes (Level 1 for existing buildings) has also led to significantly less stringent transmittance values for existing INTEGRATED NATIONAL ENERGY AND CLIMATE PLAN  December 2019 257   buildings, thus bringing down, in many cases, the total cost of the work, in relation to that concerning new buildings of the same type.  Table 52  Comparison of transmittances  Intended use  Time of construction    Climatic zone  Uwall (W/m2k)  Uroof (W/m2k)  Ufloor (W/m2k)  Uw (W/m2k)  Residential New Milan (E) 0.27 0.18 0.17 3.27 Palermo (B) 1.50 0.28 0.29 3.20 Existing Milan (E) 0.40 0.23 0.32 3.28 Palermo (B) 0.80 0.31 0.49 3.95 Building for office use  New Milan (E) 0.36 0.30 0.30 1.10 Palermo (B) 1.50 0.46 0.56 5.00 Existing Milan (E) 0.17 0.32 0.29 2.90 Palermo (B) 1.04 1.03 0.30 4.45 Building for school use  Existing Milan (E) 0.80 0.20 0.29 3.70 Palermo (B) 0.35 0.26 0.42 3.80  The integral use of heat pumps for air conditioning (heating and cooling) and ACS (full electric building) is the optimal result only for newly constructed buildings of single-family residence and office type. In the other cases, the selected installation solution is always based on the integration of heat pumps, gas boilers (three-star condensing) and multi-split systems.  The installation of solar panels, which always features amongst the work identified for all types of buildings (these panels having an installed power of between 20 and 26 W/m2), has made it possible to achieve coverage levels of 50% to 70% for newly constructed residential buildings, and of 10% to 30% for existing ones. The coverage level for offices is not so high, amounting to between 40% and 50% for new buildings and between 15% and 20% for existing ones.  It is important to underline that, in order to fit solar panels on the various reference buildings in question, it has always been assumed that optimal levels of space and orientation will be available, with no consideration being given to any possible constraints or obstructions that are often actually present.  School buildings, which have a significantly different use profile compared with the other types, are the only types of building for which no provision has been made for the use of heat pumps, owing to the absence of any summer air-conditioning system. The heating and ACS system is in fact fully integrated within the single condensing boiler. For this type of building, the coverage of renewables, via solar power, is lower (around 20% of the total) and relates to around half of the energy requirements for lighting.  The costs associated with the optimal solutions identified vary greatly between new buildings and existing buildings, but the differences arising from the different climatic area in question are not as substantial.  The following table provides a summary of the costs and the average primary energy for each type of building and time of construction (new and existing).
