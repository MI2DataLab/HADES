        51  2.2 Dimension Energy efficiency (i) The elements set out in point (b) of Article 4 (1)The indicative national energy efficiency contribution to achieving the Union's energy efficiency target of at least 32,5 % in 2030 as referred to in Article 1(1) and Article 3(4) of Directive 2012/27/EU, based on either primary or final energy consumption, primary or final energy savings, or energy intensity; expressed in terms of absolute level of primary energy consumption and final energy consumption in 2020, and in terms of absolute level of primary energy consumption and final energy consumption in 2030, with an indicative trajectory for that contribution from 2021 onwards; including the underlying methodology and the conversion factors used) Reduction of energy consumption through increased energy efficiency and energy savings has been an important part of Danish energy policy since the 1970s, when the oil crisis first focused on security of supply and import dependence. In the meantime, climate change has also played a role in the desire to streamline and reduce energy consumption in Denmark. Denmark has therefore developed a great expertise in energy efficiency, which has made it possible to keep energy consumption largely unchanged in spite of significant economic growth over the last three decades. final energy in 2020 and 2030 corresponds to the energy consumption in the Danish Energy Agency's 2019 Energy and Climate Outlook published the 30th of August 2019. The primary energy contribution is the gross energy consumption excluding consumption for non-energy purposes. The consumption for non-energy purposes is also excluded in the final energy contribution.  The Danish Energy and Climate Outlook 2019 is based on a frozen policy scenario, where instruments and actions from the Energy Agreement from June 2018, from the energy policy agreement of March 2012 and subsequent adjustments are included. The Energy Agreement from June 2018 includes new energy efficiency measures in the period 2021-2024. In 2024 a stocking will take place and the need for new measures will be evaluated.  The Danish Energy Agency's Energy and Climate Outlook is based on a number of overall economic assumptions (the production of the companies, private consumption, fuel prices, etc.), a number of technology-specific assumptions (the cost of different types of installations, their efficiency, etc.) and assumptions as to what the energy market players will do when acting on market terms.  More information about the methodology and the assumption used in the Outlook are available at the Dhttps://ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/Analyser/deco19.pdf          52  Table 4: Indicative contribution 2020 and 2030.  2020 2030  PJ Mtoe PJ Mtoe Primary energy 733,5 17,52 767,4 18,33 Final energy 635,1 15,17 660,9 15,78 Note: Consumption for non-energy purposes is not included.

The data will be updated after the adoptation of the forthcoming climate action plan. The reasons for the increased consumption especially for final energy after 2020 are primarily:   Increased activities (economic growth) in the different sectors   The establishment of several new big datacentres in Denmark. In the outlook these are consuming 25 PJ (0,60 Mtoe) of electricity in 2030 equal to 15 % of the total electricity consumption in 2030. Without the increased consumption from the new datacentres, the final energy consumption would be almost stable from 2020 to 2030.  No specific new energy efficiency measures for the period 2025-2030 exist as The Energy Agreement from June 2018 only covers the period of 2021-2024. The Danish Government has committed itself to an ambitious climate policy, which aims to e gases by 70% in 2030, relative to 1990 levels. The measures and instruments for reaching this goal will be outlined in the climate action plans. The upcoming climate action plan will amongst other things include energy efficiency measures, including energy saving requirements for all public sector buildings and a         53  national strategy for sustainable construction. Moreover, the Government is working on a plan for the implementation of article 5 in EED in the period 2021-2030. In addition, the Government will work to increase the electrification of the transport sector to ensure significantly more electric vehicles on the roads. These initiatives will thus increase   (2) Cumulative amount of end use energy savings to be achieved over the period 2021-2030 under point (b) of Article 7(i) on the energy saving obligations of Directive 2012/27/EU  The cumulative amount of end use energy savings to be achieved over the period 2021-2030 shall be based on the final energy consumption (excluding consumption for non-energy purposes) in 2016, 2017 and 2018. The calculation is based on Eurostat-data (final energy consumption Europe 2020-2030) for 2016 and 2017 and estimated data for 2018. This data from Eurostat do not include ambient heat. The data is shown in Table 6.

The existing measures to support energy renovation of existing buildings are:  Taxes on energy use for heating of buildings  Requirements in the building code  Energy Performance certificate for buildings  A new support scheme in 2021-2024 for energy renovation of existing buildings  Subsidy scheme to replace oil burners with heat pumps in buildings outside the district heating and gas grids  Information activities  Data and digitalisation   The building job scheme The indicative milestones of the long-term strategy for the renovation of the national stock of buildings and the roadmap with domestically established indicators will be outlined in the upcoming climate action plan. The climate action plan will amongst other things include energy efficiency measures, including energy saving requirements for all public sector buildings. (4) The total floor area to be renovated or equivalent annual energy savings to be achieved from 2021 to 2030 under Article 5 of Directive 2012/27/EU on the exemplary role of public bodies' buildings  Denmark is currently implementing EED, article 5 in accordance with the alternative approach. The ministries obligated under the existing Ministerial Order are bound by an energy savings target, but are at liberty to pursue the instruments which are most cost effective in their particular circumstances, including deep renovations, behavioural measures etc. The Government is working on a plan for energy efficiency in government buildings in 2021-2030, including a model for implementing the requirements in EED, art. 5.  (ii)The indicative milestones for 2030, 2040 and 2050, the domestically established measurable progress indicators, an evidence-based estimate of expected energy savings and wider benefits, and their contributions to the Union's energy efficiency targets as included in the roadmaps set out in the long-term renovation strategies for the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 2010/31/EU See point 3 above.
