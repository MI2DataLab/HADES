2.5. Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness 2.5.1.1. i. National objectives and funding targets for public and, where available, private research and innovation relating to the Energy Union, including, where appropriate, a timeframe for when the objectives are to be met The National Board for Research and Innovation has issued in May 2019 the Cyprus Strategy Framework for Research and Innovation 2019  current strategic framework adopts the following vision: Cyprus to become a dynamic and competitive economy, driven by research, scientific excellence, innovation, technological development and entrepreneurship, and a regional hub in these fundamental areas strategic framework revolves around nine (9) pillars and enablers of strategic importance, as presented in the following diagram. The strategy framework will be put into action through a first set of policy measures and activities targeting the aforementioned strategic pillars and enablers, aiming to kick-start this reform and to facilitate a strong boost of the research and innovation ecosystem. The nine pillars and enablers of the R&I strategy are depicted in Figure 2.1337. The governance enabler (SE.1 in the above diagram) has been materialized through the Council of Ministers decision of the 9th of October 2018 (Decision No. 85.883), which has set a new national Governance System of R&I. Among other things the decision: 1. Establishes the National Board for Research and Innovation (NBRI), succeeding the National Committee for Research and Innovation, 2. Establishes the institution of the Chief Scientist and R&I coordinators in every ministry, 3. Authorizes the Minister of Finance to take all necessary steps to modify the Research Promotion Foundation (currently Research & Innovation Foundation) statute to appoint the Chief Scientist ex-officio as President. The Research & Innovation Foundation statute should also be formulated, where needed, to reflect new developments in the research and innovation governance system and the role of the Foundation as the executive arm of the Government on research and innovation issues. The new R&I Governance system is depicted in Figure 2.1438.                                                            37  Cyprus Research and Innovation Strategy 2019   38  Cyprus Research and Innovation Strategy 2019   96     Figure 2.13: The nine pillars and enablers of the R&I national strategy   Figure 2.14: National R&I Governance System 97  For this purpose, an implementation roadmap is designed for the initial period of 2019-2021. Each policy measure is subject to agile implementation and enhancement along the way, in collaboration with stakeholders involved so that to ensure efficient delivery and maximization of impact. Moreover, the roadmap will be updated and further enhanced according to progress and developments in the national R&I ecosystem, as well as with the support of further case-studies and the elaboration of a detailed R&I strategy.

Table 2.18: Breakdown of the national R&D expenditure for 2016 and 2017 and how is projected to be in 2023  Considering the abovementioned, as well as the investments that have to be done up to 2030 to reach national targets, annual spending in research and innovation related to energy  Energy and water resource efficiency, as well as mitigation of climate change are among the Thus, the objective in R&I in energy and climate is the best possible production of research work and innovative products and services that will help increase energy efficiency, energy                                                            39  Cyprus Research and Innovation Strategy 2019   98  security, and renewable energy and tackle climate change. At the same time R&I must add value to businesses and provide useful insights for policy makers.  Smart specialization has been addressed during the period 2015-2020 through the Smart Specialization Strategy for Cyprus (S3CY)40, issued in March 2015. S3CY prioritized domains, areas and economic activities where the country was identified to have a competitive advantage or the potential to generate knowledge-driven growth through investments in R&I (including investments co-financed by European Structural and Investment Funds), thus upgrading its competitiveness. Energy was identified as the main priority along with tourism.  More specifically S3CY identified the following priority areas in the energy sector:  Development or improvement of RES technologies and Storage o A.1 Solar energy  o A.2 Solar heating and cooling technologies o A.3 Wind energy  B. Innovative applications in RES  o B.1 Solar thermal technologies  o B.2 Photovoltaics o B.3 Innovative applications in RES (tourism, agriculture, farming etc.)   C. Development of hydrocarbons  o C.1 Storage of natural gas o C.2 Use of natural gas  D. Energy use  Energy saving o D.1 Development of innovative and cost-effective technologies to optimize energy use in new and existing buildings o D.2 ICT for monitoring energy consumption and for improving energy efficiency in urban environment and transport o D.3 Energy transmission and distribution networks The above priorities are in line with the European Strategic Energy and Technology Plan (SET -Plan) targets and objectives. More details regarding the participation of Cyprus in SET-Plan are provided paragraph 3.5 (ii). The design of funding Programs for the support of R&I during the period 2015-2020 of the RESTART 2016-2020 framework Program announced by the Research & Innovation Foundation and the program supporting innovative entrepreneurship announced by the MECI was based on the S3CY recommendations.  Taking into consideration the new developments in the national R&I ecosystem (including new and emerging technologies, companies and sectors of the economy), the new R&I governance system, as well as the requirements of the European Structural Investment Fund (ESIF) for the new programming period 2021-2027, an updated Smart Specialization Strategy                                                            40  99  is required. This is scheduled to start in April 2019 and be completed by June 202041. Energy and climate in this context should be repositioned.  In the framework of NECP, a Working Group for Research, Innovation and Competitiveness was formed consisting of stakeholders from the public sector, the private sector and academia and is operating as a consultation forum to identify priority Source: National Board  Cyprus Research and Innovation Strategy 2019   areas of research and innovation that correspond to the national targets for decarbonisation. The Working Group took into account the SET-Plan deliberations, the Cyprus Smart Specialization Strategy, the feedback from the other Working Groups of NECP and the strengths of Cyprus related to the global market of research and innovation.  This effort was backed by the national network of Climate  KIC which has done a series of interviews and an interactive, facilitated workshop, to identify and map the needs of the various stakeholders in terms of R&I. The interviews and workshop followed a semi-structured format in which stakeholders were invited to discuss the NECP targets, the challenges faced by their respective sectors in achieving the targets (challenges included technical/technological, social, regulatory, resource needs etc.), and the role of R&I in helping meet the NECP targets. The results are indicated in Table 2.19. The detailed feedback obtained can be found in Appendix 7. The stakeholders engagement process and consultation is ongoing, and through a continual meaningful elicitation of needs, the R&I targets which underpin the NECP are being shaped and will be regularly updated (see section 3.5).

Where available, national 2050 objectives related to the promotion of clean energy technologies and, where appropriate, national objectives, including long-term targets (2050) for deployment of low-carbon technologies, including for decarbonising energy and carbon-intensive industrial sectors and, where applicable, for related carbon transport and storage infrastructure This envisaged scenario for 2050 ( Figure 2.15) shows that Cyprus will become an exporting country in electricity generation mainly produced from solar energy. At the same time, gas will be available for backup purposes and for security of energy supply. From the preliminary results of the model, it appears that in addition to photovoltaics, other technologies such as concentrated solar thermal systems will contribute to the dominance of RES in the energy system. However, it has been noted that emerging technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture and storage have not been considered in the above scenario due to the lack of available data. Nevertheless, the high penetration of RES will enable electrification of the transport sector and process heat which will benefit hard to decarbonize sectors like cement and brickworks industry. This scenario provides an indication on how clean energy technologies should develop to best cater for the energy transformation needs of the country. Some of them, like solar thermal technologies and photovoltaics are already within the priorities of Smart Specialization Strategy, but other technologies that will play an important role in the long-term, like electrification of transport, storage and decarbonised process heat are not sufficiently addressed. These are factors that need to be considered in updating the Smart Specialisation Strategy mentioned above. 101  2.5.1.3. iii. Where applicable, national objectives with regard to competitiveness Dependence on the import of petroleum products and extremely low performance in terms of endogenous energy sources create a framework of reduced security in the continuous supply of energy, and exposure of the economy to fluctuations of global oil price. The high cost of supplying petroleum products significantly increases the cost of energy production. Thus, energy costs are passed on to electricity-consumers with adverse social impacts and act as a brake on growth, as it negatively affects the competitiveness of products and services. Additionally, the Cyprus electricity grid has no energy interconnections with other countries. Isolation of the grid, and seasonality of demand caused by tourist industry, poses unfavourable conditions to ensure adequate reserve power generation capacity.   Figure 2.15: Envisaged scenario of the national energy mix up to 2055 Responding to the challenges is the decoupling of economic activity from the use of fossil fuels by increasing energy efficiency first and then maximizing the use of RES. Development of innovative technologies and energy saving systems in the built environment, transport and industry will contribute towards this goal. The Comprehensive Impact Assessment has shown that additional investments to realise the PPM scenario (which can come from private, national and EU Funds) are entirely feasible for the standards of the Cypriot economy and will pay off because fuel import costs throughout the lifetime of these measures can decline considerably with an increase in national GDP and employment of about 0.3% compared to the WEM scenario. Successful implementation of the package of PPM requires significant investments for energy renovations in buildings and industry and  most importantly  a substantial commitment to promote public transport 102  and non-motorised transport modes (walking and cycling) as well as a shift to electric cars. Table 2.20 shows the cumulative additional investment needs in the period 2020-2030 to implement the PPM scenario without the EuroAsia Interconnector, in comparison to the WEM scenario and Table 2.21 shows the annual total economic output (in million  persons) associated with the investments for the period 2021-2030.

The above-mentioned vision is addressed by six strategic pillars:  1. Infrastructure for Sustainable Development / Production. 2. Improvement of Industrial / Business Environment. 3. Digitization of Industry. 4. Developing New Skills and Enhancing / Upgrading Existing Skills. 5. Enhance Access to Financing. 6. Enhance Market Access / Extraversion, Exports and Investments. Through the implementation of the six strategic pillars the aim is to overcome the main challenges faced by the industry. According to the New Industrial Policy one of these duction costs and more generally increased supply chain costs due to small market size, insularity of the economy and geographical and energy "isolation", limited resources, low the ability to innovate, the inadequate utilization and implementation of quality standards, the lack of a                                                             42  2030  Action Plan for the Period 2019 -  103  Achieving Sustainable Development and Production is foreseen through the creation of appropriate infrastructures and projects, institutions and mechanisms, business models, cyclic production processes and alternative energy systems. In the epicentre of developing the appropriate infrastructure for industry is improving energy efficiency, integration of RES and R&I. A list of actions is adopted to promote energy efficiency and RES in industry within the timeframe of 2019  2022 (see paragraph 3.5i). 104  Table 2.21: vestments for the period 2021-2030   2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030  Total economic output With Existing Measures  59.038 60.610 62.119 63.553 64.916 66.380 67.944 69.464 71.037 72.514 With Planned Policies and Measures  without electricity interconnection  59.187 60.756 62.261 63.691 65.047 66.510 68.060 69.646 71.257 72.725 Difference between Scenarios 0,25% 0,24% 0,23% 0,22% 0,20% 0,19% 0,17% 0,26% 0,31% 0,29%  Total employment With Existing Measures  477.810 490.408 502.484 513.952 524.825 536.458 548.936 560.590 572.776 584.814 With Planned Policies and Measures without electricity interconnection  479.173 491.684 503.675 515.089 525.884 537.489 549.866 562.166 574.636 586.502 Difference between Scenarios 0,29% 0,26% 0,24% 0,22% 0,20% 0,19% 0,17% 0,28% 0,32% 0,29%
