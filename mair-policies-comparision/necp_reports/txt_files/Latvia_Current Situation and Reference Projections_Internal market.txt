2.5. Internal energy market  2.5.1. Electricity interconnectivity 2.5.1.1. Current interconnection level and main interconnections The wholesale price of electricity at the electricity stock exchange is affected not only by scheduled and unscheduled repair works in the transmission network, but also scheduled and unscheduled repaired works at power plants, as well the availability of hydro resources in Scandinavian countries and in Latvia.  It is important to mention the total net capacity of the transmission network (NTC), which is 1,000 MW for the Latvian and Estonian interconnection (in the direction from EE to LV). It should be added that this is one of interconnections, where overload is observed. In turn, the capacity of the Lithuanian and Latvian interconnection (in the direction from LV to LT) is 1,234 MW.  The latest interconnections  the NordBalt submarine power cable between Lithuania and Sweden with a total capacity of 700 MW and the LitPol-link interconnection between Lithuania and Poland with a total capacity of 500 MW  increase the total interconnection capacity of the energy system of the Baltic States with other EU countries from the previous 1,000 MW to 2,200 MW. Table 8.

The amount of electricity imported from third countries in 2018 was 2,558,187 MWh, which was by 229 % more in comparison with 2017 (776,395 MWh). In accordance with the NPS information, in 2018 Sweden exported 2,930,002 MWh to Lithuania through the NordBalt cable, while Poland exported 721,839 MWh through LitPol-link. The average transfer capacity of the NordBalt cable was                                                       79  80 LV-Latvian bidding area, LT-Lithuanian bidding area, EE-Estonian bidding area, FI-Finnish bidding area, SE4-Fourth Swedish bidding area, LBI-Lithuanian-Belorussian import bidding area 81 Transfer capacity = total monthly commercial flow kWh / total monthly net transfer capacity kWh (NTC). 82 Nord Pool Spot is a Nordic electricity stock exchange, where the electricity price for the Latvian bidding area based on market principles 55  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 60 % in 2018, which was a reduction of 3 percentage points compared to 2017. The average transfer capacity of the LitPol-Link interconnection in the direction from Poland to Lithuania was 29 %, which was an increase of 7 percentage points compared to the previous year. In turn, the transfer capacity of LitPol-Link from Lithuania to Poland was 39 %, which was a reduction of 8 percentage points compared to the previous year. In 2018, the transfer capacity of the Estonia  Latvia interconnection was 56 %, which was a reduction of 2 percentage points compared to the previous year. The highest recorded monthly transfer capacity of the Estonian  Latvian interconnection was 79.4 % (September), but at the time, when Latvia had enough local production and less demand for electricity imports from Estonia, the transfer capacity of the interconnection reduced to 38.5 % (December) on average of the net transmission capacity available. The total net transmission capacity was 6,689,093 MWh in 2018. In the Latvian electricity system, there are no grid overloads, which would restrict free access to the electricity system, so any producer of electricity who has concluded an electricity sales contract has access to the electricity system without restrictions, and this access is guaranteed. All the generated electricity, regardless of the method of its acquisition, is provided with equal opportunities to access the grid. 2.5.1.2. Fulfilment of the interconnection capacity expansion requirements According to the EC, the electricity interconnectivity level of Latvia (forming part of the Baltic countries) in 2017 was 23.7 %. The interconnection level for Latvia in 2018 was calculated using several formulae and without taking into account interconnection capacities with third countries (only ES DV interconnection capacities)83: a) ratio of the incoming (import) interconnection capacity (total) to peak capacity (demand); b) ratio of the outgoing (export) interconnection capacity (total) to peak capacity (demand); c) ratio of the incoming (import) interconnection capacity (total) and installed RES capacity; d) ratio of the outgoing (export) interconnection capacity (total) and installed RES capacity; e) ratio of the incoming (import) interconnection capacity (between LV and other EU MS) to peak capacity (demand); f) ratio of the outgoing (export) interconnection capacity (between LV and other EU MS) to peak capacity (demand); g) ratio of the incoming (import) interconnection capacity (between LV and other EU MS) and installed RES capacity; h) ratio of the outgoing (export) interconnection capacity (between LV and other EU MS) to installed RES capacity.

The scheduled desynchronization from the BRELL network in 2025 means the transfer capability to Russia/Belarus/Kaliningrad is set at 0 MW for 2030.   Figure 26. Electricity interconnectivity level of Latvia in 2018 Taking into account interconnection capacities of the Baltic States with other EU MS, it can be concluded that the level of the LV interconnection exceeds 85 % in all indicators. Furthermore, if we take into account only Latvian interconnection capacities with other EU MS (Estonia and Lithuania), then the interconnection level in Latvia in the lowest indicator (ratio of import interconnection capacity and RES capacity installed) is 49 %, so Latvia should give thought to how it can improve this indicator to the 60 % recommended by the EC84. Latvia is planning to improve this indicator with the Latvia  Estonia third interconnection project (330V electricity transmission high-voltage line among substations in Estonia and Latvia) implementing the project until 2020. In this way, it intends to increase the maximum                                                       84 The EC group of interconnection experts recommends MS with <30 % in any of the indicators to urgently study additional capabilities of interconnections and report on an annual basis to high-level regional groups and the Infrastructure Forum on the results of such a research. Any project helping MS to reach the threshold of 30 % should be submitted for inclusion in the Ten-Year Network Development Plan and later PCI lists. MS with >30 %but <60 % in any of the indicators are asked to study and develop additional interconnection projects. Such projects will have to consider the possibility of applying for inclusion in TYNDP and later PCI lists. 57  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 transfer capability of the Latvian-Estonian cross-section in the direction to Estonia by 500 MW and in the direction of Latvia by 600 MW.

Development of the Baltic interconnection capacity with the European electricity system (MW) 2.5.2. Energy transmission infrastructure 2.5.2.1. Key characteristics of the existing transmission infrastructure for electricity and gas The main features of the transmission network are the number of step-down substations and high voltage distribution points in a specific territory, which are in turn characterised by the specific demand for electricity capacity there, and a relevant network of transmission lines (330 kV and 110 kV), which meets energy supply security and cost-effectiveness criteria. Based on these criteria the transmission network is rated as close to optimal with a potential for development. The electricity transmission network currently consists of 330 kV lines with a total length of 1,346.43 km and 110 kV lines with a total length of 3,893.54 km, 25,330 kV transformers, and 248,110 kV transformers with the total installed capacity of 9,020.5 MVA. To making servicing of the transmission network more efficient, operational organisation units are broken down based according to the territorial principle into:  13 groups of substations  for operation of 330/110 kV substations and distribution points  Salaspils, Krustpils, Daugavpils,  Right bank and Left bank, with one base substation in each group;  6 line districts  for operation of 330/110 kV transmission power lines  Riga district, Krustpils district. The 330 kV network of the Latvian energy system is a middle stage of the energy system of the Baltic countries between its northern and southern parts. There is double-way feed in all 330 kV substations, except Daugavpils. The 110 kV network has a ring schematic. Most of 110 kV substations have two transformers and double-way feed. 58  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00  Key reads, left to right, top to bottom: 330 kV line 110 kV line 330 kV cable line 110 kV cable line 330 kV substation 110 kV substation 110 kV substation managed by other legal entities HPP WPP Figure 28. Schematic of Latvian 330 kV and 110 kV electrical networks85 The natural gas transmission system of Latvia is connected to the natural gas transmission systems of three neighbouring countries: Estonia, Russia and Lithuania. The connection with Estonia technically allows natural gas to flow only from Latvia to Estonia, while the connections with Lithuania and Russia allow such flows in both directions. The overall annual load of all natural gas interconnections is low and does not even reach 50 % of the theoretically available capacity; however, at certain times of demand, natural gas transmission system interconnection capacities may reach 100 % of available capacity.

The main natural gas supply route for consumers of Latvia are long-distance gas pipeline networks from the YamalEurope natural gas pipeline in the Tver Oblast in Russia via Saint Petersburg and Pskov to Estonia and Latvia. In general, the long-distance natural gas pipeline networks in the Baltic States are well developed and their capacity to ensure ion its use: for example, the connection between the Estonian and Latvian natural gas systems does not ensure the physical transfer of natural gas from Estonia to Latvia due to the lack of required equipment (but there are virtual bidding point transactions), while the capacity of the transmission connections of Lithuania and Latvia is insufficient to cover peak .

Along with the opening of Klaipeda Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal, however, there is physical access to natural gas not only from Russia but also from other countries.

Projections of network expansion requirements In order to ensure the safe operation of the Latvian electricity system and the effective functioning of the electricity market, and in order to prevent the ageing of equipment, the Latvian TSO is reconstructing and modernising high voltage substations and electricity distribution points, and , in the light of development trends in electricity systems in both Latvia and neighbouring countries, is evaluating and deciding on the development of the Latvian electricity transmission system interconnection, as well as on the need to reinforce and modernise the internal network. The electricity transmission network is developed in accordance with the Latvian electricity transmission system development plan87 and the -Year Network Development Plan88.  Between 2020 and 2029, the following projects are to be implemented for the development of the Latvian and Baltic electricity network:  Third electricity interconnection between Latvia and Estonia;  -2    Reconstruction of existing Estonia  Latvia 330 kV interconnections;  Synchronisation of the Baltic States with European transmission networks and decoupling from the Russian united electricity system.  Figure 30. Projects of the Baltic States according to the development plans of the TSOs of the Baltic States Gas supply systems of the Baltic States are not connected to the single EU natural gas transmission network. In order to remedy this situation, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of (17 April 2013 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure and repealing Decision No 1364/2006/EC and                                                       87 http://www.ast.lv/content/elektroenergijas-parvades-sistemas-attistibas-plans 88 http://tyndp.entsoe.eu/ 61  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 amending Regulations (EC) No 713/2009, (EC) No 714/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009, the Eastern Baltic Region has been defined  In the period from 2020 to 2029, the following projects are to be implemented for the development of the Latvian and Baltic natural gas network:  Construction of the Estonia  Latvia interconnection (Balticconector) (will come into operation on 1 January 2020);  Improvement of the Latvia  Estonia interconnection (Karksi) (the project will be completed in 2020);  Improvement of operations of the I2025);  Improvement of the Latvia  Lithuania interconnection (the project will be completed by 2023);  Construction of the Poland  Lithuania interconnection (GIPL) (the project will be completed by 2022).  Figure 31. Natural gas infrastructure projects planned in the Baltics89 2.5.3. Electricity and gas markets, and energy prices 2.5.3.1. Current situation of electricity and gas markets Latvianatural gas consumption is about 1.4 billion m3, while a reduction in consumption has been observed in the last ten years (consumption was 1.66 billion m3 in 2008). The reduction of the Latvian natural gas market has several objective and positive reasons  different energy efficiency measures, including modernisation of boiler houses and reduced losses in energy supply, especially heating, as well as diversification of energy sources, namely, successful use of local RES (for example, an increase in the share of woodchips), for example, in heating. This alsenergy imports. The potential benefit of a regional market for Latvia is its geographic location, which creates opportunities for natural gas transit from south to north, as well as the technica                                                       89 http://www.conexus.lv/uploads/filedir/pso_zinojums_2018.pdf 62  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 lectricity consumption is 7.4 TWh. There have been changes in the structure of total consumption of energy sources in recent years  as consumption of natural gas decreases in the processing sector, the share of RES in total consumption of energy sources increases due to the increase in produced electricity in hydropower plants and wind power plants90. At the same time, amounts of generated RES electricity fluctuate according to external factors. High rainfall and an associated high inflow of water into the river Daugava in 2017, the consumption of RES energy increased by 5.6 %, while under filled reservoirs and low water levels in water bodies, including the Daugava, were characteristic of an unusually dry and hot summer period in 2018. Therefore, HEP generation fell by 43.6 % in 2018. Thus, in 2018, most of electricity generated locally (37 % of final consumption) was produced in the processing sector (62 %), namely at cogeneration plants, and the remainder (38 %) in HPPs and WPPs (9.2 PJ). 2.5.3.2. Present situation in energy prices In 2017, a considerable drop in electricity prices was observed in Latvia 3.91 % compared to the average price in 2016, making the average electricity price in 2017 34.68 EUR/MWh. The price reduction in Latvia was mainly the result of the first full year of operation of Nord Balt (after the testing period). It significantly reduced the amount of unplanned outages and maintenance, which in turn allowed wholesale prices of electricity in the Latvian bidding area to move closer to the level of wholesale prices in the Nordic countries. Meanwhile, in 2018, the average stock exchange price of electricity in the Latvian bidding region increased by 43.9 %, rising to 49.90 EUR/MWh.   Figure 32. Electricity costs for a household consuming 200 kWh a month91 The cost items forming the final electricity tariff in the consumption group with 200 kWh per month for household users show that the fixed connection fee created the biggest difference in costs, thus demonstrating the importance of an effective connection, which has been particularly emphasised in recent years. Also if consumption of a household is, for example, only 200 kWh per month, then it would be unwise to have a 3-phase connection with 40 ampere capacity, which not only promotes maintenance of impractical capacity, but                                                       90 CSB 91 The calculation is based on the average Nord Pool electricity price  EUR 0.0348/kWh 63  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 also increases consumer costs by 60 %. Since 2016, the tariffs of services of the distribution connection should also be paid by electricity users  who do not consume electricity, making all users pay a tariff consisting of a fixed fee for a connection and a variable price depending on electricity consumption. This is a major contribution to the efficient use of the electricity network, because electricity users have conducted evaluations of their connection capacities and have reduced their capacity if necessary, thus optimising their electricity costs.  The average price households in Latvia paid for natural gas in 2013-2017 was EUR 0.0456/kWh, which is slightly more than in Estonia but less than in Lithuania and EU overall with an average sales price during that period of EUR 0.0659/kWh.  Wholesale prices of natural gas apply to system users that consume more than 25,000 m3 of natural gas a year. Natural gas prices for large non-household consumers in Latvia are generally lower than the EU average. The average price the large consumers in Latvia paid for natural gas in the period from 2013 to 2017 was EUR 0.0456/kWh, which is slightly more than in Estonia (EUR 0.0433/kWh) but less than in Lithuania (EUR 0.0469/kWh) and EU overall with the average wholesale price in the period from 2013 to 2017 of EUR 0.0659/kWh.   Key reads: EU, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania  Figure 33. Changes in the price of natural gas for non-household consumers, EUR per kWh (bi-annual)92 Latvia closed 2017 with one of the lowest wholesale prices of natural gas in the EU, at EUR 17.11 per megawatt hour (in Q4 2017), which was the lowest price across the Baltic Sea region93. However, the average sales price of natural gas in 2017 was EUR 2.60/MWh higher than in 2016 (14.51 EUR/MWh). The wholesale price of natural gas on the German market area Gaspool in August 2018 was EUR 5.20/MWh higher than in August 2017, while on the Dutch trading point Title Transfer Facility (TTF) the price increased by EUR 4.73/MWh. In                                                       92 http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database 93https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/quarterly_report_on_european_gas_markets_q4_2017_final_20180323.pdf 64  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 2018, the wholesale price of natural gas continued to gradually grow until November, where the highest wholesale price of 2018  EUR 26.29 per megawatt hour  was reached. Contrary to projections, a decline has since started and in September 2019 the average Gaspool wholesale price was EUR 9.64 per megawatt hour.  Key reads: Consumption up to 100 MWh, consumpion up to 2500 MWh, consumption up to 55 000 MWh Figure 34. Indicative average sales prices of natural gas and price ranges in procurements for legal persons94  2.5.3.3. Development projections Since the electricity consumed in Latvia is purchased from the Nord Pool wholesale market, the electricity market of the Baltic States and Nordic countries is highly developed. In 2018, the electricity price in Nordic States and the Baltic States rose significantly within the space of a year along with the overall global increase of energy prices (oil, natural gas, coal) and the increase of the emission allowance price. Since 2017 the prices have increased by 88 % in the Nordic countries, by 52 % in Estonia, and by 58 % in Latvia. Although the electricity price continued to increase in January 2019, a decline has been observed since February both compared to the previous year and the previous month, relative to the reduction in prices of natural gas and coal. The market price of electricity may well remain at the same level in 2020. However, this will depend on the weather conditions in both the Scandinavian countries and Latvia. TSO has developed an electricity and electric power balance projection, as well as an electricity consumption projection with at least three scenarios95. The wholesale price of natural gas in future will depend on many interrelated factors, including fluctuations of natural gas wholesale prices on exchanges and geopolitical developments around the world.  2.5.4. Energy poverty and energy availability ines energy poverty is a special type of poverty related to a number of adverse effects on human health and well-being, e.g. respiratory and                                                       94 https://www.iub.gov.lv/lv/iubsearch/q/dabasg%C4%81ze/ 95 http://www.ast.lv/sites/default/files/editor/PSO_Zinojums_2018.pdf 65  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 heart disease and mental health influenced by low temperatures and stress related to gas, heating, and electricity bills that people cannot pay. Energy poverty has an indirect impact on various quality-of-life indicators defining the well-being of households and people, including health, environment, and productivity96. Furthermore, the European Economic and Social Committee has defined energy policy as finding it difficult or impossible to ensure adequate heating in the dwelling and to access other essential energy services at a document and laws as of yet. In order to evaluate the scope of energy poverty, the Energy Poverty Observatory proposes reviewing a number of indicators  the share of households having utility bill debts; the share of households whose absolute energy consumption is less than half of the average indicator for that country; the share of households whose share of energy consumption in income is twice as high as the national average; the share of households that could not afford heating due to lack of money. Presently, the latest statistical data are available only for  In 2017, lack of money meant that heating was unavailable for 9.7 % of dwellings EU  7.8 %) of inhabitants or 11.6 % of all households, but in 2018 this indicator had fallen to 7.5 % (EU  8 %) of the Latvian inhabitants or 9.8 % of all Latvian households97. This indicator has generally improved since 2005, though it significantly worsened in the period from 2009 to 2013 due to the global economic downturn. This share in Latvia is a special problem of a social nature, in particular for the households living in social houses/apartments. In 2018, 15.7 % of the population were living below the poverty threshold  and 18.4 % of households below the poverty threshold could not afford heating98. Moreover, the situation is different if certain types of households are analysed  some types of households differ considerably from the EU-28 figure.  Table 10. Households that could not afford heating due to lack of money (%)99  1-person households  (of all inhabitants) 1-person households (AROP100) 1-person households >65y.

The support in addressing housing issues shows the number of recipients of the housing allowance, the average amount of the housing allowance, and the resources spent for this purpose. Housing allowance was granted to 93 700 inhabitants (4.8 % of the total population) in 2017 and to 83 00 inhabitants (4.3 % of the total population) in 2018.

The municipalities spent EUR 16.5 million on housing allowances in 2017, and EUR 14.0 million in 2018. project101 situation in Latvia is evaluated, the energy poverty definition is being developed, including development of energy poverty criteria for Latvia, and, based on the developed criteria, the social groups at risk of energy poverty are identified. This project is expected to end in 2021, and its results will be incorporated into the updated  plan of 2022-2023. Similarly, the Latvian Association for Protection of Consumer Interests in cooperation with the Jelgava Real Estate Administration participates in the international project STEP, which defined energy poverty criteria based on the experiences of other countries, and solutions for prevention of energy poverty are being sought.  The approach to prevention of energy poverty in Latvia mainly focuses on social policy. When necessary, municipalities should ensure the minimum level of income for all households, and they may also provide a housing allowance to all households, which includes costs of electricity and heating. Moreover, central government provides financial support to individual vulnerable population groups to allow them to pay for electricity. Poor households may benefit from some general energy policies. EEOS stipulates that electricity suppliers should reach a known energy saving by informing consumers about measure is an agreement signed by different stakeholders in the public and private sector to promote energy renewal in cooperation and provision of information to households.  2.5.5. Current division of price components  PUC observes the basic principle defined in the Law on regulators of public utilities when determining the tariff for natural gas supply services: the tariffs should be determined such that the tariff payments made by the users are economically justified costs of service provision and ensure profitability of public services. The draft tariff includes only the costs applying to the provision of the specific service and that are economically justified. PUC determines the methodology for calculation of natural gas transmission, storage, distribution services and the natural gas transmission service tariff, the natural gas storage service tariff and the natural gas distribution system service tariff are determined in accordance with it.                                                       101https://www.em.gov.lv/lv/nozares_politika/valsts_petijumu_programma__energetika_/konkurss__ilgtspejiga_energetikas_infrastruktura_un_tirgus_/ 67  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00  Figure 35. Division of price components for the final natural gas consumer102 The wholesale price of electricity is one of the components in the final electricity price, where the final price also included transmission and distribution system service, MPC and VAT. The costs (tariffs) of services of the transmission system operator and the distribution system operator in Latvia are approved by PUC. The transmission service and the distribution service is only one of the items in the bill and is determined using a differentiated tariff. The tariff (distribution and transmission services) may consist of: fees for delivery of electricity; fees for provision of electricity; fees for the current of the input-output device; fees for permitted load.

Division of price components for the final electricity consumer103 In the heat supply sector, regulated services include the production of thermal energy, the transmission and distribution of thermal energy, and the trading of thermal energy. Trading of thermal energy is regulated up to the so-with the user, usually the point of entry of the heating network into the building. The use of thermal energy in a building is not a regulated service. The thermal energy supply service is regulated if the total volume of thermal energy is more than 5000 MWh/year. However, small heat supply systems are not regulated to avoid any additional administrative burden on heat supply undertakings and thus not to increase heat supply and tariffs.

Costs of service provision that are necessary to provide the service depend on these conditions. Most of the total final tariff of thermal energy consist of fuel costs or costs of                                                       103  104 Source: PUC The image does not reflect real proportions, but demonstrates the scope of impact of tariff components 69  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 purchased thermal energy and fixed costs, which include payment for work, depreciation of fixed assets and other costs. Other costs are comparatively small. Final prices of fuel in all EU Member States are built based on a similar principle, where the price consists of three basic components  fuel purchase price, state duty and taxes, foreign currency fluctuations, geopolitical situation, climatic situation, quality requirements, as well as demand. State duties and taxes include excise duty, state duty for maintenance of admixtures, company maintenance and development costs, they include maintenance of the filling stations and personnel costs. 2.5.6. Description of energy subsidies According to the information provided by the EC energy subsidies are:  Tax expenses (exceptions and reductions, tax credits);  Direct transfers (grants, soft loans);  Indirect transfers (capacity mechanisms). 2.5.6.1. Tax and duty expenses Excise duty The purpose of the excise duty is to restrict consumption of goods, which are harmful for the environment and human health. Presently, excise duty applies to petroleum products and natural gas. Excise duty does not apply to coal and other fossil fuels, as well as peat. At the same time, natural resources tax should be paid for fuel. Presently, different excise duty rates apply to petroleum products and natural gas depending on the purpose of their use. Table 11.

Value added tax Reduced VAT rate (12 %) applies to individual coke fuel deliveries, if its actual consumer is an inhabitants, who purchases and consumes coke heating fuel for the needs of a household, and to delivery of thermal energy, if its actual consumer is an inhabitant, who purchases and consumes thermal energy for the needs of a household. VAT does not apply to the importation of gas through a natural gas system or any network connected to such a system or fed in from a vessel transporting gas into a natural gas system or any upstream pipeline network, of electricity or of heat or cooling energy import through heating or cooling networks. NRT NRT is applied for emissions of different air pollutants or emitting of GHG emissions into the atmosphere. The NRT rate is applied to each specific air pollutant or GHG. NRT for CO2 emissions does not apply to the equipment, which are included for combustion of EU ETS and biomass and peat. Coal, coke and lignite (brown coal) which are used for production of electricity, as well as production of heating and electricity in the process of cogeneration, as well as for sale of coal, coke and lignite (brown coal), if the selling person has a licence for production of electricity or licence for production of heating and electricity in the process of cogeneration is subject to EUR 0 NRT rate. VOT In accordance with the Law on the Vehicle Operation Tax and Company Car Tax the tax should be paid every year by persons, who own, hold or possess or have a registered vehicle in Latvia (excluding tractor equipment, such trailers and semi-trailers, the full weight of which does not exceed 3500 kg, trams, trolleybuses, off-road vehicles, snow motorcycles, mopeds and bicycles) or a vehicle subject to a tax shall get transit licence plates.

VOT of 25 % of the VOT rate shall apply:  to a producer of agricultural products, an agricultural service co-operative society and a recognised aquaculture (pond farm type) farm  for a goods vehicle, which is intended by construction for the transportation of different goods, and a trailer or semi-trailer, which is intended by construction for the transportation of different goods, observing special conditions;  to the vehicles with which a natural person or legal person included in the database of recipients of the Rural Support Service payments carries out own-account carriages, observing special conditions; The total amount of VOT and CCT reliefs on which information is available, was EUR 14.3 million in 2017, which was by EUR 3.8 million or 36.4 % more than in 2016. Electricity tax According to the Electricity Tax Law, electricity used for the carriage of goods and public carriage of passengers, including on rail transport and in public carriage of passengers in towns, as well as household users shall be exempt from tax. The electricity delivered or EU or other foreign representatives or organisations is exempt from the tax:  in the context of diplomatic or consular relations;  for international organisations, which have been recognised as such by the public institutions, where such organisations are located, as well as members of these 73  ENER-2019-00002-00-04-EN-TRA-00 organisations in accordance with international conventions establishing these organisations or agreements of their home countries;  armed forces of any member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, except the member state collecting the electricity tax, as well as armed forces mentioned in Article 1 of Council Decision 90/640/EEC of 3 December 1990, for consumption of these armed forces and civil staff accompanying them, or for the needs of kitchens or canteens of these armed forces;  for consumption in accordance with the agreements concluded with foreign countries, which are not EU Member States, or international organisation, unless such an agreement has been permitted or approved with regard to exemption from value added tax. For the electricity supplied to persons for provision of street lighting services, the tax is calculated using the zero euro rate per megawatt hour. The total amount of the exemption from the electricity tax was EUR 2.6 million in 2017, which is 0.01 % of GDP. In 2017, the amount of the exemption from the electricity tax was 56.5 % of actual income from the electricity tax (EUR 4.6 million). 2.5.6.2. Direct transfers One project applying to fossil energy sources with regard to reconstruction and renovation of production buildings extending the economic activity of a peat management company in manufacturing has been implemented so far within the EU funds aid programmes promoted by the MoE. 2.5.6.3. Indirect transfers In accordance with the Electricity Market Law, state aid is provided in Latvia for production of electricity from RES or in cogeneration and undertakings receive a fee for the capacity installed in the cogeneration stations in a mandatory procurement. Mandatory procurement is a state support mechanism for producers of electricity, which provides for funding from payments of end users of electricity. All Latvian end users of electricity subject to the mandatory procurement component cover the costs of mandatory procurement according to their electricity consumption, which is included in the final price of electricity in addition to the market price of electricity, the distribution and transmission and the value added tax.
