Thus, between 2005 and 2016, the nominal capital expenditures on the National Transmission Grid (KSE) increased over 2.5 times from PLN 481.9 million spent by the TSO on grid development and modernisation in 2005. Key expenditures in 2016 were PLN 1,024,300 on the construction and development of substations and power lines, and PLN 136.5 million on their modernisation. These  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  68  investments increased the reliability of the power system and adapted the sub-stations to new operating conditions (remote supervision, control and monitoring, unmanned operation). The additionally installed autotransformers will contribute to meeting demand for electricity and increasing reliability of power supply for consumers. Newly built or extended facilities will increase the capacity of the National Transmission System, as well as improving reactive power compensation and voltage regulation in the NTS. Thanks to the investment activities undertaken in 2016, nearly 78 km of new 400 kV lines and 10 km of 220 kV lines were built and nearly 240 km of 400 kV lines and 400 km of 220 kV lines were modernised. In addition, 270 km of optical fibre routes and 3,186.8 m2 sub-station was a very important investment completed in 2016. The aim of the project was to improve conditions for intersystem power exchange in the synchronous area with Germany and to avoid loop flows from the German system through the Polish system. The applied shifter technology is unique on a global scale. These are the first such shifters in Europe. 2018 was a record year for PSE in terms of the value of investments. In 2018, capital expenditure s totalled PLN 1.8 billion, approx. PLN 1.7 billion of which was allocated to the upgrading and construction of network infrastructure. 16 out of over 140 investment projects planned for the coming years were also completed: two related to the construction of new lines and 14 consisting in the extension and upgrading of existing infrastructure.

The transmission pipeline operator was designated by a decision of the President of the Energy Regulatory Office in 2006. Its main tasks are to manage the national transmission network and ensure continuous and reliable gas transmission between sources and customers in Poland. GAZ-SYSTEM S.A. is licensed as the transmission system operator until 6 December 2068. In 2017, GAZ-SYSTEM S.A. had nearly 12,000 kilometers of gas transmission pipelines under its management. The transmission system operated 67 points of entry (both import and domestic entry points, i.e. points of gas supply from mines or compressor stations) and 983 points of exit from the system (mainly connections with distribution systems and points of gas off-take by final customers). In terms of age, more than 53% of the pipelines are older than 30 years. Only 10% of the total length of the transmission pipelines has been put into operation in the last 5 years. Table 56.

This change is due to a number of factors: - Increase in the working capacity of the Wierzchowice storage facility from 575 mcm to 1,200 mcm; - Increase in the working capacity of the Strachocina storage facility from 150 mcm to 360 mcm; - Increase in the working capacity of the Husów storage facility from 350 mcm to 500 mcm; - Increase in the working capacity of the Mogilno storage facility from 370 mcm to 589.85 mcm; - Commissioning of the Kosakowo storage facility towards the end of 2014. In 2018, it had the capacity of 145.5 mcm and its target capacity is 250 mcm.  - Crude oil and liquid fuels  key parameters of existing infrastructure Poland is dependent on external supplies of crude oil due to the fact that its own resources are limited and sufficient only to meet 4% of domestic demand. With a share of approx. 80% in the current supply structure, Russia is a key importer of crude oil tsecurity is ensured from a technical viewpoint, particularly thanks to its extensive transmission infrastructure sk, whose capacity is sufficient to fully cover the demand of Polish refineries. The system of emergency oil and fuel stocks is essential to ensuring continuity of supply, as it guarantees an effective government response when a crisis situation occurs. Approx. 6 million tonnes of crude oil and fuels are kept as emergency stocks, a volume sufficient to meet domestic demand for more than three months at a normal consumption level. mergency stocks, as well as to meet the commercial and operational needs of market operators. However, it is necessary to ensure full physical availability of stocks in a crisis situation, which necessitates additional investments (which are currently underway). The fuel market in Poland is fully competitive. There is an extensive retail fuel sales network, which is diversified in terms of ownership structure. Dominated by two refineries, the wholesale market is more concentrated. The majority of fuel consumption is met by domestic production, with imports playing a complementary role. In order to secure the continuity of fuel supply to the market, it is necessary to ensure that domestic fuel demand is covered to the maximum extent by domestic production. The difficulties with which the refining sector in Europe has been coping for several years (low refining margin), caused by both internal factors (e.g. decrease in fuel consumption) and external factors (e.g. extraction of crude oil from unconventional deposits in the United States of America, increased fuel exports to EU countries from outside Europe, lower environmental costs of non-EU refineries), will be increasingly affecting Polish refineries as well. In view of the limited domestic oil resources, Poland's energy security in the oil sector depends in particular on the existing oil infrastructure, processing capacities of domestic refineries and storage capacities. Their reliability, modernisation and possible further expansion will have a key impact on maintaining energy security in the future. In this respect, it is important to maintain State control over key oil companies, and thus the government's ability to actively influence the oil sector. It is, therefore, advisable to maintain the State's share in key enterprises in the sector at least at the current level. Over the last two years, steps have been taken to make the structure of oil supply more geographically balanced. The main limitations in this regard have so far stemmed from economic considerations. This is evidenced, amongst others, by the difficulties related to the construction of the third oil supply route to Poland (the Odessa-Brody-36. The Polish system of pipelines for liquid fuels is based on the installations operated by PERN S.A., a company                                             36 The 675 km long Odessa-Brody pipeline connects the Black Sea with the Druzhba oil pipeline and ends up near the Polish border. Built between 1996 and 2001, the pipeline connects the Ukrainian cities of Odessa and Brody and has been planned as the first stage of construction of a pipeline supplying oil from the Black planned. The pipeline extension project is to be co-financed by the European Union.  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  71  of pipelines (the Druzhba pipeline) transporting crude oil from Russia to fuel producers in Poland and Germany, as well as oil storage. Russian oil is transported through two lines of the Druzhba pipeline, running from Adamowo, located at the a network of product pipelines that are used to transport liquid fuels produced by refineries. This network PERN consists of three sections: Eastern, Western and Pomeranian. The Eastern Section via three lines. It is used to transport crude oil to PKN Orlen and indirectly to the Lotos Group and German refineries. The pipeline has a length of 233 km and a maximum capacity of 56 million tonnes of crude oil per year (following the completion of the third line in October 2016). The Western Section Schwedt via two lines. The length of the route in Poland is 416 km and the nominal capacity is 27 million tonnes of crude oil per year. allowing crude oil to be pumSolino) is owned by PKN Orlen.  Company transports the Polish raw material extracted near these locations. The third section of the pipeline, i.e. the Pomeranian Sectionimported by sea for the PKN Orlen refinery. The Pomeranian Section operates in a reverse mode, a solution which enables pumping oil in both directions (the reverse direction is used to pump crude oil to PKN Orlen and, if necessary, to German refineries). Moreover, in combination with the infrastructure of the Naftopol liquid fuel arrangement facilitates exports of crude oil transported through the Druzhba pipeline, Pomeranian Section is 235 km and the nominal capacity is 27 and 30 million tonnes of crude oil per year (in the northern and southern direction, respectively). PERN operates also a network of product pipelines for transporting petroleum products (petrol, diesel and heating oil) in three directions: -   Rejowiec. The length of the route is approx. 208 km and the nominal capacity   Rejowiec, respectively). -   Emilianów. The length of the route is approx. 163 km and the nominal capacity is 1.15 million tonnes per year. -  Koluszki  Boronów.

The reverse construction plans are divided into two parts to be completed by 2020 and 2022. The reverse capacity is planned at 15 million tonnes per year in the first phase and approx. 22 million tonnes in the second phase. The reverse use of the Eastern Section has been necessitated by the need to adapt PERN's logistic services relating to crude oil transport and storage to the new needs of refineries, which are increasingly exploring new directions of raw material supplies by sea as part of their diversification efforts. Polish and German refineries are looking for oil from different directions. There are now tanker deliveries to Lotus and Orlen from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Canada and the USA. Such deliveries are bound to increase. Due to the diversification of supplies by PERN's customers, free storage capacities may occasionally occur in Adamowo. In such a situation, reverse storage of oil supplied not only from the East. In addition to the reverse flow project concerning the Eastern Section, PERN is planning a nearly 10% increase in capacity of the reversible pipeline of the Pomeranian Section connecting the company's storage facilities near pumping stations, the project is scheduled to be completed by 2020. On the other hand, the expansion of the by 2022 at the latest.  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  73  The production of liquid fuels for the purposes of crude oil processing is carried out mainly in refineries owned by Polski Koncern Naftowy ORLEN S.A. and Grupa Lotos S.A. Polski Koncern Naftowy ORLEN S.A., together with companies forming ORLEN Group, is the leader of the refinery and petrochemical industry in Central and Eastern Europe. ORLEN Group comprises PKN ORLEN as the parent company, as well as companies located in Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Malta, Sweden, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, the USA and Canada. As at 31 December 2018, ORLEN Group comprised 67 companies, including 57 subsidiaries. In 2018, the crude oil processed by PKN ORLEN totalled 33.4 million tonnes a year. The Group's refinery and processing structure comprises refineries in Poland, the Czech Republic and Lithuania with a total crude oil processing capacity of 35.2 million tonnes a year, as well as crude oil processing plants, including  PKN and Eastern Europe with a capacity of 16.3 million tonnes a year. In the area of petrochemical production, the key Olefin unit has a maximum capacity of about 700,000 tonnes of ethylene and approx. 380,000 tonnes of propylene.  of biocomponents, base oils, heating oils, hydro refined paraffins and regeneration of used oils.  only plant of this type in the Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia).  itvinov have a total production capacity of 8.7 million tonnes a year. The Unipetrol Group also has petrochemical assets with a production capacity of approx. 600,000 tonnes a year (320,000 tonnes of polyethylene and approximately 280,000 tonnes of polypropylene). A new Polyethylene 3 unit with a capacity of approximately 270,000 tonnes a year is also under construction, which will enable higher utilisation of the Olefins unit and deeper integration of petrochemical and refinery production.  awek is the only producer of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in Poland and one of the largest producers of fertilisers and sodium hydroxide in the country. The production capacity is approximately 1.0 million tonnes a year of nitrogenous fertilisers, 0.4 million tonnes a year of PVC and granulates and 0.2 million tonnes a year of sodium hydroxide. Thanks to the planned construction of the third nitrogenous fertiliser production facility, ANWIL's production capacity after 2021 will increase to approximately 1.5 million tonnes a year.   the largest plastic plant in Poland and the only domestic manufacturer of polyolefins; it has installations with a total production capacity of 900,000 tonnes (420,000 tonnes of polyethylene and 480,000 tonnes of polypropylene), and products are distributed both in Poland and on foreign markets.  Petrol stations operate under the ORLEN brand in the premium segment and the Bliska brand in the economy segment (only 3% of the network) in Poland, mainly under the Benzina and Benzina Plus brands in the Czech Republic (mainly the premium segment), and under the ORLEN brand (premium segment) in Lithuania. On the German market, ORLEN Deutschland manages economy stations under the star brand, and the network is supplemented by a dozen or so Famila stations attached to hypermarkets or supermarkets. The LOTOS Capital Group is the second largest fuel producer in Poland. It is the only operator to engage in hydrocarbon extraction in the Polish Exclusive Economic Zone of the Baltic Sea. Oil exploitation is also carried out by the LOTOS Capital Group in the area of the Norwegian Continental Shelf and in onshore oil fields in anced refinery complexes in Europe with an annual capacity of approx. 10.5 million tonnes of crude oil. The LOTOS Capital Group focuses its operations on the extraction and processing of crude oil and the wholesale and retail sale of petroleum products, including fuels (unleaded petrol, diesel and light fuel oil), heavy fuel oil, asphalts, aviation fuel, pyrolytic petrol, propane-butane (LPG) and base oils. As at 31 December 2018,  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  74  the Capital Group of Grupa LOTOS S.A. was composed of Grupa LOTOS S.A. as the parent company and 18 companies under the LOTOS brand. Three of them are based outside Poland: in Lithuania, Norway and the United Kingdom. In 2018, the average daily production of oil and gas by the LOTOS Group was 20,400 boe/day (barrels of oil equivalent), which means an annual capacity of nearly 1 million toe (tons of oil equivalent).74% of the total volume, i.e. 15,200 boe/day, came from Norwegian deposits. As at the end of 2018, the LOTOS Group had total proved and probable oil and gas reserves of 89.8 million boe, including 69.8 million boe of oil (78% of total 2P reserves) and 20.1 million boe of gas (22% of total 2P reserves). As in previous years, Russian Ural oil was the dominant type of oil processed. At approx. 73.1%, its share was slightly lower than in previous years. Crude oil imported from other directions, including approx. 197,000 tonnes of oil supplied by LOTOS Petrobaltic Capital Group, complemented the mix. 4.5.3. Electricity and gas markets, energy prices - Current situation on the electricity market During the period of analysis, domestic electricity production shows an upward trend, reaching 170.5 TWh in 2017 and 170.0 TWh in 2018, the highest result in the history of the Polish energy industry. An increase in electricity consumption is also visible in the same period, after a decrease resulting from the economic slowdown in 2009, and this increase has been outpacing production since 2016. The growing consumption of electricity in 2018 was supplemented by imports of 5.7 TWh, i.e. 3.3% of domestic consumption (see the figure below). The structure of the wholesale electricity market is presented on the basis of an analysis of directions of energy sales. In 2016, public power generators sold a total of 144.1 TWh of energy, i.e. approx. 1.8% less than in 2015 (146.6 TWh), and the wholesale of electricity by commercial power plants and CHP plants took place primarily through regulated markets where, similarly to the previous year, the dominant role was played by the power exchange and sales to trading companies. The increase in the popularity of electricity exchange trade in Poland was primarily influenced by the 2010 amendment to the Energy Law that introducexchange. With regard to generators receiving compensation for the premature termination of long-term electricity purchase contracts, the exchange obligation applies to all generated electricity with the exception of, amongst others, electricity generated through cogeneration, electricity generated for own use and electricity generated in units with an installed capacity of not more than 50 MWe.

Sales of electricity to final customers is gradually increasing. An increase of over 28% is recorded within the -off of the distribution system operator from the former distribution companies continue to be the main sellers of energy, accounting for 84% of all trades. Other independent companies engaged in electricity trading are gaining an increasing share of sales to final customers. Electricity is sold under comprehensive contracts (Polish umowa kompleksowa) and sales contracts. In the period under discussion, there is a significant increase in the share of TPA customers in the energy market. The number of TPA customers and the share of TPA sales are presented below. - Current situation on the electricity market In December 2012, an important step was taken towards the liberalisation of the Polish gas market by launching the gas exchange on the Polish Power Exchange. This was the implementation of Article 49b of the Energy Law, which requires that a certain volume of high-methane natural gas fed into the transmission network in a given year be mandatorily sold by electricity undertakings on commodity exchanges. In 2013, this volume equalled 30% of gas fed into the transmission network and has been as high as 55% from 2015. In 2015, TGE S.A. operated the following gas fuel markets: Intra Day Market, Day-Ahead Market, Commodity Forward Instruments Market, and the auctioning of natural gas. The gas market in Poland operates on two levels: - wholesale market  sale of gas to large customers connected to the transmission network or to distribution or trading companies (as at the end of 2018, 197 operators were licensed to trade in gaseous fuels on the wholesale market, 102 of which were actively engaged in natural gas trade), - retail market  sale of gas to final customers connected to the distribution network. In 2015, gas sales to final customers continued to be dominated by PGNiG Group companies. Following the distinction introduced in 2014, wholesale customers and final customers with an annual natural gas consumption of over 25 mcm began to be supplied by PGNiG S.A. and the remaining final customers by PGNiG Obrót  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  78  Detaliczny Sp. z o.o. 2015 saw an increase in the share of alternative vendors in the retail market. The PGNiG Group's share in gas sales to final customers was over 88% in 2015. The remaining gas sales to final customers were carried out by other trading companies operating in Poland and by companies selling gas mainly on the German market directly to large final customers, who imported gas to Poland on their own. Gas companies sold 150,192 GWh of natural gas to final customers in 2015 and 157,211 GWh in 2010. Table 60.

Total natural gas imports, i.e. the sum of imports and intra-Community acquisitions, amounted to 128,762 GWh in 2015 (115,136 GWh in 2010). Imports of natural gas from the East totalled 93,432 GWh in 2015 (103,174 GWh in 2010). Intra-Community acquisition of gas totalled 33,950 GWh in 2015 (11,962 GWh in 2010).

On 1 January 2017, the provisions of the Energy Law came into force, abolishing the supervision of the President of the Energy Regulatory Office over tariffs for the sale of gas to wholesale customers, the sale of LNG and CNG, the sale of gas to final customers purchasing it at a virtual point and through tenders, auctions and public procurement. The obligation to obtain approval of the President of the Energy Regulatory Office for price lists of high-methane and nitrogen-rich natural gas sold to final customers other than households was lifted on 1 October 2017. The ERO President will supervise tariffs (i.e. maximum prices) for network gas sold to households until the end of 2023. Following the amendment of the Act on stocks of crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas in 2017, natural gas stocks will have to be stored physically, in specifically designated installations and in a manner that meets liged Entities is excluded. The amended Act also provides the cancellation or expiry of a licence or discontinuation of natural gas imports during a given gas year does not release the Obliged Entity from maintaining mandatory stocks of natural gas until the end of the year. - Electricity prices by sector Price projections for final customers are based on projections of averaged system costs, taking into account estimates of costs related to the operation of the particular support systems in Poland, the level of taxation and transmission and distribution charges. The presented electricity price projections include the full cost associated with the operation of support systems for energy produced from renewable energy sources and in cogeneration, as well as for energy efficiency improvement projects. The analysis also factors in the introduction of a capacity payment mechanism. The calculations of final customer prices and their components are based on data collected using the G-11e statistical form, the aim of which is to obtain information on electricity prices by categories of standard household and non-household (including industrial) final customers, defined in accordance with the new data collection methodology developed and recommended by the European Commission. A final customer means a customer consuming electricity for his own use. Categories of standard final customers are determined by annual electricity consumption. The reporting form contains 12 categories of final customers: 5 categories of standard household customers and 7 categories of standard industrial and service customers.  Current situation and projections with existing policies and measures as of the end of 2017 (reference scenario  without implementing the NECP)  80  The table below presents projections of electricity prices for the three defined groups of final customers. The presented figures are average prices offered under comprehensive contracts (Polish umowa kompleksowa) and separate contracts (Polish umowa rozdzielona), inclusive of taxes (the calculations are based on an excise duty of PLN 0.02/MWh at current prices and 23% VAT throughout the forecast horizon). As is shown by the results obtained, a gradual increase in electricity prices is expected for all the three groups of final customers. The increase in prices is evenly distributed across the sectors, which is a consequence of the assumption of proportional distribution of the costs of all support schemes, with the exception of support for renewable energy (currently industry is partially exempted from the RES charge). The main factors behind the projected increase include the costs of CO2 emission allowances, which increase over time, and the development costs of zero-emission technologies. VAT for industrial customers is reimbursed by the State Treasury, and therefore electricity prices inclusive of VAT are given for industrial consumers for reference only.

In addition to these projects, GAZ-SYSTEM S.A. has included another 20 transmission infrastructure projects in the National Ten-year Gas Transmission System Development Plan. The PGNiG Group's 2017-2022 strategy with an outlook until 2026 sets out capital expenditure of PLN 10 billion for the development of distribution networks in 2017-2022. As a result of these investments, the Group expects to connect over 300,000 new natural gas customers to the distribution network and increase the volume of gas distribution by 16%. Moreover, the PGNiG Capital Group expects to invest approx. PLN 300 million in trade and storage. The expansion of KPMG Kosakowo to reach the capacity of 250 mcm is the largest such investment project in the near future. Companies operating on the gas market have revised many of their projects and it is, therefore, pointless to provide detailed data that are not up-to-date. Current data are provided in Annex 2 to the NECP. - Capital expenditure on infrastructure development in the electric power sector Forecasted capital expenditure on the replacement of end-of-life generation units and the construction of new and retrofitting of existing units, as required by the Industrial Emissions Directive and contained in the BAT Conclusions of 17 August 2017, is shown in the table below.

The required capital expenditure on renewable sources for the whole period 2016-2040 is estimated at approx. 40% of the total capital expenditure.  Figure 39. Capital expenditure on the projected structure of generation sources by fuel    Coal-derived Gazowe Gaseous  Nuclear Inne paliwa Other fuels  Renewable sources Projected capital expenditure in the electricity transmission and distribution sub-sector comprises the costs of network expansion or strengthening related to the introduction of new capacities into the system. The assessment of these costs is an extremely difficult task, as upgrading costs depend on the condition of the existing infrastructure, location of sources and type of technology, area, length and rated power of power lines. In general, the more decentralised the power system is, the greater the need for strengthening of the distribution network and thus the higher the costs involved. This analysis employs an estimation based on the adopted unit investment costs for the transmission network (HV) and for the distribution networks (MV and EHV), expressed in million EUR/MW of additional capacity of generation units connected to the respective network. Unit investment costs were assumed according to the PRIMES model (Table 4.15), with the exception of network costs for offshore wind farms, which were assumed to be 0.7 million EUR/MW of installed capacity. Projected capital expenditure in the electricity transmission and distribution sub-sector in 2016-2040 is presented below. Table 65.
