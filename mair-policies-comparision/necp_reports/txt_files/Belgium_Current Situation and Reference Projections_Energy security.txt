Dimension energy efficiency Table 7 - Primary and final energy consumption in the economy and by sector (WEM scenario, in ktoe) Source: Eurostat (June 2018) for 2005-2015 (updated for solid fuels) (3); compilation of regional projections for 2020-2030. Note:  For the period 2020-2030, final energy demand in the transport sector corresponds to fuel sales in Flanders and in the Brussels Capital Region, but to fuel consumption in Wallonia.  ption fell by 13% between 2005 and 2015. The lower level of primary energy consumption in 2015 compared with 2005 and 2010 is partly explained by the sharp decrease in nuclear energy generation. Furthermore, final energy consumption fell by 5% over the period 2005-2015. Industry and the residential sector were responsible for this downward trend as their energy consumption fell by 8% and 18% respectively. On the other hand, energy consumption rose in the transport sector (+5%) and tertiary sector (+7%). The projections with existing measures show a general downward trend for primary energy consumption to 2030 (-12% in 2030 compared with 2005 levels). The downward trend is mainly due to implementation of the law on phasing out nuclear power over the period 2022-2025; the higher level in 2020 than in 2015 is due to the availability of nuclear generation capacity. The projection for primary energy consumption in 2020 (48,597 ktoe) is higher than Belgium's indicative energy efficiency target (47,300 ktoe). However, the projection for final energy demand with existing measures shows an upward trend to 2030. In 2020, final energy demand (36,675 ,500 ktoe). In 2030, final energy demand is 3% higher than in 2005. The increase over the period 2020-2040 is mainly due to transport.

The difference between the two sources is small and reduces over time, for both total primary energy consumption and total final energy consumption: for 2005, it is 4% for both primary and final energy consumption; for 2015, it is zero for primary energy consumption and 1% for final energy consumption. However, the differences at energy and sector level may be much greater. It is worth noting that the consumption of solid fuels is currently under review and will be updated; the update will be sent to Eurostat as soon as possible.  2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 Primary energy consumption 52,544 53,937 45,741 48,597 46,953 46,076 Final energy consumption 37,803 38,036  35,880 36,675 38,160 38,945 Industry 12,935 12,468 11,918 13,265 14,507 15100 Residential 9,925 9,411 8,163 7,898 7,720 7,531 Tertiary 4,995 5,812 5,358 5,109 5,159 5,196 Transport 9,948 10,345 10,440 10,404 10,775 11,117 8 Source: Eurostat (June 2018) for 2005-2015 (updated for solid fuels) (4);  compilation of regional projections for 2020-2030.  Around domestic consumption came from fossil fuels (solid fuels, oil and natural gas) in 2005, 2010 and 2015. In 2005 and 2010, 20% came from nuclear power. However, this share fell to 12% in 2015 following the shutdown of several nuclear reactors. Part of the reduction in nuclear energy generation in 2015 was offset by electricity imports, which increased to 3.3% (compared with less than 1% in 2005 and 2010). The share of renewable energy sources rose steadily, from 2% in 2005 to almost 7% in 2015. The projections with existing measures point to an increasing share of fossil fuels (almost 90% in 2030). The increase is particularly pronounced for natural gas owing to its more intensive use for electricity generation. In addition, the share of renewable energy sources stabilises at around 8%. An increasing (or decreasing) share is not necessarily synonymous with increasing (or decreasing) consumption. For example, domestic oil consumption is lower in 2020-2030 than in 2005. Gross domestic consumption of natural gas and renewable energy rises steadily over the period covered by the projection.

Note:  For the period 2020-2030, the breakdown between domestic renewable energy generation and net imports is not available. For the purposes of calculating import dependency, it is assumed that the renewable energy is generated entirely in Belgium.  Belgium relies on imports for almost all its energy needs as the country has very limited domestic energy sources. These include renewable energy sources (wind, solar and biomass), as well as nuclear heat, although the uranium needed is imported. Domestic production of renewable energy increased by a factor of 3.4 between 2005 and 2015. All fossil fuels are imported. However, fossil fuel imports fell by 8% between 2005 and 2015.  The projections with existing measures point to increasing import dependency (90% in 2030). The main reasons for this trend are the phasing out of nuclear power (nuclear heat is considered domestic production according sources are projected to increase only moderately
