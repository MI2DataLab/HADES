4.4. Dimension Energy security  i. Current energy mix, domestic energy resources, import dependency, including relevant risks i.1. Current energy mix and domestic energy resources Portugal does not explore or produce, crude oil or natural gas. This means that these products are imported from third countries. The energy import balance has fallen in recent years, recording aagr of -1.0% in the 2009-2018 period. The reduction in the import balance, which has a positive impact in reducing external energy dependency and as a result, lower energy bills for the country, was brought about through the increase in domestic energy production. This increase was particularly due to endogenous renewable sources, which led to a reduction in the imports of coal and natural gas to produce electricity. The increase in production capacity at national refineries, which provided greater response for internal consumption, also contributed to the reduction in oil product imports, and as a result, an improved import balance. NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4. Current Policy Situation and Existing Measures and Projections 136   Figure 42 - Evolution of Energy Import Balance in Portugal (ktoe) [Source: DGEG]     Domestic energy production has grown in recent years, recording aagr of more than 3.1% in the 2009-2018 period, confirming the growth seen in the previous decade (3.3% from 1999 to 2006). The increase in domestic energy production has had a positive impact on reducing external energy dependency through lower imports of coal and natural gas to produce electricity. In 2018, domestic energy production was 6 416 ktoe, representing an increase of 24% over 2017, as a result of a highly favourable hydrological year with greater availability of hydro resources to produce electricity. With respect to PEC, domestic energy production represented around 25% (+6 p.p. over figures for 2017). In the last decade from 2009-2018, domestic production represented an average of approximately 23% of PEC against an average of 16% in the period from 1999 to 2008. Figure 43 - Evolution of Domestic Energy Production in Portugal (ktoe) [Source: DGEG]    i.2. Energy dependency One of the main challenges, and the goal of current national energy policy, is to reduce external energy dependency. Historically, Portugal has had high energy dependency of between 80% and 90% up to 2009, as the country has no fossil fuels such as oil or natural gas, which have a highly significant weighting in final energy consumption. The focus on renewable energies and energy efficiency in recent years has allowed Portugal to lower dependency to less than 80%. However, variability in hydro production, which accounts for a large share  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4. Current Policy Situation and Existing Measures and Projections 137   of national electricity production, negatively influences energy dependency in dry years, as was the case in 2005 and 2008. In 2018, energy dependency stood at 77.9% (75.9% including the contribution of heat pumps), representing a reduction of 1.8 p.p. over 2017 and a reduction of 10.9 p.p. with respect to 2005, a year which saw the highest figure for energy dependency in recent years. Figure 44 -     i.3. Relevant risks for energy supply in Portugal As already mentioned, Portugal does not exploit or produce coal, oil or natural gas, and as such, the supply of these energy sources to the Portuguese market is exclusively via imports from third countries. To assess issues relating to supply security and the proper functioning of the natural gas market, a Risk Assessment is carried out on the National Natural Gas Transmission System (SNGN). This assessment, was undertaken every two years, but after the publication of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of 4 October (see point 2.3 of this Plan), will now be conducted every four years, or earlier should it be considered necessary. It takes into consideration relevant national and regional circumstances, such as market size, network configuration, the input and output flows of the Member State, the presence of storage and the role of gas in the energy mix, focusing particularly on the use of gas for the production of electricity and the functioning of industry. The assessment involves scenarios of exceptionally high demand and disruptions to gas supply caused by failures in the main supply infrastructure. After the Risk Assessment is carried out, a Preventive Action Plan is drawn up to define suitable measures to eliminate or attenuate the risks identified in SNGN risk scenarios, as well as an Emergency Plan which details measures to be taken during differing levels of crisis. This plan attributes responsibilities to those involved in the system so as to be able address the risk events identified and safeguard supply. It should be remembered that in accordance with the abovementioned regulation, the preparation of a common regional risk assessment is also provided for to identify and study the main risks affecting specific EU regions (referred to as Risk Groups). With respect to the electricity production sector, historically, hydro power plants have always played a significant role in Portugal. In 2018, the weighting of hydro power in gross electricity production was 23%, contrasting with 13% in 2017. This difference was due to 2018 being considered a wet year (IPH = 1.05) while 2016 was considered a dry year (IPH = 0.47). As a result of greater availability of hydro resources for electricity production, Portugal has lower energy dependency given that it has to import less natural gas and coal, also NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4. Current Policy Situation and Existing Measures and Projections 138   leading to a reduction in the energy bill. In recent years, there has been diversification of renewable sources for electricity production, particularly wind and the construction of new reversible hydro plants with pumping equipment allowing excess wind production produced at times of lower consumption to be used, enabling energy to be stored for use at times of greater consumption. This diversification has allowed the impact of dry years on the electricity production system to be attenuated. The following figure shows the evolution in external energy dependency compared to gross hydro electricity production. Figure 45 - Relationship between external energy dependency and the production of hydro energy [Source: DGEG]  i.4. National Electricity Production System In 2018, the national Electricity Production System recorded gross electricity production of 59.6 TWh, representing a rise of 0.3% over 2017. 51% of total production came from renewable sources (+10p.p. Over 2017) with greater incidence on hydro and wind power which together represented around 44% of all national electricity production in 2017, followed by natural gas (26%) and coal (20%). Of note is the fact that Portugal registered an export balance of 2.7 TWh in 2018, similar to that seen in 2017. In the renewable component of electricity production, hydro power accounted for around 44%, followed by wind with 41%, biomass35 with 10%, solar photovoltaic with 3% and geothermal, which is only produced in the Azores, with 1%.                                                                            35 Biomass includes plant/forestry waste, sulphite liqueurs, biogas and solid urban waste (renewable part)  NECP 2030 Section B - Analytical Basis - Chapter 4.

Petróleo Oil products Gás Natural Natural gas Carvão Coal  In 2018, Portugal recorded a total of 22 GW of installed capacity for electricity production, 13 984 MW of which, corresponding to around 64%, came from renewable technologies. This represents an increase of 1.6% over 2016, the equivalent of 221 MW, mainly as a result of the entry into operation of new wind, solar and biomass capacity. Of total installed capacity, around 33% (7 098 MW) corresponds to hydro plants, which includes an important reversible pumping component, allowing excess production of renewable energy to be absorbed and stored. This represents around 40% of total hydro capacity, while wind represents 25% (5 368 MW), around 23% (4 984 MW) is natural gas, 9% (1 871 MW) coal, 4% (810 MW) biomass36, around 3% (673 MW) solar, 5% (997 MW) other non-renewables37 and 0.2% (34 MW) of other renewables38. In the last decade, 2009-2018, an increase of 3.7 GW total installed capacity for electricity production was recorded, while renewables saw an increase of 4.9 GW, and non-renewable thermal production had a decrease of around 1.1 GW.
