 52    2. NATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS  2.1. Decarbonisation  2.1.1. GHG emissions and removals  2.1.1.1. The elements set out in point (a)(1) of Article 4   -ETS and non-(EU) 2018/842 involves a 37% reduction in these emissions by 2030 compared to 2005.  The European Commission will make known the budgets (annually binding national limits pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/842) allocated to each Member States in executing acts that will be published once the emissions data for 20162018 are available (probably in 2020).  According to Regulation (EU) 2018/841, each Member State (including France) must ensure that emissions in the land, land-use and forestry (LULUCF) sector do not exceed removals for the periods from 2021 to 2025 and from 2026 to 2030, compared to a reference period of 20052009 for the land sector and a projected forest reference level for forest management.   The diagram below outlines the European climate framework for the period 2021targets in this context.      2.1.1.2. Other national objectives and targets consistent with the Paris Agreement and the existing long-term strategies. Where applicable for the contribution to the overall Union commitment of reducing the GHG emissions, other objectives and targets, including sector targets and adaptation goals, if available  tion targets                                  Agriculture, buildings, transport, etc.                            53    The targets set by France for the reduction of regional GHG emissions are consistent with its EU and international undertakings10. These targets are as follows:  - achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, or in other words net zero emissions within the country; enshrined in law;  - reducing greenhouse gas emissions by -40% by 2030 compared to 1990; this target was set in the Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth, which was adopted in 2015;  - in the short and medium term, to comply with the carbon budgets adopted by decree, i.e.  the emissions caps that must not be exceeded for successive five-year periods (except for the first period which covers four years, from 2015 to 2018).   The carbon budgets are defined in the SNBC. The SNBC and the first three carbon budgets were adopted by Decree No 2015-1491 of 18 November 2015. The carbon budgets that have been adopted relate to the periods 20152018, 20192023 and 20242028. For reference purposes, they are broken down at the level of the following major sectors: transport, residential and tertiary buildings, industry, agriculture, energy generation and waste. Provisional adjustments were made to the carbon budgets in 2019 in response to developments in the field of GHG emissions accounting11.  The draft SNBC 2 contains details of the fourth carbon budget for the period 20292033, which will be adopted by decree in 2019 in parallel to the adoption of the revised SNBC. The draft also revises the second carbon budget.  The graph below contains historical GHG emissions data for France since 1990, as well as the emissions for the period between now and 2050 modelled by the reference scenario used for the draft SNBC 2. It also shows the next three carbon budgets.     10 Under the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.  11 Final adjustments to the carbon budgets will be carried out in spring 2020 if necessary, when the outcomes of the GHG emissions inventory for the entire period between 2015 and 2018 are available.   54             Figure 13: Changes in GHG emissions and sinks in France between 2005 and 2050       Évolution des émissions et des puits de gaz à effet de serre sur le territoire national entre 2005 et 2050  Changes in GHG emissions and sinks within France between 2005 and 2050                               55    Emissions et puits de gaz à effet de serre (en  MtCO2eq)  GHG emissions and sinks (in MtCO2eq)  Budgets carbone  Carbon budgets  2050  Objectif de neutralité carbone  2050  Target of carbon neutrality  Agriculture et Sylviculture  Agriculture and silviculture  Traitement des déchets  Waste treatment  Résidentiel et Tertiaire  Residential and tertiary buildings  Secteur des terres  Land sector  Emissions brutes tendancielles  Gross emissions under the trend-based scenario  Industrie maunfacturirère  Manufacturing sector   Energy sector  Transports  Transport  Capture et Stockage du Charbone  Carbon capture and storage    Based on the reference scenario used for the draft SNBC 2, a potential trajectory for GHG emissions reduction through to the achievement of carbon neutrality in 2050 can be modelled; this trajectory served as a starting point for the fourth carbon budget. The short-term and medium-term hypotheses used when developing the scenario were more accurate than those used when developing the scenario that was provided for under the SNBC adopted in 2015, and which was used as a basis for the first three carbon budgets. As a result, the second carbon budget that had been adopted in 2015 was adjusted upwards in the draft SNBC 2. The following finding has emerged from the provisional emissions forecasts for the periods 20192023 and 20242028, covered by the second and third carbon budgets:  - The second carbon budget set under the SNBC 1 will be exceeded, potentially by around 120 MtCO2eq for the entire period between 2019 and 2023, which is equivalent to 6% of the second budget. Reasons for this excess include the downward adjustment of hypothetical energy price trends and greater allowances for the challenges faced by the transport sector (lack of hoped-for improvements in the performance of new vehicles and absence of a modal shift in the fright transport sector) and buildings (lower-than-planned rate of renovation, and less substantial impact).  - The targets for the third carbon budget will only be missed by a very small amount (2 MtCO2eq) provided that all the measures already proposed are put in place, including all of the additional measures provided for in the reference scenario.  The table and graph below show the next three carbon budgets under the draft SNBC 2, with a breakdown by sector:  Average annual emissions  (in Mt CO2eq)  R eference year s  Second carbon budget  Third carbon budget  Fourth carbon budget  Period  1990  2005  2015  2019-2023  2024-2028  2029-2033  Transport  122  144  137  128  112  94  Buildings  91  109  88  78  60  43   56    Agriculture/  silviculture (excluding  LULUCF)  94  90  89  82  77  72  Industry  144  115  81  72  62  51  Energy production  78  74  47  48  35  30  Waste  17  21  17  14  12  10  Total (excluding  LULUCF)  546  553  458  422  359  300         Total (including  LULUCF)  521  505  417  383  320  258         Carbon budgets adopted in 2015  adjusted in 2018 (for reference)     398  357             Emissions for the reference years are taken from the CITEPA format. The figures that appear in the table above are rounded to the nearest unit, meaning that there may be slight discrepancies between the total emissions for the different sectors of industry and the overall total.

In application of the Effort Sharing 342 MtCO2e by 2020. The trajectory of the draft SNBC 2 provides for a figure of around 330 MtCO2e of GHG emissions in the ESD sector by 2020, or in other words a reduction of -17% compared to the reference year of 2005, which exceeds the target set (a reduction of -14%), and will therefore allow France to comply with its ESD commitments with an estimated excess of 165 MtCO2e. The emissions-reducing trajectory based on a scenario with existing measures (WEM) would involve GHG emissions being stabilised at around 354 MtCO2e, which represents a reduction of only -11.6%. Since France recorded an excess of around 100 MtCO2e in 2020,  58    however, it would still be able to comply with its commitments under the Effort Sharing Decision. France anticipates the accumulation of a significant excess under the Effort Sharing Decision; it has no concrete plans to transfer its excess allowances, but has not ruled out this possibility.  ssions of 37% compared to 2005, which is equivalent to GHG emissions in the ESR sector of around 248 MtCO2e in 2030. The trajectory of the draft SNBC 2 provides for a figure of around 233 MtCO2e in 2030 in the ESR sector (equivalent to total GHG emissions of 310 MtCO2e), or in other words a reduction of -41.5% in GHG emissions by 2030 compared to the reference year of 2005. By following the trajectory for GHG emissions reduction outlined in the draft SNBC 2, France will therefore be able to comply easily with the provisions of the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR).  The European Commission will be responsible for decisions on emission allowances under the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR). An initial estimate based on GHG emissions in 2016, 2017 and 2018 can however be used as a starting point for the future trajectory of GHG emissions reductions in the ESR sectors.  Average GHG emissions in 2016, 2017 and 2018 in the ESR sectors were 349.267 MtCO2e. According to the provisions of Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No shall start either at five-twelfths of the distance from 2019 to 2020 or in 2020, whichever results in a   are five twelfths of the distance from 2019 to 2020, which gives an estimated emission allowance ranging from 334.9 MtCO2e in 2021 to 250.7 MtCO2e in 2030, or a total allowance of 2,928 MtCO2e.

Conversely, the trajectory corresponding to a scenario with existing measures (WEM) provides for a target of 340.4 MtCO2e by 2021 and only 303.9 MtCO2e by 2030, or in other words a reduction in GHG emissions of 24%, compared to a target of -37%. In this situation, France would accumulate a total estimated allocation deficit of around -276 MtCO2e for the period 20212030.  The trajectory adopted by France for climate policy purposes corresponds to the SNBC 2, which means that the targets set under the Effort Sharing Regulation will be exceeded and a potential allocation excess of around 169 MtCO2e will be accumulated over the period 20212030. At this stage, France plans to make use of the flexibility option provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 842/2018 and bank the excess part of the allocation, and has not ruled out the possibility of transferring them to a different Member State.   59    France is not eligible for the flexibility option provided for under Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 842/2018 allowing the limited cancellation of EU ETS allowances, or the safety reserve provided for under Article 11.    Application of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry.  Regulation (EU) 2018/841 lays out rules for the accounting of emissions and removals in the forestry and land-use sectors and imposes commitments on the Member States with a view to ensuring that total emissions do not exceed total removals over the period 2021 to 2030, based on the accounting rules of the same Regulation. The rules in question are differentiated by land category. Emissions from forest management, including harvested wood products, are accounted for in relation to a reference level for forest management; emissions from the land-use sector (except forests) are accounted for in relation to an average for the period 20052009; and emissions and removals linked to deforestation and afforestation are accounted for in full.   Based on these accoun-an increase in removals or a reduction in emissions compared to an overall reference situation. This commitment is met through the production of a compliance report containing the total balance of emissions and removals and details of any intention to use the flexibility options, and rules guaranteeing the achievement of this target at EU level for the periods 20212025 and 20262030.  As regards forest management, France forwarded its Forestry Accounting Plan in January 2020 in keeping with the provisions of Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2018/841, which included calculations of the reference level for managed forests (estimated at -55.40 MtCO2e for the period 20212025 and 57.29 MtCO2e for the period 20262030). Since removals stood at -46.817 MtCO2e in 2017, the calculated reference level means that it will be necessary to increase carbon sinks in the forest management sector; this can be achieved by continuing past management practices.  The trajectory under the SNBC 2 provides for smart and sustainable management of forests with a view to optimising their role as a carbon pump in the long term while improving their resilience to climate risks. This development is a vital step in ultimately achieving climate neutrality by fostering the parallel development of carbon sinks in standing forests and in bio-based products, particularly in the construction sector. The SNBC 2 therefore provides for an increase in carbon sinks across the entire sector by 2050, and also provides for an increase in the carbon stored in agricultural soils, a decrease in anthropogenic development and a sharp increase in the carbon stored in wood products.                  Figure 15: Sinks in the land- Plan, Section 1.2.1)   60     Puits du secteur des terre dans l'AMS  Carbon sinks in the land sector under WAM scenario  Puits du secteur des terre (en MtCO2eq)  Carbon sinks in the land sector (in MtCo2eq)  Forêt  Forest  Produits bois  Wood products  Autres terres  Other land  Total  Total    Over the period 20212030, the projected developments will result in an overall stabilisation of sinks in the land-use sector; at the same time, however, carbon sinks associated with forest management will drop as a result of increasingly dynamic forest management aimed at upping the production of wood materials.  Removals within the managed forest sector will therefore fall over the period 20212030, resulting in a debit; this should nevertheless remain below the level of flexibility provided for in Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 for managed forest land. The specific accounting rules provided for by the Regulation in respect of the other categories of land make it difficult to estimate accurate figures; nevertheless, the anticipated trajectory provides for a reduction in the rate of anthropogenic development and ploughing of grassland and an increase in forest cover, which should make it possible to achieve a positive balance for these categories of land.  Having regard to the above, France plans to make use of the general flexibility options provided for in Article 12(2) and (3), which make it possible to bank any quantity of removals remaining for the period 20212025 or to transfer them to or from another Member State. As noted above, the flexibility option provided for under Article 13 in respect of managed forest land could also be utilised if necessary, in accordance with the provisions of this Article.  Adaptation targets  France is currently implementing its second National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (PNACC), and a number of the adaptation policies and measures under this Plan may promote the achievement of objectives and targets under the Energy Union. The implementation of these policies and measures is aligned with the adaptation targets under the integrated national energy and climate plan.    61    The overall objective under the second National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (20182022) is to put in place, by 2050, the measures required to adapt the regions of metropolitan and overseas France to the regional climate changes that are anticipated. In keeping with its long-term targets under the Paris Agreement and relevant targets under other international agreements, France will need to adapt to the level of climate change made unavoidable by past GHG emissions that have accumulated in the atmosphere. France has chosen to base its work in this area on a hypothetical average global temperature increase of 2 °C compared to the pre-industrial era, despite its efforts at national and international level  therefore a vital complement to its climate change mitigation policy, which is aimed at achieving carbon neutrality.    By way of example, the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan, which was adopted in December 2018, provides for several measures promoting the adaptation of forests to climate change. Certain interactions between climate change and the energy system (in particular changing consumption levels in buildings) were taken into account when working on the MEP and the SNBC. Other topics currently being investigated include the impact of climate change on energy production and the security of supply, particularly within the framework of the provisional supply/demand balance sheet drawn up by RTE (the TSO). These topics will need to be examined in further depth when the national programmes are next updated.   Other policies and measures are outlined in Section 3.1.4.     2.1.2. Renewable energies  Targets relating to renewable energies are set under the Energy Code. It provides for an increase in the share of renewable energies to 23% of gross final energy consumption by 2020, and to 33% by 2030. By this date, renewable energies must account for at least 40% of electricity production, 38% of final heat consumption, 15% of final fuel consumption and 10% of gas consumption in order to achieve this target. The MEP 1 set targets by sectors.  Measures to promote renewable energies are determined to achieve the objectives set by law. Since these targets are expressed as percentages of renewable energies in relation to energy consumption, the target quantities of renewable energy depend on the amounts consumed. In turn, the amounts consumed depend on the macroeconomic context. The targets for 2028 are therefore expressed as a range (Scenario A and Scenario B) to ensure that the targets set by law can be achieved. Depending on the macroeconomic context, it may be necessary for the Government to step up its policy initiatives to maintain the same percentage use of renewable energies.  2.1.2.1. Renewable and recovered heating and cooling  The Energy Code sets a target of 38% for the share of renewable energies in final heat consumption by 2030. To achieve this target, it will be necessary to accelerate the increase in the share of renewable heating to an average of 1.2% per year, or in other words 1.5 times higher than the increase observed between 2010 and 2016. The Energy Code also sets the target of a five-fold increase in the amount of renewable and recovered heating and cooling supplied by district heating and cooling networks by 2030 (compared to the situation in 2012).  France also has European commitments, with a total target of 23% renewables by 2020, which means a target rate for renewable heat of 33% by 2020. This target does not seem attainable within the mandated deadline. The Renewable Energies Directive has recently been revised and published, and requires each Member State to increase its rate of renewable and recovered heat by at last 1.3 points each year between 2020 and 2030. This new target is compatible with the framework set by the LTECV and the targets imposed by the MEP.  The targets for renewable heating set by the MEP 2 can be seen in the table below.   62      Target in MEP for 2023  Low target in MEP for 2028  Scenario A  High target in MEP for 2028  Scenario B  Renewable heat  196 TWh  219 TWh  247 TWh  Targets have also been set per sector.

In multi-family dwellings, Scenario B corresponds to a total of 2.2 million air source heat pumps by 2028, which represents an increase by a factor of 2.9 in the total for 2017, with geothermal heat pumps being fitted in 1,000 multi-family dwellings per year.  In the tertiary sector, Scenario B corresponds to 114 million m² of floor area in tertiary buildings heated with air source heat pumps by 2028 (which represents a doubling of the figure for 2017).    2017  2023  2028,  Scenario A  2028,  Scenario B  Air source heat pumps  (TWh)  27.6  35  39  45  Geothermal heat pumps  (TWh)  3.14  4.6  5  7    Deep geothermal  Target for increase in heat produced from geothermal sources under the MEP 2:  2017  2023  2028, Scenario A  2028, Scenario B  1.18 (TWh)  2.9 (TWh)  4 (TWh)  5.2 (TWh)     63    Solar thermal  Target for the increase in heat produced from solar thermal sources under the MEP 2:  The targets for 2023 are based on the installation of around 100,000 m2 per year of solar thermal in the buildings sector (with half of this figure on privately owned buildings) and 150,000 m2 in the industrial sector (around 50 solar power plants).  The targets for 2028 are based on the installation of between 150,000 m² and 350,000 m² per year in the buildings sector (with 70% of this figure on privately owned buildings, and assuming significant developments in the field of combined solar systems) and 300,000 m² in the industrial sector (around 100 solar power plants).  2017  2023  2028, Scenario A  2028, Scenario B  1.18  1.75  1.85  2.5    Recovered heat  Targets for the development of recovered heat under the MEP 2:  The MEP sets a target for the delivery of recovered heat (industrial, data centres and waste) through district heating and cooling networks. Achieving these targets will necessitate a five-fold or six-fold increase in the amount of lost industrial heat that is recovered by 2028, improved recovery of lost heat from household waste treatment facilities, and the recovery of combustion heat from other waste such as solid recovered fuel. Scenario B for 2028 would result in an increase in the average recovery rate within networks of 0.8% per year over the period 20162028.   Lost industrial heat would account for 0.84 TWh by 2023 (which represents a doubling of the reference level for 2016) and between 2.3 TWh and 3 TWh by 2028 (which represents a fivefold or six-fold increase compared to the level for 2016);   Improved recovery of lost heat from household waste treatment facilities and the recovery of combustion heat from other waste such as solid recovered fuel would contribute 3.6 TWh to the networks by 2023 and between 5.3 TWh and 6.9 TWh by 2028 (whereby 50% of this figure is already accounted for in the biomass target).      2016  2023  2028  Scenario A  2028  Scenario B  Target (TWh) including renewable and recovered energies from domestic waste incineration plants  (DWIP)  3  4.47  7.6  9.9    Recovery of energy from waste  There is no quantitative target for the production of energy from waste. The ranges of values are specified in the relevant paragraphs.    Targets for the development of district heating and cooling networks  The targets correspond to an average of 60% of renewable and recovered energies supplied through the networks in 2023, and 65% in 2030. By 2030, the delivery of renewable and recovered district cooling through networks is forecast to have tripled; in other words, around 5 million living quarters (or equivalent) will be connected to such networks in 2030.   64      2018  2023  2028  Scenario A  2028  Scenario B  Delivery of renewable and recovered heat  (TWh)  14.1  24.4  31  36  Delivery of renewable and recovered district cooling (TWh)  0.76  1.1  1.4  2.7    2.1.2.2. Biofuels   In 2015, Directive 2015/1513 (ILUC12) set a target of 10% renewable energies in the transport sector by 2020, with a ceiling of 7% for biofuels in which production competes with food production and an indicative target of 0.5% by 2020 for advanced biofuels. The Directive contains a list of the feedstock that can be used to develop advanced biofuels. The Energy Code sets a more ambitious target of 15% renewable energies in the figure for final fuel consumption by 2030. To achieve this target, it will be necessary not only to increase the rate at which biofuels are incorporated into fuels, but also to step up efforts to develop alternative fuels that emit less carbon dioxide than traditional fossil fuels.   France has reached the ceiling of 7% for the incorporation of conventional biofuels into liquid fuels. One of the priorities of the MEP is to develop second-basis of waste and residues. This was a target set in the MEP adopted in 2016. The targets set in 2016 have been revised in the new MEP with a view to aligning them with the new definition of advanced biofuels in Directive ofuels that are produced from the feedstock listed in Part A of Annex  The target for the increase in biofuel consumption under the MEP 2:  To achieve the target for the incorporation of first-generation biofuels, it will be necessary to maintain and not exceed a level of 7% by 2023 and by 2028. An increase in the bio-based component of fuels must therefore be achieved exclusively through the development of advanced biofuels produced from the feedstock listed in Part A of Annex IX to Directive 2018/2001.  Heavy emphasis will be placed on compliance with the sustainability and traceability criteria for feedstocks while engaging in efforts to achieve the targets that have been set. In particular, France hopes to develop advanced biofuels for modes of transport that will be difficult to electrify, especially aviation.    Rate of incorporation of advanced biofuels into fuels released for consumption  2016  2023  2028  Target for the petrol sector (%)  nd  1.2  3.8  Target for the diesel sector (%)  nd  0.4  2.8    The table above shows the percentage share of fuels (in terms of energy) to be achieved by advanced biofuels. To ensure that this target can be achieved, the energy content of advanced biofuels will be eligible for double-counting. It will be possible to add advanced biofuels used in kerosene to the  12 . Directive (EU) 2015/1513 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 September 2015 amending Directive 98/70/EC relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (Text with EEA relevance) (ILUC).    65    numerator when calculating progress towards the achievement of the target for the heating oil sector, and they will be eligible for an additional multiplier of 1.2.

Electricity  The Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth set a target of 40% for the share of renewable energies in final electricity consumption by 2030. The electricity system will need to undergo a significant shift to achieve this target, with growth in all renewable energy segments. The specific nature of this growth will depend on the volume of energy available in each segment, its maturity and its competitiveness.    Hydropower  The target for the increase in installed hydropower generation capacities under the MEP 2:  the target that has been set involves increasing generation capacities by around 200 MW by 2023 and by between 900 and 1,200 MW by 2028, with an attendant rise in generation of approximately 3 to 4 TWh, around 60% of which will be achieved by optimising existing facilities.    2016  2023  2028, Scenario A  2028, Scenario B  25.3 GW  25.7 GW  26.4 GW  26.7 GW    Onshore wind  The target for the increase in installed wind generation capacity under the MEP 2:  The targets under the MEP (including repowering) are set out in the table.

Energy efficiency  2.2.1. The elements set out in point (a)(1) of Article 4  2.2.1.1. National contribution to the EU target of 32.5% by 2030  Article 1 of the Regulation on the governance of the Energy Union and Article 3(4) of Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency set a maximum figure for primary energy consumption in the EU of 1,273 Mtoe and for final energy consumption in the EU of 956 Mtoe by 2030, which is equivalent to a reduction of at least 32.5% compared to a trend-based reference scenario.  Articles L. 141-1 to L. 141-6 of the Energy Code, amended by the Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth of 17 August 2015, provide a framework for the MEP. The MEP sets priorities for government action in the field of energy within mainland France for the next 10 years, split into two periods of five years. The MEP that is currently being adopted covers two successive five-year periods: 20192023 and 2024
