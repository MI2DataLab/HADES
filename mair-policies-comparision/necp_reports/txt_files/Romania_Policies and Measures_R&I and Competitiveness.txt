3.5. Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness i. Policies and measures related to the elements set out in point 2.5 The programmes fostering research/innovation (R-I) activities, which are clustered around the relevant ministry, are designed under a generalised framework, fundamental research being considered the priority activity for any field, including the energy sector. Considering the current constraints, the development of this sector must rest upon the need to prioritize projects, thus making better use of the existing research infrastructures in Romania. The relevant policies and measures considered by Romania are described below and ordered by their interaction with other dimensions of the Plan: main vector in the trans-sectoral impact, secondary effect of measures pertaining to other dimensions and to the dimension concerned. Trans-sectoral policies and measures 1) R-I main dimension The adoption of advanced technologies in the energy sector is the main action line from the viewpoint of the research, innovation and competitiveness dimension. Moreover, this action line is purposed to support and to propagate beneficial effects through the research-innovation modules and the other INECP dimensions. From the viewpoint of decarbonisation and reduction of GHG emissions, the adoption of new technologies will be speeded up by strengthening a legal framework dedicated to the research-innovation activities, developing educational resources at all levels, increasing the number of research-innovation projects within State-owned companies, and tactical actions for specific initiatives, such as projects for promoting the use of hydrogen.  The organised efforts for the legal framework for granting tax facilities will thus be enhanced mainly by strengthening the following measures:  the additional deduction of research-development costs on calculation of the income tax;  the full exemption from the payment of the income tax for a period of ten years for companies carrying out solely research-development activities;  exemption from the payment of the income tax for the remuneration costs of persons included in the research-development and innovation projects;  the projects regarding intellectual property rights would require designing a favourable legal framework. From this viewpoint, measures may be provided for the investment effort at the stage of research or for the operating period. A good practice example consists in levying a low tax for profits gained from the use of intellectual property rights;  the selection of priority areas and the tactical initiatives presented in the INECP must be completed by streamlined public procurement procedures. Considering the current situation and the incipient context, this support must be allocated specifically for projects targeting research/development or the implementation of pilot projects for the areas covered by INECP. In the same context of interaction with the decarbonisation objectives, incipient segments such as contribution of alternative fuels (e.g. hydrogen) may be accelerated by dedicated measures The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         by fostering research and demonstration projects (the sustainable development of hydrogen production from renewable sources within the territory of Romania to the extent possible). Romania could thus provide support for research projects targeting hydrogen and facilitate the implementation of pilot and demonstration projects that are likely to contribute significantly to the achievement of the decarbonisation objectives by promoting the use of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen. The following main strategic areas are targeted:  Flexibility of the energy system. There is a significant opportunity of tapping the excess potential in generation of electricity from renewable sources to produce hydrogen by electrolysis;  Power transmission infrastructure. Romania may consider using the existing methane infrastructure for hydrogen transmission and distribution by injecting hydrogen into the public natural gas network on the short term (2025-2030) and the medium term (2030-2040) and by increasing hydrogen contribution to the long-term transmission and distribution network (>2040). Moreover, Romania plans to carry out an assessment in the period 2021-2022 regarding the possibility of injecting hydrogen in the form of synthesis gas from RES (after it has been brought to the standard of methane by reaction with CO2) in the natural gas transmission/distribution systems. The excess electricity from variable renewable sources, which is thus converted, could be transported on long distances and/or stored. In this way, transmission/distribution systems could be used at the optimum capacity for the entire technical lifetime without limitation to the period of extraction of gases from the internal onshore/offshore perimeters.  The review and then implementation of this alternative is likely to bring benefits to the economic development of Romania consistently with the European decarbonisation policies by increasing the use of RES in final consumption. The natural interaction of the R-I pillar with the decarbonisation objectives will be strengthened by adopting advanced technologies through specific initiatives for the RES components. The main measures will be the following:  developing solar power plants - supporting new research initiatives (e.g. start-up projects to enhance efficiency in the capturing of solar energy in thermally insulated panels) and supporting the marketing and quantification of potential prototypes;  developing projects on wind power plants - supporting local competence centres (e.g. the COMOTI National Research and Development Institute for Turbo Engines in Bucharest) to extend international collaboration, strengthening public-private partnerships, achieving know-how transfer to economic operators;  the development of storage capacities, as described in the paragraph applicable to energy security, will bring about additional benefits for the quantification of RES solutions at the energy system level, thus enhancing the decarbonisation phenomenon;  developing research and development of technologies for production of biofuels (e.g. production of advanced biofuels and coprocessing of oils) and biogas within the territory of Romania;  digitalisation of the energy system by developing Smart Grid projects and supporting the initiatives of Transelectrica/distribution operators. Moreover, the adoption of advanced technologies will constitute the main connection for the interaction with the objectives of the energy efficiency dimension. In order to quantify the beneficial effects, the implementation of storage solutions will be thus completed by the extended implementation of smart meters in order to improve energy consumption (details on measures and policies in Section 3.2.). The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         The implementation of these advanced technologies requires strengthening a vertical ecosystem on the value chain. Another core element in achieving the decarbonisation targets consists in fostering investments in the development of the RES equipment manufacturing industry and electromobility. The contribution of the policies pertaining to this key factor will be reflected in the positive impact on the RES and RES-T decarbonisation targets through the policies described in Section 3.1., with support through the following complementary actions:  supporting the scientific research for energy transition - RES, energy efficiency and electromobility technologies - by extending partnerships with private operators to participation in the current European initiatives;  adopting support measures including research, establishing common standards and developing the necessary infrastructure for electrical and hybrid vehicles. In regard to the internal market, research-innovation initiatives will be mainly supported by strengthening the public-private partnerships in order to achieve the gradual adoption of functional technologies and proven benefits in areas such as the Internet of Things, decentralised storage, blockchain and smart applications. 2) R-I - secondary dimension Having the role of support, the integration of R-I initiatives translates into the following: Decarbonisation  reduction of GHG emissions   Operational strengthening to ensure compliance with the environmental law and application of best international environmental protection practices by energy companies in the current activities and projects  Introduction of highly impactful economic incentives through price instruments for a green transport system  Support for investments in modernisation of holdings  Promotion of more condensed development measures, with combined utility, which are focused on transit activities as a mean to reduce distances covered by motor vehicles, to develop the infrastructure and to reduce maintenance costs Decarbonisation - pertaining to the industrial sector, through the implementation of best available technologies (BAT) in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to increase energy efficiency in the industrial sector. The main goal will be to attract new funding sources and to implement modern hydrogen type technologies in the industrial processes. The measures are described in Section 3.1. Energy security  The flexibility of the energy system by fostering development of the storage capacities -   Efforts will be strengthened to attract funding sources such as Horizon Europe or the ETS Mechanisms - Innovation Fund pertaining to storage of energy in the electricity grid or low-carbon mobility. Moreover, the aim will be to ensure active participation in the European Battery Alliance for local research centres with  relevant business scope (e.g. research centres for cryogenic and isotopic technologies and for alternative propulsion systems). On the short term, the Romanian State will provide for regulation for the purpose of quantifying the existing local projects (two objectives in the Constanta area), which are developed with the support of private operators, and inclusion of this topic among the strategic research and development priorities. The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan          In addition, by developing intermittent capacities and mechanisms for integration of RES into the NES, in electrical accumulator systems, including small storage capacities  Other policies/measures pertaining to the dimension Additional measures pertaining to the research, innovation, and competitiveness dimension in the energy sector, apart from the abovementioned interactions, are presented below:  Supporting education and promoting scientific research, security and health at work  Developing higher education in the field of energy and harmonising it with the energy sector needs Establishing partnerships with the energy industry for education and vocational training, fostering gender equality  Supporting vocational secondary education in the field of energy by fostering gender equality  Supporting fundamental and applied scientific research in the field of energy; developing partnerships with the energy industry  Developing the capacity for attracting European and international funding sources for scientific research by participation of research-development-innovation institutes in international consortiums  Continuing vocational training programmes for administrative specialists in the energy sector  Continuing training for prevention of occupational risks, protection of health and security of workers, removing the risk and accident factors  Increasing the number and quality of human resources in R&D activities in priority fields by incentivising young independent teams, scholarships for junior researchers, international mobility projects and projects for reintegration of researchers in the diaspora  Building on the high level of specialisation reached in nuclear research by developing technologies for advanced generation IV reactors and developing the infrastructure for lead-cooled fast reactors under a European and international partnership  Conceptual development, construction and operation of research infrastructures described in the national roadmap seeking streamlining with the ESFRI infrastructures and the SET plan (e.g. ALFRED or CCAP) by providing for investment funds and supporting the development of human resources  Preparing specialists according to the new relevant requirements  Developing research partnerships to improve the quality of life  Fostering research, development and innovation activities in the transport sector  Creating new jobs, professional qualifications and opportunities for SMEs in the transport and energy efficiency sector In addition, the 2014-2020 National Strategy for Research, Development and Innovation includes general measures that are also applicable to the energy sector. Therein the field of energy is mainly approached from the viewpoint of the measures fostering smart specialisation. They are expressed by permanently building on the high level reached in nuclear research by developing technologies for advanced generation IV reactors and developing the research infrastructures for lead-cooled fast reactors under a European and international partnership. Moreover, the aim is to ensure enhanced tapping of fossil fuels, diversification of national sources, multifunctional transport (smart grids), enhanced energy efficiency at the consumer and quantification of the smart city concept. Romania plans to achieve tangible progress with the implementation of the projects described in the national roadmap by ensuring the staggered funding of research infrastructures and of The 2021-2030 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan         existing maintenance and operation costs, building new infrastructures to meet specific demands and meeting the previously made European commitments. The projects for the development of the research infrastructure in the field of energy are listed in Section 4.6. ii. Where applicable, cooperation with other Member States in this area, including, where appropriate, information on how the SET Plan objectives and policies are being translated to a national context Cooperation with other states is described according to applicability from the viewpoint of the projects on the roadmap - Section 4.6.i. iii. Where applicable, financing measures in this area at national level, including Union support and the use of Union funds Romania must draw on the major opportunity provided by the new Horizon Europe Programme that will mobilise funds worth over EUR 100 billion for research and innovation in the period 2021-2027 (of which EUR 2,4 billion for the Euratom Programme). Horizon Europe will be a continuation of the Horizon 2020 Programme, which funded over 18 000 projects with over EUR 31 billion, which makes it the most ambitious innovation programme ever54. Romania plans to identify solutions that are applicable to Horizon Europe so as to enable the Framework Programme, such as extension of participation, streamlining of procedures or a non-discriminatory remuneration policy for all participants in FP9 should be furthered in the new Framework Programme. projects will be reviewed in the light of new funding sources. In order to fund research, innovation and competitiveness projects, the financing sources detailed in point 5.3.i will also be considered.                                                   54 Source: European Commission, EU Budget for Research and Innovation, which is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/budget-proposals-research-innovation-may2018_en.pdf
