2.2. Dimension of energy efficiency i. The elements set out in point (b) of Article 4 Hungary's energy efficiency target is to ensure that the country's final energy consumption does not exceed the value of 2005 in 2030 (785 PJ), either. If final energy consumption exceeds the level for 2005, such increase should exclusively derive from carbon neutral energy resources. The reduction of energy consumption is obviously a priority, but energy consumption in either the industry or in transport should not be limited to this end in case of economic growth. We aim to ensure that GDP growth exceeds the rate of the increase in energy consumption at a growing rate. Based on the method presented in the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, the cumulative end-use energy saving obligation for the 20142020 period amounts to 167.5 PJ. Eurostat introduced the 2020-2030 final energy indicator to calculate the energy efficiency targets of Member States based on a single methodology and to allow comparison with the previous programming period. Based on the above method, the cumulative final energy consumption savings obligation relating to the 20212030 period, not including reduction options, equals 331.23 PJ, which can be achieved with steady annual savings of 7 PJ, assuming steady 0.8 % annual savings and policy measures spanning the entire period, compared to the trajectory calculated without these. Fulfilment of the energy saving target prescribed in the Energy Efficiency Directive25 is a serious challenge in all areas. The energy efficiency programmes and measures introduced in the 2014-2020 period result in approximately 3-4 PJ final energy savings annually for final customers, thus it is necessary to roughly double current savings in the next period.  ii. Milestones relating to 2030, 2040 and 2050, not involving commitments; measurable result indicators drawn up on a national level and their contribution to the EU energy efficiency objectives, once these are included in the trajectories determined in long-term strategies aimed at the renovation of privately and publicly owned residential and non-residential buildings, in harmony with Article 2(a) of Directive 2010/31/EU                                                       24 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, amending Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC.  25 Directive (EU) 2018/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 amending Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency.   The drawing up of the long-term energy efficiency roadmap relating to Hungary's building stock is in progress. The drawing up of the roadmap may commence after the approval and processing of Commission guidelines concerning Article 2(a), enacted after the amendment of Directive 2010/31/EU in 2018. The renewed survey of the national building stock, based on the building certification method modified in consideration of new international standards, is expected to be carried out in 2020. In accordance with our Union obligations26, we are drawing up and implementing a long-term renovation strategy. According to data of the National Building Energy Performance Strategy (NBEPS) in effect, approximately 40 % of primary energy is consumed in buildings, with residential buildings accounting for the largest share of about 60 %.27 According to Eurostat28 some 35%, primarily from the energy use of buildings. According to data of the HEA relating to household energy consumption29, much (three fourths) of the energy consumption of Hungarian households is related to heating, most of which is supplied with natural gas (retail consumption accounts for about half of national gas consumption). The production of domestic hot water, lighting and use of electronic devices (with a share of one tenth, respectively) are two other areas with high energy consumption. Thus, in relation to residential buildings the biggest potential for energy savings lies in the modernisation of buildings and heating systems. We estimate that the modernisation of the residential building stock aimed at improved energy efficiency and a growing transition to alternative heating methods can replace up to one quarter of natural gas imports (annual natural gas consumption of ~2 billion m3). Retail modernisation projects will be implemented on a market basis, within the framework of the planned energy efficiency obligation scheme, thus most of the costs thereof will not be borne by households or the State budget. The deep renovation of 3 % of the floor area of the central government building stock annually is also a strategic objective.                                                       26 Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings and Directive (EU) 2018/844 amending Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency; Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, amending Regulations (EC) No 663/2009 and (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directives 94/22/EC, 98/70/EC, 2009/31/EC, 2009/73/EC, 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2013/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directives 2009/119/EC and (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council. 27 National Building Energy Performance Strategy (2015), p. 24; https://www.kormany.hu/download/d/85/40000/Nemzeti%20E%CC%81pu%CC%88letenergetikai%20Strate%CC%81gia%20150225.pdf 28 https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitViewTableAction.do 29 http://mekh.hu/download/5/13/90000/8_1_Haztartasok_felhasznalasa_eves.xlsx  iii. Where applicable, other national objectives, including long-term targets or strategies and sectoral targets, and national objectives in areas such as energy efficiency in the transport sector and with regard to heating and cooling A key objective is sustainable and climate-friendly energy management even by maintaining and further increasing industrial output. The competitiveness of energy and GHG intensive industrial activities is guaranteed by their ability to not exceed the unit energy consumption and GHG emissions of their European industrial competitors. In parallel with maintaining the existing energy intensive industrial sectors, from an energy strategic point of view future industrial investments should be made in low energy and GHG intensive, high-tech industrial sectors that support the sustainable and competitive development of the Hungarian economic structure. To reduce increasing energy consumption in transport, it is essential to develop and increase the use of public transportation, and to offer the carriage of goods by rail as a realistic option for freighting. Owing to the high useful efficiency of electric motors, the spread of electromobility clearly leads to energy savings for final customers. With the implementation of the Green Bus Programme  aimed at the greening of local transport  by 2030 only environmentally friendly electric buses will be used in long distance public transport. Point v. of Chapter 2.1.2 presents the district heating targets.
