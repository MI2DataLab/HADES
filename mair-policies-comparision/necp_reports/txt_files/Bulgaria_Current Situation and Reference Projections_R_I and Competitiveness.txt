4.6 Research, innovation and competitiveness dimension i. Current situation of the low-carbon-technologies sector and, to the extent possible, its position on the global market (that analysis is to be carried out at Union or global level) Owing to the efforts of academic and technical communities in Bulgaria, energy saving technologies, which lead to significant energy cost reductions and improve comfort and living conditions, have been developing at a fast pace. Innovations in the energy sector will contribute both to achieving overall energy cost reductions and imposing new energy efficiency standards. They will also bring about a shift towards lower and more sustainable energy consumption. The Innovation Strategy for Smart Specialisation 2014-20202020 identifies as a priority area the development of clean technologies with a focus on transport and energy (energy storage, saving and efficient allocation, electrical vehicles and eco-mobility, hydrogen-based models and technologies, waste-free technologies, technologies and methods that include by-products and materials from one production in other productions). The Ministry of Economy has launched the development of the Innovation Strategy for Smart Specialisation 20212027, along with an Action Plan to it.   228  ii. Current level of public and, where available, private research and innovation spending on low-carbon-technologies, current number of patents, and current number of researchers In 2018, total research and development (R&D) costs in Bulgaria in all sectors stood at 0.75 % of GDP (against an EU average of 2.11 % according to Eurostat data). In 2017, R&D costs in the private sector stood at 0.53 % (as compared to the EU average of 1.36 %), despite the significant improvement compared to 2007, particularly in the sector of Information and Communication Technologies. The share of large multinational companies in R&D investment account for more than half of total investments in the business sector. Regional concentration is also a prominent feature of the process, with more than 70 % of R&D activity concentrated in the Southwest region, and more specifically Sofia. In 2017, R&D costs in the public sector stood at 0.21 % of GDP as compared to the EU average of 0.69 %. In 2018, Bulgaria doubled its R&D budget with a view to supporting the implementation of the Scientific Research Strategy for the period 2017-2030 and had committed to gradually increase public spending on R&D to 1 % of GDP in 2025. Bulgaria finances public research institutions on the basis of effectiveness criteria and has developed national research programmes with the aim of consolidating research potential vestment. In the multi-annual financial framework for the period 20142020, the financial envelope from the EU Structural and Investment Funds earmarked as support intended to help Bulgaria address reform challenges is in the amount of EUR 11.7 billion or approximately 2.8 institutions, innovative companies and researchers have received grants from other sources and EU programmes, such as the Horizon 2020 Programme. Their currently stands at approximately EUR 65 million EU financing helps companies and research institutions mobilise additional private investments. Grant assistance from the European Regional Development Fund alone has generated approximately EUR 113 million in additional private capital for companies. A total of 5.2 % of the financing available under the European Regional Development Fund has been earmarked for RD&I and SMEs, entrepreneurship, energy efficiency, urban development and environmental management. These funds will help raise an additional EUR 247 million in public and private investment. Six infrastructure and innovation projects in which Bulgaria will participate have been approved to date. Their total amount is EUR 302 million, which is expected to generate EUR 769 million in additional investments. iii. Breakdown of current price elements that make up the main three price components (energy, network, taxes/levies) The projected prices of electricity under the currently prevailing conditions until 2040 are shown in the charts below.   229  Figure 68: Projected average price of electricity, EUR/MWh, WEM scenario  Average price of electricity Excise duty and VAT (EUR/MWh) Average price of electricity before tax (EUR/MWh) Average price of electricity after tax (EUR/MWh) Source: (B)EST model, E3-Modelling Under the WEM scenario in the period 2020-2040 the price of electricity after tax is projected to increase, reaching EUR 122 per MWh. The projected average price of electricity before tax includes the price of electricity plus the prices for access to and transmission of electricity via the national grid and distribution networks. The price projections correspond to the values shown in Figure 67. The projection includes excise duty and VAT but does not include public service obligation costs.

Description of energy subsidies, including for fossil fuels Bulgaria does not provide energy subsidies, including for fossil fuels.  In order to achieve the targets for the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption and create incentives for heat and electricity cogeneration in accordance with Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency and the provisions laid down in national law, along with the Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy for the period 2014-2020, support is provided under the following schemes:  RES schemes SA.44840  Support for renewable energy generation in Bulgaria in accordance with the Renewable Energy Sources Act; Under the scheme operational support is granted to the producers of electricity from renewable sources in the form of preferential prices for electricity from renewable sources in accordance with the provisions laid down in the ZEVI.  In Commission Decision No C (2016) 5205 final of 4.8.2016 regarding assisting the production of energy from renewable sources in Bulgaria  SA.44840 (2016/NN), the European Commission concluded that the measure represented State aid within the meaning of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).  internal market within the meaning of Article 107(3)(c) of the TFEU, provided that certain requirements are met. In order to ensure compliance with Commission Decision on State aid C(2016) 5205 final of 4.8.2016, Bulgaria its amended and supplemented the Renewable Energy Sources Act (SG No 91 of 2 November 2018). The estimated budget of the State aid scheme is BGN 13 227 144 000 (EUR 6 772 419 550). The State aid measure has been notified in accordance with proper procedure. It entered into force on 3 May 2011 and will expire on 31 December 2021. Support scheme for electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration  SA.56326 In 2019, the Energy Sector Act was amended in order to bring it in line with Articles 30 and 110 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy for the period 2014-2020. In connection with this, a State aid scheme for electricity produced by combined high efficiency heat and power cogeneration (SA.56326) was notified to the European Commission. Under the scheme preferential prices/premiums are granted for electricity produced by combined high efficiency heat and electricity cogeneration plants, on the condition that the electricity has been registered by a certificate of origin issued by the Electricity and Water Regulation Commission. Granting support under Article 10c [sic] of Directive 2003/87/EC In accordance with Article 10(c) [sic] of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas   231  emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC Bulgaria has used the opportunity to allocate emission allowances free of charge to electricity plants during the period 2013-2020. By Decisions C92012) 4560 of 6.7.2012 and C (2013) 8455 final of 4.12.2013 [on State aid SA 34385 (2013/N)] the European Commission granted Bulgaria a derogation under Article 10(c)(5) [sic] of Directive 2003/87/EC. The National Investment Plan (NPI) covers all operators who meet the requirements for the derogation envisaged in Article 10(c) [sic] of Directive 2003/87/EC. The implementation of the investment projects set out in the NPI is to ensure a sustainable transition to a low-carbon economy by means of upgrading existing plants, deploying clean technologies, reconstructing and upgrading infrastructure, and diversifying the energy mix and sources of energy supply. A total of 54 168 005 GHG emission allowances have been earmarked for allocation over the entire NPI implementation period (2013-2020). In 2020, no allowances are to be allocated under the NPI because 2020 is a reporting year for the allowances allocated in 2019, when the last payments from the NPI account will be made. Granting support under Article 10c of Directive*EU) 2018/410 Wishing to modernise its energy sector and in accordance with Article 10(c) of Directive (EU) 2018/410 [amending Directive 2003/87/EC] to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments, and Decision (EU) 2015/1814, Bulgaria will use the possibility for transitional free allocation of greenhouse gas emissions allowances to electricity generation during the fourth stage of EU ETS transition period 2021-2030. To this end, the National Investment Framework for the period 2021-2030 will be implemented, which envisages a possibility to free allowances to be allocated to operators against an obligation to invest in energy sector modernisation. Direct and indirect subsidies planned In accordance with Directive (EU) 2018/410 of 14 March 2019 by 30 September 2019 Bulgaria fulfilled its obligation to notify the European Commission of its intention to derogate from Article 10(c) of said Directive by allocating, free of charge and on a transitional basis, greenhouse gas emission allowances to electricity generation plants with a view to enhancing cost-efficient reductions of GHG emissions and low-carbon investments during the fourth stage of EU ETS transition period 2021-2030. The total allowances to be allocated free of charge will not exceed 40 % of the allowances Bulgaria will receive in accordance with Article 10(2)(a) for the transition period 2021-2030, divided in equal annual quantities. Implementation of a market-oriented capacity mechanism for a period of 10 years In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/943 on the internal market for electricity, which grants Member States the possibility to apply a capacity mechanism, where they have concerns in respect of the adequacy of national resources and the mechanism functions in line with market principles and the requirements for the limit values of 550 gCO2 of fossil fuel per kWh of electricity and the limit value of 350 kg CO2 of fossil fuel on average per year per installed kW from 1 July 2025.   232  Bulgaria will focus its efforts on developing and implementing a capacity mechanism that ensures the security and adequacy of the system and enables electricity producers to receive an additional income from participating in the market for electricity
