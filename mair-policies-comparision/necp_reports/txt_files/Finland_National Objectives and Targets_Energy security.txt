2.3 Dimension energy Securityi. The elements set out in point (c) of Article 4ii. National objectives with regard to increasing: the diversification of energy sources and supply from third countries; for the purpose of increasing the resilience of regional and national energy systemsThe Government Decision on the Targets of Security of Supply (1048/2018) outlines the targets for the security of energy supply. The security of energy supply must be based on diverse energy sources and fuels, sufficient and decentralised energy production and reliable transmission and supply systems. The security of energy supply is based on well-functioning energy markets, a clear long-term energy policy that encourages investments, and energy efficiency.1919 Government decision on the objectives of security of supply, Chapter 3.1. https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2013/2013085767Under the Government decision, for Finland to be prepared for disruptions in the availability of energy and to meet the commitments under international agreements, requires the National Emergency Supply Agency to hold imported fuels in state-owned reserves to last for an average of five months at normal consumption rates. The implementation of this obligation is constantly monitored and, as necessary, the quantities, qualities and locations of export fuels are changed to align to the situation prevailing at any given time.The Government decision on the targets of security of supply also states that the use of peat in combined power and heat generation must be secured. To ensure availability should weather risks be realised, the target is to have peat reserve stocks covering six months™ use at the beginning of the peat production season.International cooperation is constantly developing and intensifying. In the past few years, there has been significant development in cooperation with the EU, the IEA, the Nordic countries and NATO. Of the Nordic countries, Finland has agreements concerning security of supply with Sweden and Norway. Also, the relationships with the security of supply authorities of Estonia have intensified. The National Emergency Supply Agency has together with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs invested in the personnel resources of international cooperation in the field of security of supply.According to the recent market report by the Finnish Energy Authority20, the total installed generation capacity in Finland at the end of 2018 was about 17,600 MW. However, no more than 12,000 MW of the installed capacity (including peak load reserves) is estimated to be available during peak demand. This is due to the unavailability of thermal power plants and the unpredictable nature of wind power. Consumption peaks occur during the winter months and are highly affected by outdoor temperature and length of cold spell.Table 9 below shows the highest hourly electricity demands in 2011Œ2018 and the actual electricity generation during peak consumption and the highest annual 20 Energy Authority, National Report 2018 to the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators and to the European Commission - Finland. 11.7.2019. https://energiavirasto.fi/documents/11120570/13026619/Raportti-National-report-2019-Finland/5f0408b2-5903-11cf-29a3-3a6d0ed0d2a5/Raportti-National-report-2019-Finland.pdf68generation for 2011Œ2018. The table shows that the record peak consumption of 15,105 MW was in 2016. During last winter (2018Œ2019), the highest hourly load was 14,062 MWh/h. The consumption peak is closely related to the weather conditions.Table 9. The peak hourly electricity consumption in Finland 2011Œ2018.

Where applicable, national objectives with regard to reducing energy import dependency from third countries, for the purpose of increasing the resilience of regional and national energy systemsThe National Energy and Climate Strategy sets a national target of 55 % for energy self-sufficiency. The target has been set according to the national rules for calculation and does not include electricity produced with nuclear power in Finland. National targets related to energy self-sufficiency also include the decision to ban the use of coal for use in energy production by 2030 and to halve domestic use of mineral oil (petrol, diesel oil, light and heavy fuel oil, aviation fuels) compared to 2005 levels by 2030.In addition, the opening of the gas market from the beginning of 2020, the construction of the Balticconnector gas pipeline and the related objective of creating a regional gas market comprising Finland and the Baltic states will reduce the dependency on natural gas imported from Russia.21 Finnish Energy Authority.

National objectives with regard to increasing the flexibility of the national energy system, in particular by means of deploying domestic energy sources, demand response and energy storage.The National Energy and Climate Strategy and the Medium-term Climate Change Policy Plan have set the objective to increase the share of biofuels to 30 % of fuels used in road transport and to replace 10 % of light fuel oil use with bioliquids. The majority of biofuels and bioliquids are estimated to be domestic and their raw materials are estimated to include biodegradable waste, side streams of the forest and other industries, and logging residues. The act concerning the quota obligation for biofuel use in transport and in heating was passed in spring 2019 and entered into force on 1 April 2019.As for the transport sector, the objective is also to increase the number of electric cars to at least 250,000 and the number of gas-powered cars to at least 50,000 by 2030. The majority of the gas used in transport is domestic biogas. Domestic energy sources account for a large share also in Finland™s electricity production.The objectives of the National Energy and Climate Strategy to increase the number of renewable sources of energy described in Chapter 2.1.2 also promote the diversification of energy sources. Finland has not set specific objectives for the diversification of deliveries from third countries. National objectives are mainly related to reducing the dependency on imports from third countries (see the next section). Regarding imported fuels, the oil and coal markets are global, so it is possible to switch supply sources even within a short period of time. To prepare for possible supply disruptions, compulsory stockpiles related to the security of supply of oil products and coal are held. As regards natural gas, the already completed LNG terminals, those under construction and the Balticconnector gas pipeline enable a decentralised supply of gas.Decentralised electricity and heat production based on renewable energy will be promoted. An effort will be made to increase decentralised small-scale production, mainly on market terms and through economic incentives through the electricity markets and taxation. The interest of citizens, companies and the public sector in utilising renewable sources in the energy solutions of individual buildings will be encouraged through guidance with information and local reference sites.70Finland has been at the forefront of promoting real-time price signals for consumers. As required by legislation, smart electricity meters were effectively installed at all customers already in 2013. All customers have the possibility of choosing an electricity contract with dynamic pricing. At the end of 2018, approximately 9 % of retail customers had a dynamic electricity price contract23.Consumer protection and competitiveness in the retail sector are reflected in measures aimed at curbing hefty single price increases, such as the legislation that lays down restrictions on the annual price increases of electricity transmission charges. Also, other means are currently under consideration by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.The role of flexibility and demand response was further emphasised in the National Energy and Climate Strategy. Based on the strategy, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment tasked a large working group (Smart Grid Working Group) to find ways to promote further customers™ participation in the electricity markets and resource adequacy in 2016. The working group completed its work in October 2018 and gave concrete proposals on how to improve the situation24. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment is currently implementing these proposals in parallel with the Clean Energy Package implementation
