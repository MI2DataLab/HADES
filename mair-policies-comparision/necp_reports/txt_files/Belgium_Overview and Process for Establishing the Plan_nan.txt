3 1. Overview and process for establishing the plan 1.1. Executive summary i. Political, economic, environmental and social context of the plan Political context (1) Belgium is a federal state in which decision-making power is shared between a Federal Government and three Regions (Wallonia, Flanders and the Brussels Capital Region), as well as three Communities (the Flemish Community, the French Community and the German-speaking Community). The Regions are responsible for areas such as rational use of energy, promotion of renewable energy sources, public transport, transport infrastructure, urban and rural planning, agriculture and waste management. The Federal State is responsible for many aspects of fiscal policy, as well as for policies on goods (standards, fuel quality, labelling and performance standards for household and industrial appliances, etc.). It has overall responsibility for nuclear energy and   territorial waters, which means that it is also responsible for the development of offshore wind farms. Through its complementary policies in areas ranging from taxation to biofuels, bicycles, product standards, energy efficient public buildings and railways, the Federal Government supports the Regions in their climate and air quality policies. These complementary policies, in addition to the forecasts for offshore wind energy, represent -2030 climate and energy package (2). Responsibility for energy is shared under the Law of 8 August 1980. the division of powers, several bodies have been set up to foster cooperation and consultation between the various levels of authority and to ensure consistency between the actions of the Federal State and its component entities. The three Regions and the Federal Government collaborate closely and continually on energy and climate policy. The work is coordinated within various forums, including: - the energy policy coordination platform known as CONCERE/ENOVER; - the Coordination Committee for International Environmental Policy (Comité de coordination des /Coördinatiecomité Internationaal Milieubeleid); - the National Climate Commission (Commission nationale du climat/Nationale Klimaatcommissie  CNC/NKC). The National Climate Commission is the central coordinating body for national climate policy. Established by the cooperation agreement of 14 November 2002, the CNC is responsible for developing and monitoring the national climate plan and for complying with EU and international reporting obligations. The CNC is made up of representatives from the four entities concerned. Under the terms of the cooperation agreement between the Federal State and the Regions on energy coordination signed on 18 December 1991, the Federal Government and the three regional governments set up an official body for the discussion and coordination of all energy-related issues, known as CONCERE/ENOVER (Groupe de Concertation État-/Energie-Overleggroep Staat-Gewesten). This CONCERE body meets once a month and has several permanent and ad hoc thematic working groups on national, European and international priorities. In connection with the preparation of the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), a steering group (CONCERE-CNC PNEC 2030) was set up to provide guidance and coordination. The steering group is composed of representatives from the climate and energy agencies of the Federal Government and each Region. With this aim in mind, CONCERE and the CNC adopted a working methodology that included a mandate for the steering group.                                                             1 Government agreement of October 2014. 2 Government agreement of October 2014. 4   Economic context (3) Belgium has a very open economy, situated at the heart of a region of intense economic activity. The Belgian economy is dominated by industry and the tertiary sector. Gross domestic product (GDP) stood at EUR 459.6 billion in 2018 (average GDP growth from 2005 to 2018: 1.4%). Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions stabilised between 1990 and 2005 and are now on a downward trend (-19.7% in 2016 compared with 1990 levels). The main drivers of this decoupling are greater use of gaseous fuels (reduction in the use of liquid and solid fuels), increased energy efficiency, and changes in the structure of the economy (fewer energy-intensive industries such as steel, and more added value in less energy-intensive sectors such as the tertiary and retail sectors). GHG emissions per unit of GDP were 277 tonnes per billion euro in 2016 (excluding land use, land-use change and forestry  LULUCF). Energy Energy intensity has been on a downward trend since 1990, reflecting the decoupling of economic growth and primary energy consumption. In terms of the market share of total final consumption, petroleum products remain the principal source of energy (43%), followed by natural gas (27%) and electricity (20%). The residential and tertiary sectors are the main consumers of final energy (40% in 2017), followed by industry (30%) and transport (30%). Natural gas is the dominant fuel in the industrial and residential sectors (38% and 40% respectively in 2015). In the transport sector, energy consumption is dominated by petroleum products (93%). Belgium has limited energy resources; its total primary energy production accounts for about 30% of its total primary energy consumption. It is therefore dependent on other countries for its fossil fuel supply. Nuclear energy (nuclear heat) accounts for 74primary energy production. The proportion for renewable fuels and waste is 26%. In recent years, Belgium has made progress in developing renewable energy. In 2016, renewable energy accounted for 8.65% of total final energy consumption. Transport Belgium is covered by an extensive network of inland waterways and an extremely dense communication network (road and rail). As Belgium is a transit country, transport is a fast-growing sector. Road transport is the most energy-intensive form of transport in Belgium. The number of private vehicles is growing steadily (Belgium has an extremely high level of car ownership, with one car for every two inhabitants). Road transport still accounts for the bulk of land goods transport. Demand for fossil fuels in this sector is expected to continue to rise. Industry Although the importance of the industrial sector (particularly heavy industry) in the economy has declined since accounting for almost 15% of GDP). The principal contributing factors to industrial GHG emissions covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) are energy transformation (mainly attributable to electricity and heat production, but also oil refining), industrial processes (notably the chemical, mineral products and metal industries), and energy combustion in manufacturing industries (steel, chemicals, food and beverage production, cement).                                                            3 Joint General Policy Declaration of the Government of the Brussels Capital Region and the Joint Board of the Common Community Commission, 2019-2024 parliamentary term. 5 In 2015, non-ETS industrial GHG emissions accounted for 24% of all industrial emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes. These included nitrous oxide (N2O), fluorinated gases (F-gases) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Waste Waste production rose by 24% between 2004 and 2014. Significant improvements in waste treatment have considerably reduced the amount of waste sent to landfill. Housing stock Since 1995, the number of buildings has increased by 12%; over the same period, the number of households has of heating. The number of homes with energy-consuming appliances is continuing to rise. Agriculture s and horticultural crops, cereals, potatoes, sugar beet, livestock farming and dairy production. Although 44%) is used for agriculture than for any other purpose, the number of farms has continued to decline in recent years.  the Belgian economy is steadily falling and now represents less than 1% of GDP. Despite high population density, the proportion of forests and other natural habitats remains relatively stable (23% of the land area).   Environmental context The diagram below shows the contribution of the main sectors of the economy  Contribution of the main sectors to total GHG emissions in 2017  The following diagram summarises the impact of the main sectors on the national trend. It clearly shows the sharp increase in road transport and the rise in emissions from commercial buildings.   6 Trends in GHG emissions from the main sectors between 1990 and 2017  In Belgium as a whole, total GHG emissions (ETS and non-ETS combined) fell by 20.2% in 2017 compared with 1990 levels, and by 21.9% if we take 1995 as the baseline for fluorinated gases (excluding LULUCF). The largest contribution to total emissions is that of CO2, which accounted for 85.2% of emissions in 2017. Methane (CH4) emissions make up the second-largest share at 7%, while N2O emissions represent an additional 5.2% (the remaining 2.6% is fluorinated gases). In 2017, ETS and non-ETS emissions fell by 28% and 16% respectively compared with 2005 levels. Emissions from energy consumption (i.e. Sector 1 of the Common Reporting Framework  CRF: energy, industry, transport, residential and tertiary in the main) contributed 73% to total emissions in 2017 (excluding LULUCF). Since 1990, these emissions have declined by around 20%. Emissions from the energy and manufacturing sectors have fallen by 33% and 42% respectively, while emissions from transport rose by 24% between 1990 and 2017. There has been a shift from solid fuels to gaseous fuels in the electricity generation sector and in industry. Combined with the development of biofuels in some sectors, this situation has resulted in a decrease in the level of CO2 emissions produced for a given level of energy consumption. Emissions from the residential and tertiary sectors fell in 2017 relative to previous years as a result of the change in the type of fuel used and better insulation. This is despite the upward trend observed in several indicators (such as the rise in the number of households and the number of workers in the tertiary and institutional sectors). Moreover, the trend for the tertiary sector since 1990 shows a net increase in emissions due to the growth in activity in this sector. Emissions from road transport have been rising steadily since 1990 due to growth in the number of cars and increasing traffic density. Nevertheless, growth in traffic has slowed considerably in recent years. Industrial processes and product use are the second biggest source of greenhouse gases in Belgium, accounting for 17% (ETS and non-ETS) of the national total in 2017. Since 1990, emissions have fallen by 25% due to investments in alternative fuels and in energy efficiency, and as a result of carbon leakage. This applies across all sectors, although the metal industry saw the sharpest decline on account of plant closures. Agriculture accounts for 9% of total emissions (mainly CH4 and N2O). Some CO2 emissions are caused by liming. Since 1990, emissions from this sector have fallen by 17% due to a decrease in emissions from enteric fermentation (linked to the reduction in the number of livestock and the shift from dairy cattle to breeding cattle) and farmland (decline in the use of synthetic fertilisers and reduction in the number of livestock, which in turn reduces the amount of nitrogen excreted on grazing land). LULUCF is both a carbon sink and a source of CO2 emissions. However, the LULUCF sector was a net sink in 2017, as it always has been in the past.  7 In 2017, the waste sector accounted for around 1.3% of the national total. Emissions come from waste incineration, (solid) landfill waste and wastewater treatment. Emissions from this sector have fallen steadily; in 2017, they were 66% below 1990 levels, mainly due to the recovery of biogas and its use in solid waste disposal.  Social context Belgium had 11,398,589 inhabitants as of 1 January 2018, representing 2.2% of the total population of the European Union (Belgium is the ninth most populous Member State in the EU). Belgium is very densely populated: with an average density of 371 inhabitants per km² (2018), it is the third most densely populated country in Europe. However, this density varies from one part of the country to another, with the north of the country being much more densely populated than the south. As of 1 January 2018, Flanders is home to 57.5% of the population, Wallonia 31.9% and the Brussels Capital Region 10.6%. Population density by municipality as of 1 January 2018  Source: FPS Economy  FPS Economy - Directorate-General Statistics and Economic Information Indisponible Not available Limites des provinces Provincial boundaries  intensity in 2017, at 10.5 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per capita, is significantly lower than in 1990 when it was 14 tonnes. Due to the significant contribution of energy-intensive industry to Belgian GDP, this figure is above the CO2 intensity for the EU, which fell from 12 tonnes to 8.8 tonnes per capita between 1990 and 2017. Statbel, the Belgian national statistics office, uses inability to pay energy bills as a measure of material poverty (defined as an inability to maintain an average standard of living and to cover the costs of rent, water, electricity, etc.). The percentage of the population in poverty was 5.1% in 2017.  Constituent parts of the National Energy and Climate Plan In preparing this initial Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan, cooperation and consultation with various other strategic areas was vital at both federal and regional level. As well as climate and energy, these areas included mobility, science policy, finance, defence and agriculture. Given the integrated nature of the plan, contributions from the various entities and agencies involved in these strategic areas proved essential. This was because many of the strategic objectives and measures overlap and/or have a direct or indirect impact on one or more strategic areas other than climate and energy. This approach also sought to confer a certain degree of 8 ownership on all the strategic areas involved. This ensured the necessary level of engagement when preparing entity-specific plans, ensuring that efforts required to achieve or deliver the agreed objectives and measures could be made.  Interfederal Energy Pact In the Interfederal Energy Pact of December 2017, Belgium reaffirmed its commitment to the Paris Agreement by putting particular emphasis on the transition to a low-carbon society. The Interfederal Energy Pact sets out a common ambition for the energy transition in Belgium. It is recognised by the three regional governments and the Federal Government as a significant statement of intent regarding their determination to complete the required energy transition. As such, it has informed the development of the various entity-specific plans that form the basis of this integrated NECP. us energy transition targets. It serves as the basis for a coherent medium- and long-system, setting out key measures to accelerate the energy transition. The Pact also gives an insight into the 2030 energy mix. energy consumption must be seen as horizontal measures. These should be integrated into the various relevant areas of public policy, including tax, health, mobility, employment, training, land use and the circular economy.  Entity-specific plans The decision to start with entity-specific plans as the basis for the final integrated plan was part of the steering h entity adopted its own approach to developing its plan, both in terms of content and implementation through consultation, etc. This integrated NECP contains the plans of the various Belgian entities.   Federal State Working methodology A federal task force, chaired by the Directorate-General for Energy of the Federal Public Service for the Economy and by the Directorate-General for the Environment of the Federal Public Service for Health, was created to coordinate the activities. The commitment of the other relevant Federal Public Services and entities (including the Federal Public Service for Mobility and Transport, the Régie des Bâtiments/Regie der Gebouwen [Government Buildings Agency], the Federal Public Service for Finance, the Federal Public Service for Defence, the Federal Public Service for Justice, the Federal Public Service for Foreign Affairs, etc.) to provide content contributions was critical in this respect.  The overall objective of the task force was (and is) to identify federal measures on the basis of the Interfederal Energy Pact and to incorporate them, including relevant opinions and alternative proposals, which eventually resulted in the federal contribution to this plan.  Additional policy measures requested by the regions The draft NECP approved on 18 December 2018 by the Consultation Committee stated as follows: The Federal Government is committed to reviewing and implementing regional proposals made under the NECP by the end of March 2019. Where appropriate, it will propose alternative federal policies and measures with a similar effect to compensate for any demands it cannot meet. On 10 May 2019 the Council of Ministers of the Federal Government approved the indicative list of additional federal measures in support of regional measures under the draft Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 9 2021-2030. These measures will be discussed with the Regions with the aim of  transition objectives towards a low-carbon economy.  Content The Federal Energy and Climate Plan, which was adopted by the Federal Government on 29 November 2019, is broadly based on the Federal Energy Strategy approved by the Federal Government on 30 March 2018. By approving the Belgian Interfederal Energy Pact as a constituent part of the Federal Energy Strategy, the Federal Government has once again confirmed its commitment to implementing the Paris Agreement by initiating the transition to a low-carbon society. In this way, the Federal Government is laying the groundwork for an energy system capable of ensuring a continuous, sustainable and affordable energy supply, and confirming its intention to do so as efficiently as possible. With the Energy Pact, the government has a solid basis for drawing up the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan and the associated federal contribution. However, the climate and energy transition not only common ambitions to be identified, but also every policymaker to be enabled to develop specific measures. The scale and time horizon of this challenge require daring to move away from the usual frameworks for reflection and to look beyond the normal parliamentary terms. This is essential if the objectives defined in the Federal Energy Strategy, the Energy Pact, the Climate and Energy Package, and the Paris Agreement are to be achieved. In addition to the Energy Pact and the contribution of all the federal agencies and entities concerned, as well as the analyses of the Federal Planning Bureau (Bureau fédéral du plan/Federaal Planbureau), the interparliamentary dialogue on climate, the input of the advisory councils, the European Commission recommendations, the results of the public and stakeholder consultations, the results of the regional consultation, and the points for attention raised by the Regions are also important sources of inspiration.  Flemish Region On 20 July 2018 the Flemish Government approved both the draft Flemish Climate Policy Plan 2021-2030 and the draft Flemish Energy Plan 2021-2030.  These plans were integrated into the draft Belgian Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030, which was approved by the Consultation Committee on 18 December 2018 and notified to the European Commission at the end of December 2018. Since the draft Flemish and Belgian plans were approved, various opinions/recommendations have been received, carefully studied and, where possible, integrated into the Flemish Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030 (VEKP) approved on 8 December 2019.  Walloon Region Energy and climate policy in Wallonia Parliamentary activities On 19 February 2014 the Walloon Parliament adopted the Climate Decree. Its purpose is to set short-, medium- and long-term greenhouse gas emission reduction goals and to put in place monitoring instruments. In particular, it provides for the setting of five-year by the Decree are as follows:  a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990;  an 80% to 95% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 compared with 1990. In order to achieve these goals, provision is made for the Walloon Government to produce an Air, Climate and Energy Plan (Plan Air-Climat-Energie  PACE) every five years, setting out all the measures to be taken in order to comply with the emission budgets. 10 On 23 November 2016 the Walloon Parliament adopted a decree approving the Paris Agreement (adopted on 12 December 2015). It then embarked on further legislative work. As a result, on 28 September 2017, the Walloon Parliament adopted a resolution on the implementation of a Walloon climate policy, thus -term climate policy that is coherent with the policies adopted by other Belgian entities. In this resolution, the Walloon Parliament asks the Walloon Government to adopt an ambitious policy and a strategy for the growth of renewable and sustainable energies allowing the goal of a 95% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (compared with 1990) to be achieved. The resolution makes direct reference to the process of drafting the NECP 2030. It (http://nautilus.parlement-wallon.be/Archives/2017_2018/RES/886_9.pdf).  Air, Climate and Energy Plans Wallonia is currently updating its climate policy on the basis of the Air, Climate and Energy Plan (PACE). (http://www.awac.be/images/Pierre/PACE/Plan%20Air%20climat%20énergie%202016_2022.pdf). In line with the procedure described in the Climate Decree, the Air, Climate and Energy Plan forms part of a dynamic process that involves annual reporting to the government and parliament, making it possible to amend the Plan either in response to feedback or in preparation for future legislative amendments. PACE 2016-2022 In accordance with the Climate Decree, the first draft Air, Climate and Energy Plan will apply until 2022 (i.e. over the first two periods). It was approved at first reading by the Walloon Government on 23 January 2014. It then underwent a public consultation process, during which a large number of comments were submitted. The amended version of the PACE 2016-2022, incorporating the outcomes of the public consultation, was adopted at second reading by the Walloon Government on 21 April 2016. PACE 2021-2030 The processes associated with implementing Quality Directive interact in various ways. The Walloon Government has therefore decided to combine and formalise measures relating to energy, climate and air quality in a new Air, Climate and Energy Plan for the period to 2030 (PACE 2030). This will include new policies and measures making it possible to achieve, by 2030, the energy and climate goals set under the Energy Union, and the air quality goals provided for in the revised National Emission Ceilings Directive. This integrated vision of air, climate and energy policies avoids conflicting or counterproductive measures, as the Energy and Climate Plan must take account of the impact of air quality measures. The draft PACE 2021-2030 was adopted by the Walloon Government on 4 April 2019. The resolution is available on the Walloon Parliamenhttp://nautilus.parlement-wallon.be/Archives/2017_2018/RES/886_9.pdf). (http://www.awac.be/images/Pierre/PACE/Plan%20Air%20climat%20énergie%202016_2022.pdf).  Brussels Capital Region Our way of living in the world in an increasingly urban context adds its share of constraints when it comes to dealing with the challenge of climate change. Cities are major centres of energy consumption and yet provide fascinating opportunities environment; by 2050, nearly three-quarters will live in cities. The urban area of Brussels serves as a good model for these issues. The Brussels Capital Region is a medium-sized city in global terms (between one and five million inhabitants). There are currently more than 400 (417) cities in this category, compared with only around 30 megacities. The solutions developed in Brussels are therefore likely to be of interest to a substantial and growing number of the global population. 11 The specific context of this Brussels plan is the Paris Agreement on climate change signed in December 2015, which, as the first universal climate agreement, aims to keep the global temperature rise below 2°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100 and, if possible, to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. With regard to the Belgian situation, on 14 December 2017 the Government of the Brussels Capital Region and the Walloon Government both adopted the Energy Pact, which outlines a clear energy vision for our country to 2050. On 30 March 2018 the Federal Government and the Flemish Government also signalled their approval of this pact. This vision, as it relates to the Brussels Capital Region for the coming decades, is set out in this document. Fully in line with the framework provided by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Brussels Capital Region aims to adopt a systemic approach by implementing these goals in a coordinated manner. In this respect, environmental policies, although necessary, are not in themselves sufficient. The government wants an ambitious response to the European goals and to the commitments made under the Paris Agreement, by developing a fair and proactive climate policy. To that end, it will develop a systemic, structural and structured approach. All regional levers will be mobilised to establish a new climate governance and to ensure that these climate and biodiversity challenges lead to regional decisions. Lastly, through its Regional Policy Statement (4), the new Brussels Government has committed to the following climate goals: - The region will develop a long-term strategy based on binding targets and an evaluation framework  - The government has set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. - The government will do its utmost to increase the European Union targets for the same deadline. - The government undertakes to get close to the European carbon neutrality target by 2050. This plan is based on other strategic plans. These are, in particular, the strategy for reducing the environmental impact of existing buildings, which is annexed to this document, and the Good Move regional mobility plan. On occasion, we will very briefly mention certain objectives or measures from these plans without, however, necessarily going into detail on them. We will refer the reader to these documents where appropriate. The WAM scenario projections will include these policies as far as possible.  From PACE to NECP 2030 Against this background, the Brussels Capital Region has decided to use this document to set new objectives and measures for 2030 and, where appropriate, to give an overview of the following decade to 2040, as suggested by the Governance Regulation. These objectives and measures will complement those already included in the Regional Air, Climate and Energy Plan adopted in 2016 (5). In order to combine these various planning exercises with the need to incorporate air, climate and energy measures and the ambitions of the Regional Policy Statement 2019-2024 (participation, air and climate objectives), a new Air, Climate and Energy Plan will be produced by mid-2023. The government will assess possible interactions between the PACE and the NECP 2030 as well as other planning tools.  ii. Strategy relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union overall philosophy and four pillars of the Interfederal Energy Pact:                                                            4 Joint General Policy Statement of the Government of the Brussels Capital Region and the Joint Board of the Common Community Commission, 2019-2024 parliamentary term. 5 Also called the Integrated Plan. 12 - Ensure sustainable, secure and affordable energy. The aim is to achieve an optimal balance between environmental efficiency, economic efficiency and social efficiency. - Put citizens at the heart of the energy system. Empower and encourage citizens and businesses to make the most effective and energy-efficient decisions in order to collectively achieve the overarching objectives through participation and information. - Maintain an affordable system for both large and small consumers. The global energy transition comes at a price, but the cost of failing to act would be even higher. The transition will also yield economic opportunities for Belgium. The focus will be on affordability and business competitiveness, as well as on vulnerable consumers. - Ensure participation and that initiatives at all levels of government are consistent. The focus will be on dialogue, inclusiveness, communication and consistency between the different levels of government to achieve a positive outcome.  This is reflected in this NECP for each dimension of the Energy Union as follows. 1. Dimension decarbonisation  Reduction in GHG emissions As part of the dimension decarbonisation, Belgium will reduce its GHG emissions by 35% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels for non-ETS sectors. Energy-intensive industry and the electricity sector come under the EU ETS. With this in mind, the EU ETS is designed as a harmonised instrument that reduces GHG emissions while largely preserving the competitiveness of businesses. In the past, Belgium has taken considerable steps to reduce greenhouse gases in the economy, to the point where several sectors have already adopted the most cost-effective measures possible. However, non-ETS sectors will have to move up a gear before 2030 and their GHG emissions will have to decline at a faster rate than they have done so far. This will require a renewed effort from those sectors that contribute the most to GHG emissions, i.e. the buildings and transport sectors. In the buildings sector, emphasis is placed on significantly improving energy efficiency and on  energy sources. The transport sector is aiming for an ambitious modal revolution in passenger transport, at the same time as greening the vehicle fleet and other types of transport (freight, public, etc.).  This NECP proposes a range of measures with a view to effecting this transition. The Regions are concentrating on the large-scale renovation of their buildings. The transport sector is relying on legislation and behavioural change. All entities have pledged to introduce measures to support these initiatives and raise awareness. Renewable energy As part of the dimension decarbonisation, Belgium has set a contribution in terms of the proportion of renewable energy it uses. The EU target is 32% by 2030. Based on the measures outlined in the entity-specific plans, Belgium will generate 17.4% of its gross final energy consumption from renewable energy sources (RES) by that date. 13 Renewable energy production in 2030 (Mtoe) By entity RES production  Final energy consumption Proportion of RES (Mtoe) (GWh) (GWh) (Mtoe) own consumption (%) BE consumption (%) Belgium 6.20 72,128 411,407 35.4 17.5%  Brussels Capital Region 0.11 1,250 17,372 1.5 7.2% 0.3% Walloon Region 2.37 27,506 117,053 10.1 23.5% 6.7% Flemish Region 2.45 28,517 276,982 23.8 10.3% 6.9% Federal State 1.28 14,855    3.6%  2. Dimension energy efficiency With regard to energy efficiency, Belgium has set its contribution to the EU target of 32.5% by 2030. Its estimated contribution is 15% in primary energy savings and 12% in final energy savings by 2030 compared with the PRIMES (Price-Induced Market Equilibrium System) 2007 baseline. A significant contribution (estimated at a cumulative figure of 185  7.   3. Dimension energy security Energy security is one of the major challenges facing Belgium in the short and medium term. The strategic objectives or priorities associated with energy security can be summarised as follows: - In view of the plans announced to phase out low-calorific gas (L-gas) supplies from the Netherlands from 2022 onwards, Belgium intends to convert and switch 1.6 million connections to high-calorific gas between 2017 and 2029. - The energy mix will radically change due to the planned gradual phase-out of nuclear power by 2025, with 5,918 MW of decommissioned nuclear capacity having to be replaced. Belgium is opting for an energy mix based on flexible capacity, load shifting, storage and renewable energy. A monitoring and correction mechanism will therefore be developed to ensure security of supply, safety, sustainability and long-term affordability. - As nuclear power is phased out, plans will be drawn up for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and the management of radioactive waste. This will require various decisions to be made, particularly regarding technical specifications and the siting of waste storage facilities. - A capacity compensation mechanism will be developed by 2021 and implemented during the period 2022-2025 to ensure security of electricity supply and attract investment to develop new capacity or maintain existing capacity. The security of supply situation will be monitored at a structural level, taking the situation in neighbouring countries into account. - Belgium will also carry out the various risk assessments regarding the security of electricity, natural gas and oil supply enshrined in EU and international legislation. These assessments will mainly be carried out at regional level through, inter alia, the Pentalateral Energy Forum (PLEF) and the Gas Platform. - Several longer-term forecasts are being prepared, including triennial energy outlooks by the Federal Planning Bureau. Regulators and system operators, individually or within their European organisations (e.g. ACER, CESR, ENTSO-E, ENTSO-G), are also conducting numerous studies in support of energy security policy. - Lastly, Belgium is continuing to invest in improving and updating its crisis management policy for all relevant energy carriers. 14  4. Dimension internal energy market The strategic priorities for improving the internal energy market are focused on the following areas: - With regard to energy transportation infrastructure, efforts will be made in the next few years to reinforce the existing interconnections with France and the Netherlands (Brabo) and the existing 380 kV internal corridors. In the next network development plan, the added value of a network will also be studied through projects of common interest (PCIs) aimed at reinforcing the interconnections with Germany (ALEGrO HVDC link) and the UK (Nemo HVDC link). - To encourage market integration, the results of the existing market coupling will be evaluated at regular intervals during the period 2020-2030 on the basis of clear key performance indicators (KPIs). - Solutions will be found in response to the increasing need for flexibility by aligning supply and demand, integrating the storage sector, extending interconnections between countries and making energy networks smarter, creating energy communities and developing opportunities for energy saving. - With regard to energy poverty, all existing federal and regional measures, which are already highly developed, will continue to focus in coming years on tackling the issue at source in accordance with EU directives, with targeted measures to reduce energy consumption. - Smart meter roll-out will continue, allowing citizens to make their own contribution to flexibility and security of supply. - Tariffs calculated on the basis of both a capacity tariff and consumption will be introduced in a bid to ensure that network costs are shared fairly. - Market mechanisms will be adapted in order to create the conditions for ensuring security of supply while facilitating an energy transition at the lowest possible cost.  5. Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness in connection with the Energy Union is aimed at supporting the general objectives of EU energy policy in terms of energy security, sustainability and competitiveness. In addition, the R&I policy encourages innovation in and by Belgian companies in order to boost their competitiveness. Belgium is convinced that a common European approach is necessary to achieve the EU strategy for a resilient Energy Union and a forward-looking climate policy. Belgium is committed to spending at least 3% of GDP on research and development (R&D). The various Belgian entities are developing different programmes to achieve these goals. For the federal authorities, the main emphasis is on the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO) programme and research in the nuclear sector. In the various Regions, the focus on climate and energy is reflected in research programmes and cooperation as part of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan). Hydrogen is recognised as being a vital technology in the energy transition as it enables the decarbonisation of certain market segments that have few other alternatives and it offers the electricity system a flexible solution tailored to the significant rise in the penetration rate of variable renewable energies. Although it is currently too early to set targets for 2030, the four entities must, however, agree on a dynamic roadmap for the gradual roll-out of power-to-gas. Maintaining and enhancing the competitiveness of its firms is a key issue for Belgium. To ensure that Belgian industry remains competitive and to protect jobs, an energy standard is being developed for energy-intensive businesses in particular. Household energy bills will also be monitored and special consideration given to a proactive policy to address poverty.  15 Flemish Region Flanders needs to take great strides forward in the coming years to decarbonise the energy system and make it more sustainable. This is necessary in order to achieve the Flemish energy and climate targets for 2020 and beyond. The conclusion of the Paris Climate Agreement and the Directives from the Clean energy for all Europeans package provide clear guidelines for a future energy transition. Significant improvements must be made in energy efficiency, the proportion of renewable energy sources in the energy supply must increase sharply, and our energy infrastructure must become better and more flexible so that the energy supply remains secure at all times. Energy bills must remain affordable for households. To achieve all this, we need a smart energy system that can respond flexibly to the fluctuating supply of renewable energy. The competitiveness of our businesses cannot be compromised by the costs associated with the investments needed in the energy transition, which can in fact offer opportunities to our businesses. The first and foremost strategic objective is a substantial increase in energy efficiency in all sectors. The three main energy-consuming sectors are industry, the residential sector and the transport sector. In addition to improving energy efficiency, we must also focus on the solid expansion of renewable energy. Energy services and technologies will be digitally controlled with smart interconnections. The energy model of today is not ready to tackle the challenges of tomorrow. We are therefore at a turning point in the way in which we organise our energy supply. The importance of renewable energy is growing, especially green electricity produced locally and on a decentralised basis. In the future, citizens and certain businesses will increasingly be able to take responsibility for their own energy supply. In certain segments, such as households, electricity will increasingly have to be consumed when renewable sources are available. For times when renewable energy sources supply too little or too much electricity, flexible applications and storage must be developed and made accessible to ensure that the energy system is efficient and can operate at the pace of a 21st century economy. Our energy system will have to become more flexible to allow integration of renewable energy. Optimum matching of energy demand and energy supply, demand-side management and energy storage play a key role in the development of a sustainable energy system that guarantees security of supply at all times at an affordable price. The latter is essential to maintain public support. There are major challenges in the energy transition and appropriate solutions are essential. To prepare for the energy transition and pave the way for a new energy model, the Flemish Government has already developed a long-term vision in consultation with citizens, businesses and civil society. In addition to the energy vision, a strategic plan is now also being produced, which takes into account the action points from the energy vision and the recent Energy Pact. Flanders is aiming to reduce its GHG emissions from non-ETS sectors by 35% (6) by 2030 compared with 2005 levels, which is a considerable challenge. The target set for Belgium is also well beyond the figure calculated on the basis of cost efficiency (25%). During the 13-year period between 2005 and 2018, non-ETS emissions fell by only 5% in Flanders. The Flemish Energy and Climate Plan is a step forward in tackling this challenge, but, based on the forecasts, its measures will not currently achieve the 35% reduction set for 2030. The latest forecasts indicate that, after implementing the measures in the plan, there will be a shortfall in emission allocations of 3.8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent for the entire period 2021-2030. The Flemish Government intends to keep gradually reducing this shortfall in the coming years through the following measures:  continuing to innovate, e.g. by using drones for deliveries and by digitising the buildings sector;  speeding up the development of the circular economy through further initiatives taken by and with businesses, e.g. recycling of complex plastics, circular construction, urban mining and design-to-recycle;                                                            6 See paragraph 2.1.1.1 for further details on how this 35% target determines the emission allowance for 2030. 16  federal support policy, e.g. greening company cars;  transposing other European (regulatory and financing) instruments, e.g. the EcoDesign regulations and the new Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. To help ensure that the target is achieved, Flanders will use the flexibility offered by Article 6 of the Effort Sharing Regulation. This is a specific form of flexibility reserved for Member States facing a significant difference between their non-ETS target for 2030 and their cost-effective reduction potential. During the period 2021-2030, this flexibility mechanism allows a quantity of additional emission allocations every year to be provided for non-ETS sectors through the limited cancellation of EU ETS emission allocations that would otherwise have been auctioned. However, in order to limit use of this flexibility as much as possible, Flanders will continue to prioritise, in the next 10 years, the adoption of measures that further reduce non-ETS emissions. Under the European regulations, use of this flexibility can be notified to the European Commission only at the end of 2019 and will cover a 10-year period. The European regulations also specify that the planned use of this flexibility during the period 2021-2030 can be revised downwards in 2024 (impact from 2026) and 2027 (impact from 2029). Energy and climate policy is a cross-cutting theme for which the Flemish Government as a whole is responsible. The Environment and Energy Minister will set a good example with his policy and, as the coordinating minister for energy and climate policy, will invite the other ministries to adopt and implement additional targeted and supported measures in their policy area, which will contribute to the Flemish energy and climate targets. There are a huge number of options at federal level for supporting regional energy and climate policy. In this respect, the changes needed to company car tax can be made at federal level in order to green the company car fleet as quickly as possible and make it emission-free. A reduced VAT rate of 6% throughout Belgium could encourage post-demolition rebuilding. Likewise, European initiatives, such as EcoDesign or stricter CO2 emission standards for vehicles, will effectively reduce emissions in Flanders. As coordinating minister, the Environment and Energy Minister will also encourage the other political levels to assume their share of the responsibility. However, we in the Flemish Government accept our responsibility and want Flanders to make its contribution to the global climate challenge, while remaining fully aware that achieving these targets will require everyone to make an effort. Future innovations and the technologies that we are also developing in Flanders will help in this respect in the coming years. Given the size of this challenge, we need everyone to take part. We want to see the creativity, commitment and energy in our society being used to achieve our ambition of reaching these targets. We are therefore also calling on all citizens, businesses, civil society, local authorities and scientific institutions to join us in thinking about the additional measures that we can each take or about measures that will help us to achieve the targets more effectively. We are thinking in this respect about the commitments that each stakeholder can make, regardless of sector or network. Where this is advisable, such measures can be anchored in instruments such as covenants, Green Deals, etc. With regard to the climate, this plan focuses on sectors that are not yet included in the EU ETS, as it is only for such non-ETS sectors  buildings, transport, agriculture, waste and a small part of industry  that Member States must meet the targets. The emphasis is therefore on the direct emissions of each sector. When adopting measures, we must ensure that the reduction measures in these sectors cause as few indirect emissions as possible in the ETS sector or abroad. The electrification of building heating and transport is probably the main example of emissions being transferred from non-ETS to ETS. For energy-intensive industry and electricity generators, the EU ETS creates fair conditions of competition within Europe, with specific reduction targets. Bearing in mind that the EU ETS will lead to the drastic emission reductions that are needed, we also want to support this transition in Flanders, which particularly explains the emphasis placed on innovation in the plan. In terms of research, innovation and competitiveness, we are transforming the energy and climate challenge into an economic opportunity. We intend to play a leading role in research and innovation, which are the key to 17 the long-key challenges. This policy will help to maintain and reinforce a local manufacturing industry and to achieve the Flemish energy and climate targets.  iii.

Reinforcement of regional collaboration (Pentalateral Energy Forum, Gas Platform) in order to guarantee security of supply and improve market coupling.  Development of an operational crisis management policy for all energy carriers. Finance the transition Green OLOs (Belgian linear bonds): In 2018 and 2019 the Federal Government launched the first green linear bonds (Green OLOs), totalling EUR 6.89 billion, with the income being used solely for public expenditure on the transition to a sustainable economy. The new eligible expenditure for the period 2021-2030 will be made in the transport, energy and buildings sectors, essentially based on this plan, the Energy Pact and the National Pact for Strategic Investments. National Pact for Strategic Investments (Pacte National pour les Investissements Stratégiques  PNIS) The PNIS aims to offer an assessment of strategic investment needs in Belgium up to 2030. These needs cover six areas, including energy and mobility. Around EUR 150  4 EUR 2 billion of infrastructure investment. Some of the work to coordinate and structure the PNIS, which involves experts from the federated/federal entities, involves budget and financial tools, funding techniques, EU, federal and federated funding sources, including debt agencies and National Promotional Banks (NPBs), and financial market instruments. Energy Transition Fund An Energy Transition Fund was set up in 2016 to finance innovative energy projects falling under the responsibility of the Federal State and also measures designed to maintain and/or develop and/or research a system capable of guaranteeing security of supply and network balance, particularly as regards energy production and storage, and also demand-side management.  Flemish Region Energy branch agreements for industry and agriculture Encouragement to renovate residential buildings following a notarial transfer, and obligation to renovate non-residential buildings following a notarial transfer Reduction in N2O emissions when producing caprolactam, and measures to reduce fluorinated GHG emissions  Faster elimination of the asbestos risk in the roofs of dwellings, and promotion of post-demolition rebuilding Promotion of low-emission and zero-emission vehicles for individuals and company and bus fleets, installation of charging infrastructure, and encouragement of innovation in order to green goods transport 20 Walloon Region  Name of the measure Description Key objectives Sectors affected Implementation of measures from the energy renovation strategy for buildings The Walloon contribution involves gradually decarbonising the buildings sector through energy efficiency measures that largely stem from the strategy to reduce the environmental impact of existing buildings.  This strategy aims to ensure the energy efficiency and high environmental performance of the Walloon building stock by 2050.  In the residential sector: aim for the EPB A label (specification  85 kWh/m²/year) on average for the entire housing stock by 2050.  For the tertiary sector: aim for an energy-neutral (zero-energy) tertiary building stock by 2050.  These measures are intended to reduce average energy consumption in the residential and tertiary sectors by 29.1% by 2030. Buildings Implementation of measures from the Vision FAST mobility plan The aim of the Vision FAST mobility plan is to reduce the distances travelled by both individuals and goods.  The plan involves six priority measures: greening of the vehicle fleet; roll-out of electric vehicles; reduction in combustion engines and diversification into CNG vehicles; diversification of the bus fleet; penetration of LNG in goods transport by road; and improvement of transport infrastructure  These ambitions are intended to reduce GHG emissions from transport by at least 24% compared with 2005 levels. Transport Increase in the capacity to generate electricity, heating and cooling from renewable sources Support for the generation of renewable electricity by revising the green certificate mechanism. Implementation of a renewable heat transition plan and introduction of a coordinated mechanism of structural support tailored to the size of installations.  The generation of renewable electricity by 2030 is estimated at 10 TWh.  The generation of renewable heat by 2030 is estimated at 14.2 TWh. RES Specific measures in the non-ETS industrial sector Continued improvement of energy efficiency in this sector through various types of technical measure, including decarbonisation of energy carriers and improved flexibility of energy demand. In the longer term,  Industry 21 widespread fuel switching to decarbonised electricity and renewable heat (thermal solar, heat pumps and geothermal energy, or biomass combustion) must be pursued. Implementation of a framework to reduce indirect emissions in the Walloon Region. Implementation of measures to reduce direct and indirect GHG emissions.

In addition, energy efficiency measures in the buildings sector largely stem from the strategy to reduce the environmental impact of existing buildings. This strategy aims to ensure the energy efficiency and high environmental performance of Brussels buildings by 2050.  Ban on coal-fired appliances from 2021.  Ban on heating oil appliances from 2025.  Average consumption of 100 KWh/m²/year in the residential sector.  Energy neutrality for buildings in the tertiary sector. Buildings Implementation of measures from the Good Move plan The regional mobility plan (Good Move) aims to reduce individual mobility needs. Good Move sets out the rmobility objectives and measures for the period 2020-2030. It is based around six priorities (cross-cutting strategic action programmes) and provides for the implementation of around 50 measures.  A 21% reduction in vehicle-kilometres in the Brussels Capital Region by 2030 compared with 2018 levels. Transport Increase in the capacity to generate electricity, heating and cooling from renewable sources The combined target set for the electricity, heating and cooling sectors intra muros is 470 GWh by 2030. The region also wants to develop a policy of extra muros investment in new renewable energy generating facilities that can generate around 700 GWh by 2030.  1,170 GWh of renewable energy by 2030 by combining intra muros efforts in the electricity and heating sectors with extra muros efforts. RES Gradual adaptation of the LEZ and gradual elimination of combustion engines From 2020, set new milestones for the LEZ for any type of vehicle for the period 2025-2035. Make the access criteria stricter and introduce a ban on diesel vehicles in 2030 and a ban on petrol and LPG vehicles in 2035 within the LEZ.  Elimination of diesel by 2030 at the latest and elimination of petrol and LPG by 2035 at the latest. Transport Implementation of a framework aimed at reducing indirect emissions in the Brussels Capital Region Implementation of measures to reduce direct and indirect GHG emissions. These are cross-cutting measures, such as developing the circular economy or promoting urban agriculture.  Get close to the European neutrality target by 2050, including for indirect emissions. Cross-sectoral  23 1.2. Overview of current policy situation i. National and Union energy system and policy context of the national plan  Federal State  Economic and energy policy responsibilities are divided between the Federal State and the regional governments (Wallonia, Flanders and the Brussels Capital Region) in accordance with the Law of 8 August 1980 on the division of energy responsibilities. Renewable energy sources remain, for the most part, under the exclusive competence of the regions, although the Federal Government is also responsible for regulating the development of offshore wind farms due to the fact that it manages the territorial waters. Several coordination bodies have been established to facilitate communication between the federal and regional governments. The energy policy priorities set by the current Federal Government can be summarised as follows:  ensuring energy security and taking the necessary measures to improve generation adequacy;  contributing to the achievement of the European internal energy market and to the development of strategic and interconnected European energy networks, while unlocking greater potential for flexibility within the electricity system;  providing a stable and favourable investment climate that promotes innovation and offers some predictability through long-term guarantees;  monitoring energy prices to ensure the affordability of energy bills for industry and households, while also safeguarding competitiveness;  establishing a long-Federal State and the Regions. Climate policy responsibilities are divided between the Federal State and the Regions (Wallonia, Flanders and the Brussels Capital Region). By conducting a policy of support in the areas of taxation, biofuels, bicycles, product standards, energy-efficient federal public buildings and railways, the Federal Government will support the Regions in their climate policy and in their air pollution policy. Together with the planned off-shore wind energy, this policy of support will be the federal contribution to the achievement of targets in the EU climate and energy package 2020 and 2021-2030. consultation and cooperation between the different levels of power and to ensure the consistency of the actions of the Federal State and its entities. The central coordinating body for national climate policy is the National Climate Commission, established by the cooperation agreement of 14 November 2002, which in particular is responsible for establishing and monitoring the National Climate Plan, as well as for complying with European and international reporting obligations. The cooperation agreement on burden sharing 2013-2020 was also adopted on 15 June 2018 between the Federal Government and the Regions.   ii. Current energy and climate policies and measures relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union 1. Dimension decarbonisation Reduction in GHG emissions Belgium succeeded in reducing its non-ETS and ETS GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) by 20.2% in 2017 compared with 1990 levels. The most significant contributions came from the transition from solid/liquid fuels to gaseous fuels, industry efforts to cut emissions (CO2/N2O/Fluorine) and a widespread commitment to rational energy use. 24 Although the main focus is on the key non-ETS sectors, significant reductions appear to have been made in the residential sector, largely as a result of better insulation. Emissions from road transport have been rising steadily since 1990, owing to the increase in the number of cars and longer journeys. In policy terms, Belgium has set itself a binding target of a 15% reduction by 2020 (compared with 2005 levels) in non-ETS sectors. This target is spread among the different Regions, which have introduced their own measures to achieve the necessary reductions. The Federal State is contributing to this effort through additional measures and a policy of enablement. Renewable energy In principle, responsibility for renewable energy in Belgium lies with the Regions. However, this principle is undermined by the fact that the Regions exercise their substantive powers only within the limits of their territorial jurisdictions, and not therefore in maritime areas. Consequently, since the 1980 State Reform, the Federal Government has been responsible for renewable energy sources in maritime areas under Belgian jurisdiction according to international maritime law. Biofuels are also subject to federal jurisdiction. All other aspects relating to renewable energy are under regional jurisdiction. Potential for renewable energy generation is comparatively low in Belgium. The country is very flat and densely populated, with a relatively low number of sunshine hours. The large-scale use of hydropower, onshore wind turbines and solar panels is difficult owing to the considerable challenges around land use and public support. In 2017, the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption was 9.06%. For the first time, Belgium is therefore on track according to the National Renewable Energy Action Plan and Directive 2009/28/EC. However, growth in the share of renewables in final energy consumption has slowed in recent years and is being closely monitored to ensure that the targets will be met. Total electricity production stood at 7,854 ktoe in 2017. The share of electricity generated from renewable sources was 17.24%, a large part of which came from wind energy (41%). Biomass and solar energy each accounted for around 20%. In the transport sector, 6.58% of fuel came from renewable sources, out of a total of 8,829 ktoe. 8.03% of energy used in heating and cooling was renewable, out of a total of 18,577 ktoe.  2. Dimension energy efficiency In order to transpose and implement Article 3 of Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, in June 2013 Belgium notified the European Commission of its indicative energy efficiency target for 2020, specifically an 18% reduction in primary energy relative to projected gross inland energy consumption (excluding non-energy uses), according to the PRIMES 2007 baseline model. on existing and planned policy measures taken at federal and regional level. The energy reduction in 2020 relative to the PRIMES 2007 baseline scenario (53.3 Mtoe) was calculated using the methodology developed for the 2011 and 2012 National Reform Programmes. This equates to an energy saving of 9.6 Mtoe and gross inland energy consumption of 43.7 Mtoe in 2020. As required by the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), this primary target is converted into a final consumption target of 32.5 Mtoe in 2020. In 2017, primary energy consumption was 49 Mtoe and final energy consumption was 36 Mtoe.  3. Dimension energy security Like Europe as a whole, Belgium is largely dependent on imports of primary energy sources (oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear fuel) to meet domestic demand. Nuclear fuel is not naturally present below ground in Belgium. Since the markets for the various energy carriers are almost completely liberalised and are therefore subject to market movements at international, European, regional and national level, Belgium does not have a clear policy on the diversification of its energy supply when it comes to oil, natural gas or coal. However, the origin of these different 25 primary energy sources is continually monitored and no potentially problematic supplier monopolies have been identified to date. Origin of energy imports by carrier in 2017 (in %)   Crude oil Natural gas (Source: 2019 key energy figures) Russie Russia Norvège Norway Royaume-Uni United Kingdom Autres Other Pays-Bas The Netherlands  4. Dimension internal energy market Belgium serves as a role model for the proposed EU interconnection target. According to the current timetable, Belgium will already have an electricity interconnection rate of approximately 21% by 2020. The EU target for 2030 (i.e. 15%) will therefore be achieved by 2020. The interconnection rate will increase again in late 2020 or early 2021 due to the Aachen Liège Electricity Grid Overlay (ALEGrO) and investments in additional static voltage regulators. Aside from existing projects, further expansion could potentially be envisaged following the consultation currently under way on the Draft Federal Development Plan 2020-2030 submitted by Elia , additional impact assessments and changes to the electricity system in the coming years. If all the projects described in the Development Plan are completed, the interconnection rate will be approximately 30% by 2030. With regard to natural gas, Belgium already has an efficient and well-developed natural gas network, with well-established internal infrastructure complemented by interconnections with all its neighbouring countries, an LNG terminal at Zeebrugge and a storage facility at stake in key projects in central and western Europe. This provides added flexibility and enhances both security of supply and the energy security, provided that this security can be guaranteed for Belgian consumers. This aspect will need to be developed in future and will be included in measures relating to market function. The roll-out of smart meters will ensure that citizens make their own contributions to flexibility and security of supply. Market function will be adapted in order to provide the framework for ensuring security of supply during the energy transition, and to ensure this is done at the lowest possible cost. F, including in the context of efforts to secure accessible and affordable energy for all citizens. Various measures are already in place nationwide.   5. Dimension research, innovation and competitiveness general energy and climate policy objectives in terms of sustainability, energy security and competitiveness. In addition, research and 26 innovation policy encourages innovation in and by Belgian companies with a view to boosting their competitiveness. Given the neeclosely linked to the priorities set out in the SET Plan. At international level, Belgium is a member of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the International Energy Agency (IEA). Overall, Belgium is committed to achieving the European R&D target of 3% by 2020. general objectives are translated into specific policies by the Federal Government and the different Regions, taking into account the distribution of research and innovation powers between them. Given the significant presence of energy-intensive industries in Belgium, maintaining competitiveness is crucial for a successful energy transition.  Flemish Region The current climate policy options are mainly set out in the Flemish Climate Policy Plan 2013-2020 (8) and in the additional policy described in the corresponding progress reports (9). The trends resulting from the greenhouse gas inventory are explained in more detail in point 4.1. The current energy policy options are mainly set out in the Flemish Energy Efficiency Action Plan 2017 and in the additional policy described in the corresponding progress reports. The resulting trends are explained in more detail in point 4.3. As regards renewable energy, the current policy options are set out in a Renewable Energy Plan 2020. The sub-targets set in that plan are developed in a Solar Plan, a Heat Plan and a Wind Plan in point 2.1.2.  Walloon Region The main measures currently being implemented in the fields of decarbonisation, energy efficiency and promotion of renewable energies are set out in the Air, Climate and Energy Plan 2016-2022 (PACE 2022) (10). The PACE 2022 contains 142 measures, broken down by sector, aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and other atmospheric pollutants, improving air quality and adjusting to the impacts of climate change.  iii. Key issues of cross-border relevance Within the framework of the Regional Energy and Climate Dialogue 2030 (see point 1.4 below), the countries in the Pentalateral Energy Forum have identified a number of issues with a cross-border impact and on which cooperation would seem desirable in terms of preparing their respective NECPs. A governance structure has also been established to ensure structural monitoring of this cooperation.  iv. Administrative structure of implementing national energy and climate policies In September 2016, the CONCERE-CNC steering group for the NECP 2030 was given its mandate by the CNC and CONCERE. The Federal Government and each of the Regions are represented by two steering group members, responsible for the energy and climate sectors respectively. The steering group (see point 1.1(i)) coordinates, plans and oversees the following aspects. (a) Ttimetable. (b) National dialogue and consultations with other relevant official sectors (such as transport and agriculture) and stakeholders are instigated by the steering group. In addition, dialogue and                                                            8 https://www.lne.be/sites/default/files/atoms/files/2013-06-28_VMP2013-2020.pdf 9 https://www.lne.be/sites/default/files/atoms/files/VORA2016-2017_Mitigatie.pdf 10 The text of the PACE 2016-2022 is available on the following website: http://www.awac.be/index.php/thematiques/politiques-actions/les-politiques-changement-clim/politique-wallonne  27 consultation on topics that fall within the exclusive remit of each entity may be organised separately by each entity as it deems appropriate, with the aim of fostering synergies and preventing duplication of effort. The content of this dialogue and consultation is shared with the steering group. (c)  (d) Options for outsourcing and supervising joint missions with third parties as part of the NECP development process.  Flemish Region European framework The contains provisions on monitoring, reporting and updating the national energy and climate plans. The Effort Sharing Regulation also provides for a supervisory mechanism to ensure that Member States make sufficient progress in terms of reductions in non-ETS sectors. In summary, these regulations set out the steps following submission of the final NECP to the European Commission (see Figure 1-1).  Chronology of the planning and drafting of energy and climate reports (Source: Governance Regulation) Ontwerp NEKP  Draft NECP Finaal NEKP  Final NECP Ontwerp update NEKP  Draft update of NECP Finale update NEKP  Final update of NECP jaarlijks rapport annual report Rapport 2020 doelstellingen EE en HE Report on 2020 energy efficiency and renewable energy targets NEKP Voortgangs-rapport NECP progress report   From 2021, there must be annual reporting (Articles 26 and 19 of the Governance Regulation) on greenhouse gas inventories, use of auctioning revenues and international climate finance. Greenhouse gas policies and measures, emission projections and national adaptation actions must be reported on every two years (Article 18 of the Governance Regulation). In the years in which a national progress report is drawn up (see below), all of these aspects must be included therein. 28  From 2021, the European Commission will assess on an annual basis whether Member States are making sufficient progress as regards the reduction of greenhouse gases in non-ETS sectors. In the event of insufficient progress, specific recommendations will be made. Member States will then have three months to submit a corrective action plan. If specific recommendations are not followed, Member States must explain why (Article 8 of the Effort Sharing Regulation).  From 2023, a national progress report must be drawn up every two years on the state of implementation of the integrated NECP relating to all five dimensions of the Energy Union. In addition to the climate aspects, the other dimensions of the Energy Union must therefore also be reported on, in particular renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy security, internal energy market, and research, innovation and competitiveness (Article 18 of the Governance Regulation). Based on these reports from Member States, the Commission will assess progress at the EU level and for each Member State and take the necessary action (Article 29 of the Governance Regulation).  In 2022, a one-off report must be made on achievement of the 2020 national energy efficiency and renewable energy targets (Article 27 of the Governance Regulation).  Unless reasons are provided why the NECP does not require updating, the plan will be updated by 30 June 2023 (draft) and by 30 June 2024 (final) and then every 10 years thereafter (Article 14 of the Governance Regulation).  Flemish framework The Flemish policy cycle of implementation, monitoring, reporting, assessment and correction is in line with the biennial European reporting cycle. The Flemish Energy and Climate Plan will be updated during the period 2023-2024, unless reasons are provided why the plan does not require updating. From the plan to specific policy measures The current Flemish Energy and Climate Plan outlines policy for the period 2021-2030. It contains the action plans and policy programmes announced for each sector, including for this purpose the estimated impact on projections. Those projections not taking account of the measures included in the plan equate to the WEM (with existing measures) scenario, while those projections that do take account of those measures equate to the WAM (with additional measures) scenario. A framework of agreements will be established by the end of 2020 at the latest to ensure that the policy is fully integrated and based on energy and climate data. The framework will include a clear timetable and procedures for the successive stages of the energy and climate policy cycle, and will also clarify the role of each ministry, department and entity involved. It will also indicate how stakeholders, experts, local authorities, innovators and pioneers will participate. In this way, all the relevant parties will have a clear view of their role in the process, which will avoid parallel consultations or overlapping projects. Stakeholders will be involved in both preparing and implementing the policy, for which purpose a framework will be created to enable mutual undertakings. Lastly, the role of independent experts in this respect will also be determined. For each measure resulting from the plan, an entity will be designated in the short term to assume responsibility for implementing the measure. For most of the measures, several public entities as well as other stakeholders will also be involved, even if they do not have ultimate responsibility. In particular, the new Flemish Energy and Climate Agency (Vlaams Energie en Klimaat Agentschap  VEKA), which is yet to be set up, and the Environment Department (for climate-related environmental issues) will use their knowledge and skills to support the other policy areas and levels of government with the policy measures in the plan. The specific measures will be determined over the next few years and will influence the sectoral strategic plans of every policy area and level of government involved. This will occur based on the following principles:  Within their specific area, all ministers will take the necessary measures to ensure that the climate transition picks up speed. All sectors must assume their respective responsibility so that the common 29 aim can be achieved. Each functionally relevant minister must develop targeted and supported measures that contribute to the Flemish energy and climate objectives.  Every policy area and level of government will have to make significant and continuous efforts to achieve the ambitions of the Flemish Energy and Climate Plan. Where relevant, work will also be needed in all policy areas and at all levels of government to develop an integrated and effective approach that respects   All ministers will be responsible for ensuring that their own policy is compatible with the climate (Climate Proofing or mainstreaming of climate change).  Stakeholder participation: in addition to the various policy areas and authorities, the active participation of various stakeholders and society as a whole will also be necessary to achieve the Flemish climate targets. Co-creation, dialogue, engagement, openness and cooperation are the keys to this approach. All agencies must ensure, in conjunction with VEKA, that all interested parties remain engaged in the development of policy and that the implementation of this plan is worked on together. Progress reports every year or every two years The Flemish Government will annually report to the European Commission on:  the emissions inventory;  the use of auctioning revenues;   international climate finance  Flemish biennial progress reports will cover all aspects (relevant to Flanders) of the five dimensions of the Energy Union. Given the considerably heightened ambition of the binding GHG reduction target (in comparison with previous planning periods), correct monitoring of sectoral emissions and underlying indicators is crucial in order to adjust policies where necessary. Monitoring and reporting will therefore need to be not only objective and accurate but also very targeted and specific. The first annual report in this planning period will be produced by 15 March 2021 at the latest, with the first biennial integrated progress report being produced in 2023. Follow-up of recommendations and potential adjustments Based on the annual report, biennial integrated progress report and any recommendations made by the European Commission, the Flemish Government will consider whether and how the Flemish Energy and Climate Plan should be adjusted. If, based on the aforementioned assessments, it appears that insufficient progress has been made in reducing emissions in non-ETS sectors, the Flemish Government will contribute to the national action plan by explaining the adjustments and/or additional measures to be adopted.   Walloon Region The Walloon Government instructed the Department of Energy and Sustainable Building (part of the Wallonia Public Service for Planning, Housing, Heritage and Energy: https://energie.wallonie.be) and the Walloon Air and Climate Agency  AwAC: http://www.awac.be) to work together on a new PACE 2030. These two agencies set up a Steering Committee (Comité de Pilotage  COPIL) with the task of coordinating the drafting of the PACE 2030. The COPIL used the following for this purpose:  work carried out within the Department of Energy and within AwAC (with the latter in particular having access to sectoral experts); 30  a thematic working group including other agencies (transport, industry, etc.);  work of the Committee of Experts set up under the Climate Decree (http://awac.be/index.php/thematiques/politiques-actions/les-politiques-changement-clim/politique-wallonne)  1.3. Consultations and involvement of national and Union entities and their outcome iv. Involvement of the national parliament Federal State  Two debates were held on the federal contribution to the draft NECP after this was Chamber of Representatives. The new Energy, Climate and Sustainable Development Committee has already expressed its interest in cooperating with Parliament on the federal contribution to the NECP, having indicated this in particular during the sitting on 2 October 2019.  Walloon Region The Climate Resolution, adopted on 28 September 2017 by the Walloon Parliament, calls on the Walloon Government to pursue an ambitious climate policy by recommending a series of measures concerning renewable energy, energy efficiency, housing, mobility, agriculture, etc. Following on from that resolution, although not called for in it, the Energy Minister has undertaken to present quarterly feedback on the various measures contained in the resolution.  An initial feedback meeting took place on 12 January 2018 in the presence of four MPs, at which the progress made in terms of climate policy was presented.  v. Involvement of local and regional authorities Federal State The NECP has been developed and coordinated within a steering group jointly established by the National Climate Commission (CNC) and CONCERE, as explained in more detail in point 1.1(i).  Local authorities have not been consulted on the federal part of the plan. However, inspiration has been taken from the draft regional plans and parliamentary resolutions, as well as from the items raised in those documents for the attention of the federal authorities.  Flemish Region Local authorities have not been separately consulted on the development of the Flemish Energy and Climate Plan. However, their opinions have been heard through the advisory councils and Electricity groups. -cutting   Walloon Region In Wallonia, the public inquiry held on the PACE enabled broad consultation with authorities at all levels. Local authorities will also be involved in implementing the measures.  vi. Consultations of stakeholders, including the social partners, and engagement of civil society and the general public The various stages of the NECP have been presented to the general public and civil society in a number of ways: 31 Draft NECP: A nationwide consultation was organised on the Interfederal Energy Pact. Between early May and late June 2017, the 129 key stakeholders were canvassed in writing on their vision, expectations and requirements Nearly 50 written responses to this consultation were received. In addition, a vast organised in the autumn of 2017 (17 October to 5 November). More than 45,000 people took part in the online survey. The responses to the two public consultations were analysed by the energy agencies concerned (under the aegis of the CONCERE Energy Pact working group) and were fully taken in account by policymakers as a contribution to the pact. An analysis of this survey can be found at: https://www.energiepact2050.be/129-17-brochure-A4-N.pdf. Final NECP: After the first draft plan was producedSteering Committee and was given responsibility for consultations with the public and stakeholders, among other tasks. This resulted in the launch of a large-scale national public consultation in which the public could participate in three ways: an online questionnaire; an open-ended question allowing general comments to be added on the draft NECP; and the possibility of responding by email. Nearly 61,000 people took part, of which around 52,000 completed the questionnaire in full. At the end of the questionnaire, respondents could also answer an open-ended question allowing them to make general comments on the draft NECP; this option was used by almost 20,000 respondents. In addition to providing feedback through the online questionnaire, the public and stakeholders were also able to respond by email, either on the NECP in general or on the various entity-specific plans. A different email address was provided for each of the plans. Through the email addresses for the NECP and the federal contribution, around 230 responses were also received from individuals or stakeholders, with or without attachments and written positions. More detailed information on the results of this public consultation can be found at: http://www.plannationalenergieclimat.be/fr/enquete-publique, which is the official NECP website launched in mid-September. This website is the result of a joint national initiative to bring together all the local initiatives and present them to the public. It is currently available in NL and FR, with EN being added soon, and also contains information on regional cooperation initiatives, for example.  Federal State No targeted public consultation was organised ahead of the federal contribution to the draft NECP. This can be explained in part by the fact that a large-scale national consultation was organised on the Interfederal Energy Pact (11), which partly served as a contribution to the drafting of the NECP (12). Draft NECP: At the federal level, the advisory bodies FRDO CFDD (Federale Raad Voor Duurzame Ontwikkeling/Conseil Fédéral du Développement Durable  Federal Council for Sustainable Development) and CCE/CRB (Conseil  Central Economic Council) delivered their contributions and proposed specific measures, which were, to a certain extent, incorporated in the federal contribution to the NECP. The Gas and Electricity Advisory Board (Conseil Consultatif du Gaz et de Adviesraad Gas en Elektriciteit) was also invited to submit an opinion, but declined the invitation                                                            11 As approved by the Federal Government on 30 March 2018. 12 Federal Council for Sustainable Development: Opinion on the National Pact on strategic investment and financing of the transition to a decarbonised economy, 30/05/2018: https:/www.frdo-cfdd.be/sites/default/files/content/download/files/2018a07f.pdf 32 due to lack of time to prepare a specific opinion as a contribution Nevertheless, it forwarded two earlier opinions that had some relevance for the NECP (13). Final NECP: As regards the social partners and civil society, the Federal Council for Sustainable Development was asked for an opinion in early 2019 and took on the task of coordinating a joint opinion (14) from all the federal and regional councils in response to the draft NECP. On 13 September, a dialogue was organised with stakeholders at administrative level to find out the views of those concerned, such as consumers, NGOs, employer organisations and trade unions, with particular attention being  (15). The results of the public consultation and the opinions (16) and comments of the advisory boards and stakeholders were taken into account when the final NECP was prepared.  Flemish Region Stakeholders, experts and the public were extensively involved and consulted during the preparation of the draft Flemish Climate Policy Plan 2021-2030 and the draft Energy Plan 2030. This particularly occurred through the Flemish Climate Summit approach (with round tables on the climate conducted by each minister in the Flemish -the lectricit (Electricity) groups on five themes: energy efficiency, renewable energy, flexibility, funding and governance), the Renovation Pact approach, and several other approaches associated with the climate and energy (on mobility, planning, clean energy for transport, etc.). Following approval of the draft Flemish Climate Policy Plan 2021-2030 and the draft Energy Plan 2030 on 20 July 2018, the Flemish Government received opinions and recommendations from a wide range of stakeholders and experts through various channels:  Opinion of the Socioeconomic Council for Flanders (Conseil socio-économique de la Flandre/Sociaal-Economische Raad voor Vlaanderen  SERV), the Flemish Council for the Environment and Nature (- en natuurraad van Vlaanderen  Minaraad) and the Strategic Advisory Board for Agriculture and Fisheries (Conseil consultatif stratégique Agriculture et de la Pêche/Strategische Adviesraad voor Landbouw en Visserij  SALV) on the draft Flemish Energy Plan and Climate Plan, Sporen naar een krachtiger kilmaat- en energie plan 2030 (08/10/2018) https://www.vlaanderen.be/publicaties/advies-sporen-naar-een-krachtiger-klimaat-en-energieplan-2030-gezamelijk-advies-serv-minaraad-en-salv-1  Opinion of the Flemish Youth Council (Conseil flamand de la jeunesse/Vlaamse Jeugdraad) on the Flemish Climate Policy Plan 2021-2030 (05/09/2018)                                                            13 Gas and Electricity Advisory Board, 25/06/2018: response to a request for an opinion: reference to Opinion cc161221-068, 21/12/2016, and Opinion cc161019-067, 19/10/2016. 14 Joint opinion on the draft National Energy and Climate Plan 2030 (NECP)  CFDD, CCE, CESE Wallonie  Pôle environnement  Pôle énergie, SERV, Minaraad, CESRBC, CERBC:  https://www.frdo-cfdd.be/sites/default/files/content/download/files/2019a03f.pdf 15 https://www.climat.be/files/9715/7320/2169/SH_dialogue_PFEC_13092019_Chairs_summary_FR.pdf 16 Federal Council for Sustainable Development: Opinion on the federal contribution to the NECP 2030, 30/05/2018: https://www.frdo-cfdd.be/sites/default/files/content/download/files/2018a06f.pdf  Federal Council for Sustainable Development: Opinion of the CFDD on the draft National Energy and Climate Plan 2030 (NECP): https://www.frdo-cfdd.be/sites/default/files/content/download/files/2019a02f_0.pdf  Central Economic Council: Specific measures for the federal part of the National Energy and Climate Plan.

Monitoring group consisting of experts appointed by the Flemish Government  first opinion (11/7/2019) and second opinion (12/10/2019).  The five roups (energy efficiency, renewable energy, flexibility, funding and governance) were re-formed in the spring of 2019 for the purpose of contributing to the NECP.  See https://www.energiesparen.be/Vlaams_energieplan  These opinions and recommendations were carefully examined by the various authorities, and incorporated in the NECP where appropriate. They will continue to be included in subsequent versions of the NECP.  Walloon Region First consultation In the process of preparing the PACE 2030, an initial written consultation was held from 13 March to 21 April 2017. Based on a list of existing policies, its aim was to obtain responses from the various stakeholders and allow them to inform the competent authorities of their views on the current Walloon energy and climate policy and on how the energy system should be developed to 2030. Those contributions (which consisted of around 40 responses) were examined and highlighted a number of areas for improvement in the existing measures, and also new measures to be adopted. The documents provided briefly described the various tools and levers in place as part of the energy and climate policy in Wallonia. They formed a basis for reflecting on current actions and future routes to achieving the target of reducing GHG emissions by 35% by 2030 in Belgium and Wallonia. Stakeholders were asked to answer a themed questionnaire. Second consultation A second consultation was held from 19 February to 19 March 2018. This written consultation allowed At a linked event (22 and 23 February), the authorities presented those measures and constructively discussed them with the socioeconomic partners, before the government adopted the new Air, Climate and Energy Plan 2030. Particular emphasis was placed on proposals for new measures to be implemented between 2020 and 2030. The main themes of those consultations were connected with the non-ETS target and mainly involved renewable energy, energy efficiency, industry (non-ETS, including HFC), transport and mobility, and agriculture. Public inquiry on PACE Following the consultations, the Walloon Government presented a draft PACE 2030. In accordance with Article D.29-1 of Book I of the Environment Code, Wallonia held a public inquiry on the draft PACE 2030, including its associated documents. This draft PACE is a summary of the measures included in the draft Walloon Energy and Climate Plan 2030 and in the Air Plan, which are themselves designed to meet our European obligations. 34 Following the public inquiry, the government will examine a second version of the PACE incorporating the results. Those aspects that have been corrected will also be included in the Walloon Energy and Climate Plan 2030 (Plan Wallon Energie Climat 2030  PWEC 2030). The public inquiry closed in August 2019, with contributions having been received from: - 23 organisations, - 62 individuals, - 21 municipalities (17).  Brussels Capital Region A national consultation on the draft integrated plan was held between 4 June and 15 July 2019. The public and stakeholders were invited to respond to both the national document and also the entity-specific plans (18). The Brussels Plan 2030 received 63 responses from the public and stakeholders; those responses have been taken into account in this version. on the draft NECP (19), which were made in June 2019. The plan was also adapted following the consultation of neighbouring countries in September 2019. Lastly, the Regional Policy Statement of the Brussels Government has been incorporated into the plan in order to bring it into line with the ambitions of the new regional executive following the regional elections on 26 May 2019. In addition, other consultations have fed into the discussions leading to the development of the plan. As indicated above, this plan aims to implement the vision contained in the Interfederal Energy Pact, with that vision also stemming from consultations with Belgian stakeholders (April-June 2017) and the general public (November 2017) (20). Lastly, as stipulated in the Governance Regulation, the perspective of this document is to 2050. It therefore takes account of sectoral consultations conducted as part of the low-carbon study 2050 (21) in February and March 2016. Those consultations and that study will also feed into the future long-term strategy of Brussels in accordance with Article 15 of the Governance Regulation. In addition, the plan is based on other plans, such as the strategy to reduce the environmental impact of existing Brussels buildings (22) (see point 2.2.1.1) and the Good Move regional mobility plan (see point 2.2.2.1), on which consultations have also been conducted.                                                             17 The public inquiry procedure allows the municipal authorities to play a central role. First of all, they are consulted prior to the procedure on the table of contents of the Environmental Report. The municipalities then have another important role to play in the inquiry process itself by relaying the contributions of the public. In total 152 municipalities responded, but 131 simply stated that they had not received any response from their residents. 18 The results of the consultation are available on the dedicated website. 19 Commission Recommendation of 18 June 2019 on the draft integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of Belgium covering the period 2021-2030.  20 45,016 responses were received during the public consultation. The results are available on the dedicated website: https://pacte-energetique2050.be 21 Low-carbon scenarios to 2050 for the Brussels Capital Region: study carried out by the Climact firm for Bruxelles Environnement in 2016-2017. 22 Also known as the renovation strategy. This was the subject of a sectoral consultation on renovation work on 27 April 2018 and also multiple bilateral consultations with Brussels operators in the sector in late 2018 and early 2019. 35 vii. Consultations of other Member States At bilateral level, there is no specific initiative for the exchange of information on NECP-related projects.  dialogue with neighbouring countries and other Member States tends to take place in the context of regional cooperation (see point 1.4 below).  Walloon Region The Member States face many common challenges in all the dimensions described in this plan. As regards the Walloon Region (taking into account its regional powers), there is great interest in working with cross-border regions and countries such as North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Sarre, Lorraine and Luxembourg. n the Great Region bodies, or the signature of a Declaration of Intent between the Walloon Government and the Regional Government of North Rhine-Westphalia, which has the energy transition as one of its themes in order to ensure a future energy supply that is secure, affordable and environmentally friendly. It also covers the following themes: - Bioenergy Together with the Walloon Region, the cross-border regions and countries form a unique biomass supply area (wood in particular). As a result, different levels of support could create distortions in neighbouring markets or the Walloon market, bearing in mind that there are already significant tensions between the various potential users of biomass residues and co-products. - Electric mobility The roll-out of electric mobility requires an infrastructure that is continuous and interoperable. This roll-out is supported by the EU through Directive 2014/94/EU in particular, but cross-border cooperation could benefit all the areas concerned.  viii. Iterative process with the Commission The European Commission was invited to participate in the Regional Energy and Climate Dialogue 2030 (see point 1.4), to which it responded enthusiastically. It will continue to participate in this process in future at the request or initiative of the Member States. At national level, several informal consultations with the Commission have taken place with various representatives of all relevant entities within the -General for Energy and Directorate-General for Climate Action) on the NECPs. In order to respond to th (23), a table summarising the 10 most important  is contained in an annex.  1.4. Regional cooperation in preparing the plan i. Elements subject to joint or coordinated planning with other Member States Belgium has well-established structures for regional cooperation and coordination on energy and climate issues. Possibilities for regional collaboration are currently examined within the Benelux framework, expanded to countries in the Pentalateral Energy Forum (i.e. BE, NL, LUX, FR, DE, AT, and CH as an observer).                                                            23 Commission Recommendation of 18 June 2019 on the draft integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of Belgium covering the period 2021-2030, C(2019) 4401 final and SWD(2019) 211 final: https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/be_rec_fr.pdf & https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/be_swd_en.pdf 36 Within the North Sea cooperation framework, i.e. the North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC), work is also underway on a Danish-led initiative to include a common paragraph in the respective cooperation plans with the Member States of NSEC, namely BE, NL, LUX, DE, FR, UK, IE, DK, NO and SE (point (ii)).  ii. Explanation of how regional cooperation is considered in the plan 1. Benelux The Benelux Declaration on Regional Cooperation for the Development of Integrated National Energy and Climate Plans was signed during the Energy Council on 11 June 2018. This policy commitment laid the foundations for enhanced regional cooperation on the integrated national energy and climate plans, and also looked to include the member countries of the Pentalateral Energy Forum (PLEF).  2. Pentalateral Energy Forum (PLEF/Penta) Cooperation within the PLEF on the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plans (INECPs) was confirmed at the launch event  held on 27 June 2018 and aimed at the directors-general for energy and climate and at experts from all the PLEF member countries. During this event, the participants presented their respective INECP, set out the cross-border issues and exchanged their first impressions. The intention was to subsequently approve a working method for continuing to develop this regional cooperation and consultation dialogue on the respective INECPs. With the PLEF member countries having already demonstrated their commitment to continuing this initiative, the way forward was to be developed over the next few months so that the provisional and final plans could be submitted by 31 December 2018 and 2019. A policy statement was signed on 4 March 2019 formalising  On the margins of the Energy Council on 25 June 2019, the energy ministers of the PLEF countries agreed to adopt the following as common text in the INECPs. This text specifically sets out the commitment to cooperate in this respect:  Since 2005, the Pentalateral Energy Forum has been a structure for voluntary regional cooperation between Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and, since 2011, Austria. It therefore covers over one third of the EU population and more than 40% of electricity generation in the EU. In 2011, Switzerland joined the forum as a permanent observer and actively contributes to the technical work and decision-making process. In close cooperation with the European Commission (by invitation), the Pentalateral Energy Forum is improving cooperation between all the participants with a view to creating a regional electricity market as an intermediate step towards achieving a common European electricity market. The cooperation is led by the ministers responsible for energy policy who meet regularly. Activities are monitored by the Penta coordinators and by the Penta NECP Committee under the guidance of the respective directors-general of the participating countries. The work programme is implemented by electricity Transmission System Operators (TSOs), ministries, National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), the European Commission and market operators who meet regularly within three Support Groups. The main success recorded in the last 15 years has been the change seen in Penta countries, which have moved from a purely national policy perspective on the energy markets to the adoption of a regional approach. Specific regional steps have been taken in a number of dimensions that remain relevant today: Internal electricity market/market integration: Support Group 1 (Groupe de Soutien 1  SG1) focuses on the coupling of electricity markets in the region. As one of its goals, SG1 has encouraged the flow-based market coupling (FBMC) of overnight markets and, in May 2015, FBMC was officially launched in the Penta region: the first of its kind within the European Union. 37 Since then, FBMC has been constantly improved and become increasingly successful; it now serves as a basis for a fully established FBMC at EU level for overnight markets. In addition, to increase transmission capacity available for cross-border trade on the intra-day market, SG1 has encouraged a process of coordinated calculation of the intra-day capacity following the FBMC of overnight markets for all borders in the region. This was implemented in March 2016 as a first step towards the coupling of European intra-day markets. SG1 has been a privileged witness to the radically changing landscape of electricity and governance of electricity markets. Whereas in 2005 grid operators worked separately, over the years SG1 has actively encouraged cooperation between participants. This has, for example, helped to bring TSOs together within regional associations, merge power exchanges with TSOs and encourage new regional players (TSCNET, Coreso, former CASC-CWE, SSC). Given the new implementation plans that need to be prepared in accordance with the Clean Energy Package, the Penta countries will closely coordinate their activities and explore possibilities for joint action. Internal electricity market/flexibility: Support Group 3 (SG3) focuses on flexibility issues in the region. Its work so far has been concentrated on balancing, the intra-day market and the role of demand-side management, which are the three main areas of regional cooperation allowing the flexibility of electricity markets to be improved. Various technical reference documents have been developed that summarise the main obstacles to increased use of flexibility in the Penta region. Participation in SG3 has been opened up to the traditional participants (NRAs/TSOs), as well as to other stakeholders such as Distribution System Operators (DSOs), the main consumer protection organisations and renewable energy generators. As regards balancing, current approaches have been assessed and best practices exchanged within the PLEF. In addition, Penta plays a vital role in the process of implementing EU guidelines on electricity system balancing. In terms of demand-side management, a separate group of experts has worked on a report describing the real situation in the Penta region, with emphasis on the rules and responsibilities of new market players in each country of the region. As regards the future cooperation of the Penta countries on hydrogen, a workshop has been organised to identify possible topics for cooperation in this respect. Security of supply: Support Group 2 (SG2) deals with security of supply issues in the region. A memorandum of agreement on security of supply cooperation was signed between the Penta countries in June 2017. On that basis, and in the light of the new EU Regulation on risk-preparedness, a crisis management organised in 2018 to improve mutual understanding of national concerns, identify the main potential crisis (cross-border) situations for the region and to assess various measures aimed at mitigating the effects of a crisis. The first regional Generation Adequacy Assessment (GAA) carried out by the Penta TSOs and published in March 2015 marked an important step. The assessment method was based on a probabilistic and chronological approach with an hourly resolution for the years 2015/2016 and 2020/2021; this was a significant improvement on the existing deterministic approaches. The Penta TSOs also used a common regional dataset based on the same scenarios and assumptions, a regional temperature-sensitive load pattern and harmonised probabilistic hydrological data. The governments of the Penta countries are convinced that these dimensions are relevant. In addition to continuing their work in these areas, the Penta countries will use the PLEF over the next few years to work on the following priorities: 38 DECARBONISATION OF THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR Common vision of a decarbonised electricity system in the Penta countries by 2050: The Penta countries will exchange their visions of a decarbonised electricity system by 2050 (with intermediate stages in 2030 and 2040) in terms of a highly efficient energy system mainly based on renewable energy, gradual elimination of electricity generated from fossil fuels, and effective final use of electricity. To start with, the national scenarios indicating what the electricity system could be like in 2050 will be compared, the common and divergent aspects of those scenarios will be identified, and the way in which security of supply would be guaranteed in those scenarios will be determined. This will ensure a common understanding of the expectations and challenges in creating a future electricity system. Launch of cross-border cooperation on renewable electricity: The Penta countries will work on a voluntary basis to develop a menu of common ideas covering various levels of cooperation, including exploring the possibilities of opening up national/cross-border calls for tender and organising joint calls for tender for interested Penta countries, with increasing reference being made to the European framework for renewable energy and existing cooperation mechanisms, such as joint projects and statistical transfers (menu cluster) for interested Penta countries. The Penta countries are also supporting the work being carried out by the European Commission and Member States to develop an EU financing mechanism for renewable energy. Integration of electromobility options and services without any regional restrictions: The Penta countries will help to increase the proportion of renewable energy in transport by encouraging electromobility (including fuel cell options). They will facilitate the integration/implementation of electromobility options and services without any restrictions within the Penta region by identifying and, where necessary, removing obstacles to the cross-border roll-out of electromobility and charging services and by ensuring interoperability. Study of carbon pricing options and their cross-border impact on electricity prices: The Penta countries that are planning to introduce carbon pricing, or considering introducing this system, will exchange their views, on a voluntary basis, on the political approaches to introducing carbon pricing and on its advantages and disadvantages in terms of reducing CO2 emissions, security of supply, price trends and ensuring a fair situation for their industries. INTERNAL ELECTRICITY MARKET Market integration: The Penta countries will further improve their supervision of FBMC in order to increase cross-border trade and social well-being and also optimise the advantages for consumers. They will make this supervision more innovative so that it provides common key indicators for assessing the transition towards a fully decarbonised pentalateral electricity market by 2050. The Penta countries will work together to rapidly implement the Clean Energy Package and to tackle any cross-border impacts for the energy market (e.g. by continuing to develop redispatching in the Penta region and by improving cooperation in this respect). Flexibility: The Penta countries will study the impact of implementing flexibility options such as demand-side management, PtX (Power-to-X) and hydrogen, storage and electromobility, and will analyse the specific electricity-related obstacles to sectoral coupling. As regards the potential future role of increasingly renewable hydrogen as an energy carrier in their energy systems, the Penta countries will examine possible joint approaches to guarantees of origin, cross-border infrastructure, the respective role of TSOs and DSOs, and hydrogen mixing standards. They will also exchange information and best practices on hydrogen support schemes and innovation projects, as well as on the future role of hydrogen in general. 39 SECURITY OF SUPPLY The Penta countries will constantly improve the pentalateral generation adequacy assessment by using more reliable meteorological data and the latest NECP figures and targets of the Penta countries when determining future energy mixes and carrying out other sensitivity analyses. The third assessment is currently being conducted by the Penta TSOs for the 2021 and 2025 horizons, taking into account regional scenarios (based on national scenarios), improved flow-based calculations, and demand flexibility sensitivities. As part of the Clean Energy Package (CEP), and particularly in the context of regional cooperation and the Regulation on risk-preparedness, discussions have begun with ENTSO-E, the Commission and other stakeholders. The aim is to define the rules for cooperation between Member States in order to identify potential regional crisis scenarios and prevent, prepare for and manage crises in the electricity sector, in a spirit of solidarity and transparency, while taking full account of the requirements of a competitive internal electricity market. The Penta countries will work in partnership to develop specific regional measures for crisis situations. TOOLS FOR FUNDING THE ENERGY TRANSITION The PLEF will start to exchange information on possible regional approaches aimed at improving energy efficiency and the roll-out of renewable energy, for example by identifying, with financial institutions such as the EIB, common approaches designed to reduce risks in both sectors and therefore facilitate achievement   3. North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC) At the Ministerial meeting on 20 June 2019, the ministers decided to include the following common paragraph in this chapter on NSEC: Belgium is part of the wider North Seas region, which has a large renewable energy potential. The European Commission has estimated that offshore wind from the North Seas can cover up to 12% of the electric power consumption in the EU by 2030. Offshore wind generation and grid infrastructure projects may have cross-border effects on energy prices, security of supply and the environment, including availability of marine space as well as the pace of innovation. The North Seas countries therefore have great benefits to gain from cooperation.  The North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC) is a voluntary, bottom-up, market-oriented, regional cooperation initiative established in 2016, which seeks to create synergies, avoid incompatibilities between national policies and foster joint strategies where possible and beneficial.  The aim is to coordinate and facilitate further cost-effective deployment of offshore renewable energy, in particular wind, ensuring a sustainable, secure and affordable energy supply in the North Seas countries through increased and better coordinated offshore wind deployment as well as potential joint projects or cluster projects. The NSEC focuses on a step-by-step approach with the perspective of further integration and increased efficiency of wholesale electricity markets in the longer term, while contributing to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing security supply in the region.   The North Seas Energy Cooperation consists of 10 countries with participation from the European Commission: Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark.  As regards to preparing this plan, Belgium made use of the NSEC, in which experts in the support groups shared information and experiences on specific aspects, for example on barriers and best practices of national offshore wind development and in particular on aggregation of national renewable energy trajectories for offshore wind until 2030 and market integration.  40 Belgium furthermore consulted on its National Energy and Climate Plan in the area of planned offshore wind deployment until 2030 and related grid planning aspects with the other North Seas countries.  The support groups under the cooperation focus on the following subjects:   Support group 1: Maritime Spatial Planning   Support group 2: Development and regulation of offshore grids and other offshore infrastructure   Support group 3: Support framework and finance for offshore wind projects   Support group 4: Standards and technical rules in the offshore wind sector   Maritime spatial planning  Within the North Seas Energy Cooperation, Belgium contributes to the work on establishing a common environmental impact assessment methodology. In order to reach our energy and climate targets within the EU, there is a need to better understand the possible ecological limits of large-scale wind development in the North Seas. Further work is needed on maritime spatial planning and environmental assessment to be able to utilise the potential of the North Seas. To increase knowledge and support the deployment of offshore wind in the North Seas, the North Seas countries will continue to cooperate closely on environmental research, cumulative impact assessment of wind farms between responsible authorities for energy, maritime spatial planning and environment.  Offshore grids and other offshore infrastructure The NSEC serves as a platform to jointly work on concepts for potential joint wind offshore projects and for coordinated electricity infrastructure including transmission infrastructure.   Belgium works together with the other North Seas Energy Cooperation countries on the possibilities for concrete cooperation projects. Besides joint offshore wind projects that would be connected to and supported by several Member States, this includes the work on possible hybrid solutions that would use cross-border solutions for connecting offshore wind farms to the grid and seek synergies with interconnection capacity between countries, and on the corresponding market arrangements.  Belgium is therefore contributing to the development of possibilities for cooperation on hybrid projects and identifying and addressing possible legal, regulatory and commercial barriers.  By coordinating on increased interconnection among the countries in the NSEC, an increasing amount of excess production of energy could flow across borders to meet demand in a well-functioning internal energy market.   The NSEC has identified a list of potential areas and projects in the region, where joint projects could be particularly beneficial. These include: (1) IJmuiden Ver offshore wind farm to UK, (2) CGS IJmuiden Ver  Norfolk, (3) COBRA Cable, (4) DE offshore wind farm connected to NL and (5) North Seas Wind Power Hub.  The NSEC is working on developing concrete concepts for the implementation of selected projects from the above list.   The NSEC will continue to work on the action plans for the specific hybrid projects which can also be taken further at a national and regional level. Furthermore, the cooperation will continue to work as a forum to reflect on how to deal with the uncertainties about the regulatory treatment of hybrid projects at EU and national level and as a forum to discuss options for addressing these issues. 41  Support framework and finance of offshore wind projects As regards to measures, Belgium benefits from the NSEC in several ways. The work in the NSEC provides a platform for exchange of best practice regarding the design of support schemes and to develop and work on new concepts tackling new challenges concerning support for offshore wind as well as to develop possible options for future joint offshore wind projects.   Belgium works in the NSEC to coordinate the timing of calls for tender, to exchange best practices on the design for offshore wind support schemes and to identify, where possible, common principles as well as possible options for alignment of support.   As regards the coordination of calls for tender, Belgium regularly shares information regarding its national tender schedule with the other NSEC countries. The NSEC member countries regularly meet and share information on their respective national tender schedules with the aim of identifying possible overlaps in time and enabling the most continuous tender pipeline across the North Seas region to ensure that tender processes maximise competition and deliver most value for money to consumers. Belgium is ready to take into account, amongst other criteria and where possible, this overview of tender schedules in its future tender planning to avoid unnecessary bottlenecks and to provide a steady capacity pipeline to involved stakeholders without stop and go cycles.   Belgium shares and discusses in the NSEC the estimated national offshore renewable trajectory, information on its national offshore deployment plans and best practices in the design of offshore wind tenders.   At the Ministerial meeting in Esbjerg on the 20th of June 2019, North Seas countries agreed to work together to achieve an indicative aggregated installed offshore wind capacity of Member States of the NSEC of at least 70 GW by 2030 based on national planning. The indicative contribution of Belgium to this aggregate capacity in 2030 is 4 GW (see also point 2.1.2).  In order to reflect the dynamics of offshore wind deployment in the region, this aggregate planned capacity of at least 60 GW for 2030 can be translated into an overall trajectory with indicative milestones for the region of approximately 23 GW in 2020 and 48 GW in 2025.   In the NSEC, Belgium also contributes to the work of analysing and developing options for further mobilisation of investment capital for joint projects, for instance through EU funds such as European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) as well as institutional investors. Such future joint projects could be cross-border projects for renewable energy in accordance with the CEF proposal.  Harmonisation of standards and technical rules The North Seas Energy Cooperation is working on aligning standards and technical rules that could contribute to further reducing costs of offshore wind deployment. The focus is on aligning rules and technical standards within five identified areas. These include: (1) Aviation, marking and lights, (2) Health and safety, (3) Certification of regulatory requirements, (4) Park layout and site investigation and (5) Approaches to research. The NSEC works to develop proposals and recommendations for implementation in close cooperation with industry. The aim of those recommendations is to achieve cost reductions whilst at the same time being achievable. The cooperation will continue to work on aligning rules and technical standards as well as exchange of best practices to reduce unnecessary regulation and costs for the industry.
